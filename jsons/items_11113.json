In this class our aim is to read a range of difficult texts from both antiquity and modernity slowly and carefully, examining closely a series of important philosophical conjunctions. By examining these scenes of reception, both the ancient text and the modern shed light upon one another \u2013why do certain ancient texts come to illustrate and illuminate modern philosophy, and how do modern concerns come to re-animate the ancient texts? The conjunctions will include Sophocles\u2019 Antigone and Hegel; Presocratic philosophy and Nietzsche; Sophocles\u2019 Oedipus Tyrannos and Freud; Plato\u2019s Phaedrus and Derrida; Plato\u2019s Republic and Irigaray; Antigone and Judith Butler. This class recommended for students with some experience with theory and continental philosophy who wish to deepen their understanding of these difficult thinkers. Topics: Lyric Subjectivity and Transculturation Duffy This course will explore the development of lyric poetry from the troubadours to the European metaphysicals, exploring imitation, competition, and anxiety as driving forces of lyric production within a transcultural framework. Primary Texts will include works by Arnaut Daniel, Dante, Petrarch, Pietro Aretino, Garcilaso de la Vega, Lu\u00eds Vas de Cam\u00f5es, Joachim du Bellay, Pierre de Ronsard, Jan Van der Noot, Sir Philip Sidney, Edmund Spenser, John Donne, Jean de Sponde, Francisco de Quevedo, Fernando Herrera, Giambattista Marino, George Herbert, and Richard Crashaw. Critical works will include those by Thomas Greene, Leonard Forster, Teodolinda Barolini, Roland Greene, Terence Cave, Maria Rosa Menocal, Ignacio Navarette, Mario Praz, Gilles Deleuze, Heather DuBrow, and others.  Topics in 18th Century Literature: Enlightenment Evil Gadberry This semester, we will investigate a series of attempts to justify the existence of evil in the world \u2013 and in us. As we read poems, novels, letters, and works of philosophy of the long eighteenth century, we will study the complaints hurled at an incomprehensibly unjust universe in a moment known for its confidence in the powers of the understanding. Our inquiry will take us from texts that try to justify a system that makes us rotten from the very beginning, to works that suggest we live in the best of possible worlds, to scathing satires of these defenses, and \u2013 most scandalously of all \u2013 to outright celebrations of wickedness. We will look at the impersonal evil of natural calamities (in the writings that emerged around the devastating Lisbon earthquake of 1755) to the carefully wrought cruelties of sadism (in the Marquis deSade\u2019s Justine, for instance). As we do so, we\u2019ll think about how Enlightenment reason grapples with problems that seem to resist reason, how Enlightenment optimism stands up to critique, and how some instrumentalize (and even eroticize!) reason in pursuit of amoral pleasures. Required works will include the following primary works, many of which will be available in a coursepack: Kant, \u201cOn the Miscarriage of All Philosophical Trials in Theodicy\u201d; Kleist, \u201cThe Earthquake in Chile\u201d; Laclos, Dangerous Liaisons; Leibniz, Theodicy (selections); John Milton, Paradise Lost (selections); Pope, \u201cAn Essay on Man\u201d; Rousseau, letter to Voltaire defending Pope and Leibniz and selections from the Confessions and Social Contract; Sade, Justine; Voltaire, Candide and \u201cPoem on the Lisbon Disaster.\u201d The coursepack will also include secondary readings by Bakunin, Foucault, Lacan, and others.    Topics in 20th Century Literature: Cosmopolitanism and Urban Spaces Halim The notion of cosmopolitanism has been associated, traditionally, with the city, the cosmopolite being conceived of as a privileged urbanite. Although much has changed in the way we have come to think of cosmopolitanism in recent years, we still need to ask: to what extent is everyone potentially a cosmopolite nowadays? Are there good and bad candidates for that status, and if so, what are the criteria, and who gets to decide? Are all the world\u2019s cities global cities? And what of \u201cvillage\u201d in \u201cglobal village\u201d? If we bear in mind that a substantial portion of the world\u2019s population still lives in relatively deprived semi-rural areas, how would that alter our understanding of this new cosmopolitanism, or propose other forms? In what way does the city-bred cosmopolite\u2019s thirst for pastoral images and idyllic vistas impact peasants and the countryside? What, if any, are the tactics to which rural migrants in big urban centers resort to rework old patterns of belonging and forge new attachments? In this course, we will attend to these and other questions of cosmopolitanism and globalization in rural and urban spaces through theory, literary texts and films from the Middle East, Europe and the USA.    Topics in 20th Century Literature: Violence and Technology Kaffen Frequently characterized as an aberration within modernity, pervasive violence in its various forms (war, terror, crime, culture) has proven disastrously resistant to the ideals of the enlightenment, throwing them into question if not crisis. More, its relationship to technology in particular remains among the most fraught legacies of modernity. Indeed, the intersections of technology and violence have engendered the most profound critical debates and contentious cultural and artistic works of the twentieth century. In the interest of grappling with the ever increasing complexity of this relationship, we will read a broad array of critical writings on violence and technology, as they intersect with questions of politics, security, and sovereignty. At the same time, we will pay attention to the cultural and artistic expressions that critically engage with these issues from literature, music, architecture, painting, photography, cinema, video games, and assorted new media. Readings will include Eyal Weizman, George Bataille, Paul Virilio, Sasaki Ataru, TJ Clark, Walter Benjamin, Adriana Caverero, Hannah Arendt, Carl von Clausewitz, Ariella Azoulay, Jean Genet, Michel Foucault, Carl Schmitt, George Didi- Huberman, W.G. Sebald, Ernst Junger.  Topics: Fascism/Violence/Memory: The Case of the Spanish Civil War Matos-Martin The Spanish Civil War (1936-1939) is the defining event in Spanish modern history as well as widely acknowledged as a precursor to World War II. As the earliest example of battleground against fascism, those three years fascinated and attracted individuals from across the world, including George Orwell and Ernest Hemingway, and have continued to be the object of numerous books and other cultural products. Not so well known and studied, however, is the long-lasted and violent fascist regime established once the democratic Spanish Republic was eventually defeated. The purpose of the course is to examine the war and the fascist dictatorship that followed and perpetuated the logic of war, with a special focus on fictional and cultural representations. Literary texts, films, and documentaries will be analyzed in comparison with other artistic and cultural forms of expression (photography, painting), and accompanied by readings in history and theory. Topics to be discussed include political and ideological dynamics of war and fascism (comparing the Spanish case with other fascist regimes such as the Nazis through such theoretical lenses as biopolitics, for example), representations of violence, memory and history, and justice.  Topics in 19th Century History: Century Literary History: Arthur Rimbaud Ross A seminar devoted to the poetry, cultural, and political context of Arthur Rimbaud.   Students must have some reading knowledge of French (there will surely be differing   levels of familiarity with French in the group) and a good French dictionary. Discussion conducted in English.  Senior Seminar in Comparative Literature: Honors Thesis Vatulescu This seminar, limited to senior Comparative Literature majors engaged in writing a senior honors thesis, is designed to be a writing workshop. Students will articulate and research a thesis topic, identify an appropriate critical approach and methodology, and write at least one chapter of their thesis. Periodical writing installments give the students the opportunity to receive feed-back from their peers and instructor as well as to learn to critique others' work-in-progress. Permission of the DUGS is required to enroll in the course. Students must also have a 3.65 or better GPA, both overall and in the major.

We find ourselves stretched between the past and the future, flung into a world we did not create and yearning for something better. We have expectations of the world and even fantasies of other ones. Our thought often transcends this world, leaving reality behind. The stories we tell of other, better worlds can often be critiques of our own, whereas sometimes we develop and implement projects for the transformation of this world and even of ourselves. Our goal is to demonstrate the ongoing conversation and practice of utopia in Western (i.e, ancient Greek and Roman, Western Mediterranean Christian, European, and Euro-American) cultural history. In examining some parts of this complex and at times contradictory tradition we will develop a set of questions which can be asked of utopian literature. We also examine our own relationship to this literary, ethical, and political tradition.  FALL 2013 MAP-UA 400 Texts &amp; Ideas: Topics\u2014Objectivity Prof. Gitelman (English) and Prof. Robles (Media, Culture &amp; Communication)   syllabus  Bias. Spin. Propaganda. Hype. These are familiar pejoratives for citizens of the twenty-first century, and by implication they privilege the same alternative: objectivity. Objectivity is a concept\u2014or an ideal\u2014that frames our understanding of pursuits as diverse as politics, journalism, and science, realms in which we hope to be able to discern the right, the true, and the real. But what is objectivity? Whose discernment counts as objective? How can we tell? Questions like these ask us to consider not only what we know but also how, while the conditions of evolving, possessing, and assessing knowledge turn out to be remarkably available to cultural and historical change. We consider the origins and character of objectivity within and against the Western intellectual tradition by considering selected episodes in its emergence, both ancient and modern, asking how thinkers have thought about knowing. What are or have been the available routes to certainty? What standards exist or have existed for knowledge about the past, about the self or about others, and about the world around us? Is it possible that the twenty-first century will involve new forms of objectivity? Readings: Matthew, Thucydides, Plato\u2019s Protagoras and Meno, Descartes\u2019 Discourse on Method, selections from Montaigne, Bird\u2019s Sheppard Lee, Agee and Evan\u2019s Let Us Now Praise Famous Men.  FALL 2013 MAP-UA 400 Texts &amp; Ideas: Topics\u2014On Beasts and Books Prof. Kay (French)   syllabus According to the Book of Genesis, human beings have two distinct relationships with other animals: in one version of the creation story Adam gives them names, in the other they are created to keep him company. Whether non-human animals are creatures to which we assign meanings, or whether they are our interlocutors, is thus a dilemma formulated from the outset. It will provide the overall framework for this course in we examine how animals are interpreted metaphorically or symbolically, as if they were texts, and how they are also represented as speaking to us, as if they were producers of texts. We work mainly on written documents ranging from the Bible and antiquity through the Middle Ages and the premodern period (mainly the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries), reaching forward occasionally into the contemporary world for current examples. Some materials are literary (like fables and fairy stories), some philosophical, others historical. We also consider visual materials from manuscript illuminations to recent films. And we evaluate the role of animals in cultural practices other than literary or artistic works\u2014for instance, in hunting or in zoos\u2014and discover how, in this sense, they are like texts that we can read and analyze. FALL 2013 MAP-UA 400 Texts &amp; Ideas: Topics\u2014Animal Humans Prof. Lezra (Comparative Literature)  syllabus  \"One might go so far as to define man as a creature that has failed in its effort to keep its animalness\u2026\" So writes the German philosopher Peter Sloterdijk. What sort of animal were we? Where, how, and by whom has the line between the human and the animal been drawn? With what consequences for our \"human\" understanding of the world? Of concepts like the \"soul,\" \"society,\" politics, the family? Is the line between the human and the animal drawn differently in different genres--in literary works, theological treatises, natural histories, paintings, films? We come at these questions from different angles, following them from antiquity to early modern responses to these questions, and in essays by contemporary philosophers and advocates. Readings: Genesis, Numbers, Euripides' Bacchae, Plato's Phaedrus, Ovid's Metamorphoses, Apuleius' Golden Ass, Marie de France' Bisclavret, Shakespeare's Midsummer Night's Dream, Montaigne's \"Apology in Defense of Raymond Sebond, Machiavelli's Prince, H. G. Wells's Island of Dr. Moreau and Island of Lost Souls, Derrida's \"The Animal that therefore I am,\" selections from Boccaccio, Peter Singer, Giorgio Agamben, Donna Haraway. FALL 2013 MAP-UA 402 Texts &amp; Ideas: Antiquity and the Renaissance Prof. Gerety (Collegiate Professor)   syllabus  What   is the soul? Is it the conscious self or something more? Does our   identity persist beyond death? What is the relation between the soul and   good and evil? Some say that Socrates 'discovered' the human soul, but   the idea that we have souls that outlast our bodies is as old as   humanity. Our understanding of the nature of our souls often dictates   the way we feel we should live. We will explore ideas from Homer and   Heraclitus through Socrates himself and then on to Sophocles, Plato,   Aristotle, the Hebrew Bible, the New Testament (including the Gnostics),   Augustine, and Vergil. We look for the elements that make up personal   identity and value in the ancient world, both religious and secular, and   see how much these change from Homer's world to that of Augustine and   the Roman Empire. We then turn to Dante, who provides a bridge to some   of the great thinkers and artists of the Renaissance--most notably   Shakespeare and DaVinci but also Montaigne and Villon. In all of these,   the permanence and even presence of our souls seem more uncertain, more   threatened by death and obliteration, than in Plato or Paul, and this   threat reaches our morality and values as well. In this way, the   Renaissance marks the beginning of the world in which all of us must now   find our way. FALL 2013 MAP-UA 402 Texts &amp; Ideas: Antiquity and the Renaissance Prof. Gilman (English)  syllabus The \"Renaissance\" understands itself as an age bearing witness to the \"rebirth\" of classical antiquity. In art, philosophy, and literature it also assumes the task of reconciling the cultural inheritance of Greece and Rome with the Christian tradition (itself entering into a moment of crisis as allegiances split between the Catholic church and the \"reformed\" church of Luther and Calvin). Our first task is to look at antiquity; our second, to explore the ways in which European culture between 1400 and 1700 invents the modern by making itself conversant with the past. Readings: Homer's Odyssey; Sophocles' Antigone; Plato's Phaedo and Symposium; Vergil's Aeneid; Genesis, Exodus, Job, Luke, Acts, John; Augustine's Confessions; Castiglione's Book of the Courtier; Machiavelli's Prince; Erasmus's Praise of Folly; Montaigne's Essays; More's Utopia; Shakespeare's Tempest. FALL 2013 MAP-UA 404 Texts &amp; Ideas: Antiquity and the 19th Century Prof. Baker (English)  syllabus Examines Western conceptions of the relation between humans and the natural world. Considers how 19th-century thinkers embraced, revised, and overturned ancient ideas about creation, natural order, the distinction between humans and animals, and the risks and rewards of probing nature's mysteries. Readings: Homer's Odyssey, Hebrew and Christian scripture, Aeschylus' Prometheus Bound, Shelley's Frankenstein, Darwin's Origin of Species, and works by Plato, Aristotle, Augustine, Emerson, Goethe, and Nietzsche. FALL 2013 MAP-UA 404 Texts &amp; Ideas: Antiquity and the 19th Century Prof. Corradi (Sociology)  syllabus A guide to the intellectual heritage distinctive to the West, with special attention to the nature of the person, freedom, rationality, democracy, and the social order. The works we study continue to shape the way people understand themselves and the world. They are 'classic' in the sense that they have not finished saying what they have to say. We situate them in historical context, looking for ways in which later authors responded to themes introduced by earlier ones. From the particularity of the West, these themes show a vocation for universality. Readings include: Genesis, Exodus, Luke, Corinthians; Sophocles' Oedipus and Antigone; Plato's Apology and Republic; Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics; Pericles' Funeral Oration; Epictetus' Discourses; Augustine's Confessions; Tocqueville's Democracy in America; Mill's On Liberty; Darwin's Origins of the Species; Marx and Engels' Communist Manifesto; Kierkegaard's Fear and Trembling; Nietzsche's Genealogy of Morality; Weber's Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism; Lincoln's Gettysburg Address; Freud's Civilization and Its Discontents. FALL 2013 MAP-UA 404 Texts &amp; Ideas: Antiquity and the 19th Century Prof. Renzi (MAP)   syllabus  Contemporary moral psychology: where it came from, where it\u2019s brought us, how we might move beyond it. Readings: Book of J; Genesis, Exodus, Isaiah; Matthew, Galatians; Gospel of Mary; Euripides' Medea; Aristophanes' Clouds; Plato's Apology and Republic; Xenophon's Apology; Augustine's Confessions; Marx and Engels\u2019 Communist Manifesto; Kierkegaard's Fear and Trembling; Nietzsche's Genealogy of Morality; Freud's \"Case of Miss Lucy R.\" and Civilization and Its Discontents. FALL 2013 MAP-UA 404 Texts &amp; Ideas: Antiquity and the 19th Century Prof. Ulfers (German)   syllabus  A conversation between two paradigms informing Western culture: the dominant, optimistic one, revolving around notions of historical progress toward absolute knowledge and utopian visions of the world and society; and the subterranean, pessimistic one, which looks on the former as a human construct or fiction that must come to naught. Readings: works from the Hebrew and Christian scriptures, Plato, and Sophocles; Augustine's Confessions; selections from Darwin; Marx and Engels' Communist Manifesto; Nietzsche's Birth of Tragedy; Freud's Interpretation of Dreams; Kafka's Metamorphosis; Mann's Death in Venice.  FALL 2013 MAP-UA 410, Texts and Ideas: Topics\u2014Exile and Belonging\u2014Writing Intensive Prof. Waters (Irish Studies)  syllabus A writing-intensive version of Texts and Ideas offered in conjunction with selected sections of EXPOS-UA 1, Writing the Essay. Recommended for students regardless of intended major who seek a deeper engagement with the texts and more attention to writing about them than the regular versions of these courses can provide. While readings and assignments are shared between the lecture and the writing workshops, there are no recitations for this lecture; students must therefore be prepared to do substantial independent work without the support of a recitation section. Open to new CAS first-year students only.   The very possibility of our identity rests on the possibility of our estrangement. This theme haunts Western literature, philosophy, and politics from antiquity to the present. We examine the dynamic of exile and belonging, of place and displacement, by reading closely a series of classical texts that established a framework for thinking about culture, the state, and the individual. Readings: Genesis, Exodus, Isaiah; Sophocles' Oedipus, Antigone, Oedipus at Colonus; Defoe's Robinson Crusoe; Shelley's Frankenstein; Douglass' Narrative of the Life of an American Slave; Marx and Engels' Communist Manifesto; Nietzsche's Gay Science; Freud's Civilization and Its Discontents, and Disturbance of Memory at the Acropolis; selection from Ovid, Byron, Keats. NOTE: Students must also register for one of the linked section of EXPOS-UA 1, Writing the Essay: 016, 017, 018, 020, 021, 023, 025. Spring 2014 SPRING 2014 CORE-UA 400 Texts &amp; Ideas: Topics\u2014Political Economy Prof. Gross (History)   syllabus  What is the \u201cmarket\u201d, the \u201ceconomy\u201d, or \u201ccapitalism\u201d? How do individuals interact with each other in the marketplace? What is the morality of commerce? And how does, or should, the state govern the economy? These are all questions that have no simple answers and as a consequence they stimulate controversy today, in America and throughout the world. Yet these questions have a long pedigree. Since antiquity intellectuals have grappled with the fundamental issues of what in the past they called moral philosophy, what today we call political economy: how the individual, the market, and the state should interact with each other. Readings: Aristotle, Aquinas, Locke, Smith, Ricardo, Rousseau, Zola, Marx, Mill, Bagehot, Weber, Orwell, Keynes, Polanyi, Friedman, Hayek, Galbraith, Kindleberger, Harvey, Sachs. SPRING 2014 CORE-UA 400 Texts &amp; Ideas: Topics\u2014Paranoid Narratives Prof. Sanders (Comparative Literature)   syllabus  It\u2019s no secret that we live in an age of paranoia. What began life in the nineteenth century as a psychiatric diagnosis may now be the predominant form taken by our experience of politics and technology. We explore the evolution of ideas about paranoia through a careful reading of key texts, with special focus on narrative: Could there be something about the structure of narrative\u2014its \u201cvoices\u201d and its \u201cspeakers,\u201d its drive for explanation of origins\u2014that is paranoid, or gives rise to paranoia? Tracing psychoanalytic theories of paranoia (Sigmund Freud, Melanie Klein), and attending no less to their narrative structure, we address this question and others by reading key autobiographical and fictional works from Europe and Africa, such as Schreber\u2019s Memoirs of My Nervous Illness, Orwell\u2019s Nineteen Eighty-Four, Head\u2019s A Question of Power, Marks\u2019 Not Either an Experimental Doll, Coetzee\u2019s Disgrace, as well as political writings and documents by Richard Hofstadter, Michel Foucault, Julian Assange (Wikileaks), South African AIDS denialists, and Rwandan g\u00e9nocidaires.  SPRING 2014 CORE -UA 400 Texts &amp; Ideas: Topics\u2014Guilt and Sin, Law and Justice Prof. Maudlin (Philosophy)  syllabus The   nature of justice, the legitimacy of law, and the justification for   punishment. We begin with Biblical accounts of sin and retribution,   Greek myths on the origin of the legal system, and the trial and   execution of Socrates. Turning to more modern works, we consider   theories of natural rights and the origin of legitimate states through   social contract, ending with three novels that present challenging views   of crime, the legal system, and the human soul. Readings: Genesis,   Exodus; Euripides\u2019 Oresteia; Plato\u2019s Apology, Crito, Phaedo, Republic;   Paine\u2019s Rights of Man; Melville\u2019s Billy Budd; Dostoyevsky\u2019s Crime and   Punishment; Kafka\u2019s Trial. SPRING 2014 CORE -UA 400 Texts &amp; Ideas: Topics\u2014On Liberation Prof. Watson (English)   syllabus  What is liberation? What is the political form that allows for maximum freedom, and how is it to be achieved? How have the concepts of freedom, slavery and oppression been articulated by thinkers from Plato to Gandhi? We examine these enduring questions through a wide historical and cultural lens, aiming to understand and map out competing ideas around the conditions for freedom (and unfreedom). To this end, we read seminal works theorizing the relationship between the individual and the collective, ideas of sovereignty, the ideal state and the revolutionary nation, and arguments for violence and non-violence. While grounded in Western thought on the topic, we also pay attention to how the struggles and theorizations of the non-West (the Haitian Revolution, the Algerian and Indian independence struggles, postcolonialism and the Tricontinental) have shaped our inquiry into the nature and promise of liberation. Reading: Epictetus\u2019 Handbook, Plato\u2019s Republic, Equiano\u2019s Life, Shakespeare\u2019s Tempest, Rousseau\u2019s Discourse on Inequality, Mill\u2019s On Liberty, selections from Marx, James\u2019 Black Jacobins, Cesaire\u2019s Discourse on Colonialism, Gandhi\u2019s Hind Swaraj, Freire\u2019s Pedagogy of the Oppressed. SPRING 2014 CORE -UA 402 Texts &amp; Ideas: Antiquity and the Renaissance Prof. Gilman (English)   syllabus  The \"Renaissance\" understands itself as an age bearing witness to the \"rebirth\" of classical antiquity. In art, philosophy, and literature it also assumes the task of reconciling the cultural inheritance of Greece and Rome with the Christian tradition (itself entering into a moment of crisis as allegiances split between the Catholic church and the \"reformed\" church of Luther and Calvin). Our first task is to look at antiquity; our second, to explore the ways in which European culture between 1400 and 1700 invents the modern by making itself conversant with the past. Readings: Homer's Odyssey; Sophocles' Antigone; Plato's Phaedo and Symposium; Vergil's Aeneid; Genesis, Exodus, Job, Luke, Acts, John; Augustine's Confessions; Castiglione's Book of the Courtier; Machiavelli's Prince; Erasmus's Praise of Folly; Montaigne's Essays; More's Utopia; Shakespeare's Tempest. SPRING 2014 CORE -UA 403 Texts &amp; Ideas: Antiquity and the Enlightenment Prof. Deneys-Tunney (French)   syllabus  The Enlightenment was a Europe-wide movement, which concerned all aspects of culture of the time: philosophy and literature, the arts (painting, music, architecture), as well as politics and society as a whole. The Enlightenment defined itself as a new birth, a subversive movement that would free mankind of all its prejudices--philosophical, religious, political, sexual, racial. In doing so, the Enlightenment appears today to be indeed the beginning of our modernity, as it invented key concepts that define or frame our contemporary representations of ourselves and the world around us: the concept of the subject or subjectivity, of nature, of origins, of equality, of critical philosophy and democracy, of pleasure, of sexuality, of happiness. It is a unique moment in history, where philosophy aims not only at interpreting the world but also at changing it to make it a better place for mankind. It culminates at the end of the 18th century in France with the French Revolution, which declared for the first time in human history that all men are born free and equal. Readings: Genesis, Plato's Symposium and Phedrus, Epicurus' Maxims and letters, Descartes' Discourse on Method, Rousseau's Discourse on Inequality and R\u00eaveries, Diderot's Indiscreet Jewels and Jacques the Fatalist, Voltaire's Candide and Zadig, Marivaux's Dispute and Double Unfaithfulness, Kant's \"What is Enlightenment?\" SPRING 2014 CORE -UA 403 Texts and Ideas: Antiquity and the Enlightenment Prof. Chazan (Hebrew &amp; Judaic Studies)  syllabus Focuses on the understanding of knowledge and truth in antiquity and the Enlightenment. Divergent perspectives on knowledge and truth have important implications for society and the individual. They lead to alternative notions of how society should be ordered, who should exercise power in society, the goals of individual endeavor, and the nature of individual fulfillment. Key texts from antiquity and the Enlightenment will be read and analyzed with these issues uppermost in mind. Readings: Genesis, Exodus, Luke, Acts, Galatians; Sophocles' Antigone; Euripides' Bacchae; Plato's Apology and Symposium; Augustine's Confessions; Spinoza's Tractatus Theologico-Politicus; Locke's Letter Concerning Toleration; Lessing's Nathan the Wise; Montesquieu's Persian Letters; Voltaire's Letters Concerning the English Nation; Paine's Age of Reason.  SPRING 2014 CORE -UA 404 Texts &amp; Ideas: Antiquity and the 19th Century Prof. Ertman (Sociology)  syllabus Explores   the ancient foundations of traditional Western culture by examining the   political and social institutions, religious beliefs, and value systems   of the Israelites, Greeks, Romans, and early Christians; then turns to   the radical challenges to this traditional culture, in the areas of the   economy, politics, religion, and morality, that arose over the course of   the 19th century, challenges that continue to reverberate to this day.   Readings: Genesis, Exodus, Deuteronomy, Luke, Acts, Romans; Thucydides'   Peloponnesian War; Plato's Apology and Symposium; Vergil's Aeneid;   Augustine's Confessions; Smith's Wealth of Nations; Marx and Engels'   Communist Manifesto; Mill's On Liberty; Darwin's Origin of Species;   Nietzsche's Genealogy of Morality; Freud's Civilization and Its   Discontents.  SPRING 2014 CORE -UA 404 Texts &amp; Ideas: Antiquity and the 19th Century Prof. Levene (Classics)   syllabus  Every society places demands on individuals: it could not do otherwise and still remain a society. But what happens when those demands are inconsistent? Can--or should--an individual determine the right course of action by reason alone? Or should one simply obey--but then, whom should one obey? What happens when people's moral judgments differ from the expectations of those around them? How can one maintain a society in the face of such conflicts? From the first moments of Western literature those questions are explored; they became all the more insistent in the unprecedented political, social, intellectual, and economic upheavals of the 19th century. One effect was the increasingly central role given to art itself, seen as the dynamic force able to create a cohesive society. Our study will include Richard Wagner's remarkable music-drama The Ring of the Nibelung, perhaps the most significant and influential art-work of the era (studied primarily as a text, though there will be opportunities to hear the music as well). Other readings will include selections from the Hebrew and Christian Scriptures; Homer's Iliad; Sophocles' Antigone; Plato's Gorgias; Vergil's Aeneid; poetry by (among others) Shelley, Tennyson, and Matthew Arnold; Arnold's Culture and Anarchy; Wagner's Art and Revolution; and Nietzsche's Genealogy of Morality.

SPRING 2014 CORE -UA 404 Texts &amp; Ideas: Antiquity and the 19th Century Prof. Baker (English)  syllabus  Examines   Western conceptions of the relation between humans and the natural   world. Considers how 19th-century thinkers embraced, revised, and   overturned ancient ideas about creation, natural order, the distinction   between humans and animals, and the risks and rewards of probing   nature's mysteries. Readings: Homer's Odyssey, Hebrew and Christian   scripture, Aeschylus' Prometheus Bound, Shelley's Frankenstein, Darwin's   Origin of Species, and works by Plato, Aristotle, Augustine, Emerson,   Goethe, and Nietzsche.  top of page           Contact Us | &copy; New York University , Arts and Science"}, {"content": "Texts & Ideas    | The College Core Curriculum, College of Arts and Science | New York Univeristy                          NEW YORK UNIVERSITY     ARTS AND SCIENCE     COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIENCE     GRADUATE SCHOOL OF ARTS AND SCIENCE             The College Core Curriculum            Back to Home       Texts & Ideas | 2014-2015 Note: * indicates draft/sample syllabus  Fall 2014 FALL 2014 CORE-UA 400, Texts &amp; Ideas: Topics\u2014Utopias and Dystopias Prof. Becker (Classics)   syllabus  We all have difficulty living in the present. We find ourselves stretched between the past and the future, flung into a world we did not create and yearning for something better. We have expectations of the world and even fantasies of other ones. Our thought often transcends this world, leaving reality behind. The stories we tell of other, better worlds can often be critiques of our own, whereas sometimes we develop and implement projects for the transformation of this world and even of ourselves. Our goal is to demonstrate the ongoing conversation and practice of utopia in Western (i.e, ancient Greek and Roman, Western Mediterranean Christian, European, and Euro-American) cultural history. In examining some parts of this complex and at times contradictory tradition we will develop a set of questions which can be asked of utopian literature. We also examine our own relationship to this literary, ethical, and political tradition.  FALL 2014 CORE-UA 400, Texts &amp; Ideas: Topics\u2014Political Economy Prof. Gross (History)  syllabus  What   is the \u201cmarket\u201d, the \u201ceconomy\u201d, or \u201ccapitalism\u201d? How do individuals   interact with each other in the marketplace? What is the morality of   commerce? And how does, or should, the state govern the economy? These   are all questions that have no simple answers and as a consequence they   stimulate controversy today, in America and throughout the world. Yet   these questions have a long pedigree. Since antiquity intellectuals have   grappled with the fundamental issues of what in the past they called   moral philosophy, what today we call political economy: how the   individual, the market, and the state should interact with each other.   Readings: Aristotle, Aquinas, Locke, Smith, Ricardo, Rousseau, Zola,   Marx, Mill, Bagehot, Weber, Orwell, Keynes, Polanyi, Friedman, Hayek,   Galbraith, Kindleberger, Harvey, Sachs. FALL 2014 CORE-UA 400, Texts &amp; Ideas: Topics\u2014Medieval Political Thought Prof. Stoller (NYU Libraries)  syllabus Medieval   political thought spanned three great religious traditions:   Christianity, Islam and Judaism. Across all three traditions it was   grounded in a deeply religious perspective on the human condition, one   originating in a set of sacred texts that shared a common monotheism and   a similar moral ethic. The political thought of all three groups was   equally grounded in a set of ancient, pagan texts, drawing on the   perspective of the Greeks and Romans, on whose shoulders the medievals   believed they stood. Political theorists across all three traditions   drew heavily from one another, but each spoke to the unique concerns of   its own community. We explore the commonalities and the contrasts among   the three political systems and the extraordinary minds that shaped   them. Readings will include Hebrew and Christian scriptures, the Qur'an,   Plato, Aristotle, Augustine, Alfarabi, Alghazali, Aquinas, Avicenna,   Bacon, Giles of Rome, Maimonides, Marsilius of Padua, and Polgar.  FALL 2014 CORE-UA 400, Texts &amp; Ideas: Topics\u2014Action Prof. Halpern (English)  syllabus  What   does it mean to perform an act? What are we doing when we do something?   The term \u201caction\u201d covers everything from picking up a pencil to leading   a political revolution. Action is a way of intervening in the world and   changing it, in minor or major ways. Both ethics and politics involve   acting in relation to others. Philosophers have found action interesting   because it bridges the mental and physical worlds, beginning as   intention and ending with some sort of embodied execution. The English   word \u201cact\u201d complicates things still further, since it can mean not only   \u201cto do something\u201d but also \u201cto pretend to do something; to play a part.\u201d   Acting in the \u201cserious\u201d sense is always haunted by dramatic or   play-acting. And because drama is the art form that relies on people   actually doing things onstage\u2014or rather, pretending to actually do   things onstage\u2014it is also an art form that has thought through questions   of action in sophisticated ways. We read a variety of works by   philosophers, playwrights, theologians, filmmakers, and economists in   order to get a sense of how action has been understood from the   classical era to the present day, including Aeschylus, Aristotle,   Augustine, Marlowe, Shakespeare, Smith, Marx, Nietzsche, Freud, Beckett.  FALL 2014 CORE-UA 400, Texts &amp; Ideas: Topics\u2014Value Prof. Poovey (English) &amp; Prof. Zaloom (Social and Cultural Analysis)  syllabus Can   you put a price on sex? art? love? life? Is time money, or is   daydreaming time well-spent? Would you accept a pound of flesh as   payment of a debt? Is there such a thing as a free lunch, and what would   it taste like? We explore different\u2014and often conflicting\u2014conceptions   of value spanning literature, philosophy, ethnography, and social   theory, seeking to convey three fundamental principles: Value is not   inherent in things but the result of a social process, value is often   determined at the intersection of different conceptions of productive   potential, and value is conceptualized or measured in different, and   often conflicting, ways. Readings include selections from Aristotle,   Christian Scripture, Shakespeare, Smith, Bentham, Wordsworth, Austen,   Weber, Keynes, Milton Friedman, Kazuo Ishiguro, and Pierre Bourdieu. FALL 2014 CORE-UA 400, Texts &amp; Ideas: Topics\u2014This World and the Next Prof. Connolly (Classics)  syllabus  Explores different ways of thinking about the world or worlds beyond (and better than) the one in which we live, concentrating on the afterlife, political utopias, and the worlds created by artistic imagination. Readings include Homer, Vergil, Dante, the Bible, Plato's Republic, Marx and Engels' Communist Manifesto, selection of Romantic poetry, and Philip K. Dick's Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep, and its film adaptation, Blade Runner. FALL 2014 CORE-UA 400, Texts &amp; Ideas: Topics\u2014Arts and Publics Prof. Blake (English)  syllabus Civic values and public purpose are intricately bound up with the arts. Whenever a case needs to be made that the arts matter, we tend to speak (usually, in very general terms) about how the arts contribute to education, or self-expression, or community life, or public deliberation, or the moral and social reform of individuals and institutions. On the other side, those who question the public value of the arts might complain that the arts are elitist, or overweening, or out of touch, or too political, or not political enough. How did we come to think about the arts in these terms? What are some of our assumptions about public life, such that it makes sense for us to promote the arts as having an important public cultural role, or alternatively distrust or dismiss them for not properly or effectively living up to that role? And, ultimately, what is at stake: Why does it matter if the arts matter? Readings from the Classical period through the present day, with a specific focus on drama and theatre. FALL 2014 CORE-UA 400, Texts &amp; Ideas: Topics\u2014Visible and Invisible Cities Prof. Cox (Italian Studies)  syllabus The   experience of living in a city is one vital thread that connects us   with our ancient, medieval, and early modern ancestors, and that   continues to provide a unifying element in millions of our   contemporaries\u2019 disparate lives across the globe. Urban life is a   constant environment and stimulus, whether you find yourself in New   York, Florence, Accra, or Shanghai. Our aim is to supply conceptual   frameworks and historical contexts for this experience by exploring the   ways human communities have been theorized and imagined within the   Western tradition from classical antiquity through to the Renaissance,   particularly the city, conceived since Aristotle as the proper habitat   of humankind, and the relationship between the family or household and   the state. The primary texts encompass utopian writings and works of   political theory, but also texts describing and analyzing real-world   communities and visual and cartographic representations of cities and   urban space. Readings include the canonical\u2014from Plato, Aristotle,   Vergil, Dante, Boccaccio, More, Shakespeare\u2014to texts from Christine de   Pizan and Moderata Fontelong, marginalized from the canon and only now   becoming visible. FALL 2014 CORE-UA 403, Texts &amp; Ideas: Antiquity and the Enlightenment Prof. Rubenstein (Hebrew &amp; Judaic Studies)  syllabus Beginning with the collision of the \"Judeo-Christian\" and Hellenistic traditions and their encounter in the Christian Scriptures and Augustine, we see Enlightenment thinkers grapple with the fusion of these traditions they had inherited, subjecting both to serious criticism and revising them as a new tradition\u2014science and technology\u2014rises to prominence. Reading from the Hebrew and Christian Scriptures, Sophocles, Plato, Augustine, Montesquieu, Pope, Voltaire, and Rousseau. FALL 2014 CORE-UA 404, Texts &amp; Ideas: Antiquity and the 19th Century Prof. Corradi (Sociology)  syllabus A guide to the intellectual heritage distinctive to the West, with special attention to the nature of the person, freedom, rationality, democracy, and the social order. The works we study continue to shape the way people understand themselves and the world. They are 'classic' in the sense that they have not finished saying what they have to say. We situate them in historical context, looking for ways in which later authors responded to themes introduced by earlier ones. From the particularity of the West, these themes show a vocation for universality. Readings include: Genesis, Exodus, Luke, Corinthians; Sophocles' Oedipus and Antigone; Plato's Apology and Republic; Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics; Pericles' Funeral Oration; Epictetus' Discourses; Augustine's Confessions; Tocqueville's Democracy in America; Mill's On Liberty; Darwin's Origins of the Species; Marx and Engels' Communist Manifesto; Kierkegaard's Fear and Trembling; Nietzsche's Genealogy of Morality; Weber's Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism; Lincoln's Gettysburg Address; Freud's Civilization and Its Discontents.

FALL 2014 CORE-UA 404, Texts &amp; Ideas: Antiquity and the 19th Century Prof. Ulfers (German)  syllabus A conversation between two paradigms informing Western culture: the dominant, optimistic one, revolving around notions of historical progress toward absolute knowledge and utopian visions of the world and society; and the subterranean, pessimistic one, which looks on the former as a human construct or fiction that must come to naught. Readings: works from the Hebrew and Christian scriptures, Plato, and Sophocles; Augustine's Confessions; selections from Darwin; Marx and Engels' Communist Manifesto; Nietzsche's Birth of Tragedy; Freud's Interpretation of Dreams; Kafka's Metamorphosis; Mann's Death in Venice. Spring 2015 SPRING 2015 CORE-UA 400, Texts &amp; Ideas: Topics - Materialism Prof. Shaw (English)  syllabus Why is materialism a dirty word? Through what logic has it come to be associated with crass monetary gain and excessive bodily pleasure? When did these associations begin, and why? What other senses of materialism (as a philosophy of the everyday, and as a critical corrective to idealism) lurk underneath these pejorative, immediate associations? How might they be activated? We examine conflicts between Christian idealism and a range of materialist philosophies, including Epicureanism, experimentalism and Marxism. Materialists became infamous for directing their attention at bodies rather than souls, at terrestrial matter rather than divine will, and at the letter rather than the spirit of scripture. We follow their lead and pay close attention to a range of texts and objects, but in doing so we also consider just how various materialisms could be, how their realist correctives operated at different scales and in different contexts: from the atomic to the economic, from the corporeal to the textual. Readings: Lucretius, Vergil\u2019s Georgics, 1 Corinthians, Machiavelli\u2019s Prince, More\u2019s Utopia, selections from Montaigne, Shakespeare, Bacon, Diderot, Wordsworth, Poe, Balzac, Marx, Nietzsche and Whitman.  SPRING 2015 CORE-UA 400, Texts &amp; Ideas: Topics\u2014On Objectivity Prof. Gitelman (English)  syllabus Bias. Spin. Propaganda. Hype. These are familiar pejoratives for citizens of the twenty-first century, and by implication they privilege the same alternative: objectivity. Objectivity is a concept\u2014or an ideal\u2014that frames our understanding of pursuits as diverse as politics, journalism, and science, realms in which we hope to be able to discern the right, the true, and the real. But what is objectivity? Whose discernment counts as objective? How can we tell? Questions like these ask us to consider not only what we know but also how, while the conditions of evolving, possessing, and assessing knowledge turn out to be remarkably available to cultural and historical change. We consider the origins and character of objectivity within and against the Western intellectual tradition by considering selected episodes in its emergence, both ancient and modern, asking how thinkers have thought about knowing. What are or have been the available routes to certainty? What standards exist or have existed for knowledge about the past, about the self or about others, and about the world around us? Is it possible that the twenty-first century will involve new forms of objectivity? Readings: Matthew, Thucydides, Plato\u2019s Protagoras and Meno, Descartes\u2019 Discourse on Method, selections from Montaigne, Bird\u2019s Sheppard Lee, Agee and Evan\u2019s Let Us Now Praise Famous Men.

SPRING 2015 CORE-UA 400, Texts &amp; Ideas: Topics\u2014Life and Death Prof. Velleman (Philosophy)  syllabus  Every   person has a life to live, but what is this thing, \u201ca life\u201d, that every   person has? To begin with, it\u2019s just the temporally extended existence   of the person, the proverbial three score and ten. But a person\u2019s life   is more than that, because it follows a natural progression of   life-stages, from childhood to adolescence to middle age to senescence.   And it\u2019s even more still, since it is partly the creation of the person   living it, who can plan it, evaluate it, anticipate its future, and   remember its past. We explore these and other aspects of a person\u2019s life   through works of literature and philosophy. What makes you the same   person throughout the different stages of your life? How does the   passage of time color your perception of life? What makes for a good   life? A meaningful life? Should you be grateful for having been born, or   dismayed at having to die? Readings: Aristotle\u2019s Nicomachean Ethics,   Epicurus\u2019 \u201cLetter to Menoeceus,\u201d Cicero\u2019s De Finibus, Lucretius De Rerum   Natura, Dickens\u2019 Great Expectations, Tolstoy\u2019s \u201cA Confession\u201d and   \u201cDeath of Ivan Ilych,\u201d Kertesz\u2019 Kaddish for an Unborn Child, Kafka\u2019s   Metamorphosis, McCullers\u2019 Member of the Wedding, Vonnegut\u2019s   Slaughterhouse-Five. SPRING 2015 CORE-UA 400, Texts and Ideas: Topics\u2014Technologies of the Universe Prof. Weatherby (German)  syllabus The human is the \"tool-making animal,\" as Karl Marx wrote, quoting Benjamin Franklin. Marx's writing partner Friedrich Engels would make this the center of his philosophy, declaring the invention of tools and the work they do as the evolutionary force that led to the separation between the ape and the human. But if human activity is \"technological\" by nature, it is in nature itself that tools arise; then how does human time fit into geological time, how does the cosmos come to include the \"tool-making animal,\" and who remakes that cosmos? In an age sometimes now called the \"anthropocene,\" the questions of the cosmos and the tool are increasingly intertwined. Beginning with cosmogonies in the ancient world (Gilgamesh, Hebrew Bible, Hesiod, Plato), we track the shifts that led to the modern scientific conception of the universe (Aristotle, Copernicus, Helmholtz, Einstein). We then explore problems that the ubiquity of technological objects raises\u2014artificial life (Leibniz, Hoffmann, Lem), entropy (Kelvin, Wiener), computing (Babbage, Turing, von Neumann)\u2014compare Carl Sagan's Cosmos with its ongoing update by Neil deGrasse Tyson, and visit the Hayden Planetarium. SPRING 2015 CORE-UA 402, Texts &amp; Ideas: Antiquity and the Renaissanc e Prof. Sider (Classics)  syllabus The West began with Greece, moved to Rome, and the incorporated Judeo-Christian values during the Middle Ages. The Renaissance, looking back to the Greeks for re-inspiration, gave near final shape to our ideas of Western culture. Since this series of movements and influences is not chronological, neither shall we read our text in chronological order. Instead, we will take our rubric seriously and look for a few \"conversations\" between and among writers from all our areas: Hesiod and Genesis; Homer and Vergil; Aristophanes and Rabelais; Song of Songs, Sappho, and Marguerite de Navarre; Thucydides and Machiavelli; Catullus and Petrarch; Ovid and Shakespeare; Euripides, Plato, and a Gospel SPRING 2015 CORE-UA 403, Texts &amp; Ideas: Antiquity and the Enlightenment Prof. Deneys (French)  syllabus The Enlightenment was a Europe-wide movement, which concerned all aspects of culture of the time: philosophy and literature, the arts (painting, music, architecture), as well as politics and society as a whole. The Enlightenment defined itself as a new birth, a subversive movement that would free mankind of all its prejudices--philosophical, religious, political, sexual, racial. In doing so, the Enlightenment appears today to be indeed the beginning of our modernity, as it invented key concepts that define or frame our contemporary representations of ourselves and the world around us: the concept of the subject or subjectivity, of nature, of origins, of equality, of critical philosophy and democracy, of pleasure, of sexuality, of happiness. It is a unique moment in history, where philosophy aims not only at interpreting the world but also at changing it to make it a better place for mankind. It culminates at the end of the 18th century in France with the French Revolution, which declared for the first time in human history that all men are born free and equal. Readings: Genesis, Plato's Symposium and Phedrus, Epicurus' Maxims and letters, Descartes' Discourse on Method, Rousseau's Discourse on Inequality and R\u00eaveries, Diderot's Indiscreet Jewels and Jacques the Fatalist, Voltaire's Candide and Zadig, Marivaux's Dispute and Double Unfaithfulness, Kant's \"What is Enlightenment?\" SPRING 2015 CORE-UA 403, Texts &amp; Ideas: Antiquity and the Enlightenment Prof. Chazan (Hebrew &amp; Judaic Studies)  syllabus Focuses on the understanding of knowledge and truth in antiquity and the Enlightenment. Divergent perspectives on knowledge and truth have important implications for society and the individual. They lead to alternative notions of how society should be ordered, who should exercise power in society, the goals of individual endeavor, and the nature of individual fulfillment. Key texts from antiquity and the Enlightenment will be read and analyzed with these issues uppermost in mind. Readings: Genesis, Exodus, Luke, Acts, Galatians; Sophocles' Antigone; Euripides' Bacchae; Plato's Apology and Symposium; Augustine's Confessions; Spinoza's Tractatus Theologico-Politicus; Locke's Letter Concerning Toleration; Lessing's Nathan the Wise; Montesquieu's Persian Letters; Voltaire's Letters Concerning the English Nation; Paine's Age of Reason. SPRING 2015 CORE-UA 404, Texts &amp; Ideas: Antiquity and the 19th Century Prof. Renzi (College Core Curriculum)  syllabus Contemporary moral psychology: where it came from, where it\u2019s brought us, how we might move beyond it. Readings: Book of J; Genesis, Exodus, Isaiah; Matthew, Galatians; Gospel of Mary; Euripides' Medea; Aristophanes' Clouds; Plato's Apology and Republic; Xenophon's Apology; Augustine's Confessions; Marx and Engels\u2019 Communist Manifesto; Kierkegaard's Fear and Trembling; Nietzsche's Genealogy of Morality; Freud's \"Case of Miss Lucy R.\" and Civilization and Its Discontents. SPRING 2015 CORE-UA 404, Texts &amp; Ideas: Antiquity and the 19th Century Prof. Ertman (Sociology)  syllabus Explores the ancient foundations of traditional Western culture by examining the political and social institutions, religious beliefs, and value systems of the Israelites, Greeks, Romans, and early Christians; then turns to the radical challenges to this traditional culture, in the areas of the economy, politics, religion, and morality, that arose over the course of the 19th century, challenges that continue to reverberate to this day. Readings: Genesis, Exodus, Deuteronomy, Luke, Acts, Romans; Thucydides' Peloponnesian War; Plato's Apology and Symposium; Vergil's Aeneid; Augustine's Confessions; Smith's Wealth of Nations; Marx and Engels' Communist Manifesto; Mill's On Liberty; Darwin's Origin of Species; Nietzsche's Genealogy of Morality; Freud's Civilization and Its Discontents.

In this class our aim is to read a range of difficult texts from both antiquity and modernity slowly and carefully, examining closely a series of important philosophical conjunctions. By examining these scenes of reception, both the ancient text and the modern shed light upon one another \u2013why do certain ancient texts come to illustrate and illuminate modern philosophy, and how do modern concerns come to re-animate the ancient texts? The conjunctions will include Sophocles\u2019 Antigone and Hegel; Presocratic philosophy and Nietzsche; Sophocles\u2019 Oedipus Tyrannos and Freud; Plato\u2019s Phaedrus and Derrida; Plato\u2019s Republic and Irigaray; Antigone and Judith Butler. This class recommended for students with some experience with theory and continental philosophy who wish to deepen their understanding of these difficult thinkers. Topics: Lyric Subjectivity and Transculturation Duffy This course will explore the development of lyric poetry from the troubadours to the European metaphysicals, exploring imitation, competition, and anxiety as driving forces of lyric production within a transcultural framework. Primary Texts will include works by Arnaut Daniel, Dante, Petrarch, Pietro Aretino, Garcilaso de la Vega, Lu\u00eds Vas de Cam\u00f5es, Joachim du Bellay, Pierre de Ronsard, Jan Van der Noot, Sir Philip Sidney, Edmund Spenser, John Donne, Jean de Sponde, Francisco de Quevedo, Fernando Herrera, Giambattista Marino, George Herbert, and Richard Crashaw. Critical works will include those by Thomas Greene, Leonard Forster, Teodolinda Barolini, Roland Greene, Terence Cave, Maria Rosa Menocal, Ignacio Navarette, Mario Praz, Gilles Deleuze, Heather DuBrow, and others.  Topics in 18th Century Literature: Enlightenment Evil Gadberry This semester, we will investigate a series of attempts to justify the existence of evil in the world \u2013 and in us. As we read poems, novels, letters, and works of philosophy of the long eighteenth century, we will study the complaints hurled at an incomprehensibly unjust universe in a moment known for its confidence in the powers of the understanding. Our inquiry will take us from texts that try to justify a system that makes us rotten from the very beginning, to works that suggest we live in the best of possible worlds, to scathing satires of these defenses, and \u2013 most scandalously of all \u2013 to outright celebrations of wickedness. We will look at the impersonal evil of natural calamities (in the writings that emerged around the devastating Lisbon earthquake of 1755) to the carefully wrought cruelties of sadism (in the Marquis deSade\u2019s Justine, for instance). As we do so, we\u2019ll think about how Enlightenment reason grapples with problems that seem to resist reason, how Enlightenment optimism stands up to critique, and how some instrumentalize (and even eroticize!) reason in pursuit of amoral pleasures. Required works will include the following primary works, many of which will be available in a coursepack: Kant, \u201cOn the Miscarriage of All Philosophical Trials in Theodicy\u201d; Kleist, \u201cThe Earthquake in Chile\u201d; Laclos, Dangerous Liaisons; Leibniz, Theodicy (selections); John Milton, Paradise Lost (selections); Pope, \u201cAn Essay on Man\u201d; Rousseau, letter to Voltaire defending Pope and Leibniz and selections from the Confessions and Social Contract; Sade, Justine; Voltaire, Candide and \u201cPoem on the Lisbon Disaster.\u201d The coursepack will also include secondary readings by Bakunin, Foucault, Lacan, and others.    Topics in 20th Century Literature: Cosmopolitanism and Urban Spaces Halim The notion of cosmopolitanism has been associated, traditionally, with the city, the cosmopolite being conceived of as a privileged urbanite. Although much has changed in the way we have come to think of cosmopolitanism in recent years, we still need to ask: to what extent is everyone potentially a cosmopolite nowadays? Are there good and bad candidates for that status, and if so, what are the criteria, and who gets to decide? Are all the world\u2019s cities global cities? And what of \u201cvillage\u201d in \u201cglobal village\u201d? If we bear in mind that a substantial portion of the world\u2019s population still lives in relatively deprived semi-rural areas, how would that alter our understanding of this new cosmopolitanism, or propose other forms? In what way does the city-bred cosmopolite\u2019s thirst for pastoral images and idyllic vistas impact peasants and the countryside? What, if any, are the tactics to which rural migrants in big urban centers resort to rework old patterns of belonging and forge new attachments? In this course, we will attend to these and other questions of cosmopolitanism and globalization in rural and urban spaces through theory, literary texts and films from the Middle East, Europe and the USA.    Topics in 20th Century Literature: Violence and Technology Kaffen Frequently characterized as an aberration within modernity, pervasive violence in its various forms (war, terror, crime, culture) has proven disastrously resistant to the ideals of the enlightenment, throwing them into question if not crisis. More, its relationship to technology in particular remains among the most fraught legacies of modernity. Indeed, the intersections of technology and violence have engendered the most profound critical debates and contentious cultural and artistic works of the twentieth century. In the interest of grappling with the ever increasing complexity of this relationship, we will read a broad array of critical writings on violence and technology, as they intersect with questions of politics, security, and sovereignty. At the same time, we will pay attention to the cultural and artistic expressions that critically engage with these issues from literature, music, architecture, painting, photography, cinema, video games, and assorted new media. Readings will include Eyal Weizman, George Bataille, Paul Virilio, Sasaki Ataru, TJ Clark, Walter Benjamin, Adriana Caverero, Hannah Arendt, Carl von Clausewitz, Ariella Azoulay, Jean Genet, Michel Foucault, Carl Schmitt, George Didi- Huberman, W.G. Sebald, Ernst Junger.  Topics: Fascism/Violence/Memory: The Case of the Spanish Civil War Matos-Martin The Spanish Civil War (1936-1939) is the defining event in Spanish modern history as well as widely acknowledged as a precursor to World War II. As the earliest example of battleground against fascism, those three years fascinated and attracted individuals from across the world, including George Orwell and Ernest Hemingway, and have continued to be the object of numerous books and other cultural products. Not so well known and studied, however, is the long-lasted and violent fascist regime established once the democratic Spanish Republic was eventually defeated. The purpose of the course is to examine the war and the fascist dictatorship that followed and perpetuated the logic of war, with a special focus on fictional and cultural representations. Literary texts, films, and documentaries will be analyzed in comparison with other artistic and cultural forms of expression (photography, painting), and accompanied by readings in history and theory. Topics to be discussed include political and ideological dynamics of war and fascism (comparing the Spanish case with other fascist regimes such as the Nazis through such theoretical lenses as biopolitics, for example), representations of violence, memory and history, and justice.  Topics in 19th Century History: Century Literary History: Arthur Rimbaud Ross A seminar devoted to the poetry, cultural, and political context of Arthur Rimbaud.   Students must have some reading knowledge of French (there will surely be differing   levels of familiarity with French in the group) and a good French dictionary. Discussion conducted in English.  Senior Seminar in Comparative Literature: Honors Thesis Vatulescu This seminar, limited to senior Comparative Literature majors engaged in writing a senior honors thesis, is designed to be a writing workshop. Students will articulate and research a thesis topic, identify an appropriate critical approach and methodology, and write at least one chapter of their thesis. Periodical writing installments give the students the opportunity to receive feed-back from their peers and instructor as well as to learn to critique others' work-in-progress. Permission of the DUGS is required to enroll in the course. Students must also have a 3.65 or better GPA, both overall and in the major.

We find ourselves stretched between the past and the future, flung into a world we did not create and yearning for something better. We have expectations of the world and even fantasies of other ones. Our thought often transcends this world, leaving reality behind. The stories we tell of other, better worlds can often be critiques of our own, whereas sometimes we develop and implement projects for the transformation of this world and even of ourselves. Our goal is to demonstrate the ongoing conversation and practice of utopia in Western (i.e, ancient Greek and Roman, Western Mediterranean Christian, European, and Euro-American) cultural history. In examining some parts of this complex and at times contradictory tradition we will develop a set of questions which can be asked of utopian literature. We also examine our own relationship to this literary, ethical, and political tradition.  FALL 2013 MAP-UA 400 Texts &amp; Ideas: Topics\u2014Objectivity Prof. Gitelman (English) and Prof. Robles (Media, Culture &amp; Communication)   syllabus  Bias. Spin. Propaganda. Hype. These are familiar pejoratives for citizens of the twenty-first century, and by implication they privilege the same alternative: objectivity. Objectivity is a concept\u2014or an ideal\u2014that frames our understanding of pursuits as diverse as politics, journalism, and science, realms in which we hope to be able to discern the right, the true, and the real. But what is objectivity? Whose discernment counts as objective? How can we tell? Questions like these ask us to consider not only what we know but also how, while the conditions of evolving, possessing, and assessing knowledge turn out to be remarkably available to cultural and historical change. We consider the origins and character of objectivity within and against the Western intellectual tradition by considering selected episodes in its emergence, both ancient and modern, asking how thinkers have thought about knowing. What are or have been the available routes to certainty? What standards exist or have existed for knowledge about the past, about the self or about others, and about the world around us? Is it possible that the twenty-first century will involve new forms of objectivity? Readings: Matthew, Thucydides, Plato\u2019s Protagoras and Meno, Descartes\u2019 Discourse on Method, selections from Montaigne, Bird\u2019s Sheppard Lee, Agee and Evan\u2019s Let Us Now Praise Famous Men.  FALL 2013 MAP-UA 400 Texts &amp; Ideas: Topics\u2014On Beasts and Books Prof. Kay (French)   syllabus According to the Book of Genesis, human beings have two distinct relationships with other animals: in one version of the creation story Adam gives them names, in the other they are created to keep him company. Whether non-human animals are creatures to which we assign meanings, or whether they are our interlocutors, is thus a dilemma formulated from the outset. It will provide the overall framework for this course in we examine how animals are interpreted metaphorically or symbolically, as if they were texts, and how they are also represented as speaking to us, as if they were producers of texts. We work mainly on written documents ranging from the Bible and antiquity through the Middle Ages and the premodern period (mainly the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries), reaching forward occasionally into the contemporary world for current examples. Some materials are literary (like fables and fairy stories), some philosophical, others historical. We also consider visual materials from manuscript illuminations to recent films. And we evaluate the role of animals in cultural practices other than literary or artistic works\u2014for instance, in hunting or in zoos\u2014and discover how, in this sense, they are like texts that we can read and analyze. FALL 2013 MAP-UA 400 Texts &amp; Ideas: Topics\u2014Animal Humans Prof. Lezra (Comparative Literature)  syllabus  \"One might go so far as to define man as a creature that has failed in its effort to keep its animalness\u2026\" So writes the German philosopher Peter Sloterdijk. What sort of animal were we? Where, how, and by whom has the line between the human and the animal been drawn? With what consequences for our \"human\" understanding of the world? Of concepts like the \"soul,\" \"society,\" politics, the family? Is the line between the human and the animal drawn differently in different genres--in literary works, theological treatises, natural histories, paintings, films? We come at these questions from different angles, following them from antiquity to early modern responses to these questions, and in essays by contemporary philosophers and advocates. Readings: Genesis, Numbers, Euripides' Bacchae, Plato's Phaedrus, Ovid's Metamorphoses, Apuleius' Golden Ass, Marie de France' Bisclavret, Shakespeare's Midsummer Night's Dream, Montaigne's \"Apology in Defense of Raymond Sebond, Machiavelli's Prince, H. G. Wells's Island of Dr. Moreau and Island of Lost Souls, Derrida's \"The Animal that therefore I am,\" selections from Boccaccio, Peter Singer, Giorgio Agamben, Donna Haraway. FALL 2013 MAP-UA 402 Texts &amp; Ideas: Antiquity and the Renaissance Prof. Gerety (Collegiate Professor)   syllabus  What   is the soul? Is it the conscious self or something more? Does our   identity persist beyond death? What is the relation between the soul and   good and evil? Some say that Socrates 'discovered' the human soul, but   the idea that we have souls that outlast our bodies is as old as   humanity. Our understanding of the nature of our souls often dictates   the way we feel we should live. We will explore ideas from Homer and   Heraclitus through Socrates himself and then on to Sophocles, Plato,   Aristotle, the Hebrew Bible, the New Testament (including the Gnostics),   Augustine, and Vergil. We look for the elements that make up personal   identity and value in the ancient world, both religious and secular, and   see how much these change from Homer's world to that of Augustine and   the Roman Empire. We then turn to Dante, who provides a bridge to some   of the great thinkers and artists of the Renaissance--most notably   Shakespeare and DaVinci but also Montaigne and Villon. In all of these,   the permanence and even presence of our souls seem more uncertain, more   threatened by death and obliteration, than in Plato or Paul, and this   threat reaches our morality and values as well. In this way, the   Renaissance marks the beginning of the world in which all of us must now   find our way. FALL 2013 MAP-UA 402 Texts &amp; Ideas: Antiquity and the Renaissance Prof. Gilman (English)  syllabus The \"Renaissance\" understands itself as an age bearing witness to the \"rebirth\" of classical antiquity. In art, philosophy, and literature it also assumes the task of reconciling the cultural inheritance of Greece and Rome with the Christian tradition (itself entering into a moment of crisis as allegiances split between the Catholic church and the \"reformed\" church of Luther and Calvin). Our first task is to look at antiquity; our second, to explore the ways in which European culture between 1400 and 1700 invents the modern by making itself conversant with the past. Readings: Homer's Odyssey; Sophocles' Antigone; Plato's Phaedo and Symposium; Vergil's Aeneid; Genesis, Exodus, Job, Luke, Acts, John; Augustine's Confessions; Castiglione's Book of the Courtier; Machiavelli's Prince; Erasmus's Praise of Folly; Montaigne's Essays; More's Utopia; Shakespeare's Tempest. FALL 2013 MAP-UA 404 Texts &amp; Ideas: Antiquity and the 19th Century Prof. Baker (English)  syllabus Examines Western conceptions of the relation between humans and the natural world. Considers how 19th-century thinkers embraced, revised, and overturned ancient ideas about creation, natural order, the distinction between humans and animals, and the risks and rewards of probing nature's mysteries. Readings: Homer's Odyssey, Hebrew and Christian scripture, Aeschylus' Prometheus Bound, Shelley's Frankenstein, Darwin's Origin of Species, and works by Plato, Aristotle, Augustine, Emerson, Goethe, and Nietzsche. FALL 2013 MAP-UA 404 Texts &amp; Ideas: Antiquity and the 19th Century Prof. Corradi (Sociology)  syllabus A guide to the intellectual heritage distinctive to the West, with special attention to the nature of the person, freedom, rationality, democracy, and the social order. The works we study continue to shape the way people understand themselves and the world. They are 'classic' in the sense that they have not finished saying what they have to say. We situate them in historical context, looking for ways in which later authors responded to themes introduced by earlier ones. From the particularity of the West, these themes show a vocation for universality. Readings include: Genesis, Exodus, Luke, Corinthians; Sophocles' Oedipus and Antigone; Plato's Apology and Republic; Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics; Pericles' Funeral Oration; Epictetus' Discourses; Augustine's Confessions; Tocqueville's Democracy in America; Mill's On Liberty; Darwin's Origins of the Species; Marx and Engels' Communist Manifesto; Kierkegaard's Fear and Trembling; Nietzsche's Genealogy of Morality; Weber's Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism; Lincoln's Gettysburg Address; Freud's Civilization and Its Discontents. FALL 2013 MAP-UA 404 Texts &amp; Ideas: Antiquity and the 19th Century Prof. Renzi (MAP)   syllabus  Contemporary moral psychology: where it came from, where it\u2019s brought us, how we might move beyond it. Readings: Book of J; Genesis, Exodus, Isaiah; Matthew, Galatians; Gospel of Mary; Euripides' Medea; Aristophanes' Clouds; Plato's Apology and Republic; Xenophon's Apology; Augustine's Confessions; Marx and Engels\u2019 Communist Manifesto; Kierkegaard's Fear and Trembling; Nietzsche's Genealogy of Morality; Freud's \"Case of Miss Lucy R.\" and Civilization and Its Discontents. FALL 2013 MAP-UA 404 Texts &amp; Ideas: Antiquity and the 19th Century Prof. Ulfers (German)   syllabus  A conversation between two paradigms informing Western culture: the dominant, optimistic one, revolving around notions of historical progress toward absolute knowledge and utopian visions of the world and society; and the subterranean, pessimistic one, which looks on the former as a human construct or fiction that must come to naught. Readings: works from the Hebrew and Christian scriptures, Plato, and Sophocles; Augustine's Confessions; selections from Darwin; Marx and Engels' Communist Manifesto; Nietzsche's Birth of Tragedy; Freud's Interpretation of Dreams; Kafka's Metamorphosis; Mann's Death in Venice.  FALL 2013 MAP-UA 410, Texts and Ideas: Topics\u2014Exile and Belonging\u2014Writing Intensive Prof. Waters (Irish Studies)  syllabus A writing-intensive version of Texts and Ideas offered in conjunction with selected sections of EXPOS-UA 1, Writing the Essay. Recommended for students regardless of intended major who seek a deeper engagement with the texts and more attention to writing about them than the regular versions of these courses can provide. While readings and assignments are shared between the lecture and the writing workshops, there are no recitations for this lecture; students must therefore be prepared to do substantial independent work without the support of a recitation section. Open to new CAS first-year students only.   The very possibility of our identity rests on the possibility of our estrangement. This theme haunts Western literature, philosophy, and politics from antiquity to the present. We examine the dynamic of exile and belonging, of place and displacement, by reading closely a series of classical texts that established a framework for thinking about culture, the state, and the individual. Readings: Genesis, Exodus, Isaiah; Sophocles' Oedipus, Antigone, Oedipus at Colonus; Defoe's Robinson Crusoe; Shelley's Frankenstein; Douglass' Narrative of the Life of an American Slave; Marx and Engels' Communist Manifesto; Nietzsche's Gay Science; Freud's Civilization and Its Discontents, and Disturbance of Memory at the Acropolis; selection from Ovid, Byron, Keats. NOTE: Students must also register for one of the linked section of EXPOS-UA 1, Writing the Essay: 016, 017, 018, 020, 021, 023, 025. Spring 2014 SPRING 2014 CORE-UA 400 Texts &amp; Ideas: Topics\u2014Political Economy Prof. Gross (History)   syllabus  What is the \u201cmarket\u201d, the \u201ceconomy\u201d, or \u201ccapitalism\u201d? How do individuals interact with each other in the marketplace? What is the morality of commerce? And how does, or should, the state govern the economy? These are all questions that have no simple answers and as a consequence they stimulate controversy today, in America and throughout the world. Yet these questions have a long pedigree. Since antiquity intellectuals have grappled with the fundamental issues of what in the past they called moral philosophy, what today we call political economy: how the individual, the market, and the state should interact with each other. Readings: Aristotle, Aquinas, Locke, Smith, Ricardo, Rousseau, Zola, Marx, Mill, Bagehot, Weber, Orwell, Keynes, Polanyi, Friedman, Hayek, Galbraith, Kindleberger, Harvey, Sachs. SPRING 2014 CORE-UA 400 Texts &amp; Ideas: Topics\u2014Paranoid Narratives Prof. Sanders (Comparative Literature)   syllabus  It\u2019s no secret that we live in an age of paranoia. What began life in the nineteenth century as a psychiatric diagnosis may now be the predominant form taken by our experience of politics and technology. We explore the evolution of ideas about paranoia through a careful reading of key texts, with special focus on narrative: Could there be something about the structure of narrative\u2014its \u201cvoices\u201d and its \u201cspeakers,\u201d its drive for explanation of origins\u2014that is paranoid, or gives rise to paranoia? Tracing psychoanalytic theories of paranoia (Sigmund Freud, Melanie Klein), and attending no less to their narrative structure, we address this question and others by reading key autobiographical and fictional works from Europe and Africa, such as Schreber\u2019s Memoirs of My Nervous Illness, Orwell\u2019s Nineteen Eighty-Four, Head\u2019s A Question of Power, Marks\u2019 Not Either an Experimental Doll, Coetzee\u2019s Disgrace, as well as political writings and documents by Richard Hofstadter, Michel Foucault, Julian Assange (Wikileaks), South African AIDS denialists, and Rwandan g\u00e9nocidaires.  SPRING 2014 CORE -UA 400 Texts &amp; Ideas: Topics\u2014Guilt and Sin, Law and Justice Prof. Maudlin (Philosophy)  syllabus The   nature of justice, the legitimacy of law, and the justification for   punishment. We begin with Biblical accounts of sin and retribution,   Greek myths on the origin of the legal system, and the trial and   execution of Socrates. Turning to more modern works, we consider   theories of natural rights and the origin of legitimate states through   social contract, ending with three novels that present challenging views   of crime, the legal system, and the human soul. Readings: Genesis,   Exodus; Euripides\u2019 Oresteia; Plato\u2019s Apology, Crito, Phaedo, Republic;   Paine\u2019s Rights of Man; Melville\u2019s Billy Budd; Dostoyevsky\u2019s Crime and   Punishment; Kafka\u2019s Trial. SPRING 2014 CORE -UA 400 Texts &amp; Ideas: Topics\u2014On Liberation Prof. Watson (English)   syllabus  What is liberation? What is the political form that allows for maximum freedom, and how is it to be achieved? How have the concepts of freedom, slavery and oppression been articulated by thinkers from Plato to Gandhi? We examine these enduring questions through a wide historical and cultural lens, aiming to understand and map out competing ideas around the conditions for freedom (and unfreedom). To this end, we read seminal works theorizing the relationship between the individual and the collective, ideas of sovereignty, the ideal state and the revolutionary nation, and arguments for violence and non-violence. While grounded in Western thought on the topic, we also pay attention to how the struggles and theorizations of the non-West (the Haitian Revolution, the Algerian and Indian independence struggles, postcolonialism and the Tricontinental) have shaped our inquiry into the nature and promise of liberation. Reading: Epictetus\u2019 Handbook, Plato\u2019s Republic, Equiano\u2019s Life, Shakespeare\u2019s Tempest, Rousseau\u2019s Discourse on Inequality, Mill\u2019s On Liberty, selections from Marx, James\u2019 Black Jacobins, Cesaire\u2019s Discourse on Colonialism, Gandhi\u2019s Hind Swaraj, Freire\u2019s Pedagogy of the Oppressed. SPRING 2014 CORE -UA 402 Texts &amp; Ideas: Antiquity and the Renaissance Prof. Gilman (English)   syllabus  The \"Renaissance\" understands itself as an age bearing witness to the \"rebirth\" of classical antiquity. In art, philosophy, and literature it also assumes the task of reconciling the cultural inheritance of Greece and Rome with the Christian tradition (itself entering into a moment of crisis as allegiances split between the Catholic church and the \"reformed\" church of Luther and Calvin). Our first task is to look at antiquity; our second, to explore the ways in which European culture between 1400 and 1700 invents the modern by making itself conversant with the past. Readings: Homer's Odyssey; Sophocles' Antigone; Plato's Phaedo and Symposium; Vergil's Aeneid; Genesis, Exodus, Job, Luke, Acts, John; Augustine's Confessions; Castiglione's Book of the Courtier; Machiavelli's Prince; Erasmus's Praise of Folly; Montaigne's Essays; More's Utopia; Shakespeare's Tempest. SPRING 2014 CORE -UA 403 Texts &amp; Ideas: Antiquity and the Enlightenment Prof. Deneys-Tunney (French)   syllabus  The Enlightenment was a Europe-wide movement, which concerned all aspects of culture of the time: philosophy and literature, the arts (painting, music, architecture), as well as politics and society as a whole. The Enlightenment defined itself as a new birth, a subversive movement that would free mankind of all its prejudices--philosophical, religious, political, sexual, racial. In doing so, the Enlightenment appears today to be indeed the beginning of our modernity, as it invented key concepts that define or frame our contemporary representations of ourselves and the world around us: the concept of the subject or subjectivity, of nature, of origins, of equality, of critical philosophy and democracy, of pleasure, of sexuality, of happiness. It is a unique moment in history, where philosophy aims not only at interpreting the world but also at changing it to make it a better place for mankind. It culminates at the end of the 18th century in France with the French Revolution, which declared for the first time in human history that all men are born free and equal. Readings: Genesis, Plato's Symposium and Phedrus, Epicurus' Maxims and letters, Descartes' Discourse on Method, Rousseau's Discourse on Inequality and R\u00eaveries, Diderot's Indiscreet Jewels and Jacques the Fatalist, Voltaire's Candide and Zadig, Marivaux's Dispute and Double Unfaithfulness, Kant's \"What is Enlightenment?\" SPRING 2014 CORE -UA 403 Texts and Ideas: Antiquity and the Enlightenment Prof. Chazan (Hebrew &amp; Judaic Studies)  syllabus Focuses on the understanding of knowledge and truth in antiquity and the Enlightenment. Divergent perspectives on knowledge and truth have important implications for society and the individual. They lead to alternative notions of how society should be ordered, who should exercise power in society, the goals of individual endeavor, and the nature of individual fulfillment. Key texts from antiquity and the Enlightenment will be read and analyzed with these issues uppermost in mind. Readings: Genesis, Exodus, Luke, Acts, Galatians; Sophocles' Antigone; Euripides' Bacchae; Plato's Apology and Symposium; Augustine's Confessions; Spinoza's Tractatus Theologico-Politicus; Locke's Letter Concerning Toleration; Lessing's Nathan the Wise; Montesquieu's Persian Letters; Voltaire's Letters Concerning the English Nation; Paine's Age of Reason.  SPRING 2014 CORE -UA 404 Texts &amp; Ideas: Antiquity and the 19th Century Prof. Ertman (Sociology)  syllabus Explores   the ancient foundations of traditional Western culture by examining the   political and social institutions, religious beliefs, and value systems   of the Israelites, Greeks, Romans, and early Christians; then turns to   the radical challenges to this traditional culture, in the areas of the   economy, politics, religion, and morality, that arose over the course of   the 19th century, challenges that continue to reverberate to this day.   Readings: Genesis, Exodus, Deuteronomy, Luke, Acts, Romans; Thucydides'   Peloponnesian War; Plato's Apology and Symposium; Vergil's Aeneid;   Augustine's Confessions; Smith's Wealth of Nations; Marx and Engels'   Communist Manifesto; Mill's On Liberty; Darwin's Origin of Species;   Nietzsche's Genealogy of Morality; Freud's Civilization and Its   Discontents.  SPRING 2014 CORE -UA 404 Texts &amp; Ideas: Antiquity and the 19th Century Prof. Levene (Classics)   syllabus  Every society places demands on individuals: it could not do otherwise and still remain a society. But what happens when those demands are inconsistent? Can--or should--an individual determine the right course of action by reason alone? Or should one simply obey--but then, whom should one obey? What happens when people's moral judgments differ from the expectations of those around them? How can one maintain a society in the face of such conflicts? From the first moments of Western literature those questions are explored; they became all the more insistent in the unprecedented political, social, intellectual, and economic upheavals of the 19th century. One effect was the increasingly central role given to art itself, seen as the dynamic force able to create a cohesive society. Our study will include Richard Wagner's remarkable music-drama The Ring of the Nibelung, perhaps the most significant and influential art-work of the era (studied primarily as a text, though there will be opportunities to hear the music as well). Other readings will include selections from the Hebrew and Christian Scriptures; Homer's Iliad; Sophocles' Antigone; Plato's Gorgias; Vergil's Aeneid; poetry by (among others) Shelley, Tennyson, and Matthew Arnold; Arnold's Culture and Anarchy; Wagner's Art and Revolution; and Nietzsche's Genealogy of Morality.

Readings: Book of J; Genesis, Exodus, Isaiah; Matthew, Galatians; Gospel of Mary; Euripides' Medea; Aristophanes' Clouds; Plato's Apology and Republic; Xenophon's Apology; Augustine's Confessions; Marx and Engels\u2019 Communist Manifesto; Kierkegaard's Fear and Trembling; Nietzsche's Genealogy of Morality; Freud's \"Case of Miss Lucy R.\" and Civilization and Its Discontents. SPRING 2014 CORE -UA 404 Texts &amp; Ideas: Antiquity and the 19th Century Prof. Baker (English)  syllabus  Examines   Western conceptions of the relation between humans and the natural   world. Considers how 19th-century thinkers embraced, revised, and   overturned ancient ideas about creation, natural order, the distinction   between humans and animals, and the risks and rewards of probing   nature's mysteries. Readings: Homer's Odyssey, Hebrew and Christian   scripture, Aeschylus' Prometheus Bound, Shelley's Frankenstein, Darwin's   Origin of Species, and works by Plato, Aristotle, Augustine, Emerson,   Goethe, and Nietzsche.  top of page           Contact Us | &copy; New York University , Arts and Science"}, {"content": "Texts & Ideas    | The College Core Curriculum, College of Arts and Science | New York Univeristy                          NEW YORK UNIVERSITY     ARTS AND SCIENCE     COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIENCE     GRADUATE SCHOOL OF ARTS AND SCIENCE             The College Core Curriculum            Back to Home       Texts & Ideas | 2014-2015 Note: * indicates draft/sample syllabus  Fall 2014 FALL 2014 CORE-UA 400, Texts &amp; Ideas: Topics\u2014Utopias and Dystopias Prof. Becker (Classics)   syllabus  We all have difficulty living in the present. We find ourselves stretched between the past and the future, flung into a world we did not create and yearning for something better. We have expectations of the world and even fantasies of other ones. Our thought often transcends this world, leaving reality behind. The stories we tell of other, better worlds can often be critiques of our own, whereas sometimes we develop and implement projects for the transformation of this world and even of ourselves. Our goal is to demonstrate the ongoing conversation and practice of utopia in Western (i.e, ancient Greek and Roman, Western Mediterranean Christian, European, and Euro-American) cultural history. In examining some parts of this complex and at times contradictory tradition we will develop a set of questions which can be asked of utopian literature. We also examine our own relationship to this literary, ethical, and political tradition.  FALL 2014 CORE-UA 400, Texts &amp; Ideas: Topics\u2014Political Economy Prof. Gross (History)  syllabus  What   is the \u201cmarket\u201d, the \u201ceconomy\u201d, or \u201ccapitalism\u201d? How do individuals   interact with each other in the marketplace? What is the morality of   commerce? And how does, or should, the state govern the economy? These   are all questions that have no simple answers and as a consequence they   stimulate controversy today, in America and throughout the world. Yet   these questions have a long pedigree. Since antiquity intellectuals have   grappled with the fundamental issues of what in the past they called   moral philosophy, what today we call political economy: how the   individual, the market, and the state should interact with each other.   Readings: Aristotle, Aquinas, Locke, Smith, Ricardo, Rousseau, Zola,   Marx, Mill, Bagehot, Weber, Orwell, Keynes, Polanyi, Friedman, Hayek,   Galbraith, Kindleberger, Harvey, Sachs. FALL 2014 CORE-UA 400, Texts &amp; Ideas: Topics\u2014Medieval Political Thought Prof. Stoller (NYU Libraries)  syllabus Medieval   political thought spanned three great religious traditions:   Christianity, Islam and Judaism. Across all three traditions it was   grounded in a deeply religious perspective on the human condition, one   originating in a set of sacred texts that shared a common monotheism and   a similar moral ethic. The political thought of all three groups was   equally grounded in a set of ancient, pagan texts, drawing on the   perspective of the Greeks and Romans, on whose shoulders the medievals   believed they stood. Political theorists across all three traditions   drew heavily from one another, but each spoke to the unique concerns of   its own community. We explore the commonalities and the contrasts among   the three political systems and the extraordinary minds that shaped   them. Readings will include Hebrew and Christian scriptures, the Qur'an,   Plato, Aristotle, Augustine, Alfarabi, Alghazali, Aquinas, Avicenna,   Bacon, Giles of Rome, Maimonides, Marsilius of Padua, and Polgar.  FALL 2014 CORE-UA 400, Texts &amp; Ideas: Topics\u2014Action Prof. Halpern (English)  syllabus  What   does it mean to perform an act? What are we doing when we do something?   The term \u201caction\u201d covers everything from picking up a pencil to leading   a political revolution. Action is a way of intervening in the world and   changing it, in minor or major ways. Both ethics and politics involve   acting in relation to others. Philosophers have found action interesting   because it bridges the mental and physical worlds, beginning as   intention and ending with some sort of embodied execution. The English   word \u201cact\u201d complicates things still further, since it can mean not only   \u201cto do something\u201d but also \u201cto pretend to do something; to play a part.\u201d   Acting in the \u201cserious\u201d sense is always haunted by dramatic or   play-acting. And because drama is the art form that relies on people   actually doing things onstage\u2014or rather, pretending to actually do   things onstage\u2014it is also an art form that has thought through questions   of action in sophisticated ways. We read a variety of works by   philosophers, playwrights, theologians, filmmakers, and economists in   order to get a sense of how action has been understood from the   classical era to the present day, including Aeschylus, Aristotle,   Augustine, Marlowe, Shakespeare, Smith, Marx, Nietzsche, Freud, Beckett.  FALL 2014 CORE-UA 400, Texts &amp; Ideas: Topics\u2014Value Prof. Poovey (English) &amp; Prof. Zaloom (Social and Cultural Analysis)  syllabus Can   you put a price on sex? art? love? life? Is time money, or is   daydreaming time well-spent? Would you accept a pound of flesh as   payment of a debt? Is there such a thing as a free lunch, and what would   it taste like? We explore different\u2014and often conflicting\u2014conceptions   of value spanning literature, philosophy, ethnography, and social   theory, seeking to convey three fundamental principles: Value is not   inherent in things but the result of a social process, value is often   determined at the intersection of different conceptions of productive   potential, and value is conceptualized or measured in different, and   often conflicting, ways. Readings include selections from Aristotle,   Christian Scripture, Shakespeare, Smith, Bentham, Wordsworth, Austen,   Weber, Keynes, Milton Friedman, Kazuo Ishiguro, and Pierre Bourdieu. FALL 2014 CORE-UA 400, Texts &amp; Ideas: Topics\u2014This World and the Next Prof. Connolly (Classics)  syllabus  Explores different ways of thinking about the world or worlds beyond (and better than) the one in which we live, concentrating on the afterlife, political utopias, and the worlds created by artistic imagination. Readings include Homer, Vergil, Dante, the Bible, Plato's Republic, Marx and Engels' Communist Manifesto, selection of Romantic poetry, and Philip K. Dick's Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep, and its film adaptation, Blade Runner. FALL 2014 CORE-UA 400, Texts &amp; Ideas: Topics\u2014Arts and Publics Prof. Blake (English)  syllabus Civic values and public purpose are intricately bound up with the arts. Whenever a case needs to be made that the arts matter, we tend to speak (usually, in very general terms) about how the arts contribute to education, or self-expression, or community life, or public deliberation, or the moral and social reform of individuals and institutions. On the other side, those who question the public value of the arts might complain that the arts are elitist, or overweening, or out of touch, or too political, or not political enough. How did we come to think about the arts in these terms? What are some of our assumptions about public life, such that it makes sense for us to promote the arts as having an important public cultural role, or alternatively distrust or dismiss them for not properly or effectively living up to that role? And, ultimately, what is at stake: Why does it matter if the arts matter? Readings from the Classical period through the present day, with a specific focus on drama and theatre. FALL 2014 CORE-UA 400, Texts &amp; Ideas: Topics\u2014Visible and Invisible Cities Prof. Cox (Italian Studies)  syllabus The   experience of living in a city is one vital thread that connects us   with our ancient, medieval, and early modern ancestors, and that   continues to provide a unifying element in millions of our   contemporaries\u2019 disparate lives across the globe. Urban life is a   constant environment and stimulus, whether you find yourself in New   York, Florence, Accra, or Shanghai. Our aim is to supply conceptual   frameworks and historical contexts for this experience by exploring the   ways human communities have been theorized and imagined within the   Western tradition from classical antiquity through to the Renaissance,   particularly the city, conceived since Aristotle as the proper habitat   of humankind, and the relationship between the family or household and   the state. The primary texts encompass utopian writings and works of   political theory, but also texts describing and analyzing real-world   communities and visual and cartographic representations of cities and   urban space. Readings include the canonical\u2014from Plato, Aristotle,   Vergil, Dante, Boccaccio, More, Shakespeare\u2014to texts from Christine de   Pizan and Moderata Fontelong, marginalized from the canon and only now   becoming visible. FALL 2014 CORE-UA 403, Texts &amp; Ideas: Antiquity and the Enlightenment Prof. Rubenstein (Hebrew &amp; Judaic Studies)  syllabus Beginning with the collision of the \"Judeo-Christian\" and Hellenistic traditions and their encounter in the Christian Scriptures and Augustine, we see Enlightenment thinkers grapple with the fusion of these traditions they had inherited, subjecting both to serious criticism and revising them as a new tradition\u2014science and technology\u2014rises to prominence. Reading from the Hebrew and Christian Scriptures, Sophocles, Plato, Augustine, Montesquieu, Pope, Voltaire, and Rousseau. FALL 2014 CORE-UA 404, Texts &amp; Ideas: Antiquity and the 19th Century Prof. Corradi (Sociology)  syllabus A guide to the intellectual heritage distinctive to the West, with special attention to the nature of the person, freedom, rationality, democracy, and the social order. The works we study continue to shape the way people understand themselves and the world. They are 'classic' in the sense that they have not finished saying what they have to say. We situate them in historical context, looking for ways in which later authors responded to themes introduced by earlier ones. From the particularity of the West, these themes show a vocation for universality. Readings include: Genesis, Exodus, Luke, Corinthians; Sophocles' Oedipus and Antigone; Plato's Apology and Republic; Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics; Pericles' Funeral Oration; Epictetus' Discourses; Augustine's Confessions; Tocqueville's Democracy in America; Mill's On Liberty; Darwin's Origins of the Species; Marx and Engels' Communist Manifesto; Kierkegaard's Fear and Trembling; Nietzsche's Genealogy of Morality; Weber's Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism; Lincoln's Gettysburg Address; Freud's Civilization and Its Discontents. FALL 2014 CORE-UA 404, Texts &amp; Ideas: Antiquity and the 19th Century Prof. Renzi (College Core Curriculum)  syllabus Contemporary moral psychology: where it came from, where it\u2019s brought us, how we might move beyond it.

FALL 2014 CORE-UA 404, Texts &amp; Ideas: Antiquity and the 19th Century Prof. Ulfers (German)  syllabus A conversation between two paradigms informing Western culture: the dominant, optimistic one, revolving around notions of historical progress toward absolute knowledge and utopian visions of the world and society; and the subterranean, pessimistic one, which looks on the former as a human construct or fiction that must come to naught. Readings: works from the Hebrew and Christian scriptures, Plato, and Sophocles; Augustine's Confessions; selections from Darwin; Marx and Engels' Communist Manifesto; Nietzsche's Birth of Tragedy; Freud's Interpretation of Dreams; Kafka's Metamorphosis; Mann's Death in Venice. Spring 2015 SPRING 2015 CORE-UA 400, Texts &amp; Ideas: Topics - Materialism Prof. Shaw (English)  syllabus Why is materialism a dirty word? Through what logic has it come to be associated with crass monetary gain and excessive bodily pleasure? When did these associations begin, and why? What other senses of materialism (as a philosophy of the everyday, and as a critical corrective to idealism) lurk underneath these pejorative, immediate associations? How might they be activated? We examine conflicts between Christian idealism and a range of materialist philosophies, including Epicureanism, experimentalism and Marxism. Materialists became infamous for directing their attention at bodies rather than souls, at terrestrial matter rather than divine will, and at the letter rather than the spirit of scripture. We follow their lead and pay close attention to a range of texts and objects, but in doing so we also consider just how various materialisms could be, how their realist correctives operated at different scales and in different contexts: from the atomic to the economic, from the corporeal to the textual. Readings: Lucretius, Vergil\u2019s Georgics, 1 Corinthians, Machiavelli\u2019s Prince, More\u2019s Utopia, selections from Montaigne, Shakespeare, Bacon, Diderot, Wordsworth, Poe, Balzac, Marx, Nietzsche and Whitman.  SPRING 2015 CORE-UA 400, Texts &amp; Ideas: Topics\u2014On Objectivity Prof. Gitelman (English)  syllabus Bias. Spin. Propaganda. Hype. These are familiar pejoratives for citizens of the twenty-first century, and by implication they privilege the same alternative: objectivity. Objectivity is a concept\u2014or an ideal\u2014that frames our understanding of pursuits as diverse as politics, journalism, and science, realms in which we hope to be able to discern the right, the true, and the real. But what is objectivity? Whose discernment counts as objective? How can we tell? Questions like these ask us to consider not only what we know but also how, while the conditions of evolving, possessing, and assessing knowledge turn out to be remarkably available to cultural and historical change. We consider the origins and character of objectivity within and against the Western intellectual tradition by considering selected episodes in its emergence, both ancient and modern, asking how thinkers have thought about knowing. What are or have been the available routes to certainty? What standards exist or have existed for knowledge about the past, about the self or about others, and about the world around us? Is it possible that the twenty-first century will involve new forms of objectivity? Readings: Matthew, Thucydides, Plato\u2019s Protagoras and Meno, Descartes\u2019 Discourse on Method, selections from Montaigne, Bird\u2019s Sheppard Lee, Agee and Evan\u2019s Let Us Now Praise Famous Men.

SPRING 2015 CORE-UA 400, Texts &amp; Ideas: Topics\u2014Life and Death Prof. Velleman (Philosophy)  syllabus  Every   person has a life to live, but what is this thing, \u201ca life\u201d, that every   person has? To begin with, it\u2019s just the temporally extended existence   of the person, the proverbial three score and ten. But a person\u2019s life   is more than that, because it follows a natural progression of   life-stages, from childhood to adolescence to middle age to senescence.   And it\u2019s even more still, since it is partly the creation of the person   living it, who can plan it, evaluate it, anticipate its future, and   remember its past. We explore these and other aspects of a person\u2019s life   through works of literature and philosophy. What makes you the same   person throughout the different stages of your life? How does the   passage of time color your perception of life? What makes for a good   life? A meaningful life? Should you be grateful for having been born, or   dismayed at having to die?

SPRING 2015 CORE-UA 400, Texts and Ideas: Topics\u2014Technologies of the Universe Prof. Weatherby (German)  syllabus The human is the \"tool-making animal,\" as Karl Marx wrote, quoting Benjamin Franklin. Marx's writing partner Friedrich Engels would make this the center of his philosophy, declaring the invention of tools and the work they do as the evolutionary force that led to the separation between the ape and the human. But if human activity is \"technological\" by nature, it is in nature itself that tools arise; then how does human time fit into geological time, how does the cosmos come to include the \"tool-making animal,\" and who remakes that cosmos? In an age sometimes now called the \"anthropocene,\" the questions of the cosmos and the tool are increasingly intertwined. Beginning with cosmogonies in the ancient world (Gilgamesh, Hebrew Bible, Hesiod, Plato), we track the shifts that led to the modern scientific conception of the universe (Aristotle, Copernicus, Helmholtz, Einstein). We then explore problems that the ubiquity of technological objects raises\u2014artificial life (Leibniz, Hoffmann, Lem), entropy (Kelvin, Wiener), computing (Babbage, Turing, von Neumann)\u2014compare Carl Sagan's Cosmos with its ongoing update by Neil deGrasse Tyson, and visit the Hayden Planetarium. SPRING 2015 CORE-UA 402, Texts &amp; Ideas: Antiquity and the Renaissanc e Prof. Sider (Classics)  syllabus The West began with Greece, moved to Rome, and the incorporated Judeo-Christian values during the Middle Ages. The Renaissance, looking back to the Greeks for re-inspiration, gave near final shape to our ideas of Western culture. Since this series of movements and influences is not chronological, neither shall we read our text in chronological order. Instead, we will take our rubric seriously and look for a few \"conversations\" between and among writers from all our areas: Hesiod and Genesis; Homer and Vergil; Aristophanes and Rabelais; Song of Songs, Sappho, and Marguerite de Navarre; Thucydides and Machiavelli; Catullus and Petrarch; Ovid and Shakespeare; Euripides, Plato, and a Gospel SPRING 2015 CORE-UA 403, Texts &amp; Ideas: Antiquity and the Enlightenment Prof. Deneys (French)  syllabus The Enlightenment was a Europe-wide movement, which concerned all aspects of culture of the time: philosophy and literature, the arts (painting, music, architecture), as well as politics and society as a whole.
