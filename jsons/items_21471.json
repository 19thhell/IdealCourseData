Our 'Welcome' programs occur at the start of both the Fall and Spring semesters and are intended for new first year and transfer students, as well as students visiting NYU Washington Square. Our visiting or 'transitioning' population, includes (but is not limited to) participants in Fall and/or Spring in New York, Paths to Peace, Spring at Tisch, Global Liberal Studies students and NYU Abu Dhabi students who may be studying at Washington Square for a semester.   At the start of the Fall semester, we invite students new to NYU Washington Square to join us for Fall Welcome Week; in the Spring, we offer Spring at the Square. Both Welcome Week and Spring at the Square are designed to help you in your transition by complementing any required school or program orientations, advising sessions or other activities.

Our 'Welcome' programs occur at the start of both the Fall and Spring semesters and are intended for new first year and transfer students, as well as students visiting NYU Washington Square. Our visiting or 'transitioning' population, includes (but is not limited to) participants in Fall and/or Spring in New York, Paths to Peace, Spring at Tisch, Global Liberal Studies students and NYU Abu Dhabi students who may be studying at Washington Square for a semester.   At the start of the Fall semester, we invite students new to NYU Washington Square to join us for Fall Welcome Week; in the Spring, we offer Spring at the Square. Both Welcome Week and Spring at the Square are designed to help you in your transition by complementing any required school or program orientations, advising sessions or other activities.
