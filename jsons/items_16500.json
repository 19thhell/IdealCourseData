Wednesday, April 16, 2008   Earth Matters Supports Upholding NYU's Ban on Coca-Cola   The NYU Senate is considering lifting a 2005 ban that prohibited the sale of Coca-Cola products on NYU's campus. This was ban was put in place after Coke refused to have an independent investigation of the assassination of eight union leaders in a Colombia Coca-Cola plant. Supporters of lifting the ban are citing a report conducted by the International Labor Organization to say that Coke has met the demands of the ban. Earth Matters, along with Students Creating Radical Change, OXFAM, the Law Students for Economic Justice, and Take Back NYU!, does not believe that the ILO report fulfills the ban's requirements for the following reasons:   - The ILO report was not independent. Ed Potter, Coca-Colas Director of Global Relations, has been the International Business Spokesperson of the ILO for the last fifteen years and was the driving force behind Coca-Colas selection of the ILO to conduct this investigation.   - The ILO is not a monitoring organization, does not conduct human rights investigations of individual companies, and is not qualified to do so.   - This ILO mission did not set out to conduct the investigation that NYUs ban requires. The ILO mission explicitly sought only to do an assessment of current conditions, not an investigation of human rights violations.   - Despite the ILO reports probable bias and problematic methodology, it actually finds that Coca-Colas labor rights violations (namely, the tactics used to prevent union organizing and infringement on the freedom to associate) still exist.   - This report does not address the human rights abuses, ties to paramilitaries, or assassinations of union leaders that occurred to inspire the ban by NYU and other universities. In fact, nowhere does the ILO report even mention the words human rights or assassinations.   - For access to the highlights of the ILO report, please visit The PDF file   We hope that our Earth Matters members will support the position we have decided to take to keep the ban of Coca-Cola on campus in place.

Friday, November 16, 2007  A new meaning to \"guilt-free\" potato chips Here's a fun story for today: Frito-Lay is embarking on an ambitious plan to change the way its factories operate. Its goal is to take one of its Arizona plants off the power grid, or nearly so, and run it almost entirely on renewable fuels and recycled water. See the New York Times article on what Frito-Lay and some other companies are doing to enhance their \"green\" image. The calories probably still count, though.

Tuesday, November 6, 2007  Rainforest Agribusiness Campaign  Rainforest Action Network recently officially launched its Rainforest Agribusiness Campaign targeting U.S. Agribusiness giants ADM, Bunge, and Cargill.

Thursday, September 13, 2007  Court rules against automakers in emissions case On Wednesday, a federal judge in Vermont rejected automakers' challenges to a series of rules passed in California and 13 other states (including Vermont, Connecticut, New Jersey, and New York) that intend to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from cars and light trucks. This ruling was a victory over automakers, and will hopefully embolden Califoria and other states to continue efforts to mitigate climate change, even if (and precisely because) our national government won't.

Although energy markets are clearly dynamic - witness the lowest oil prices in years, we are still at energy crossroads in terms of our ability to change how we produce and consume energy. The road to Paris 2015, the potential decoupling of energy consumption and economic growth among industrialized countries, and the China/US agreement, the global growth of solar suggest start of fundamental changes in our energy paradigm. Icons of the 21st century like Apple and Google have invested in renewable energy.

Wednesday, April 16, 2008   Earth Matters Supports Upholding NYU's Ban on Coca-Cola   The NYU Senate is considering lifting a 2005 ban that prohibited the sale of Coca-Cola products on NYU's campus. This was ban was put in place after Coke refused to have an independent investigation of the assassination of eight union leaders in a Colombia Coca-Cola plant. Supporters of lifting the ban are citing a report conducted by the International Labor Organization to say that Coke has met the demands of the ban. Earth Matters, along with Students Creating Radical Change, OXFAM, the Law Students for Economic Justice, and Take Back NYU!, does not believe that the ILO report fulfills the ban's requirements for the following reasons:   - The ILO report was not independent. Ed Potter, Coca-Colas Director of Global Relations, has been the International Business Spokesperson of the ILO for the last fifteen years and was the driving force behind Coca-Colas selection of the ILO to conduct this investigation.   - The ILO is not a monitoring organization, does not conduct human rights investigations of individual companies, and is not qualified to do so.   - This ILO mission did not set out to conduct the investigation that NYUs ban requires. The ILO mission explicitly sought only to do an assessment of current conditions, not an investigation of human rights violations.   - Despite the ILO reports probable bias and problematic methodology, it actually finds that Coca-Colas labor rights violations (namely, the tactics used to prevent union organizing and infringement on the freedom to associate) still exist.   - This report does not address the human rights abuses, ties to paramilitaries, or assassinations of union leaders that occurred to inspire the ban by NYU and other universities. In fact, nowhere does the ILO report even mention the words human rights or assassinations.   - For access to the highlights of the ILO report, please visit The PDF file   We hope that our Earth Matters members will support the position we have decided to take to keep the ban of Coca-Cola on campus in place.

Friday, November 16, 2007  A new meaning to \"guilt-free\" potato chips Here's a fun story for today: Frito-Lay is embarking on an ambitious plan to change the way its factories operate. Its goal is to take one of its Arizona plants off the power grid, or nearly so, and run it almost entirely on renewable fuels and recycled water. See the New York Times article on what Frito-Lay and some other companies are doing to enhance their \"green\" image. The calories probably still count, though.

Thursday, September 13, 2007  Court rules against automakers in emissions case On Wednesday, a federal judge in Vermont rejected automakers' challenges to a series of rules passed in California and 13 other states (including Vermont, Connecticut, New Jersey, and New York) that intend to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from cars and light trucks. This ruling was a victory over automakers, and will hopefully embolden Califoria and other states to continue efforts to mitigate climate change, even if (and precisely because) our national government won't. Thursday, September 13, 2007  EM starts the year off right! Our first meeting was this past Monday, and boy was it a success! Click this link for more details!

Environment affords an outstanding opportunity for making connections among fundamental scientific and engineering concepts, economic and sociological forces, and literary and artistic endeavors. This inherently interdisciplinary subject intimately connects to our existence and is especially relevant in Abu Dhabi, which has made a major commitment to environmental sustainability. The concentration is designed to integrate the fundamental sciences, including biology, chemistry, computer science, mathematics, and physics, with economics and the arts to provide an understanding of the Earth System and the current and future challenges imposed on it as the human population grows.   The curriculum emphasizes both quantitative reasoning and descriptive analysis in courses that emphasize science, economics, social concerns, the humanities, and arts as a means to identify, explore, and solve fundamental problems and issues of environmental concern. Whenever possible, the courses utilize the local Abu Dhabi environment as a natural laboratory and studio for field trips and consider relevant local phenomena and issues. Students have the opportunity to integrate their understanding of the environment into a broader scientific, social, economic, and artistic framework through a senior Capstone project .                             Requirements   The multidisciplinary concentration in the Environment requires four courses. In order to develop an interdisciplinary understanding of environmental concerns, students must take at least one course in each of the following areas:     Environmental Science   Environmental Policy   Environment, Culture, and Society                           The Environment Courses                        To refine course list, add or remove filter options and press \"Submit\".

Issues such as energy consumption, CO2 emissions, climate change, food production, water, and material fluxes are intricately tied together as a global system. The economic trend of this system can be used to project a world in 2050 in which the world&#39;s lifestyle will be approximately equal to that of many developed nations today. Will this projected state of the world be possible, given the environmental issues above? Investigating this topic in Sydney gives us perspective from a developed nation with unique climate, resources, and world famous biodiversity. Substantial portions of this inquiry-based seminar require students to compare environmental issues in Australia to those in their home nations, other developed regions, and the world, in order to look at how conditions and solutions in Australia might be generally applicable to shared challenges.

COREI-AD 16 Where the City Meets the Sea: Studies in Coastal Urban Environments                                                                              Over half of the human population lives within 100km of a coast and coastlines contain more than two-thirds of the worlds largest cities. As a result, the world&#39;s natural coastal environments have been substantially modified to suit human needs. This course uses the built and natural environments of coastal cities as laboratories to explain the environmental and ecological implications of urban development in coastal areas. Using data from multiple coastal cities, student teams use field-based studies and Geographic Information System (GIS) data to examine patterns and processes operating in coastal cities. This course uses the local terrestrial marine, and built environments as a laboratory to address these issues, and team projects requiring field work form a core component of the learning experience. As part of the NYU Global Network University initiative this course is being offered simultaneously in several NYU sites globaly and students are collaborating extensively with students from their sister campuses through the duration of this course.    *All COREI-EDNW courses are replaced with COREX.

These four examples offer excellent learning templates for exploring public health because of their diversity: one has ended (smallpox), one is current near eradication (polio), one is an infectious disease for which no vaccine exists (AIDS) and one is a fully preventable human-manufactured epidemic (tobacco). The course will include a mix of lecture, class exercises, the role of games in health education, CSI-like investigation approaches, guest lectures and site visits based in Washington, DC. Students become familiar with how an epidemic emerges, steps taken to measure an epidemic&#39;s scope and distribution, how epidemiologists-the detectives of public health-go about determining the source of an epidemic, the role research plays in answering questions with respect to source and cure, how public health leaders work to arrest an epidemic and the interplay between society, culture, politics and health.    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

When and where did these, and other pressing environmental concerns, have their origins? What can history teach us about how we might best address these issues in the present? This course offers a comprehensive overview of the world&rsquo;s environmental history with a focus on the period from 1500 C.E. to the present &ndash; a time marked by a dramatic intensification in the use of land, water, and energy resources. The course&rsquo;s central goal is to understand the relationships between globalization, natural resource and energy use, and environmental change, and to explain how these relationships unfolded, and continue to unfold, differently in major world regions, including the Gulf. By incorporating material from the fields of ecology, biology, geology, demography, economics, political science, and anthropology, this course also provides students with important historical grounding in the multidisciplinary field of global environmental studies.

The goal of the course is to identify the best ways of asking and answering questions about the widespread environmental challenges that are seemingly inherent in China&rsquo;s economic development. Are the challenges new to Chinese history &ndash; particular to modernization &ndash; or are they rooted in long-standing patterns of land use and resource exploitation? How to do we square the history of damage wrought to nature with the equally salient history of &ldquo;Asian&rdquo; notions of &ldquo;living in harmony&rdquo; with nature, exemplified by philosophical Daoism and millennia of poetic and painting traditions extolling the beauty and wonder of nature? Who, moreover, is entitled to do what with and about the environment: what are the roles of the state?; of scientists and engineers?; of humanists? The course doubles as an introduction to the history of China, and to the multidisciplinary field of environmental studies.

In response, governments are increasingly turning to renewables and high tech to diversify their energy mix and to reduce reliance on fossil fuels in order to stimulate stagnant economies and create new jobs. Ironically, the transition to a low fossil fuel economy through the use of RES and high tech applications has led to the creation of new global race over limited resources, such as rare earths, and this competition has already given rise to a series of fresh global political and economic realities, tensions, and disputes. We will examine how major industrial powers are approaching the asymmetric threat of climate change; the nature of contemporary resource competition; the way policy decisions are influenced by political rhetoric and public opinion; and the overall economic and political impact of climate change on international relations.

POLSC-AD 184 UN: Negotiation towards A New Binding &amp; Universal Agreement on Climate Change in Paris in Dec 2015                                                                   The United Nations (UN) provides the forum where states come together to discuss mutual problems. In our rapidly globalized world, the enormous and complex challenges to humankind are making UN indispensable. This course will provide an overview of the various UN departments and programs encompassed within it and treaty negotiation process. The main concentration of this course will remain climate change negotiations. We will take climate change as a case study and consider many aspects of international policy response to this environmental and social crisis. The purpose of this course is to provide students with a general understanding of how climate change issues have been addressed at the UN. The class will be invited to study ongoing process of the new climate change agreement, which will be adopted in Paris in December 2015, at the 21st Conference of the Parties (COP21). The meeting will mark a decisive stage in negotiations on the future international agreement on a post-2020 regime. The course will closely investigate the pertinent challenges currently facing diplomats and international decision makers in making progress with what is currently on the negotiating table. We will try to seek the answer of the following questions: Will all the nations of the world, including the biggest emitters of greenhouse gases, be bound by a universal agreement on climate change for the first time in over 20 years of UN negotiations? Will it take the form of a protocol, another legal instrument or &#39;an agreed outcome with legal force&#39;, and will it be applicable to all Parties including US and China? In a treaty negotiation simulation, the students will play the roles of major green house gas emitting nations and will negotiate proposals to reduce emissions. The in-class negotiation exercise will be modeled on the real negotiations under the UNFCCC.

SRPP-AD 142 Renewable Energy Law and Policy                                                                              Energy&rsquo;s role in global climate change is increasing its importance. This course focuses on two major and interrelated themes: climate change and energy. The class will look at implications of new climate change and renewable energy mandates for the electric power sector. Energy is considered a prerequisite for economic growth and poverty alleviation. Electricity demand almost doubled from 1990 to 2011, and is projected to grow 81% from 2011 to 2035 in the existing policies scenario. Over 70% of the increased energy demand is from developing countries. At this time some two billion people (one third of world&rsquo;s population) have no access to electricity. Population growth (United Nations predicts world population growth from 6.7 billion in 2011 to 8.7 billion by 2035) and increasing standards of living (the UN Population Division projects 70 % people will be living in urban areas by 2050) for many people in developing countries will cause enormous growth in energy demand. Many poorer countries lack this essential capacity. Meeting the energy needs of developing countries without compromising the environment is a challenge. Advancement of innovative energy solutions and implementation of smart policies to make the transition to clean energy in ways that fulfill growing needs and improve economy without hurting environment is very much needed. This introductory level course on renewable energy examines the historical and legal origins of energy regulations and emerging policies. The course provides an introduction to the renewable sources and basic terms and concepts, regulatory trends and other emerging issues. The primary focus of the course will be on renewable energy policies and laws of the developing countries. We will spend considerable time with Africa, Small Island States, United Arab Emirates (UAE), and examples from other countries. The centerpiece of this course is to focus on a specific renewable energy project (in a developing country) completed with international cooperation and assistance. The course will also focus on global institutions and policymaking, the divide between industrialized countries and developing countries, the nexus between global climate change and renewable energy, sustainable energy sources, and challenges that global policymakers will face in future. The course will look at the wide variety of local and regional laws, regulatory techniques, and policy objects. The class will embark on a week- long trip to a developing country to study renewable energy project and to get hands-on experience of power generation from a renewable energy facility.    * Note: This course will be counted towards a Political Science elective (International Politics) only for Spring 2015.

This course introduces students to the main concepts of the public health field and the critical links between global health and social and economic development. Lectures explore major themes in global health, including the social determinants of health, the global distribution of disease burden and risk factors, key measures to address the disease burden in cost-effective ways, and the role of health systems and diverse global actors in responding to the health needs of populations worldwide. The course is global in coverage, but with a focus on low- and middle-income countries and on the health of the poor.
