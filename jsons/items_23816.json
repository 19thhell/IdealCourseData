To apply for admission to the MA program, you should hold a Bachelor\u2019s degree (or its equivalent). All applicants must submit the GSAS application , three academic letters of recommendation, academic transcripts, a statement of purpose, a writing sample, GRE scores and, for non-native speakers of English, results from the TOEFL. The Graduate School requests that all materials be submitted via the online Embark application system.       Guideline Requirements   Please Note: Failure to meet these requirements does not preclude admission to the program, however, given the very competitive nature of the IR program these are suggested minimum targets for applicants.               GRE Verbal Reasoning Score    160-165          GRE Quantitative Reasoning Score    150-155          GRE Analytical Writing Score (including non-native speakers)    5          US Undergraduate GPA (4 point scale)    3.5          UK Degree Classification    2:1          German BA    Sehr Gut          France Licence (from 2009 on)    14          China \u5b66\u58eb\u5b66\u4f4d    85%          Denmark BA    10          South Africa BA (Hons)    2:1 (70-74)          Jordan BA    3.0          Australia    2(a), 2(i), 2(b), 2(ii)            When is the application deadline?    The deadline for Fall 2015 admission was January 4, 2015. Late applications for Fall 2015 admission are still being considered. Please apply here .    Do you have a minimum GPA requirement?    No. Many schools do not calculate GPAs and when they do, various methods are used. Although we expect students to have a 3.5 GPA, we do not impose it as a set minimum . However, our applicant pool is academically strong and very competitive.     Do you have a minimum GRE score?    No, though again, our applicant pool is generally very strong (see guidelines above).    Can the GRE requirement be waived?    No. The GRE is required for all students and will not be waived.    Can the TOEFL be waived for international students?    The Graduate School requires applicants who are not native English speakers to submit official TOEFL score reports. The TOEFL requirement is waived if your baccalaureate or Master\u2019s degree was (or will be) completed at an institution where the language of instruction is English.    Can I submit IELTS scores instead of TOEFL scores?    No.    Can my GRE or TOEFL scores arrive after the application deadline?    Yes, but all scores must be received by February. The MA Admissions Committee may choose not to review incomplete applications.    If I am unable to submit some of my application materials online, where should I send them?    Any materials that are not submitted online should be sent to NYU GSAS Enrollment Services. Complete contact information for GSAS Enrollment Services can be found on the Application Resource Center . You do not need to mail paper copies of any materials that you submitted online.    Do I need to have a Bachelor's degree be in Political Science in order to apply?    No, though applicants are expected to have had sufficient exposure to the field for them to develop a clear statement of purpose for attending our MA program.    How important are letters of recommendation?    Letters of recommendation are very important to us. You should choose individuals who are best able to evaluate your past performance, your abilities and skills to undertake this course of study. Choose references that are in the best position to give the admissions committee relevant information.    Must all my letters of recommendation be written by professors?    The Graduate School requires that at least one letter be from an academic. Usually, but not always, the best people to get these letters from are academics. However, if you have been out of school for a number of years, you may want letters from non-academics, but please remember that they are not always in a good position to tell the MA Admissions Committee what we need to know.    What must I include in my statement of purpose?    Please describe briefly and concisely your past and present work as it relates to your intended field of study, your educational objectives at NYU, and your career plans. In addition please include your reasons for choosing your field of study. The statement should be concisely written and should not exceed one to two double spaced pages.    Do you require a Writing Sample?    Yes, a writing sample is required. It can be a paper for an undergraduate class or a publication. It should demonstrate your ability to analyze a topic insightfully and must be written in English. The writing sample should not exceed 3000 words and it should be double spaced. A good paper will improve the chances of admission, while those that lack insight or that are poorly written can be quite damaging.    What is the typical amount of time it takes to complete the MA degree?    The program is structured so that most students finish in four semesters. It is possible to finish in three semesters, but this is a very intensive route. Per GSAS policy, students must complete the degree in five years from the semester of first enrollment.     Can the Master's program be done on a part-time basis?    Yes, the Master's program in International Relations can be completed on a part-time basis. Part-time students usually take one to two courses a semester and finish in two to three years.    How can the language requirement be satisfied?    Students must demonstrate proficiency in a language other than English at the intermediate level. This may be demonstrated by taking the GSAS Foreign Language Proficiency Exam, offered every year in March, August, and November, or by receiving a grade of B or better in an upper intermediate-level language course taken at the university level. Students who are native speakers of languages other than English or who have conducted significant field research in another language may be waived from the language requirement.    Are applicants expected to have taken coursework in mathematics and statistics?    No, applicants are not required to have taken courses in quantitative methods. The program offers introductory courses in quantitative methods for first-year students with little or prior experience. Students may also pursue advanced courses in quantitative methods offered by the program as well as by the Department of Economics and the Stern School of Business.    What is the cost of attendance?    For current tuition rates and fees please visit the New York University Bursar's Office webpage, available here . The Office of Financial Aid also calculates an estimated cost of attendance, including living expenses. The estimated costs for 2014-15 are available here .     What kind of financial aid is available to Master's students?    The program is not able to provide financial aid to Master\u2019s students, but many students obtain funding from external sources. For more information, visit the GSAS Financial Aid page. Students receiving external funding may be eligible for the Graduate School of Arts and Science\u2019s Tuition Incentive Program (TIP). In this program, students receiving external awards of $13,000 or more from recognized, academic sources of funding outside of the University can apply for matching tuition points up to the amount of their outside award. Students receiving external awards of less than $13,000 may apply for matching tuition points up to 50 percent of the amount of the external award. For a list of some third party scholarships and fellowships, visit our External Funding Opportunities page.    May I sit in on a class?    To arrange a visit to one of our MA program classes, please write to ir.masters@nyu.edu .    I would like to apply as a non-degree student. Is that possible?    Yes. Applicants may apply as non-degree students, but they still must meet all the admissions requirements and deadlines set for applicants pursuing a degree. If you have additional questions about applying as a non-degree student, please contact ir.masters@nyu.edu .    May I defer my admission to the program?    Deferrals are reviewed on a case-by-case basis and must be approved by the MA Program Director and the Graduate School of Arts and Science. Deferrals will not be granted for longer than one academic year.    Can I transfer credits from another institution?    Admitted students can transfer up to 9 credits into the Master\u2019s program. Eligible courses must have received a grade of \"B\" or better and must be relevant to International Relations. Only courses for which a degree has not already been awarded may be applied to the MA in International Relations. Transferred courses cannot substitute for IR core courses.

CEP classes meet Monday through Thursday for about five hours of class each day.   At the beginning levels (Intro\u20132), all classes are taught as integrated language skills classes designed to provide a comprehensive English learning experience.   At the intermediate levels (3\u20136), instruction consists of two morning comprehensive core classes and two afternoon English enrichment and engagement classes. Both core courses integrate all English skills. At these levels, students select two types of afternoon enrichment and engagement classes. One offers focused practice on a specific language or academic skill, such as pronunciation, vocabulary development, and TOEFL prep. The other invites students to explore a topic of interest and to develop their linguistic and cultural fluency and confidence through engaging in the real use of English. Topics include American film, history of New York City, art appreciation and business English.   At advanced levels (7-9), students complete their schedules with ALI electives, ALI advanced evening courses for specific purposes, or NYU School of Professional Studies noncredit classes.

To apply for admission to the MA program, you should hold a Bachelor\u2019s degree (or its equivalent). All applicants must submit the GSAS application , three academic letters of recommendation, academic transcripts, a statement of purpose, a writing sample, GRE scores and, for non-native speakers of English, results from the TOEFL. The Graduate School requests that all materials be submitted via the online Embark application system.       Guideline Requirements   Please Note: Failure to meet these requirements does not preclude admission to the program, however, given the very competitive nature of the IR program these are suggested minimum targets for applicants.               GRE Verbal Reasoning Score    160-165          GRE Quantitative Reasoning Score    150-155          GRE Analytical Writing Score (including non-native speakers)    5          US Undergraduate GPA (4 point scale)    3.5          UK Degree Classification    2:1          German BA    Sehr Gut          France Licence (from 2009 on)    14          China \u5b66\u58eb\u5b66\u4f4d    85%          Denmark BA    10          South Africa BA (Hons)    2:1 (70-74)          Jordan BA    3.0          Australia    2(a), 2(i), 2(b), 2(ii)            When is the application deadline?    The deadline for Fall 2015 admission was January 4, 2015. Late applications for Fall 2015 admission are still being considered. Please apply here .    Do you have a minimum GPA requirement?    No. Many schools do not calculate GPAs and when they do, various methods are used. Although we expect students to have a 3.5 GPA, we do not impose it as a set minimum . However, our applicant pool is academically strong and very competitive.     Do you have a minimum GRE score?    No, though again, our applicant pool is generally very strong (see guidelines above).    Can the GRE requirement be waived?    No. The GRE is required for all students and will not be waived.    Can the TOEFL be waived for international students?    The Graduate School requires applicants who are not native English speakers to submit official TOEFL score reports. The TOEFL requirement is waived if your baccalaureate or Master\u2019s degree was (or will be) completed at an institution where the language of instruction is English.    Can I submit IELTS scores instead of TOEFL scores?    No.    Can my GRE or TOEFL scores arrive after the application deadline?    Yes, but all scores must be received by February. The MA Admissions Committee may choose not to review incomplete applications.    If I am unable to submit some of my application materials online, where should I send them?    Any materials that are not submitted online should be sent to NYU GSAS Enrollment Services. Complete contact information for GSAS Enrollment Services can be found on the Application Resource Center . You do not need to mail paper copies of any materials that you submitted online.    Do I need to have a Bachelor's degree be in Political Science in order to apply?    No, though applicants are expected to have had sufficient exposure to the field for them to develop a clear statement of purpose for attending our MA program.    How important are letters of recommendation?    Letters of recommendation are very important to us. You should choose individuals who are best able to evaluate your past performance, your abilities and skills to undertake this course of study. Choose references that are in the best position to give the admissions committee relevant information.    Must all my letters of recommendation be written by professors?    The Graduate School requires that at least one letter be from an academic. Usually, but not always, the best people to get these letters from are academics. However, if you have been out of school for a number of years, you may want letters from non-academics, but please remember that they are not always in a good position to tell the MA Admissions Committee what we need to know.    What must I include in my statement of purpose?    Please describe briefly and concisely your past and present work as it relates to your intended field of study, your educational objectives at NYU, and your career plans. In addition please include your reasons for choosing your field of study. The statement should be concisely written and should not exceed one to two double spaced pages.    Do you require a Writing Sample?    Yes, a writing sample is required. It can be a paper for an undergraduate class or a publication. It should demonstrate your ability to analyze a topic insightfully and must be written in English. The writing sample should not exceed 3000 words and it should be double spaced. A good paper will improve the chances of admission, while those that lack insight or that are poorly written can be quite damaging.    What is the typical amount of time it takes to complete the MA degree?    The program is structured so that most students finish in four semesters. It is possible to finish in three semesters, but this is a very intensive route. Per GSAS policy, students must complete the degree in five years from the semester of first enrollment.     Can the Master's program be done on a part-time basis?    Yes, the Master's program in International Relations can be completed on a part-time basis. Part-time students usually take one to two courses a semester and finish in two to three years.    How can the language requirement be satisfied?    Students must demonstrate proficiency in a language other than English at the intermediate level. This may be demonstrated by taking the GSAS Foreign Language Proficiency Exam, offered every year in March, August, and November, or by receiving a grade of B or better in an upper intermediate-level language course taken at the university level. Students who are native speakers of languages other than English or who have conducted significant field research in another language may be waived from the language requirement.    Are applicants expected to have taken coursework in mathematics and statistics?    No, applicants are not required to have taken courses in quantitative methods. The program offers introductory courses in quantitative methods for first-year students with little or prior experience. Students may also pursue advanced courses in quantitative methods offered by the program as well as by the Department of Economics and the Stern School of Business.    What is the cost of attendance?    For current tuition rates and fees please visit the New York University Bursar's Office webpage, available here . The Office of Financial Aid also calculates an estimated cost of attendance, including living expenses. The estimated costs for 2014-15 are available here .     What kind of financial aid is available to Master's students?    The program is not able to provide financial aid to Master\u2019s students, but many students obtain funding from external sources. For more information, visit the GSAS Financial Aid page. Students receiving external funding may be eligible for the Graduate School of Arts and Science\u2019s Tuition Incentive Program (TIP). In this program, students receiving external awards of $13,000 or more from recognized, academic sources of funding outside of the University can apply for matching tuition points up to the amount of their outside award. Students receiving external awards of less than $13,000 may apply for matching tuition points up to 50 percent of the amount of the external award. For a list of some third party scholarships and fellowships, visit our External Funding Opportunities page.    May I sit in on a class?    To arrange a visit to one of our MA program classes, please write to ir.masters@nyu.edu .    I would like to apply as a non-degree student. Is that possible?    Yes. Applicants may apply as non-degree students, but they still must meet all the admissions requirements and deadlines set for applicants pursuing a degree. If you have additional questions about applying as a non-degree student, please contact ir.masters@nyu.edu .    May I defer my admission to the program?    Deferrals are reviewed on a case-by-case basis and must be approved by the MA Program Director and the Graduate School of Arts and Science. Deferrals will not be granted for longer than one academic year.    Can I transfer credits from another institution?    Admitted students can transfer up to 9 credits into the Master\u2019s program. Eligible courses must have received a grade of \"B\" or better and must be relevant to International Relations. Only courses for which a degree has not already been awarded may be applied to the MA in International Relations. Transferred courses cannot substitute for IR core courses.
