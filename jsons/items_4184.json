At the end of the course, students will complete their own wiki page on the (approved) topic of their choice. In addition, an email project with Japanese college students is scheduled. This project will have students exchange emails in both Japanese and English with their counterpart(s) in Japan in order to have better understanding of the languages and cultures through authentic communication.

The test is offered in more than 50 languages and can be used by universities to grant academic credit or to grant you advanced placement in your language of study. The test also may be used for professional purposes, such as teacher certification or to establish linguistic competence for business objectives.   Tests are given by appointment on the NYU campus or at off-site locations in the United States and abroad. New York City residents must take the test at NYU. Exceptions are considered on a case-by-case basis.

For EAS majors/minors, if you have taken the placement exam with the department or with CAS Academic Affairs in the past and need a reassessment due to recent non-NYU language study, please contact the Language Coordinator with the course materials from your non-NYU program. No reassessments will be made otherwise; students must enroll in the course they were placed into. Students should consult the instructor of the course after the first day of classes if they feel the course is not their ideal level.   Please read through the information below in its entirety, and refer to the CAS Placement Examinations webpage for more information.        I.
