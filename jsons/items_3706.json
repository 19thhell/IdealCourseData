However, by performing the assigned experiments and (next semester) designing a few of your own, you will observe the phenomena that led to some of those discoveries. Hopefully, this will help you to understand the chemistry, as it did the original researchers.    Many of the experiments will involve the use of computer interfaced instruments. We have recently renovated our general chemistry laboratories and we have installed the computer equipment in order to shift the emphasis of the course from procedure to analysis. You will still need to learn good technique. You will still work with chemicals and laboratory apparatus. The computers will simply record data and allow you to examine it in ways that would be difficult or impossible with conventional methods. We hope that the new equipment will allow you to learn chemistry more effectively.    You must realize however that the experiments were not written with computer interfaced instrumentation in mind, so we have to modify the procedures.

In turn, we ask that you come to the lab prepared, and that you remain alert for announcements of changes. Your feedback about the course, and especially about the advantages and disadvantages of the new equipment, will be welcomed and appreciated.    Lectures: The lecture is intended to provide you with information that is not covered sufficiently in the experiment description. This includes background material on the experiment, details of the procedure and any planned changes, instructions for carrying out calculations, and any suggestions or hints that will help you to obtain good results. It is an important part of the course. Attendance will not be taken, and there will be no quiz given in lecture. You must attend lecture, however, if you want to obtain the information that you'll need to perform well in the laboratory. We and the TAs will not feel compelled to repeat information that has been presented in lecture. We will usually give at least one piece of information that will appear on the laboratory quiz but which is not given in the experiment write-up .    Laboratories: Attached is a schedule of the experiments to be performed during each laboratory session. You are expected to carefully read the write-up for the experiment before you enter the laboratory. Each experiment has a written pre-laboratory assignment, which must be turned in as you enter the lab. The completed pre-laboratory assignment is your entry ticket. A TA will collect it as you enter and will not let you enter without it. Next, a short quiz will be given at the start of each laboratory session (arrive on time!). If you have prepared enough to do the pre-lab, you should be ready for the quiz.    During the experiment, feel free to ask (reasonable) questions. The lab is a learning experience, not a test. We want you to know the answers when you  exit the lab. If you know them all when you enter, you gain nothing. It is probably best to ask a TA your question since your classmates are no more experienced than you.    Whenever we use the computers, you (or your partner) will have to &quot;sign-out&quot; any probes (pH, thermistor) that will be needed. You (or your partner) will have to leave your NYU ID card as collateral for this equipment. At the end of the lab period, you can obtain your ID card by returning the borrowed equipment in good condition. These are expensive  items; use them as instructed and take care of them. You are responsible for them.   Since there are half as many computers as there are students, you will work with a lab partner throughout the term. The choice of a lab partner is up to the TAs. When they assign you to a lab station at Check-In , you will share a quadrant of a lab bench with another student. That is your partner. Learn to cooperate and help each other.    THERE WILL BE NO MAKEUP LABS. If you are too ill to work, see a doctor or go to NYU Health Services and bring us documentation that will verify your illness. The documentation must be on a physician's stationery and we may call for verification. Excused labs will not count when we evaluate your grade.    If you are injured in the laboratory, report it to a TA immediately, no matter how trivial you feel the injury to be. They will escort you to the Health Services. You will be excused from any work that you miss. The presence of toxic substances makes it necessary to get medical attention for even a small scrape or burn. Cooperate with the TAs in this since it is for your benefit.    SAFETY IS OF PARAMOUNT IMPORTANCE IN THE LABORATORY. If you do not follow the safety rules presented to you, you will be removed from the lab and you will lose credit for the experiment.    IF YOU DO ANY UNAUTHORIZED EXPERIMENTATION, YOU WILL RECEIVE A FAILING GRADE FOR THE COURSE!!!     Required Materials: You will need certain items for this course:       Safety goggles (available at the NYU Bookstore).        Rubber gloves (disposables are available at the NYU Bookstore; reusable rubber gloves can be purchase in supermarkets).        The experiment descriptions (available at the NYU Bookstore; MAKE SURE you buy the V25.0111 packet, NOT the V25.0103 packet).        A laboratory equipment breakage card (available in the chemistry stockroom during the first week, or from Mr. Ghali in Room 565 Brown thereafter).        At CHECK-IN you will be given a form that gives you permission to rent a hallway locker within the Main complex. You must rent a locker because you will not be allowed to bring books, bags, or coats into the laboratory after the first week. Rent the locker right away because they are reserved for our course for a limited amount of time. If you wait too long, youll end up with a locker in another building.       In an effort to minimize costs (think &quot;tuition&quot; ) and to reduce any environmental damage, all of us will make a concerted effort to avoid wasting laboratory materials and to dispose of all products properly. With this in mind you must observe the following rules in the lab:       When you obtain a reagent for use in an experiment, read the label on the bottle; make sure that the substance name, its chemical formula , and its concentration match those specified in the directions for the experiment.        Take only the amount that you need, but DO NOT RETURN any reagent to the bottle.        Dispose of all materials into the proper waste container (again, read the labels). NOTHING WILL GO INTO THE SINKS. RUBBER GLOVES, DISPOSABLE PIPETS , and (of course) BROKEN GLASS MUST be disposed of in the &quot;Broken Glass&quot; container (not the regular trash).     In an effort to minimize injuries, we are going to be fanatical about safety. You will be given a list of safety guidelines and you will be given a tour of the emergency equipment in the laboratory on your first day there. Take this information seriously. The chemistry lab can be a dangerous place if anyone ignores the safety rules. If you see someone acting in an unsafe manner, notify a TA. If you see an emergency situation, act promptly in the fashion that we describe during the safety tour. Information from the safety tour will be needed to answer questions from the first experiment (TECH380 - Safety Practices in the Chemistry Laboratory).    The most important of the safety rules is    WEAR SAFETY GOGGLES AT ALL TIMES IN THE LABORATORY     Failure to follow the rules will result in expulsion from the laboratory!     Miscellaneous: The rules listed above are necessary if you are to have a safe, educational, and productive experience this semester. It is hoped that you will also enjoy the course. We and the TAs will be glad to assist you and to answer reasonable questions. However, we will be busy so please don;t ask things that you can figure out by yourself (e.g., \"Is this green?\").    There will be another class (V25.0103) sharing the laboratory with you. Do not interfere with them, notify one of the TAs if they bother you, and make sure that the equipment and materials that you use are meant for your course .    Grading: Grades will be based upon the following scheme:    quizzes&#9;&#9;&#9;10%   pre-lab and lab report&#9;70%   final exam&#9;&#9;20%    Each experiment (pre-lab and lab report) is graded out of 100 points, of which 5 to 10 points are for &quot;effort and attitude&quot; as evaluated by the TAs.         last updated 4:24 pm, Wednesday, Dec. 6, 2000"}]},

It is probably best to ask a TA your question since your classmates are no more experienced than you.    Whenever we use the computers, you (or your partner) will have to &quot;sign-out&quot; any probes (pH, thermistor) that will be needed. You (or your partner) will have to leave your NYU ID card as collateral for this equipment. At the end of the lab period, you can obtain your ID card by returning the borrowed equipment in good condition. These are expensive  items; use them as instructed and take care of them. You are responsible for them.   Since there are half as many computers as there are students, you will work with a lab partner throughout the term. The choice of a lab partner is up to the TAs. When they assign you to a lab station at Check-In , you will share a quadrant of a lab bench with another student. That is your partner. Learn to cooperate and help each other.    THERE WILL BE NO MAKEUP LABS. If you are too ill to work, see a doctor or go to NYU Health Services and bring us documentation that will verify your illness. The documentation must be on a physician's stationery and we may call for verification. Excused labs will not count when we evaluate your grade.    If you are injured in the laboratory, report it to a TA immediately, no matter how trivial you feel the injury to be. They will escort you to the Health Services. You will be excused from any work that you miss. The presence of toxic substances makes it necessary to get medical attention for even a small scrape or burn. Cooperate with the TAs in this since it is for your benefit.    SAFETY IS OF PARAMOUNT IMPORTANCE IN THE LABORATORY. If you do not follow the safety rules presented to you, you will be removed from the lab and you will lose credit for the experiment.    IF YOU DO ANY UNAUTHORIZED EXPERIMENTATION, YOU WILL RECEIVE A FAILING GRADE FOR THE COURSE!!!     Required Materials: You will need certain items for this course:       Safety goggles (available at the NYU Bookstore).        Rubber gloves (disposables are available at the NYU Bookstore; reusable rubber gloves can be purchase in supermarkets).        The experiment descriptions (available at the NYU Bookstore; MAKE SURE you buy the V25.0111 packet, NOT the V25.0103 packet).        A laboratory equipment breakage card (available in the chemistry stockroom during the first week, or from Mr. Ghali in Room 565 Brown thereafter).        At CHECK-IN you will be given a form that gives you permission to rent a hallway locker within the Main complex. You must rent a locker because you will not be allowed to bring books, bags, or coats into the laboratory after the first week. Rent the locker right away because they are reserved for our course for a limited amount of time. If you wait too long, youll end up with a locker in another building.       In an effort to minimize costs (think &quot;tuition&quot; ) and to reduce any environmental damage, all of us will make a concerted effort to avoid wasting laboratory materials and to dispose of all products properly. With this in mind you must observe the following rules in the lab:       When you obtain a reagent for use in an experiment, read the label on the bottle; make sure that the substance name, its chemical formula , and its concentration match those specified in the directions for the experiment.        Take only the amount that you need, but DO NOT RETURN any reagent to the bottle.        Dispose of all materials into the proper waste container (again, read the labels). NOTHING WILL GO INTO THE SINKS. RUBBER GLOVES, DISPOSABLE PIPETS , and (of course) BROKEN GLASS MUST be disposed of in the &quot;Broken Glass&quot; container (not the regular trash).     In an effort to minimize injuries, we are going to be fanatical about safety. You will be given a list of safety guidelines and you will be given a tour of the emergency equipment in the laboratory on your first day there. Take this information seriously. The chemistry lab can be a dangerous place if anyone ignores the safety rules. If you see someone acting in an unsafe manner, notify a TA. If you see an emergency situation, act promptly in the fashion that we describe during the safety tour. Information from the safety tour will be needed to answer questions from the first experiment (TECH380 - Safety Practices in the Chemistry Laboratory).    The most important of the safety rules is    WEAR SAFETY GOGGLES AT ALL TIMES IN THE LABORATORY     Failure to follow the rules will result in expulsion from the laboratory!     Miscellaneous: The rules listed above are necessary if you are to have a safe, educational, and productive experience this semester. It is hoped that you will also enjoy the course. We and the TAs will be glad to assist you and to answer reasonable questions. However, we will be busy so please don;t ask things that you can figure out by yourself (e.g., \"Is this green?\").    There will be another class (V25.0103) sharing the laboratory with you. Do not interfere with them, notify one of the TAs if they bother you, and make sure that the equipment and materials that you use are meant for your course .    Grading: Grades will be based upon the following scheme:    quizzes&#9;&#9;&#9;10%   pre-lab and lab report&#9;70%   final exam&#9;&#9;20%    Each experiment (pre-lab and lab report) is graded out of 100 points, of which 5 to 10 points are for &quot;effort and attitude&quot; as evaluated by the TAs.         last updated 4:24 pm, Wednesday, Dec. 6, 2000"}, {"content": "NYU - Chemical
