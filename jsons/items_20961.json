As a \u201cprivate university in the public service,\u201d NYU Law\u2019s goal is for all graduates to incorporate public service into their careers. PILC not only coordinates and promotes the Law School\u2019s public interest and government service activities but also counsels students individually on their careers.   PILC offers a wide variety of funding opportunities and career planning programs to students and alumni, resulting in the most comprehensive public service infrastructure of any law school in the nation. The culture of public service is pervasive: about half of the first-year class spends the summer working in public interest internships and hundreds of students perform public service in student-run pro bono organizations.
