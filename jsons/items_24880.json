See this page for examples of non-business courses approved for the co-concentration.

Any 8 units (or more) of course work in a single foreign language will count as one of the two electives for the co-major/concentration. Note: Students may also take any 6-credit intensive language course (e.g. FREN-UA 10, Intensive Elementary French I) to satisfy this requirement.   Non-foreign Language  In general, a non-business elective is one that has some significant impact on business practices of the 21st century. The undergraduate faculty adviser evaluates courses for appropriateness. To request a course evaluation, the international business undergraduate adviser would need to receive the syllabus of the course, in-person or via e-mail, and a description of the request. Applicable courses may, but are not limited to, be offered through the College of Arts and Science , Wagner Graduate School of Public Service , and Tisch School of the Arts .     Examples of approved courses include    Modern South Africa and Ghana  Comparative Economic Systems  Cities in a Global Context  NYU in Florence\u2014Italian Politics  NYU in Prague\u2014Ownership and Corporate Control in Advanced and Transition Economies  Cross-Cultural Communication  Judaism, Christianity and Islam     Examples of un-approved courses include     La Belle Epoque  History of Rome  History of Ancient Egypt  NYU in London\u2014A History of London  NYU in Madrid\u2014Fascism                       Show all | Hide all                                                Meet with Your Adviser   To ensure proper concentration progress consult your Academic and Faculty Adviser .

Any 8 units (or more) of course work in a single foreign language will count as one of the two electives for the co-major/concentration. Note: Students may also take any 6-credit intensive language course (e.g. FREN-UA 10, Intensive Elementary French I) to satisfy this requirement.   Non-foreign Language  In general, a non-business elective is one that has some significant impact on business practices of the 21st century. The undergraduate faculty adviser evaluates courses for appropriateness. To request a course evaluation, the international business undergraduate adviser would need to receive the syllabus of the course, in-person or via e-mail, and a description of the request. Applicable courses may, but are not limited to, be offered through the College of Arts and Science , Wagner Graduate School of Public Service , and Tisch School of the Arts .
