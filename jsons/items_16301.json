pages, please contact: Mark J. Perez Certification Officer NYU Steinhardt 82 Washington Square East, Room 229 New York, New York 10003 (212) 998-5033 (212) 995-4353 fax    mark.perez@nyu.edu        Commitment to Education         The Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development was founded in 1890 as the School of Pedagogy. Since then, we have expanded into health, the arts, and media studies.     As varied and diverse as our programs have been throughout the years, there is one thing that has never changed: Our commitment to studying and preparing professionals for pre-K-12 and higher education.    Read More                        Frequently Asked Questions            1. What is the difference between the New York State Education Department (NYSED) and the New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE)?    The NYSED in Albany, NY is the state agency that issues your NYS teaching certificate which is required to work in public schools across NY State. The NYCDOE (formerly known as the NYC Board of Education) is your employer if you work for NYC Public Schools.    2. I am completing a Steinhardt certification program, must I apply for NYS certification or does it issue automatically?    You must apply for NYS certification, please see application instructions here    3. Must I also apply to the NYCDOE if I wish to work for NYC Public Schools? How can I show proof that I am enrolled in a teacher certification program?    Yes, please visit the TEACH NYC website here Speech and Language Disabilities or School Counseling students, click here    Please note if you have already registered as a student teacher you will need to re-register, create a new username and password and submit a new application when seeking employment within NYC public schools.    The NYCDOE application process will require a letter of expected completion . Please use letter here Please print, complete your information, scan or photograph and upload to your NYCDOE application. If you are unable to scan or photograph and upload, y ou may fax the letter to the NYCDOE at 718-935-3532, Attention: Pending Documents    Please also review the NYCDOE Application Process FAQ here    4. A NYC public school interested in hiring me is asking for my file number. What is a NYCDOE file number?    In the past, NYCDOE file numbers were issued when a NYS certified teacher applied for a NYC teaching license whether or not there was an offer of a teaching position. The NYCDOE no longer issues licenses.    The NYCDOE file number is a unique identifier issued to educators in the NYCDOE for payroll purposes. You are not issued a file number until after you have been hired and it will be issued after your first paycheck. If you were previously issued a file number as a substitute teacher or employee, you will keep that file number.    You do not need a file number to be hired (payrolled), it is processed through your social security number. Also see NYCDOE link here , scroll to bottom of page    5. I also wish to work for NYS public schools outside of NYC. Where can I apply and view job listings?    Please visit the OLAS JOBS website here    6. I'm an International Student without a social security number. Can I get fingerprinted for student teaching? Can I register for the NYS certification exams? Can I work for NYC public schools upon graduation?    Please click here    7.a. I was fingerprinted by the NYCDOE for student teaching, employment, etc. How can I tell if my fingerprint clearance appears in my NYSED TEACH account? My fingerprint clearance does not appear in my NYSED TEACH account, what should I do?    Log in to your NYSED TEACH account (if you haven't yet created an account Self-Register here to do so), once logged it, click on TEACH Home, click on the Account Information link , highlight Fingerprinting, click GO. You should see the statement \"We have received your fingerprint information from NYC\" ignore No Data Found underneath.    If your fingerprint information does not appear in your NYSED TEACH account, complete the OSPRA 104 Form here , do not check a box in Section 2 if none apply, mail or fax the form to the NYCDOE at the address or fax number at the bottom of the form. The NYCDOE will transfer your fingerprint clearance to the NYSED.    7.b. I was fingerprinted in the past through the NYSED and my fingerprint clearance appears in the NYSED TEACH system, how do I transfer my fingerprint clearance to the NYCDOE for the purposes of student teaching?       You must first be entered into the NYCDOE's Personnel Eligibility Tracking System (PETS). To do so you may either:    1) Email PETS Administration at PETSAdminSupport@schools.nyc.gov with the following information:    Name, SSN, DOB, primary telephone number, address (including zip), email address, name of College, title/job (e.g. student teacher, field observer), and school where you will be student teaching if you know it    OR    2) Telephone the NYCDOE's Office of Personnel Investigation (OPI) at 718-935-2665 to provide them with the same information as above.    Once you are entered into PETS, you will receive an email with instructions to log into the Applicant Gateway. You must complete and e-sign all required forms in Applicant Gateway. Once completed, you must go in person to the NYCDOE HR Connect Walk-in Center with a government-issued photo identification (ex: driver&rsquo;s license), your NYU ID, original I-9 documentation that shows eligibility to work in the U.S (please refer to the I-9 Eligibility Form for a complete list of acceptable documentation) and a completed OSPRA 103 .       8. I completed my certification program at Steinhardt and have not been recommended for certification to the NYSED, why not?    Program completers are not recommended automatically, you must request that Steinhardt recommend you after you've applied online, see question 2 above. The Request for Recommendation Form can be found in the application instructions.    9. I submitted my Request for Recommendation Form, why haven't I been recommended yet?    We recommend May and January completers only after all grades have been posted on your NYU record and your degree has been awarded. We recommend Summer completers once your summer grade(s) have all posted on your NYU record.    10. How will I know if my NYS Certificate has issued? How can I check the status of my certificate?    Log in to your NYSED TEACH account, click on TEACH Home, click on the Account Information link, highlight Certificates, click GO. For more details, please visit NYSED link here    11. How can I show proof that I am certified? Will I receive my NYS Initial or Provisional (School Counseling only) Certificate in the mail?    The NYSED no longer issues paper Initial or Provisional Certificates, please see NYSED link here . You will not receive your certificate(s) in the mail (unless you request them for an additional fee, see below) nor will you receive an email indicating that they have issued in TEACH. Initial or Provisional Certificates will only issue in your TEACH account. The screen in your account indicating your issued status does not look like a certificate nor is it in pdf format. You could print this page or take a screenshot to email to prospective employers. The NYCDOE and other NYS school districts have access to TEACH and may view your certification status. However, if you need or wish to have a paper copy, you may request one for an additional fee. Once your certificate has issued in TEACH, log in to your account, click on TEACH Home on the top menu and then click on \"I would like a printed certificate\" under Online Application heading. Also see here    12. How can I apply for additional areas of certification (or extensions) now that I'm certified without having to complete another certification program?    The NYSED allows already certified individuals to apply for most additional areas of certification (or extensions) on their own (not through Steinhardt) through the Additional Classroom Teaching Certificate (Must hold a valid certificate) Pathway or the Individual Evaluation Pathway, you may view those requirements here    If you were certified prior to the NYSED's new DASA workshop requirement, you will need to complete the DASA workshop prior to the issuance of any additional or new certificates, please see details here    As a matter of policy NYU Steinhardt does not evaluate transcripts for individuals applying through an Individual Evaluation Pathway. Any evaluation completed other than by the NYSED would be unofficial and possibly inaccurate.    To apply for additional areas go back to the TEACH Online system here , apply for the additional Initial Certificate(s) (or Professional only if you already hold Professional in another area) or extension(s) online following the instructions on the website.    When prompted for a program code, y ou DO NOT enter a program code, instead select:          No, I have not completed, nor am I enrolled in, an Approved Teacher Preparation Program at a New York State College or University for this certificate and this type.          On the Interstate Reciprocity screen, select No, I am not eligible to apply through the Interstate Reciprocity Pathway. Then select the Individual Evaluation for an Additional Classroom Teaching Certificate Pathway or Individual Evaluation Pathway.    You will then have to mail your transcripts (and/or other documentation) and wait for them to review. You can request an NYU transcript here If your or an employing school wants to expedite the process once the NYSED has received your transcripts, please see here    You may wish to include course descriptions in your correspondence with the NYSED.    Steinhardt course descriptions may be found here or in current or past bulletins here    Include cover letter with name and SSN and mail with transcript(s) and course description(s) to:    Office of Teaching Initiatives New York State Education Department 89 Washington Ave, 5N EB Albany, New York 12234    *When your transcript(s) are first received your application will be listed as Ready for Review. Ready for Review means just that - your application hasn't been reviewed by an evaluator at the NYSED yet. The system defaults to \"deficient\" or \"unmet\" for some requirements until the application is evaluated, it more accurately should state \"not yet reviewed\" next the those requirements. The evaluation will change once your application is reviewed.    13. I hold Childhood Ed 1-6 Initial Certification, how can I add Early Childhood Ed Birth-2nd Grade (which includes Kindergarten) Certification?    As answered in question 12 above, the NYSED allows already certified teachers to apply for additional certificates on their own (not through Steinhardt) . To add Early Childhood B-2 (once you hold Childhood Ed 1-6) and/or Students with Disabilities (SWD) B-2 (if you also hold SWD 1-6) you will need to re-apply to the NYSED online and mail them your transcript(s). You are not applying for extensions, but rather stand alone certificates in EC ED and/or SWD B-2.    The NYSED will want to see at least 3 credits that focus exclusively on Early Childhood, see here , which you may have already completed as part of your program. If you have, go back to the TEACH Online system here , apply for the additional Initial Certificate(s) (or Professional only if you already hold Professional in another area) online following the instructions on the website.    If you were certified prior to the NYSED's new DASA workshop requirement, you will need to complete the DASA workshop prior to the issuance of any additional or new certificates, please see details here    According to the NYSED, if you've taken the old non-grade range specific Multi-Subject CST, you will not need the to take and pass the new Multi-Subject B-2 CST. If you've taken and passed the new Multi-Subject 1-6 CST, the NYSED will require that you complete Parts 1 and 2 of the new Multi-Subject B-2 CST.    When prompted for a program code, y ou DO NOT enter a program code, instead select:          No, I have not completed, nor am I enrolled in, an Approved Teacher Preparation Program at a New York State College or University for this certificate and this type.          On the Interstate Reciprocity screen, select No, I am not eligible to apply through the Interstate Reciprocity Pathway. Then select the Additional Classroom Teaching Certificate (Must hold a valid certificate) Pathway.    You will then have to mail your transcripts and wait for them to review. Request an NYU transcript here If your school wants to expedite the process once the NYSED has received your transcripts, please see here    You may wish to include the course description(s) for the Early Childhood course(s) in your correspondence with the NYSED.    Course descriptions may be found here or in current or past bulletins here    Include cover letter with name and SSN and mail with transcript(s) and course description(s) to:    Office of Teaching Initiatives New York State Education Department 89 Washington Ave, 5N EB Albany, New York 12234    *When your transcript(s) are first received y  our application will be listed as Ready  for  Review . Ready   for  Review  means just that - your application hasn't been reviewed by an evaluator at the NYSED yet. The system defaults to \" deficient  \" o  r \"unmet\" for some requirements until the application is evaluated, it more accurately should state \"not yet reviewed\" next the those requirements. The NYSED will only look for 3 credits in Early Childhood on your transcript(s). The evaluation will change once your application is reviewed.     14.

As answered in question 12 above, the NYSED allows already certified teachers to apply for additional certificates on their own (not through Steinhardt) . To add Childhood Ed 1-6 (once you hold Early Childhood Ed B-2) and/or Students with Disabilities (SWD) 1-6 (if you also hold SWD B-2) you will need to re-apply to the NYSED online and mail them your transcript(s). You are not applying for extensions, but rather stand alone certificates in CH ED and/or SWD 1-6.    The NYSED will want to see at least 3 credits that focus exclusively on Childhood Ed, see here , which you may have already completed as part of your program. If you have, go back to the TEACH Online system here , apply for the additional Initial Certificate(s) (or Professional only if you already hold Professional in another area) online following the instructions on the website.

The NYSED will only look for 3 credits in Childhood Ed on your transcript(s). The evaluation will change once your application is reviewed.    15. Am I eligible to apply for certification in other states? Which states have reciprocity with NY?    Many states have signed an interstate agreement on reciprocity but it does not necessarily waive exam or fingerprinting requirements, see details here especially the section What it is not . You MUST still apply for certification in each state that you wish to be certified to teach in.    Some states do not require that you hold NYS certification to apply in their state, only that you've completed a traditional state approved certification program plus complete their additonal requirements such as exams and fingerprinting.    Other states such as California, Oregon and Texas do require that you hold NYS Certification to apply for certification in their state (according to their websites at the time that this website was last updated).    Best to check the certification website of the state you are hoping to be certified in.    According to the New Jersey Department of Education (609) 292-2070 (though not indicted on their website ) you do not need to complete their Praxis II testing requirements if you have passed the required NYS exams and hold NYS certification when you apply for NJ certificates in the same area(s).    Requirements for all states can be found easily online by searching for state name and teacher certification. Look for a link that states out of state prepared or out of state certified teacher which will outline the steps for you.    Direct link to the education departments of all fifty states and territories from the United States Department of Education here    While NYU Steinhardt will complete out of state verification forms required by the application process for other states (please see question 16), ultimately it is your responsibility to research and ensure that you meet or will meet the requirements of certification in that state. If you have questions regarding a particular state's requirements or application process, it is best to email or speak to one of their certification representatives.    16. Where can I send an out of state program verification form to be completed?    Please click here    17. I hold an Initial Certificate through my B.S. degree, what are my Master's degree options for satisfying Professional Certification?    Please see NYSED link here    18. What if my Initial Certificate is nearing expiration or has expired and I haven't completed the requirements for Professional Certification?    You may be able to apply for a time extension, please see details here , or a re-issuance, please see details here    As you would be applying directly to the NYSED for a time extension or re-issuance, please contact them with any questions you may have.    NYSED Office of Teaching Initiatives    Phone: (518) 474-3901 Press 5 to speak to a representative.    Staff are available to answer questions: 9:00 a.m. - 4:30 p.m. EST Monday through Friday.    19. I hold NYS Initial Certification through a program I completed at NYU Steinhardt and have now taught for 3 years. How do I apply for NYS Professional Certification?    Please see application instructions here , scroll down to Professional Certification    20. I've applied for Professional Certification and my Mentored Experience is listed as Deficient, how can I have it verified?    Please details see here OR if you were mentored in a NYC Public School, please email Sue Walia at mentorverification@schools.nyc.gov    21.a. I've applied for Professional Certification and the 3 years of teaching experience that I've detailed on TEACH is listed as Deficient, why?

Since then, we have expanded into health, the arts, and media studies.     As varied and diverse as our programs have been throughout the years, there is one thing that has never changed: Our commitment to studying and preparing professionals for pre-K-12 and higher education.    Read More                        Frequently Asked Questions            1. What is the difference between the New York State Education Department (NYSED) and the New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE)?    The NYSED in Albany, NY is the state agency that issues your NYS teaching certificate which is required to work in public schools across NY State. The NYCDOE (formerly known as the NYC Board of Education) is your employer if you work for NYC Public Schools.    2. I am completing a Steinhardt certification program, must I apply for NYS certification or does it issue automatically?    You must apply for NYS certification, please see application instructions here    3. Must I also apply to the NYCDOE if I wish to work for NYC Public Schools? How can I show proof that I am enrolled in a teacher certification program?    Yes, please visit the TEACH NYC website here Speech and Language Disabilities or School Counseling students, click here    Please note if you have already registered as a student teacher you will need to re-register, create a new username and password and submit a new application when seeking employment within NYC public schools.    The NYCDOE application process will require a letter of expected completion . Please use letter here Please print, complete your information, scan or photograph and upload to your NYCDOE application. If you are unable to scan or photograph and upload, y ou may fax the letter to the NYCDOE at 718-935-3532, Attention: Pending Documents    Please also review the NYCDOE Application Process FAQ here    4. A NYC public school interested in hiring me is asking for my file number. What is a NYCDOE file number?    In the past, NYCDOE file numbers were issued when a NYS certified teacher applied for a NYC teaching license whether or not there was an offer of a teaching position. The NYCDOE no longer issues licenses.    The NYCDOE file number is a unique identifier issued to educators in the NYCDOE for payroll purposes. You are not issued a file number until after you have been hired and it will be issued after your first paycheck. If you were previously issued a file number as a substitute teacher or employee, you will keep that file number.    You do not need a file number to be hired (payrolled), it is processed through your social security number. Also see NYCDOE link here , scroll to bottom of page    5. I also wish to work for NYS public schools outside of NYC. Where can I apply and view job listings?    Please visit the OLAS JOBS website here    6. I'm an International Student without a social security number. Can I get fingerprinted for student teaching? Can I register for the NYS certification exams? Can I work for NYC public schools upon graduation?    Please click here    7.a. I was fingerprinted by the NYCDOE for student teaching, employment, etc. How can I tell if my fingerprint clearance appears in my NYSED TEACH account? My fingerprint clearance does not appear in my NYSED TEACH account, what should I do?    Log in to your NYSED TEACH account (if you haven't yet created an account Self-Register here to do so), once logged it, click on TEACH Home, click on the Account Information link , highlight Fingerprinting, click GO. You should see the statement \"We have received your fingerprint information from NYC\" ignore No Data Found underneath.    If your fingerprint information does not appear in your NYSED TEACH account, complete the OSPRA 104 Form here , do not check a box in Section 2 if none apply, mail or fax the form to the NYCDOE at the address or fax number at the bottom of the form. The NYCDOE will transfer your fingerprint clearance to the NYSED.    7.b. I was fingerprinted in the past through the NYSED and my fingerprint clearance appears in the NYSED TEACH system, how do I transfer my fingerprint clearance to the NYCDOE for the purposes of student teaching?       You must first be entered into the NYCDOE's Personnel Eligibility Tracking System (PETS). To do so you may either:    1) Email PETS Administration at PETSAdminSupport@schools.nyc.gov with the following information:    Name, SSN, DOB, primary telephone number, address (including zip), email address, name of College, title/job (e.g. student teacher, field observer), and school where you will be student teaching if you know it    OR    2) Telephone the NYCDOE's Office of Personnel Investigation (OPI) at 718-935-2665 to provide them with the same information as above.    Once you are entered into PETS, you will receive an email with instructions to log into the Applicant Gateway. You must complete and e-sign all required forms in Applicant Gateway. Once completed, you must go in person to the NYCDOE HR Connect Walk-in Center with a government-issued photo identification (ex: driver&rsquo;s license), your NYU ID, original I-9 documentation that shows eligibility to work in the U.S (please refer to the I-9 Eligibility Form for a complete list of acceptable documentation) and a completed OSPRA 103 .       8. I completed my certification program at Steinhardt and have not been recommended for certification to the NYSED, why not?    Program completers are not recommended automatically, you must request that Steinhardt recommend you after you've applied online, see question 2 above. The Request for Recommendation Form can be found in the application instructions.    9. I submitted my Request for Recommendation Form, why haven't I been recommended yet?    We recommend May and January completers only after all grades have been posted on your NYU record and your degree has been awarded. We recommend Summer completers once your summer grade(s) have all posted on your NYU record.    10. How will I know if my NYS Certificate has issued? How can I check the status of my certificate?    Log in to your NYSED TEACH account, click on TEACH Home, click on the Account Information link, highlight Certificates, click GO. For more details, please visit NYSED link here    11. How can I show proof that I am certified? Will I receive my NYS Initial or Provisional (School Counseling only) Certificate in the mail?    The NYSED no longer issues paper Initial or Provisional Certificates, please see NYSED link here . You will not receive your certificate(s) in the mail (unless you request them for an additional fee, see below) nor will you receive an email indicating that they have issued in TEACH. Initial or Provisional Certificates will only issue in your TEACH account. The screen in your account indicating your issued status does not look like a certificate nor is it in pdf format. You could print this page or take a screenshot to email to prospective employers. The NYCDOE and other NYS school districts have access to TEACH and may view your certification status. However, if you need or wish to have a paper copy, you may request one for an additional fee. Once your certificate has issued in TEACH, log in to your account, click on TEACH Home on the top menu and then click on \"I would like a printed certificate\" under Online Application heading. Also see here    12. How can I apply for additional areas of certification (or extensions) now that I'm certified without having to complete another certification program?    The NYSED allows already certified individuals to apply for most additional areas of certification (or extensions) on their own (not through Steinhardt) through the Additional Classroom Teaching Certificate (Must hold a valid certificate) Pathway or the Individual Evaluation Pathway, you may view those requirements here    If you were certified prior to the NYSED's new DASA workshop requirement, you will need to complete the DASA workshop prior to the issuance of any additional or new certificates, please see details here    As a matter of policy NYU Steinhardt does not evaluate transcripts for individuals applying through an Individual Evaluation Pathway. Any evaluation completed other than by the NYSED would be unofficial and possibly inaccurate.    To apply for additional areas go back to the TEACH Online system here , apply for the additional Initial Certificate(s) (or Professional only if you already hold Professional in another area) or extension(s) online following the instructions on the website.    When prompted for a program code, y ou DO NOT enter a program code, instead select:          No, I have not completed, nor am I enrolled in, an Approved Teacher Preparation Program at a New York State College or University for this certificate and this type.          On the Interstate Reciprocity screen, select No, I am not eligible to apply through the Interstate Reciprocity Pathway. Then select the Individual Evaluation for an Additional Classroom Teaching Certificate Pathway or Individual Evaluation Pathway.    You will then have to mail your transcripts (and/or other documentation) and wait for them to review. You can request an NYU transcript here If your or an employing school wants to expedite the process once the NYSED has received your transcripts, please see here    You may wish to include course descriptions in your correspondence with the NYSED.    Steinhardt course descriptions may be found here or in current or past bulletins here    Include cover letter with name and SSN and mail with transcript(s) and course description(s) to:    Office of Teaching Initiatives New York State Education Department 89 Washington Ave, 5N EB Albany, New York 12234    *When your transcript(s) are first received your application will be listed as Ready for Review. Ready for Review means just that - your application hasn't been reviewed by an evaluator at the NYSED yet. The system defaults to \"deficient\" or \"unmet\" for some requirements until the application is evaluated, it more accurately should state \"not yet reviewed\" next the those requirements. The evaluation will change once your application is reviewed.    13. I hold Childhood Ed 1-6 Initial Certification, how can I add Early Childhood Ed Birth-2nd Grade (which includes Kindergarten) Certification?    As answered in question 12 above, the NYSED allows already certified teachers to apply for additional certificates on their own (not through Steinhardt) . To add Early Childhood B-2 (once you hold Childhood Ed 1-6) and/or Students with Disabilities (SWD) B-2 (if you also hold SWD 1-6) you will need to re-apply to the NYSED online and mail them your transcript(s). You are not applying for extensions, but rather stand alone certificates in EC ED and/or SWD B-2.    The NYSED will want to see at least 3 credits that focus exclusively on Early Childhood, see here , which you may have already completed as part of your program. If you have, go back to the TEACH Online system here , apply for the additional Initial Certificate(s) (or Professional only if you already hold Professional in another area) online following the instructions on the website.    If you were certified prior to the NYSED's new DASA workshop requirement, you will need to complete the DASA workshop prior to the issuance of any additional or new certificates, please see details here    According to the NYSED, if you've taken the old non-grade range specific Multi-Subject CST, you will not need the to take and pass the new Multi-Subject B-2 CST. If you've taken and passed the new Multi-Subject 1-6 CST, the NYSED will require that you complete Parts 1 and 2 of the new Multi-Subject B-2 CST.    When prompted for a program code, y ou DO NOT enter a program code, instead select:          No, I have not completed, nor am I enrolled in, an Approved Teacher Preparation Program at a New York State College or University for this certificate and this type.

Course descriptions may be found here or in current or past bulletins here    Include cover letter with name and SSN and mail with transcript(s) and course description(s) to:    Office of Teaching Initiatives New York State Education Department 89 Washington Ave, 5N EB Albany, New York 12234    *When your transcript(s) are first received y  our application will be listed as Ready  for  Review . Ready   for  Review  means just that - your application hasn't been reviewed by an evaluator at the NYSED yet. The system defaults to \" deficient  \" o  r \"unmet\" for some requirements until the application is evaluated, it more accurately should state \"not yet reviewed\" next the those requirements. The NYSED will only look for 3 credits in Early Childhood on your transcript(s). The evaluation will change once your application is reviewed.     14. I hold Early Childhood B-2 Initial Certification, how can I add Childhood Ed 1-6 Certification?    As answered in question 12 above, the NYSED allows already certified teachers to apply for additional certificates on their own (not through Steinhardt) . To add Childhood Ed 1-6 (once you hold Early Childhood Ed B-2) and/or Students with Disabilities (SWD) 1-6 (if you also hold SWD B-2) you will need to re-apply to the NYSED online and mail them your transcript(s). You are not applying for extensions, but rather stand alone certificates in CH ED and/or SWD 1-6.    The NYSED will want to see at least 3 credits that focus exclusively on Childhood Ed, see here , which you may have already completed as part of your program. If you have, go back to the TEACH Online system here , apply for the additional Initial Certificate(s) (or Professional only if you already hold Professional in another area) online following the instructions on the website.    If you were certified prior to the NYSED's new DASA workshop requirement, you will need to complete the DASA workshop prior to the issuance of any additional or new certificates, please see details here    According to the NYSED, if you've taken the old non-grade range specific Multi-Subject CST, you will not need to take and pass the new Multi-Subject 1-6 CST. If you've taken and passed the new Multi-Subject B-2 CST, the NYSED will require that you complete Parts 1 and 2 of the new Multi-Subject 1-6 CST.    When prompted for a program code, y ou DO NOT enter a program code, instead select:          No, I have not completed, nor am I enrolled in, an Approved Teacher Preparation Program at a New York State College or University for this certificate and this type.

Ready for Review means just that - your application hasn't been reviewed by an evaluator at the NYSED yet. The system defaults to \"deficient\" or \"unmet\" for some requirements until the application is evaluated, it more accurately should state \"not yet reviewed\" next the those requirements. The NYSED will only look for 3 credits in Childhood Ed on your transcript(s). The evaluation will change once your application is reviewed.    15. Am I eligible to apply for certification in other states? Which states have reciprocity with NY?    Many states have signed an interstate agreement on reciprocity but it does not necessarily waive exam or fingerprinting requirements, see details here especially the section What it is not . You MUST still apply for certification in each state that you wish to be certified to teach in.    Some states do not require that you hold NYS certification to apply in their state, only that you've completed a traditional state approved certification program plus complete their additonal requirements such as exams and fingerprinting.    Other states such as California, Oregon and Texas do require that you hold NYS Certification to apply for certification in their state (according to their websites at the time that this website was last updated).    Best to check the certification website of the state you are hoping to be certified in.    According to the New Jersey Department of Education (609) 292-2070 (though not indicted on their website ) you do not need to complete their Praxis II testing requirements if you have passed the required NYS exams and hold NYS certification when you apply for NJ certificates in the same area(s).    Requirements for all states can be found easily online by searching for state name and teacher certification. Look for a link that states out of state prepared or out of state certified teacher which will outline the steps for you.    Direct link to the education departments of all fifty states and territories from the United States Department of Education here    While NYU Steinhardt will complete out of state verification forms required by the application process for other states (please see question 16), ultimately it is your responsibility to research and ensure that you meet or will meet the requirements of certification in that state. If you have questions regarding a particular state's requirements or application process, it is best to email or speak to one of their certification representatives.    16.

Perez Certification Officer NYU Steinhardt 82 Washington Square East, Room 229 New York, New York 10003 (212) 998-5033 (212) 995-4353 fax    mark.perez@nyu.edu        Commitment to Education         The Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development was founded in 1890 as the School of Pedagogy. Since then, we have expanded into health, the arts, and media studies.     As varied and diverse as our programs have been throughout the years, there is one thing that has never changed: Our commitment to studying and preparing professionals for pre-K-12 and higher education.    Read More                        Frequently Asked Questions            1. What is the difference between the New York State Education Department (NYSED) and the New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE)?    The NYSED in Albany, NY is the state agency that issues your NYS teaching certificate which is required to work in public schools across NY State. The NYCDOE (formerly known as the NYC Board of Education) is your employer if you work for NYC Public Schools.    2. I am completing a Steinhardt certification program, must I apply for NYS certification or does it issue automatically?    You must apply for NYS certification, please see application instructions here    3. Must I also apply to the NYCDOE if I wish to work for NYC Public Schools? How can I show proof that I am enrolled in a teacher certification program?    Yes, please visit the TEACH NYC website here Speech and Language Disabilities or School Counseling students, click here    Please note if you have already registered as a student teacher you will need to re-register, create a new username and password and submit a new application when seeking employment within NYC public schools.    The NYCDOE application process will require a letter of expected completion . Please use letter here Please print, complete your information, scan or photograph and upload to your NYCDOE application. If you are unable to scan or photograph and upload, y ou may fax the letter to the NYCDOE at 718-935-3532, Attention: Pending Documents    Please also review the NYCDOE Application Process FAQ here    4. A NYC public school interested in hiring me is asking for my file number. What is a NYCDOE file number?    In the past, NYCDOE file numbers were issued when a NYS certified teacher applied for a NYC teaching license whether or not there was an offer of a teaching position. The NYCDOE no longer issues licenses.    The NYCDOE file number is a unique identifier issued to educators in the NYCDOE for payroll purposes. You are not issued a file number until after you have been hired and it will be issued after your first paycheck. If you were previously issued a file number as a substitute teacher or employee, you will keep that file number.    You do not need a file number to be hired (payrolled), it is processed through your social security number. Also see NYCDOE link here , scroll to bottom of page    5. I also wish to work for NYS public schools outside of NYC. Where can I apply and view job listings?    Please visit the OLAS JOBS website here    6. I'm an International Student without a social security number. Can I get fingerprinted for student teaching? Can I register for the NYS certification exams? Can I work for NYC public schools upon graduation?    Please click here    7.a. I was fingerprinted by the NYCDOE for student teaching, employment, etc. How can I tell if my fingerprint clearance appears in my NYSED TEACH account? My fingerprint clearance does not appear in my NYSED TEACH account, what should I do?    Log in to your NYSED TEACH account (if you haven't yet created an account Self-Register here to do so), once logged it, click on TEACH Home, click on the Account Information link , highlight Fingerprinting, click GO. You should see the statement \"We have received your fingerprint information from NYC\" ignore No Data Found underneath.    If your fingerprint information does not appear in your NYSED TEACH account, complete the OSPRA 104 Form here , do not check a box in Section 2 if none apply, mail or fax the form to the NYCDOE at the address or fax number at the bottom of the form. The NYCDOE will transfer your fingerprint clearance to the NYSED.    7.b. I was fingerprinted in the past through the NYSED and my fingerprint clearance appears in the NYSED TEACH system, how do I transfer my fingerprint clearance to the NYCDOE for the purposes of student teaching?       You must first be entered into the NYCDOE's Personnel Eligibility Tracking System (PETS). To do so you may either:    1) Email PETS Administration at PETSAdminSupport@schools.nyc.gov with the following information:    Name, SSN, DOB, primary telephone number, address (including zip), email address, name of College, title/job (e.g. student teacher, field observer), and school where you will be student teaching if you know it    OR    2) Telephone the NYCDOE's Office of Personnel Investigation (OPI) at 718-935-2665 to provide them with the same information as above.    Once you are entered into PETS, you will receive an email with instructions to log into the Applicant Gateway. You must complete and e-sign all required forms in Applicant Gateway. Once completed, you must go in person to the NYCDOE HR Connect Walk-in Center with a government-issued photo identification (ex: driver&rsquo;s license), your NYU ID, original I-9 documentation that shows eligibility to work in the U.S (please refer to the I-9 Eligibility Form for a complete list of acceptable documentation) and a completed OSPRA 103 .       8. I completed my certification program at Steinhardt and have not been recommended for certification to the NYSED, why not?    Program completers are not recommended automatically, you must request that Steinhardt recommend you after you've applied online, see question 2 above. The Request for Recommendation Form can be found in the application instructions.    9. I submitted my Request for Recommendation Form, why haven't I been recommended yet?    We recommend May and January completers only after all grades have been posted on your NYU record and your degree has been awarded. We recommend Summer completers once your summer grade(s) have all posted on your NYU record.    10. How will I know if my NYS Certificate has issued? How can I check the status of my certificate?    Log in to your NYSED TEACH account, click on TEACH Home, click on the Account Information link, highlight Certificates, click GO. For more details, please visit NYSED link here    11. How can I show proof that I am certified? Will I receive my NYS Initial or Provisional (School Counseling only) Certificate in the mail?    The NYSED no longer issues paper Initial or Provisional Certificates, please see NYSED link here . You will not receive your certificate(s) in the mail (unless you request them for an additional fee, see below) nor will you receive an email indicating that they have issued in TEACH. Initial or Provisional Certificates will only issue in your TEACH account. The screen in your account indicating your issued status does not look like a certificate nor is it in pdf format. You could print this page or take a screenshot to email to prospective employers. The NYCDOE and other NYS school districts have access to TEACH and may view your certification status. However, if you need or wish to have a paper copy, you may request one for an additional fee. Once your certificate has issued in TEACH, log in to your account, click on TEACH Home on the top menu and then click on \"I would like a printed certificate\" under Online Application heading. Also see here    12. How can I apply for additional areas of certification (or extensions) now that I'm certified without having to complete another certification program?    The NYSED allows already certified individuals to apply for most additional areas of certification (or extensions) on their own (not through Steinhardt) through the Additional Classroom Teaching Certificate (Must hold a valid certificate) Pathway or the Individual Evaluation Pathway, you may view those requirements here    If you were certified prior to the NYSED's new DASA workshop requirement, you will need to complete the DASA workshop prior to the issuance of any additional or new certificates, please see details here    As a matter of policy NYU Steinhardt does not evaluate transcripts for individuals applying through an Individual Evaluation Pathway. Any evaluation completed other than by the NYSED would be unofficial and possibly inaccurate.    To apply for additional areas go back to the TEACH Online system here , apply for the additional Initial Certificate(s) (or Professional only if you already hold Professional in another area) or extension(s) online following the instructions on the website.    When prompted for a program code, y ou DO NOT enter a program code, instead select:          No, I have not completed, nor am I enrolled in, an Approved Teacher Preparation Program at a New York State College or University for this certificate and this type.          On the Interstate Reciprocity screen, select No, I am not eligible to apply through the Interstate Reciprocity Pathway. Then select the Individual Evaluation for an Additional Classroom Teaching Certificate Pathway or Individual Evaluation Pathway.    You will then have to mail your transcripts (and/or other documentation) and wait for them to review. You can request an NYU transcript here If your or an employing school wants to expedite the process once the NYSED has received your transcripts, please see here    You may wish to include course descriptions in your correspondence with the NYSED.    Steinhardt course descriptions may be found here or in current or past bulletins here    Include cover letter with name and SSN and mail with transcript(s) and course description(s) to:    Office of Teaching Initiatives New York State Education Department 89 Washington Ave, 5N EB Albany, New York 12234    *When your transcript(s) are first received your application will be listed as Ready for Review. Ready for Review means just that - your application hasn't been reviewed by an evaluator at the NYSED yet. The system defaults to \"deficient\" or \"unmet\" for some requirements until the application is evaluated, it more accurately should state \"not yet reviewed\" next the those requirements. The evaluation will change once your application is reviewed.    13. I hold Childhood Ed 1-6 Initial Certification, how can I add Early Childhood Ed Birth-2nd Grade (which includes Kindergarten) Certification?    As answered in question 12 above, the NYSED allows already certified teachers to apply for additional certificates on their own (not through Steinhardt) . To add Early Childhood B-2 (once you hold Childhood Ed 1-6) and/or Students with Disabilities (SWD) B-2 (if you also hold SWD 1-6) you will need to re-apply to the NYSED online and mail them your transcript(s). You are not applying for extensions, but rather stand alone certificates in EC ED and/or SWD B-2.    The NYSED will want to see at least 3 credits that focus exclusively on Early Childhood, see here , which you may have already completed as part of your program. If you have, go back to the TEACH Online system here , apply for the additional Initial Certificate(s) (or Professional only if you already hold Professional in another area) online following the instructions on the website.

The NYSED will only look for 3 credits in Childhood Ed on your transcript(s). The evaluation will change once your application is reviewed.    15. Am I eligible to apply for certification in other states? Which states have reciprocity with NY?    Many states have signed an interstate agreement on reciprocity but it does not necessarily waive exam or fingerprinting requirements, see details here especially the section What it is not . You MUST still apply for certification in each state that you wish to be certified to teach in.    Some states do not require that you hold NYS certification to apply in their state, only that you've completed a traditional state approved certification program plus complete their additonal requirements such as exams and fingerprinting.    Other states such as California, Oregon and Texas do require that you hold NYS Certification to apply for certification in their state (according to their websites at the time that this website was last updated).    Best to check the certification website of the state you are hoping to be certified in.    According to the New Jersey Department of Education (609) 292-2070 (though not indicted on their website ) you do not need to complete their Praxis II testing requirements if you have passed the required NYS exams and hold NYS certification when you apply for NJ certificates in the same area(s).    Requirements for all states can be found easily online by searching for state name and teacher certification. Look for a link that states out of state prepared or out of state certified teacher which will outline the steps for you.    Direct link to the education departments of all fifty states and territories from the United States Department of Education here    While NYU Steinhardt will complete out of state verification forms required by the application process for other states (please see question 16), ultimately it is your responsibility to research and ensure that you meet or will meet the requirements of certification in that state. If you have questions regarding a particular state's requirements or application process, it is best to email or speak to one of their certification representatives.    16. Where can I send an out of state program verification form to be completed?    Please click here    17. I hold an Initial Certificate through my B.S. degree, what are my Master's degree options for satisfying Professional Certification?    Please see NYSED link here    18. What if my Initial Certificate is nearing expiration or has expired and I haven't completed the requirements for Professional Certification?    You may be able to apply for a time extension, please see details here , or a re-issuance, please see details here    As you would be applying directly to the NYSED for a time extension or re-issuance, please contact them with any questions you may have.
