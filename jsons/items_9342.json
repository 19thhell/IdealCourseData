What can comics scholars learn from animation studies and vice versa?     Do illustrated books or graphic novels resist the supposed obsolescence of the book? What do pictures want (now)?     These and related questions will be explored at the Illustration, Comics, and Animation Conference at Dartmouth College to be held May 8,9, 10 2015.       Scholars interested in the illustrated image in all of its mediated guises are invited to participate in this interdisciplinary conference. Nearly all illustrated or drawn &lsquo;texts&rsquo; are eligible for consideration:   *comics and graphic novels   *cartoons and animated films   *picture books   *illustrated books       And given the uniquely plenary nature of the conference, which brings together scholarship on static and moving illustrations, preference will be given to proposals that seek to bridge visual media. Possible topics may include:   *Individual titles by prominent practitioners in the field   *Identity, subjectivity, authority, ideology or culture in or more type of illustration media   *The future of particular schools of criticism (psychoanalysis, critical race theory, phenomenology, Marxism, feminism, queer theory, post-colonialism, formalism, aesthetic theories, etc.) and one or more type of illustration media   *The contributions of archives and libraries to the study of comics, animation, and illustration.           The location of the conference may also be a source of inspiration for prospective participants. Not only does Dartmouth College lie in close proximity to the Center for Cartoon Studies in White River Junction, Vermont, it is also the origin of Theodor Geisel, Dr. Seuss, a Dartmouth graduate of the Class of 1925.       Individual papers should be no longer than 20 minutes. Panels shall be ninety minutes long and should be comprised of three presenters and one chair. Please send 300 word abstracts and a brief bio for each proposed paper no later than March 1, 2015 .         Send all proposals and inquiries to Michael A.

In the past 40 years comics have moved from occupying a decidedly lowbrow niche at the margins of pop culture to the center of the popular and critical imagination. Comics&mdash;a catch-all term that encompasses monthly comic books, graphic novels and web comics&mdash;are embedded in, relate to and comment upon other forms of media like film, painting and the novel. In addition to these formal connections, comics operate uniquely as political expression. So, in the 1970s, one might connect mainstream comics and underground comix to graffiti through their form (each are a kind of visual writing primarily disseminated and consumed throughout cities), but each of these also addressed the rising conservatism that changed understandings of and formations of urban space in that period. By scrutinizing not just the materiality of comics but also its often overlapping genres&mdash;superhero, crime, war, fantasy, memoir and biography, reportage&mdash;and its contexts&mdash;economic, cultural, and political&mdash;we begin to produce a more comprehensive understanding of comics&rsquo; logics, about why the medium unfolds as it does.   Submissions may address, but are not limited to, the following:           Comics and cultural theory   Comics and the post-WWII period   Comics and the post-Vietnam period   Comics and McCarthyism   Comics and the city   Comics and feminism   Comics and cinema   Comics and digital cultures       Comics and gender   Comics and American exceptionalism   Comics and science   Comics and pornography   Comics and race   Coimcs and sexuality   Comics and Hip-Hop   Comics and television             The JC&amp;C is looking for both original scholarly articles and reviews of recent scholarly monographs about comics and graphic novels. Please submit 500 word abstracts and a brief bio by 15 Feb 2015 to journalcomicsculture@icloud. com Full articles, if accepted, will be due for peer review by 15 May 2015.

While a graphic novel may just appear to be a grandiose comic book, thicker and produced on higher quality paper, many readers claim that the differences are more substantive. Graphic novels generally are complete stories or collections of stories, while comic books usually center on one episode in a series. As readers of graphic novels are assumed to be more mature and sophisticated, the themes tend to be more adult and the illustrations more explicit. The writing in graphic novels is often quite excellent. Art Spiegelman&rsquo;s holocaust autobiography, Maus, A Survivor&rsquo;s Tale (1991), has won prizes and been included in school curricula. The writing in comic books however, is largely underrated. As it is with graphic novels, many comics contain rich descriptors, sophisticated ideas, and high-level vocabulary.   \" graphic novel .\" Greenwood Dictionary of Education .

Beautiful Darkness - Fabien Vehlmann Call Number: PN6747.V44 J6513 2014 Kerasco\u00ebt\u2019s and Fabien Vehlmann\u2019s unsettling and gorgeous anti-fairy tale is a searing condemnation of our vast capacity for evil writ tiny. Join princess Aurora and her friends as they journey to civilization's heart of darkness in a bleak allegory about surviving the human experience. The sweet faces and bright leaves of Kerasco\u00ebt\u2019s delicate watercolors serve to highlight the evil that dwells beneath Vehlmann's story as pettiness, greed, and jealousy take over. Beautiful Darkness is a harrowing look behind the routine politeness and meaningless kindness of civilized society.   Kill my mother: a graphic novel - Jules Feiffer Call Number: PN6727.F4 K55 2014) Jules Feiffer presents his first noir graphic novel.

Comics as history, comics as literature : roles of the comic book in scholarship, society, and entertainment - Annessa Ann Babic Call Number: Electronic Resource This anthology hosts a collection of essays examining the role of comics as portals for historical and academic content, while keeping the approach on an international market versus the American one. Few resources currently exist showing the cross-disciplinary aspects of comics. Some of the chapters examine the use of Wonder Woman during World War II, the development and culture of French comics, and theories of Locke and Hobbs in regards to the state of nature and the bonds of community. More so, the continual use of comics for the retelling of classic tales and current events demonstrates that the genre has long passed the phase of for children\u2019s eyes only.   Comics: A Global History, 1968 to the Present - Dan Mazur Call Number: PN6710 .M332 2014 Comics, manga, bandes dessin\u00e9es, fumetti, tebeo, historietas\u2026 no matter the name, they have been a powerful medium across four continents for decades. This is the history of comics around the world from the late 1960s to the dawn of the 21st century.   Comics and the senses: a multisensory approach to comics and graphic novels - Ian Hague Call Number: Electronic resource ISBN: 0415713978 Attempts to define what comics are and explain how they work have not always been successful because they are premised upon the idea that comic strips, comic books and graphic novels are inherently and almost exclusively visual. This book challenges that premise, and asserts that comics is not just a visual medium. The book outlines the multisensory aspects of comics: the visual, audible, tactile, olfactory and gustatory elements of the medium. It rejects a synaesthetic approach (by which all the senses are engaged through visual stimuli) and instead argues for a truly multisensory model by which the direct stimulation of the reader\u2019s physical senses can be understood. A wide range of examples demonstrates how multisensory communication systems work in both commercial and more experimental contexts.   Gothic in comics and graphic novels: a critical approach - Julia Round Call Number: PN6714 .R74 2014 This book explores the connections between comics and Gothic from four different angles: historical, formal, cultural and textual. It identifies structures, styles and themes drawn from literary gothic traditions and discusses their presence in British and American comics today.   Superheroes in crisis adjusting to social change in the 1960s and 1970s - Jeffrey K. Johnson Call Number: PN6725 .J643 2013 As the founding fathers of the superhero comic books, Superman and Batman have defined a genre of American mythology from the mid-twentieth century to the present. The author describes how the Man of Steel and the Dark Knight dealt with their midlife crises brought on by the cultural and social changes of the 1960s and 1970s. Johnson describes how the superheroes problems and adaptations mirror much of American societal changes during that time.   It Happens at Comic-Con: Ethnographic Essays on a Pop Culture Phenomenon - Ben Bolling Call Number: Electronic Resource This collection of 13 new essays employs ethnographic methods to investigate San Diego's Comic-Con International, the largest annual celebration of the popular arts in North America. Working from a common grounding in fan studies, these individual explorations examine a range of cultural practices at an event drawing crowds of nearly 125,000 each summer.  Investigations range from the practices of fans costuming themselves to the talk of corporate marketers. The collection seeks to expand fan studies, exploring Comic-Con International more deeply than any publication before it.   America toons in: a history of television animation - David Perlmutter Call Number: PN1992.8.A59 P47 2014 Animation has been part of television since the start of the medium but it has rarely received unbiased recognition from media scholars. More often, it has been ridiculed for supposedly poor technical quality, accused of trafficking in violence aimed at children, and neglected for indulging in vulgar behavior. These accusations are often made categorically, out of prejudice or ignorance, with little attempt to understand the importance of each program on its own terms. This book takes a serious look at the whole genre of television animation, from the early themes and practices through the evolution of the art to the present day.   The Meaning of Superhero Comic Books - Terrence R Wandtke Call Number: electronic access For decades, scholars have been making the connection between the design of the superhero story and the mythology of the ancient folktale. Moving beyond simple comparisons and common explanations, this volume details how the workings of the superhero comics industry and the conventions of the medium have developed a culture like that of traditional epic storytelling.   The visible text: textual production and reproduction from Beowulf to Maus - Thomas A. Bredehoft Call Number: Z4 .B74 2014 Covering materials ranging from Anglo-Saxon manuscripts and inscribed objects to contemporary comics, The Visible Text rewrites the history of textual media and technologies. Arguing that media are not defined by technologies alone, but by a combination of technologies and the ideas that people hold about those technologies, Bredehoft identifies four distinct periods or domains in the history of English literature that correspond to four ways in which media ideologies interacted with the two basic defining technologies of manuscripts and printed books.   Projections: comics and the history of twenty-first-century storytelling - Jared Gardner Call Number: Electronic Access Beginning with the parallel development of narrative comics at the turn of the 20th century, comics have long been a form that invites\u2014indeed requires\u2014readers to help shape the stories being told. Today, with the rise of interactive media, the creative techniques and the reading practices comics have been experimenting with for a century are now in universal demand. Recounting the history of comics from the nineteenth-century rise of sequential comics to the newspaper strip, through comic books and underground comix, to the graphic novel and webcomics, Gardner shows why they offer the best models for rethinking storytelling in the twenty-first century.   Graphic Storytelling and Visual Narrative: Principles and Practices from the Legendary Cartoonist - Will Eisner Call Number: New School Gimbel PN6710 .E57 2008 Graphic Storytelling and Visual Narrative teaches how to control a story effectively using a broad array of techniques. With examples from Eisner\u2019s own catalog and such masters as H. Foster, R. Crumb, Art Spiegelman, Milton Caniff, Al Capp, and George Herriman, these books distill the art of graphic storytelling into principles that every comic artist, writer, and filmmaker should know.   No Straight Lines: Four Decades of Queer Comics - Justin Hall No Straight Lines showcases major names such as Alison Bechdel (whose book Fun Home was named Time Magazine\u2019s 2006 Book of the Year), Howard Cruse (whose groundbreaking Stuck Rubber Baby is now back in print), and Ralf Koenig (one of Europe\u2019s most popular cartoonists), as well as high-profile, cross-over creators who have dabbled in LGBT cartooning, like legendary NYC artist David Wojnarowicz and media darling and advice columnist Dan Savage. No Straight Lines also spotlights many talented creators who never made it out of the queer comics ghetto, but produced amazing work that deserves wider attention.   Multicultural Comics: From Zap to Blue Beetle - Frederick Luis Aldama Call Number: (electronic access) Multicultural Comics: From Zap to Blue Beetle is the first comprehensive look at comic books by and about race and ethnicity. The thirteen essays tease out for the general reader the nuances of how such multicultural comics skillfully combine visual and verbal elements to tell richly compelling stories that gravitate around issues of race, ethnicity, gender, and sexuality within and outside the U.S. comic book industry.   Graven Images: Religion in Comic Books & Graphic Novels - A. David Lewis Call Number: PN6712 .G73 2010 Comic books have increasingly become a vehicle for serious social commentary and, specifically, for innovative religious thought. Practitioners of both traditional religions and new religious movements have begun to employ comics as a missionary tool, while humanists and religious progressives use comics' unique fusion of text and image to criticize traditional theologies and to offer alternatives. Addressing the increasing fervor with which the public has come to view comics as an art form and Americans' fraught but passionate relationship with religion, Graven Images explores with real insight the roles of religion in comic books and graphic novels.   Comics as a Nexus of Cultures: Essays on the Interplay of Media, Disciplines and International Perspectives - Donald E. Palumbo and Mark Berninger Call Number: (electronic access) These essays from various critical disciplines examine how comic books and graphic narratives move between various media, while merging youth and adult cultures and popular and high art.

Superheroes and Philosophy: Truth, Justice, and the Socratic Way - Tom Morris Call Number: (electronic access) The comic book superheroes \u2014 Superman, Batman, the Incredible Hulk, the Fantastic Four, X-Men, and many others \u2014 have proved to be a powerful and enduring thread in popular culture, a rich source of ideas for moviemakers, novelists, and philosophers. Superheroes and Philosophy brings together 16 leading philosophers and some of the most creative people in the world of comics, from storywriters to editors to critics, to examine the deeper issues that resonate from the hyperbolic narratives and superhuman actions of this heroic world.   Supergods: What Masked Vigilantes, Miraculous Mutants, and a Sun God from Smallville Can Teach Us About Being Human - Grant Morrison Call Number: PN6725 .M67 2011 The first superhero comic ever published, Action Comics no. 1 in 1938, introduced the world to something both unprecedented and timeless: Superman, a caped god for the modern age. In a matter of years, the skies of the imaginary world were filled with strange mutants, aliens, and vigilantes: Batman, Wonder Woman, the Fantastic Four, Iron Man, and the X-Men\u2014the list of names as familiar as our own. In less than a century, they\u2019ve gone from not existing at all to being everywhere we look: on our movie and television screens, in our videogames and dreams.   Modern animalism: habitats of scarcity and wealth in comics and literature - Glenn Wilmott Call Number: PN56.P7 W54 2012 Modern Animalism explores representations of the human-animal \u2018problem creature\u2019 in a broad assortment of literature and comics from the late nineteenth century to the present \u2014 including authors such as Woolf, Joyce, Lawrence, Moore, Murakami, Pullman, Coetzee, and Atwood, and comics creators such as McCay, Herriman, Miyazaki, and Morrison. Drawing on a wide range of scholarship, from environmental economics to psychology, Glenn Willmott examines modern and post-modern allegories of the environment, the animal, and economics, highlighting the enduring and seductive appeal of the modern primitive in an age when living with less remains a powerful cultural wish.

The exhibition is based on a collection of around 5000 historical British comics housed in the Library (BIS) of the University of Oldenburg in Germany.

This is not a journal whose goal is female empowerment; instead, its purpose is intellectual and aesthetic edification: we hope to expose comics creators, scholars, and readers of all genders to ideas and art, and ideas about art.

Plagiarism (pronounced: play -juh-riz-um)  is the act of taking someone else&rsquo;s words, ideas, or information and passing them off as your own. If you don&rsquo;t give credit to the author  of these ideas in footnotes or endnotes and a bibliography, you are committing plagiarism, which is a serious academic offense.         Students, in the process of learning, acquire ideas from many sources and exchange ideas and opinions with classmates, professors, and others. This occurs in reading, writing, and discussion. Students are expected&mdash;often required&mdash;to build their own work on that of other people, just as professional researchers and writers do. Giving credit to someone whose work has helped one is courteous and honest; in fact, not to give such credit is a crime. Plagiarism is the severest form of academic fraud. Plagiarism is theft.       More specifically, plagiarism is presenting as your own:                   a phrase, sentence, or passage from another writer's work without using quotation marks;    a paraphrased passage from another writer's work;    facts, ideas, or written text gathered or downloaded from the Internet;    another student's work with your name on it;    a purchased paper or \"research\" from a term paper mill.       Other forms of academic fraud include:       \"collaborating\" between two or more students who then submit the same paper under their individual names.    submitting the same paper for two or more courses without the knowledge and the expressed permission of all teachers involved.    giving permission to another student to use your work for a class.       Proper acknowledgement marks the difference. It is your responsibility to know what constitutes plagiarism. Not knowing citation standards is not an excuse. When in doubt, err on the side of over-documentation and cite the source. You can also ask your professor, teaching assistant, or a librarian for help in determining what is and is not plagiarism.
