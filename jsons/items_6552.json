Gender identity describes the gender with which a person identifies (i.e., whether one uses man, woman, or more individualized terminology to describe oneself). One's gender identity may or may not differ from one's legal sex which is assigned at birth based on biological characteristics.                                                                                                                                                                        Who is eligible to be housed based on gender identity?                                                       Beginning in Fall 2008, all students will have the option to request to be housed based on their gender identity. This option is open to all students, regardless of identity.                                                                                                                                                                         What does \u2018transgender\u2019 mean?                                                       For many in the transgender - or \"trans\" - community, the term transgender encompasses any identities or expressions that differ significantly from the expected societal norms concerning the gender assigned at birth.                                                                                                                                                                        What if I prefer to be housed based on my gender identity?                                                       NYU will seek to place students who select this option in a room or suite with others of the same gender identity who have requested a room assignment on this basis. Every effort will be made to honor requests to be housed by gender identity, but if this is not possible, legal sex will be used in determining housing placement.                                                                                                                                                                        If I choose to be housed based on my gender identity, how will this weigh on my other housing options?                                                       NYU will make every effort to accommodate both your wish to be assigned housing based on gender identity, as well as your other preferences (i.e. low-cost housing, specific dorm choice, etc.). While all students are encouraged to provide housing preferences, NYU cannot guarantee to any student a specific dorm, room or roommate. All assignments are based upon space availability.                                                                                                                                                                        Will choosing the gender identity option help me to get better housing?                                                       The choice to be housed based on your gender identity is an additional option offered to all new incoming students. Choosing this option does not garner special consideration for specific rooms or locations.                                                                                                                                                                        What is the background of NYU\u2019s transgender housing procedure?                                                       In November 2005, the New York University Senate passed a resolution adding \"gender identity and expression\" to the University's Anti-Harassment Policy. A task force composed of students and staff members from the Division of Student Affairs was created to review and recommend a revised process by which students may request to be assigned to housing by their gender identity, rather than legal sex. Historically, all students received their room and roommate assignments automatically according to their legal sex. In Fall 2007, new students were able to request housing assignments based upon gender identity, rather than legal sex. Starting in Fall 2008, this option will be offered to all students. In accordance with our existing housing assignment process, we will seek to place students who select this option in a room or suite with others of the same gender identity who have requested a room assignment on this basis.                                                                                                                                                                        How do I get housing based on my gender identity?                                                       If you want to request to be assigned housing based on your gender identity, rather than legal sex, you may indicate that option on the existing housing application. In the housing preference section, click the box Gender Identity, then click the appropriate box indicating Gender Identity Male (GIM) or Gender Identity Female (GIF). You will also have the option to indicate if you have a preferred first name in addition to your legal name as it appears on the application.                                                                                                                                                                        What if a match cannot be made based upon my gender identity preference?                                                       In this rare situation, your assignment status will default to your    legal sex and you will be assigned accordingly.

If I am a returning undergraduate and indicate a preference to be assigned based on my gender identity on my reapplication (Phase I), how will this effect my lottery card submission (Phase II) and the online room selection process (Phase III)?                                                       Students who indicate on the Phase I reapplication a preference    to be assigned by their gender identity, will only be able to submit    a Phase II lottery card indicating that they would like to be housed with those who share the same gender identity    preference. The same holds true for the Phase III online room selection    process. Your group will be able to select an empty suite, designating    it as your gender identity, or if no empty suites are available you    will only be able to select spaces within suites already designated    with the same gender identity option.                                                                                                                                                                        What if no space is available?                                                       If no space is available at the time of your selection, we will    work with you and your \"group\" to place you over the summer,    or assign you based upon your legal sex.

This option is open to all students, regardless of identity.                                                                                                                                                                         What does \u2018transgender\u2019 mean?                                                       For many in the transgender - or \"trans\" - community, the term transgender encompasses any identities or expressions that differ significantly from the expected societal norms concerning the gender assigned at birth.                                                                                                                                                                        What if I prefer to be housed based on my gender identity?                                                       NYU will seek to place students who select this option in a room or suite with others of the same gender identity who have requested a room assignment on this basis. Every effort will be made to honor requests to be housed by gender identity, but if this is not possible, legal sex will be used in determining housing placement.                                                                                                                                                                        If I choose to be housed based on my gender identity, how will this weigh on my other housing options?                                                       NYU will make every effort to accommodate both your wish to be assigned housing based on gender identity, as well as your other preferences (i.e. low-cost housing, specific dorm choice, etc.). While all students are encouraged to provide housing preferences, NYU cannot guarantee to any student a specific dorm, room or roommate. All assignments are based upon space availability.                                                                                                                                                                        Will choosing the gender identity option help me to get better housing?                                                       The choice to be housed based on your gender identity is an additional option offered to all new incoming students. Choosing this option does not garner special consideration for specific rooms or locations.                                                                                                                                                                        What is the background of NYU\u2019s transgender housing procedure?                                                       In November 2005, the New York University Senate passed a resolution adding \"gender identity and expression\" to the University's Anti-Harassment Policy. A task force composed of students and staff members from the Division of Student Affairs was created to review and recommend a revised process by which students may request to be assigned to housing by their gender identity, rather than legal sex. Historically, all students received their room and roommate assignments automatically according to their legal sex. In Fall 2007, new students were able to request housing assignments based upon gender identity, rather than legal sex. Starting in Fall 2008, this option will be offered to all students. In accordance with our existing housing assignment process, we will seek to place students who select this option in a room or suite with others of the same gender identity who have requested a room assignment on this basis.                                                                                                                                                                        How do I get housing based on my gender identity?                                                       If you want to request to be assigned housing based on your gender identity, rather than legal sex, you may indicate that option on the existing housing application. In the housing preference section, click the box Gender Identity, then click the appropriate box indicating Gender Identity Male (GIM) or Gender Identity Female (GIF). You will also have the option to indicate if you have a preferred first name in addition to your legal name as it appears on the application.                                                                                                                                                                        What if a match cannot be made based upon my gender identity preference?                                                       In this rare situation, your assignment status will default to your    legal sex and you will be assigned accordingly. For more information,    please visit the    NYU LGBTQ Student Center in Kimmel Suite 602 or call 212-998-4424.                                                                                                                                                                             If I am a returning undergraduate and indicate a preference to be assigned based on my gender identity on my reapplication (Phase I), how will this effect my lottery card submission (Phase II) and the online room selection process (Phase III)?                                                       Students who indicate on the Phase I reapplication a preference    to be assigned by their gender identity, will only be able to submit    a Phase II lottery card indicating that they would like to be housed with those who share the same gender identity    preference. The same holds true for the Phase III online room selection    process. Your group will be able to select an empty suite, designating    it as your gender identity, or if no empty suites are available you    will only be able to select spaces within suites already designated    with the same gender identity option.                                                                                                                                                                        What if no space is available?                                                       If no space is available at the time of your selection, we will    work with you and your \"group\" to place you over the summer,    or assign you based upon your legal sex.

Policy Definitions     Transgender/Gender Non-Conforming- Anyone whose gender identity and/or gender expression does not match society's expectations of how an individual who was assigned a particular sex at birth should behave in relation to their gender.       Gender Identity - An individual's sense of being either male or female, man or woman, or something other in-between.           Gender Expression - The external characteristics and behaviors that are socially defined as masculine or feminine, such as dress, mannerisms, speech patterns, and social interactions.           Biological or Legal Sex - The sex legally assigned to an individual at birth, usually reflected in a birth certificate.           Title - This includes a prefix such as \"Mr.\", \"Mrs.,\" \"Miss\" and \"Ms.\"            Legal Name - The name legally given to an individual, which may be memorialized on a birth certificate, a court order, or certificate of naturalization.           Preferred First Name and Pronoun - The name and pronoun used by a transgender student that corresponds to the student's gender identity/expression.           New York University Office of the Registrar - The Office of the Registrar supports teaching and learning at New York University by maintaining the integrity of academic policies and the student information system.           Qualified Health Care Provider - A health care provider who has an  expertise in transgender, sex reassignment, and/or gender identity/gender  expression issues.           Qualified Mental Health Professional - A mental health care provider who has an  expertise in transgender, sex reassignment, and/or gender identity/gender  expression issues.                 Policy Statement     To assist in providing a comfortable and non-discriminatory University experience for students whose gender identity and/or gender expression does not conform to their assigned legal sex at birth, the University accepts requests from such students to change University records to reflect their gender identity and/or gender expression.               Process for Changing Biological or Legal Gender to Gender Based on Identity or Expression     Students who enroll at New York University under their biological or legal sex may change their gender in the student records system to reflect their gender identity and/or gender expression, which may differ from the sex assigned to them at birth. Such students should complete the Change of Student Information form and provide one of the following documents to substantiate the change:             Pre- or post-operative documentation from a qualified health care provider         A letter of support from a qualified mental health professional        A birth certificate or court order legalizing the preferred gender or        A valid social security card, driver license, or passport reflecting the gender identity or expression.                      Effect of Change in Student Records     A student's preferred title, first name, pronoun, and gender will be reflected in all of the student's University documents, including but not limited to the student's NYU identification card, directory listing, class rosters, and health center records.      Please be advised that changing your name and/or gender in the University's student records is not the same as legally changing your name and/or gender through the courts (or in the case of gender, through a birth certificate in some States) and you may be challenged when you are asked to provide proof of your legal name and/or identity for employment or government purposes, such as obtaining a passport.            FERPA       A student's preferred title and first name will be disclosed as \"directory information\" unless the student refuses to permit such disclosure. For further information on disclosure of directory information, please refer to New York University's Guidelines for Compliance with the Family Educational rights and Privacy Act (FERPA)            Policy Contact     Please contact Academic Records online or at (212) 998-4280, with any questions regarding this policy and process.      Disclaimer: This policy does not form a contract of any kind and may be  modified, changed, altered, or rescinded by NYU at its discretion.

Gender identity describes the gender with which a person identifies (i.e., whether one uses man, woman, or more individualized terminology to describe oneself). One's gender identity may or may not differ from one's legal sex which is assigned at birth based on biological characteristics.                                                                                                                                                                        Who is eligible to be housed based on gender identity?                                                       Beginning in Fall 2008, all students will have the option to request to be housed based on their gender identity. This option is open to all students, regardless of identity.                                                                                                                                                                         What does \u2018transgender\u2019 mean?                                                       For many in the transgender - or \"trans\" - community, the term transgender encompasses any identities or expressions that differ significantly from the expected societal norms concerning the gender assigned at birth.                                                                                                                                                                        What if I prefer to be housed based on my gender identity?                                                       NYU will seek to place students who select this option in a room or suite with others of the same gender identity who have requested a room assignment on this basis. Every effort will be made to honor requests to be housed by gender identity, but if this is not possible, legal sex will be used in determining housing placement.                                                                                                                                                                        If I choose to be housed based on my gender identity, how will this weigh on my other housing options?                                                       NYU will make every effort to accommodate both your wish to be assigned housing based on gender identity, as well as your other preferences (i.e. low-cost housing, specific dorm choice, etc.). While all students are encouraged to provide housing preferences, NYU cannot guarantee to any student a specific dorm, room or roommate. All assignments are based upon space availability.                                                                                                                                                                        Will choosing the gender identity option help me to get better housing?                                                       The choice to be housed based on your gender identity is an additional option offered to all new incoming students. Choosing this option does not garner special consideration for specific rooms or locations.                                                                                                                                                                        What is the background of NYU\u2019s transgender housing procedure?                                                       In November 2005, the New York University Senate passed a resolution adding \"gender identity and expression\" to the University's Anti-Harassment Policy. A task force composed of students and staff members from the Division of Student Affairs was created to review and recommend a revised process by which students may request to be assigned to housing by their gender identity, rather than legal sex. Historically, all students received their room and roommate assignments automatically according to their legal sex. In Fall 2007, new students were able to request housing assignments based upon gender identity, rather than legal sex. Starting in Fall 2008, this option will be offered to all students. In accordance with our existing housing assignment process, we will seek to place students who select this option in a room or suite with others of the same gender identity who have requested a room assignment on this basis.                                                                                                                                                                        How do I get housing based on my gender identity?                                                       If you want to request to be assigned housing based on your gender identity, rather than legal sex, you may indicate that option on the existing housing application. In the housing preference section, click the box Gender Identity, then click the appropriate box indicating Gender Identity Male (GIM) or Gender Identity Female (GIF). You will also have the option to indicate if you have a preferred first name in addition to your legal name as it appears on the application.                                                                                                                                                                        What if a match cannot be made based upon my gender identity preference?                                                       In this rare situation, your assignment status will default to your    legal sex and you will be assigned accordingly.

If I am a returning undergraduate and indicate a preference to be assigned based on my gender identity on my reapplication (Phase I), how will this effect my lottery card submission (Phase II) and the online room selection process (Phase III)?                                                       Students who indicate on the Phase I reapplication a preference    to be assigned by their gender identity, will only be able to submit    a Phase II lottery card indicating that they would like to be housed with those who share the same gender identity    preference. The same holds true for the Phase III online room selection    process. Your group will be able to select an empty suite, designating    it as your gender identity, or if no empty suites are available you    will only be able to select spaces within suites already designated    with the same gender identity option.                                                                                                                                                                        What if no space is available?                                                       If no space is available at the time of your selection, we will    work with you and your \"group\" to place you over the summer,    or assign you based upon your legal sex.

Policy Definitions     Transgender/Gender Non-Conforming- Anyone whose gender identity and/or gender expression does not match society's expectations of how an individual who was assigned a particular sex at birth should behave in relation to their gender.       Gender Identity - An individual's sense of being either male or female, man or woman, or something other in-between.           Gender Expression - The external characteristics and behaviors that are socially defined as masculine or feminine, such as dress, mannerisms, speech patterns, and social interactions.           Biological or Legal Sex - The sex legally assigned to an individual at birth, usually reflected in a birth certificate.           Title - This includes a prefix such as \"Mr.\", \"Mrs.,\" \"Miss\" and \"Ms.\"            Legal Name - The name legally given to an individual, which may be memorialized on a birth certificate, a court order, or certificate of naturalization.           Preferred First Name and Pronoun - The name and pronoun used by a transgender student that corresponds to the student's gender identity/expression.           New York University Office of the Registrar - The Office of the Registrar supports teaching and learning at New York University by maintaining the integrity of academic policies and the student information system.           Qualified Health Care Provider - A health care provider who has an  expertise in transgender, sex reassignment, and/or gender identity/gender  expression issues.           Qualified Mental Health Professional - A mental health care provider who has an  expertise in transgender, sex reassignment, and/or gender identity/gender  expression issues.                 Policy Statement     To assist in providing a comfortable and non-discriminatory University experience for students whose gender identity and/or gender expression does not conform to their assigned legal sex at birth, the University accepts requests from such students to change University records to reflect their gender identity and/or gender expression.               Process for Changing Biological or Legal Gender to Gender Based on Identity or Expression     Students who enroll at New York University under their biological or legal sex may change their gender in the student records system to reflect their gender identity and/or gender expression, which may differ from the sex assigned to them at birth.

Psychologists consider some individual characteristics to be  fixed while others are understood as flexible, such as preferences and  intellectual ability. Professionals in the field of child development do not  often put gender identity development in a category apt for much variation.  However, sometimes gender identity is not so cut and dry. A small percentage of  our population feels that their &ldquo;brain&rdquo; is one gender while their &ldquo;body&rdquo; is  another, a phenomenon known as Gender Identity Disorder (GID). This variation  from the norm creates immense discomfort and inhibits some children from  developing a strong, confident sense of self (Hepp, Kraemer, Schnyder, Miller  &amp; Delsignore, 2005). In fact, past research has demonstrated that when is  GID experienced in childhood, it has been correlated with low self-esteem and  has been disruptive of healthy identity development (Hepp et al., 2005).       Recently,  inclusion of GID in the upcoming DSM-V has been a subject of debate. As the DSM  currently stands, GID is considered an illness that can be &ldquo;treated,&rdquo; and many  psychologists argue that considering only one form of gender identity  development to be &ldquo;healthy&rdquo; may define gender in a heteronormative way (Zucker,  2006). The lack of understanding about the true causes and considerations  involved in GID only leaves room for discriminatory, stereotyped classification  of individuals developing gender identities. Society passes judgment in the  face of uncertainty and the mystery of sex and gender is no exception. However,  a neurological understanding of gender identity as it relates to sexual  identity may allow both clinicians and the public increased exposure to  constructs related to sex and gender. By increasing public knowledge about  gender identity development beyond the hetero-normative tradition, we may be  able to improve social acceptance for both children and adults diagnosed with  GID, who do not fall in the traditional gender paradigm.    Society&rsquo;s Medical Model       The  medical model of our society has created a dualism in which infants, children,  and adults are either male or female. Nothing apart from this dichotomy is  typically tolerated, as society does not leave room for ambiguous gender  expression or genderless people. For example, infants born with intersex  conditions like congenital adrenal hyperplasia in genetic females and steroid  5\uf061- reductase 2 deficiency in genetic males undergo near immediate surgery to  &ldquo;correct&rdquo; the condition by sculpting the child as a male or female (Zucker,  2002). The assumption in these cases is that the human brain is organized in a  sexually dimorphic manner and gender identity is not taken into account  separately from sexual identity. Therefore, the current model advocates that an  individuals&rsquo; gender identity should never deviate from physical or genetic sex.  However, it does happen and when it does, these individuals are labeled with a  &ldquo;disorder:&rdquo; GID as described in the DSM-IV-TR is defined as:          [E]vidence  of a strong and persistent cross- gender identification, which is the desire to     be, or the insistence that one  is, of the other sex. [...] To make the diagnosis,  there must     be evidence of clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, of     other  important areas of functioning (APA, 2000).    Classifying GID this way assumes that the  gender identity development of individuals with GID is maladaptive and  dangerous. In turn, these individuals internalize that very societal under-  standing of their situation, often feeling that they do not belong in the body  assigned to them by nature. This thought process might lead to a lack of  self-confidence and uncertain sense of self (Zucker, 2002). Furthermore, the  comorbidity of psychiatric and personality disorders is extremely high for  those diagnosed with GID.       Society&rsquo;s  medical model has further defined transsexualism as a disorder based on the  desire of individuals to &ldquo;correct&rdquo; GID with surgery. Transsexualism is defined  as &ldquo;desire to live and be accepted as a member of the opposite sex, usually  accompanied by a sense of discomfort with, or inappropriateness of one&rsquo;s  anatomic sex, and a wish to have surgery and hormonal treatment to make one&rsquo;s  body as congruent as possible with one&rsquo;s preferred sex&rdquo; (APA, 2000). The 1 out  of 30,000 adult males and 1 out of 100,000 adult females who identify as  transsexual often undergo major hormone therapy, surgery, and lifelong  complications that, despite their desires, do not &ldquo;fix&rdquo; the psychological  problem of not fitting into society&rsquo;s mold (APA, 2000). Despite the presence of  corrective surgery in the Western world, social norms indicate that no person  can ever completely be a member of the other sex.    The Need for Neurological Answers       Currently,  there is a significant lack of neurological evidence that defends or disputes  the idea that the brain is sexually dimorphic, and if so, where exactly  &ldquo;gender&rdquo; and &ldquo;sexual&rdquo; identities are located. The brain structures speculated  to be the home of gender and sexual identity, are acted upon by hormonal  activation at both puberty and prenatally. These activation periods are  relatively well understood, yet they do not account for all of our gendered  behavior. Further, genetic sex remains unaccounted for. If society and the  medical profession insist on diagnosing the small percentage of the population  that do not fit into assumed, socially constructed roles then evidence must be  found to defend the belief that gender is neurologically determined.       However,  the question of the origin of gender identity remains. The term &ldquo;gender  identity&rdquo; was coined in the 1960&rsquo;s by Hooker and Stoller, who defined it as &ldquo; a  young child&rsquo;s developing a fundamental sense of belonging to one sex, and not  the other&rdquo; (Hooker &amp; Stoller as quoted in Zucker, 2002). Hooker goes on to  say that gender identity is assessed using a structured verbal interview in  children. However, this study shows that most children do not have a sense of  their own gender identity unless it is somewhat confused against the &ldquo;normal&rdquo;  (Zucker, 2002). Therefore, if gender identity, like all assumed human  characteristics, is based in the brain, how would a verbal interview possibly  aid neurological classification? Gender is fundamental to the human experience,  and society has created such a distinction between the two that the lack  neurological information regarding the differences between the developing sexes  creates a remarkable paradox. With more research in the field of gender  identity development, early detection and intervention will be possible to  assist children in developing a strong sense of identity and to reduce the  number of comorbid psychological conditions associated with gender identity  disorder in any stage of life.       When  a scholarly study refers to gender identity confusion, there is no blood test,  MRI, or combination of answers to a questionnaire that can make a diagnosis.  Instead, the diagnosis refers specifically to a detailed interview and  psychiatric evaluation adhering to DSM-IV-TR criteria. When a neurological site  is found for gender identity that is different from biological sex an argument  can be made against simple biological sexual dichotomy and the legitimacy of  GID as a disorder can be debated. In the present time, people afflicted with  so-called GID are treated with hormones dictated by the medical model and  current knowledge of clinicians and live in emotional turmoil because they are  unable to forge a complete identity in the eye of society.    Gender Identity &ldquo;Disorder&rdquo; Damage throughout  the Lifetime       Naturally,  the preoccupation with a desire to be a different gender starts early in life  and as a result many psychiatric disorders develop due to lack of  understanding, acceptance, and professional care. It would seem then, that a study  of children and their comprehension of their gender conflict would provide  answers to how gender identity is perceived at a young age. The damage  associated with labeling these children as &ldquo;disordered&rdquo; further inhibits  children&rsquo;s ability to develop a strong sense of self. The intense stress of a  &ldquo;disorder&rdquo; in childhood impacts this damaged sense of self throughout the  lifetime and is intensified by the lack of knowledge around gender identity in  the brain.       Current  research attempts to isolate gender identity from biological sex in children in  order to determine the validity of GID, and therefore lessen or even eliminate  the stress and damage associated with the labeling as gender disordered.  Research conducted by Simonelli, Rossi, Tripodi, Stasio, and Petruccelli (2007)  attempts to isolate gender identity in children as its own separate entity  apart from sex differentiation and sexual orientation. However, since a child  is often unaware of his/her development, it can be difficult to decipher how a  child feels about his/her gender unless he/she feels something is wrong  (Simonelli et al., 2007). Through this study, Simonelli et al (2007) found that  only 11 out of the 246 children had any atypical gender answers, but none were  more atypical than typical (Simonelli et al., 2007). In other words, no child  answered questions outside of his/her biological sex more times than in  congruence with his/her biological sex. These few atypical profiles, all of  which were female, showed gender non-conformity, aggression, and low  conscientiousness (Simonelli et al., 2007). The majority of children reported  being satisfied with their gender, and none of the atypical profiles met the  diagnostic criteria for GID (Simonelli et al., 2007). Interestingly, over 40%  of the children could not find positive attributes to their gender indicating  that children age 9 to 13 often do not understand their own gender in  comparison with others (Simonelli et al., 2007). Due to the lack of concrete  evidence for GID in children, generalizations about how children feel about  their gender identity under &ldquo;normal&rdquo; circum- stances are almost impossible  (Simonelli et al., 2007). Although first of its kind, this study paves the way  for researchers and clinicians to begin to understand that gender identity may  be complex and fluid.       Though  children may experience discomfort with their gender during their childhood  years, not all individuals who display atypical gendered behaviors in childhood  go on to identify as transsexual as adults. In fact, many people who prefer to  identify as the opposite gender during childhood no longer feel that way after  puberty. Though 5% of girls and 2.6% of boys show opposite sex behaviors during  childhood, this percentage shrinks to 2% of girl and 1% of boys in adolescence (Asscheman,  2009). However, for those individuals who continue to experience gender  discomfort after puberty, the damage done by peers and violations of social  norms is perpetual. As a result of this damage, the number of referrals of  adolescents with possible GID has tripled in the last 30 years (Asscheman,  2009). As many as 25-27% of adolescents who felt discomfort with their gender  in childhood continue this behavior through adolescents and beyond, while 75%  identify as homosexual or bisexual (Asschemann, 2009). These statistics suggest  that childhood identification of gender is not an indicator of adult  transexualism, lending support to the notion that gender is not necessarily  hard-wired at birth. In fact, the gender constructions of these children may be  centered on their ability to adapt to their environment. Though childhood  gender role association develops into gender identity, which is located in the  brain (Zucker 2002), there is no formula of understanding whether children who  identify as gender dysmorphic will eventually identify as transsexual.      As it stands, the damage done by this early  diagnosis and &ldquo;treatment&rdquo; or lack of proper management of individuals with GID  is well reflected in adults with the condition. In a study done by Hepp et al.  (2005) it was found that 45% of GID adults had been diagnosed with a mood  disorder in their lifetime, compared with 12.9% of the general population.  Futhermore, 45% of GID adults have also been diagnosed with a substance abuse  disorder, compared with 9.7% of the general population (Hepp et al, 2005).  These remarkable statistics may indicate that diagnoses may fail to properly  address gender identity concerns instead exacerbating them.    Hormones       Hormones  also play a role in developing gender identity at two distinct time periods in  our lives. Prenatal hormones cause hard-wired, permanent brain organization.  GID theoretically roots itself in the idea that individuals are prenatally  wired for one sex, but identify as another in childhood. However, the hormones that  aid in the neurological hard wiring of biological sex have a second activation  at the onset of puberty, meaning that many children who felt that they were the  wrong gender pre-puberty now feel gender satisfied as the hormones activate to  create secondary sex characteristics. These new roles are &ldquo;right&rdquo; in 73-93% of  gender-confused children (Zucker 2002; Asschemann, 2009). Because of the very  small percentage of people feel lifelong gender dysmorphic, it seems that some  individuals are born with a biological sex that his/her gender identity  contradicts, while others grow up feeling unsatisfied with their gender until  puberty sways the hormonal influence back toward their assigned sex in  accordance with gender identity. Therefore, hormonal activation in the brain  does not independently create gender identity, but it is a reliable predictor  of gender identity confusion if the confusion extends into adolescent and into  adulthood (Asschemann, 2009).       A  recent study by Swaab (2007) reviews what is currently known about the sexual  differentiation of the brain areas and what areas are responsible for gender  identity, sex, and sexual orientation, including the effects of hormones.  Sexual differentiation brings about permanent prenatal changes in brain  structures and functions. This is due to interactions of the developing neurons  with the environment&mdash;formed by surrounding nerve cells, hormones, nutrients,  medication, and other chemical substances in utero (Swaab, 2007, p. 431).  Specifically, testicles and ovaries develop in the 6th week of pregnancy due to  genetic sex of the fetus. It is thought that hormonal influences at this time  have a direct effect on the brain&rsquo;s gender identity while biological sex is  developing. Specifically, androgens produced by the Y chromosome account for  the sexual differentiation between 6-12 week of pregnancy, while female  development is based on the absence of androgens (Swaab, 2007).       Brain  differentiation is due to influence of androgens on the developing brain that  is permanent and organizational. In utero, hormonal influences on the brain  peak at 34-41 weeks, then again 3 months after birth. The three month post  birth period is considered arbitrary considering many sex-defining surgeries in  cases of ambiguity are done right after birth with no further gender confusion.  These two hormonal peaks organize and program the brain sexually for life with  the presence/absence of testosterone (Swaab, 2007). Later, during puberty,  brain circuits are activated by sex hormones and secondary sex character-  istics develop. The rising hormone levels &ldquo;activate&rdquo; circuits that were built  during development, and behavioral patterns and dis- orders that originate much  earlier in development, such as schizophrenia, are expressed (Swaab, 2007).  Sexual differentiation occurs in two independent processes that can result when  people with male sexual organs feel female and vice versa in the brain (Swaab,  2007). Since there are two distinct activation periods of gendered hormones,  Swaab&rsquo;s research states that a discrepancy in gender identity and sex are routed  in the brain&rsquo;s chemistry.       Swaab  (2007) generalizes these hormonal processes in brain structure and function:          Different  brain structures that result from interaction between hormones and     developing brain cells are thought to  be the basis of sex differences in the structure  of     the brain, and thus of behavior, gender identity, gender role, sexual orientation, and sex     differences regarding  cognition and aggression. (p. 433)    Thus, Swaab (2007) asserts that hormonal  influence creates our biological sex as well as our gender identity and sexual  orientation during development, but they are distinct in both development and  identification. Therefore, there is no proof that social environment has any  effect on gender identity or sexual orientation. While research does not yet  completely explain the process by which gender identity is developed in the  brain, such examples using specific intersex conditions offer possible future  research findings.    Learning from Intersex Conditions and  Socialization       Scholars  researching gender indentify disorder and its possible causes and solutions  learn from the information on the biologically concrete intersex conditions.  Intersex individuals&rsquo; have an anatomical difference in their sexual organs  different from individuals that are typically male or female (Zucker, 2002). In  genetic boys with steroid 5\uf061-reductase 2 deficiency, a disorder that prevents  testosterone from producing male genitalia, a &ldquo;girl&rdquo; with a large clitoris is  born. These children, subsequently, are raised as girls and there is no cause  to think otherwise until puberty when testosterone production increases and  this &ldquo;clitoris&rdquo; grows to penis size, the testicles descend, and the child  begins to appear masculine. 60% of these children choose to live as  heterosexual men, even though they were raised as girls due to the brain  organization that testosterone inflicts on the brain prenatally (Swaab, 2007).  The remaining 40% of people with steroid 5\uf061-reductase 2 deficiency continue to  live as women. Without taking sexual orientation into account, that is a  significant percentage. Thus, the influence of hormones may not be strong  enough to sway all brain organization toward one gender expression at any given  time. Evidence from these cases of &ldquo;explained&rdquo; gender identity dysmorphia  offers insight to GID itself, which is not associated with any type of physical  difference to typically developing males and females.       In  line with Swaab&rsquo;s (2007) findings and the theories of John Money in the 1950&rsquo;s,  40% of individuals with steroid 5\uf061-reductase 2 deficiency live as their  socially constructed gender (Zucker 2002). Money spent his life trying to prove  that gender identity was a product of society, a learned way of life. His  famous John/Joan experiment involved a genetic male whose penis was damaged  during circumcision and was subsequently raised as a girl. Much to John Money&rsquo;s  dismay, after childhood, &ldquo;Joan&rdquo; chose to live as a man and eventually committed  suicide in May 2004. Therefore, gender identity is at least in part socially  constructed, but there are clearly other factors at play.       As  with steroid 5\uf061-reductase 2 deficiency, genetic girls who possess excess  testosterone in the womb, or congenital adrenal hyperplasia do not always go on  to identify as females when adults. Yet, they do not always go on to identify  as male either. These girls tend to be &ldquo;tomboys&rdquo; as children, prefer boys as  playmates, and are more aggressive than other girls (Zucker, 2002). These girls  are also more likely to identify as lesbians or transsexuals than the rest of  the population, but neither are always the case. The risk of transexuality in  these girls is only 1-3% and those with serious gender problems are 5.2%  leading to the consensus that these girls should be raised as girls despite the  high levels of testosterone in utero (Swaab, 2007). Based on the current  research, it is clear that neither hormones nor socialization create a  definitive gender identity in the brain that can be used to predict gender from  one case to the next.    Gender Identity in the Brain       Swaab  &amp; Garcia-Falgueras, (2008) believe the have isolated specific structures  that may be responsible for gender identity in the brain. According to their  research, this network of structures in the brain is responsible for gender and  sexual orientation as both genetically and socially expressed (Swaab &amp;  Garcia-Falgueras, 2008). While differences in the number of neurons and size of  the INAH-3 and BSTc were originally thought to be just sex differences, now  with more careful analysis they can be viewed as the discrepancy between  biological sex and gender identity.       These  structures responsible for biological sex and gender identity are all separate  parts in the brain, each with a different component and developmental  trajectory. Such research supports the idea that gender identity and biological  sex can be thought of as separate from individual identity. The structures, all  of which are related to the SDN-POA (Sexually Dimorphic Network), include the  INAH1 and 2, which are related to the SCN, the BSTc, and the INAH3 and 4, which  are all located in the hypothalamus of the brain (2008). Each of these  structure differs from person to person based on lifestyle lived. For example,  adult Male- to- Female transgender individuals who receive no hormone  injections or surgery in their lifetime have an INAH-3 volume of a male, but a  neuron number of a female. On the other hand, hormone-treated Male-to-female  transgender individuals have an intermediate value and a BSTc the size of  typical female. However, the hormone treatments are not believed to have caused  this change (Swaab &amp; Garcia-Falgueras, 2008). Swaab and Garcia-Falgueras&rsquo;s  (2008) findings indicate that the brain chemistry of individuals who identify  as transgender is different from those individuals who do not, regardless of  the presence of hormone treatment.       An  individual who is exclusively attracted to women has an INAH-3 volume of a male  because it is believe that the volume of the INAH-3 structure displays that of  sexual orientation and has no correlation to the size of the BSTc, which is  believed to be representative of personal gender identity (Swaab &amp;  Garcia-Falgueras, 2008). Therefore, these structural differences cannot be  accounted for by hormone treatment or castration later in life. Instead, the  differences are representative of early developmental abnormalities and  differences during the critical fetal periods opposed to non-transsexuals.  Therefore, the possible cause of atypical gender presentation presumes a  combination of genetic background and early organizational effect on the  interaction of sex hormones with the developing brain during critical fetal  periods (Green &amp; Keverne quoted in Swaab &amp; Garcia-Falgueras, 2008).  Individuals who have lifelong GID experience different hormonal breakdown,  different gender role transition, and different sexual organizational effects  in their brains than individuals without GID. Sexual differentiation of the  brain occurs later in development and can be influenced independently of  genital differentiations; the resulting modifications in brain structures in  transsexual people are hypothesized to be the basis of GID (Swaab &amp;  Garcia-Falgueras, 2008). With the tools to differentiate the gender identity  structure and the biological sex structure, it is clear that specific measures  can be developed to better understand GID. Firstly, both gender identity and  biological sex structures remain atypical in transgendered people with or  without reassignment therapy throughout the lifespan, suggesting that gender  identity is hardwired at birth (Swaab &amp; Garcia-Falgueras, 2008). This  finding is the key to understanding that gender identities that are not  &ldquo;normal&rdquo; are not necessarily unhealthy or physiologically maladaptive.    Conclusion       Researchers  in the field of sex and gender are on the brink of understanding a wealth of  knowledge about the brain&rsquo;s gender expression. However, to make decisions about  children&rsquo;s lives based on assumed knowledge is premature. There are several  genetic and inborn intersex conditions and syndromes that leave society wanting  to &ldquo;fix&rdquo; the problem by uprooting natural anatomy, yet similar gender  confusions exist without this anatomical disruption. These individuals are  labeled gender identity disordered in childhood and many go on to identify as  transgender as adults. The &ldquo;cure&rdquo; for the gender problem must be related to on  a case-by-case basis until more neurological information is available to  actually &ldquo;test&rdquo; for such a discord between brain and body. There is a great  need for more research in the area so that young children do not have to suffer  with an identity imposed by society that leads to psychological distress and  disorder in addition to not feeling at home in one&rsquo;s own body. For the first time,  neurological findings conclude that there are differences in gender identity in  the brain. Swaab&rsquo;s (2008) findings isolate differences between transgender  individuals and those of the assigned and identifying sexes. This research  offers the first glance into the richness of a transgendered individual&rsquo;s  brain. Indentifying as one gender and looking like another can one day be a  source of pride and insight, yet the lack of dissemination of this information  leaves most, if not all, gender deviant children struggling with this  completely alone. Their isolation for resources and clinical support leads to  poor self identity and self esteem and can even lead to adulthood substance  abuse and Axis 1 psychiatric disorders. All of this could result because a child  feels he cannot express his or her true self.       Researchers  in the field of gender and sexual identity have a responsibility to create  effective management models for identity development. Currently, treatment is  necessary to help children feel comfortable with their gender expression when  it is non-normative. Neurological researchers are still struggling to  understand the real difference between people with these afflictions, but  during this time it is wrong to call the confusion a disorder before it is fully  understood, as scientists did until the 1970&rsquo;s with homosexuality. Neither the  affects of prenatal and puberty hormones nor socialization alone are enough to  explain gender identity development, the process must lie in a brain structure.  Perhaps someday, when society catches up with research, there will be no need  to force a gender upon a child and the desire to live as another gender will  not be considered a disorder at all.
