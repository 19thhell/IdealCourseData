Along with the studio classes, students will have the opportunity to meet and have their work critiqued by contemporary artists. This program is free of charge . The Visionary Studio ( scheduled on 4 of the Saturdays, TBD ) part of the program brings in working artists to lecture about their work and critique projects done in the classroom. Students will have an opportunity to ask questions and acquire more in depth knowledge of what it means to be an artist in the modern age.    On the final day of the program, we will bring in several artists and Steinhardt alumni for a final critique of the work done during the entire program. The following day, we will have a one-day final exhibition of the work in the art building, opened to all family and friends. During the exhibition, all work will be documented for the students and given to them for their final portfolio.    With these workshops we aim to not only help teenagers find their voices through art, but also in everyday life. As part of the class, each student presents his/her own work, thus affording the opportunity to hone communication and presentation skills. We feel that this part of the program helps to develop skills, which can be useful in preparation for college, and ultimately outside the classroom. High school students must apply with a portfolio of work to be admitted to the Advanced Workshop.    Spring 2015 Advanced Art Workshop    The next workshops will be offered on nine Saturdays this spring from 9:30am-12:30pm:    2/28, 3/7, 3/14, 3/21, 3/28, 4/18, 4/25, 5/2, 5/9 Plus Sunday 5/10, Final Exhibition &amp; Reception *Visionary Studio lecture series will meet from 1:00-3:00pm on dates TBD. If accepted to participate, attendance in all of these dates is mandatory.    Advanced Art Workshop Descriptions    Sculpture In this class, students will learn two different ways of making sculpture. The first half of this course will engage students in the basic processes of moldmaking with plaster and clay. You will cast objects of their choosing using press molding and slip casting, and have the option of firing their work. The second half of this course will focus on soft sculpture as a medium, using various types of textiles. Technical skills such as machine and hand sewing, grommetting, and basic pattern making will be covered. Students will use these skills to respond to basic sculptural prompts. Additionally, students will participate in class critiques of their projects. Brief lectures will be given on contemporary sculpture.    Experimental Painting This class, as opposed to the traditional introductory classes in painting which usually focus on basic technique, will take a more modern approach to painting and focus on what we as contemporary viewers value from painting today. The goal is not to dismiss technique (for it is obviously very important) but to expose younger students who might not otherwise have the chance, to what it means to be a painter today. Experimentation will be key, not for its own sake, but for the rewards that will arise from trial and error.    Photo/Digital Art This course will include an introduction to several techniques in creating digital artwork. Students will learn basic skills in image and video editing software, which will provide the basis for completing several class projects, as well as discuss how digital techniques can be useful in creating traditional works. The class will begin by looking at digital photography/collage and progress into video and the moving image. Further, we will be looking at a number of contemporary and modern artists working in the field as a means of contextualizing work completed in the class.

Along with the studio classes, students will have the opportunity to meet and have their work critiqued by contemporary artists. This program is free of charge . The Visionary Studio ( scheduled on 4 of the Saturdays, TBD ) part of the program brings in working artists to lecture about their work and critique projects done in the classroom. Students will have an opportunity to ask questions and acquire more in depth knowledge of what it means to be an artist in the modern age.    On the final day of the program, we will bring in several artists and Steinhardt alumni for a final critique of the work done during the entire program. The following day, we will have a one-day final exhibition of the work in the art building, opened to all family and friends. During the exhibition, all work will be documented for the students and given to them for their final portfolio.    With these workshops we aim to not only help teenagers find their voices through art, but also in everyday life. As part of the class, each student presents his/her own work, thus affording the opportunity to hone communication and presentation skills. We feel that this part of the program helps to develop skills, which can be useful in preparation for college, and ultimately outside the classroom. High school students must apply with a portfolio of work to be admitted to the Advanced Workshop.    Spring 2015 Advanced Art Workshop    The next workshops will be offered on nine Saturdays this spring from 9:30am-12:30pm:    2/28, 3/7, 3/14, 3/21, 3/28, 4/18, 4/25, 5/2, 5/9 Plus Sunday 5/10, Final Exhibition &amp; Reception *Visionary Studio lecture series will meet from 1:00-3:00pm on dates TBD. If accepted to participate, attendance in all of these dates is mandatory.    Advanced Art Workshop Descriptions    Sculpture In this class, students will learn two different ways of making sculpture. The first half of this course will engage students in the basic processes of moldmaking with plaster and clay. You will cast objects of their choosing using press molding and slip casting, and have the option of firing their work. The second half of this course will focus on soft sculpture as a medium, using various types of textiles. Technical skills such as machine and hand sewing, grommetting, and basic pattern making will be covered. Students will use these skills to respond to basic sculptural prompts. Additionally, students will participate in class critiques of their projects. Brief lectures will be given on contemporary sculpture.    Experimental Painting This class, as opposed to the traditional introductory classes in painting which usually focus on basic technique, will take a more modern approach to painting and focus on what we as contemporary viewers value from painting today. The goal is not to dismiss technique (for it is obviously very important) but to expose younger students who might not otherwise have the chance, to what it means to be a painter today. Experimentation will be key, not for its own sake, but for the rewards that will arise from trial and error.    Photo/Digital Art This course will include an introduction to several techniques in creating digital artwork. Students will learn basic skills in image and video editing software, which will provide the basis for completing several class projects, as well as discuss how digital techniques can be useful in creating traditional works. The class will begin by looking at digital photography/collage and progress into video and the moving image. Further, we will be looking at a number of contemporary and modern artists working in the field as a means of contextualizing work completed in the class.

Erato, Ana Marva Fernandez, Mara Siegel, JJ Veronis    Grade Level: 9-12    How is power exercised, exploited, and experienced in society?       What kinds of power exist in society?    How does social power affect our perception of ourselves?    How does a symbol acquire power? How do symbols or icons have power over us?    How does the economy affect us individually?    How can you intervene in oppressive power structures?       From mass media, to peer pressure, to politics, power is a part of everyday life. As media consumers, we are exposed to information that has been processed and selectively presented to us. Art has the potential to incite and promote cultural and political resistance. It is a medium that can be used to engage citizens in political discourse and garner opposition to existing hierarchical structures. Revolutions transform an established mindset into a new ideal that unites the dissatisfied populace. Collaborative art practices have the potential to transform everyday life and standard ways of being, thinking and behaving. As artists, we address the topic of power in order to rediscover ourselves as free citizens; we become storytellers, examining the multiple facets of life affected by socio-economic inequalities. Art provides an interdisciplinary and uncensored approach to the transmission of new messages to mass audiences. In this class, we will use art to reflect on our social and political selves and participate in changing unjust situations. Class Sessions Week 1: Power and Me Students consider how we understand power in society and create a work of art that reflects negative or positive experiences with power in order to reveal or transform a specific power dynamic. Week 2: Social Power Students will discuss how social power affects social norms, their perception of themselves, their impression of others, social pressure, and the expectations that they have of themselves. Using popular icons from magazines or their memory, students will represent an aspect of social power that affects them. Week 3: Marks on Bodies This lesson explores symbols: how they are created and how they acquire power. Students will also explore what it means to wear a mark or a symbol on the body. Week 4: i-Consume Students will investigate where power exists in relation to the economy and how it affects them on a personal level. Using spoof ads and contemporary art images students will use strategies of irony and juxtaposition to create their own visual commentary on power and consumption. Weeks 5-8: Talk Back This lesson is designed to explore meaningful exchange in the public domain in order to address social change. Students will examine unfair power dynamics they have experienced in their lives and visually &lsquo;talk back&rsquo; utilizing a public context.
