Students in other divisions should therefore consult their academic advisers for specific information about how the Core pertains to them.    The Core affords students flexibility in a number of ways. It permits a choice of different tracks in each component, the satisfaction of some courses by examination or Advanced Placement credit (foreign language, FSI), and the substitution of departmental courses and exemptions based on major and minor courses of study (FSI, parts of FCC).    Given this flexibility, students in CAS work individually with advisers to plan course schedules that take into account their past preparation, current interests, and longer-term goals. While there is no prescribed schedule of courses that will be appropriate for every student, the following broad guidelines should be kept in mind.    As an incoming student, you should normally aim to complete your Core courses by the end of sophomore year. This will leave you free in your junior and senior years to focus on your major and to take elective courses. Some science and social science majors, engineering students, prehealth students, and students placed in the International Writing Workshop sequence may have to delay starting, and thus finishing, a part of the Core for a semester or more. Students who study away from New York may also need to delay completing their Core courses beyond sophomore year.    In designing the Core, the faculty sought to assure that all students would receive a broad exposure to the liberal arts early in their college careers. With this wide academic horizon, the Core encourages students to discover new intellectual interests outside their intended areas of specialization and to pursue those interests with elective courses outside their majors in their later undergraduate years.    Foreign Language: See the foreign language section of this website for complete details.    Expository Writing: Students must complete Writing the Essay (EXPOS-UA 1) during their first year. Those placed into the Liberal Studies Writing or International Writing Workshop sequences must begin in their first semester and must register for their remaining writing course(s) in the semester(s) immediately following.    Foundations of Contemporary Culture: During their first year, students normally complete a class from Texts and Ideas (CORE-UA 4xx) and one from Cultures and Contexts (CORE-UA 5xx), in either order. In the sophomore year, students chose classes from Societies and the Social Sciences (CORE-UA 6xx) and from Expressive Culture (CORE-UA 7xx), again in either order. Student who complete a designated major or minor program in the social sciences are exempt from Societies and the Social Sciences. Those who complete a designated major or minor program in the humanities are exempted from Expressive Culture. Students who complete majors in each area, who complete a joint major designated in both areas, or who complete a major in one area and a minor in the other, may satisfy both components. See the Exemptions, Substitutions, and Proficiency Exams section of this website for a list of the area designations of major and minor programs in the College.    Foundations of Scientific Inquiry: Students choose one course in Quantitative Reasoning (CORE-UA 1xx), followed by one in the physical sciences from Natural Science I (CORE-UA 2xx), and then one in the biological sciences from Natural Science II (CORE-UA 3xx). Completion of or exemption from Quantitative Reasoning is a prerequisite for both Natural Science I and II. It is recommended that students complete Natural Science I before Natural Science II. See the Exemptions, Substitutions, and Proficiency Exams section of this website for information about satisfying parts of the FSI with Advanced Placement credit or through the substitution of departmental courses.    Advice on Selecting Your Core Classes    Tips from students about choosing your courses:    Find out all you can about the faculty member teaching the class. Although Core classes are non-departmental, faculty members obviously each have a particular disciplinary or methodological bent. Look at the instructor\u2019s course evaluations (available in the Student Center on Albert) and departmental affiliation (included with the course descriptions on this website). Also, check out his or her faculty profile .    Read the course description. Look at the reading lists for different sections, especially in Texts and Ideas, to find the class that most appeals to you.    Check out the course syllabus before registering. It is often possible to consult a sample syllabus or a syllabus from the last time a faculty member taught his or her Core class. Where available, copies of syllabi are included with the course descriptions on this website.    Registration Reminders    Recitations and laboratories are an integral part of all FCC and FSI courses; they are not optional. Plan accordingly, keeping in mind that you must reserve space in your class schedule for two lectures and one recitation or lab section per week.    Because of the intensive nature of Core classes and the time needed to schedule recitations and labs, students should not register for more than one FCC or more than one FSI course at a time.    Study Away    The Core is intended to provide students with a core experience in the liberal arts at the very beginning of their college careers. In general, student should therefore have completed the Core before undertaking study away from New York. Opportunities to fulfill parts of the Core away from New York are limited: Some of the University\u2019s global sites offer departmental courses that can be substituted in satisfaction of the Core (FSI, FCC Societies and the Social Sciences). Sections of the FCC course Cultures and Contexts are regularly offered at some study away sites; sections of the FCC course Expressive Culture are offered away on a limited basis. See the course listings on this website for each semester\u2019s offerings.    Substitution of courses to and from NYU-Abu Dhabi is also available on a limited basis.

The campaign will be led by Evan Chesler, the chairman of Cravath, Swaine, and Moore and an NYU Trustee who credits the financial aid he received as both an NYU undergraduate and an NYU law school student as crucial to his success.   The campaign has already raised more than $200 million, including more than $75 million in a collective lead gift from a group of \u201cpartner\u201d Trustees -- Marge and William R. Berkley, Barbara and Evan R. Chesler, Jay M. Furman, Susan and Martin Lipton, Klara and Larry Silverstein, Judy and Michael H. Steinhardt, Bea and Anthony Welters, Leonard A. Wilf, and The Starr Foundation.     John Sexton said, \u201cWe\u2019ve had an ambitious agenda at NYU during my 11 years as president, and the NYU community has had many successes of which it can be proud.&amp;nbsp; But when I am asked what I think is NYU\u2019s most persistent and pressing challenge, and what our most important fundraising priority is, the answer is: financial aid. In spite of spending over $195 million annually in grant aid, and in spite of significant improvements over the past decade, we are still not where we want to be or need to be, largely owing to our low per- student endowment. And that\u2019s why I consider the Momentum Campaign so important \u2013 a focused and high-profile effort to increase NYU\u2019s ability to award scholarships.\u201d   Evan Chesler said, \u201cI attended NYU at a time when it was going through an existential financial crisis. But in spite of how short money was then, the University remained so focused on its mission that it was willing to extend a generous scholarship to a young man who it felt showed promise, and I became the first in my family to go to college and to law school. So I consider it a great honor to be the chair of the Momentum Campaign, in hopes that when we are done, NYU will be able to extend to even more young people the chance to have an education they might otherwise not be able to afford.\u201d   Two New Scholarship Programs Begin Right Away      NYU is starting two new scholarship programs as outgrowths of Momentum Campaign: the Finish Line Grant program , and the Global Pathways Scholarship (GPS) program .   The Finish Line Grant program, which will begin next semester, provides scholarship assistance to undergraduates receiving financial aid as they approach their final semester, lowering their debt upon graduation. NYU will provide grant aid equal to 10% of a student\u2019s cumulative need-based federal loan amount, thereby reducing the total amount owed. This represents a permanent reduction in a student\u2019s debt of not only the grant amount, but the compound interest that would have been paid on it.   The Global Pathways Scholarship program, which will start next fall, will review each student who has expressed an interest in studying abroad at one of NYU\u2019s global sites, and \u2013 depending on his or her financial need \u2013 add to their financial aid package a grant (up to a maximum of $4,000) to cover the additional costs of studying abroad. The GPS program will enable this distinctive and integral NYU experience to be made available to students who otherwise might have been precluded because of financial constraints, such as lost wages or the added expenses of travel.
