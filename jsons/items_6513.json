Bio &amp; Publications            About the Course   New York City, growing from the small Dutch commercial settlement of New Amsterdam early in the seventeenth century into a bustling multi-cultural city of more than 8 million and metropolis of more than 18 million by the twentieth century, is a place with many stories. A semester of 14 weeks can only touch on some of them.   Key Topics   This course will focus on the social history of the city \u2013 the peoples who have built the city and competing efforts by different numbers to authorize their dreams for the city. As arguably the capital for global capitalism today, one focus of this course will seek to plot its development and legacy for the shaping of the city. A more particular and related local story will be studied as well, however: the political and cultural interests, ideologies and players who shape and reshape the city as Manhattan, as New York and as the Metropolis.

It is dedicated to the role of America in the world with an emphasis on processes of transnational exchange in U.S.-European relations in the twentieth century, and more particularly in the period of the Cold War. Klimke analyzes the multi-faceted impact \u201cAmerican\u201d ideas and cultural practices have had once adopted in different sociopolitical settings, and the ways in which U.S. history has become intertwined with other countries\u2019 politics and societies. The increasingly global cultural, political, and military presence of the United States, especially after World War II, as well as the country\u2019s complex entanglement with the forces of globalization, are at the center of his scholarly interests. A special focus of his research is transnational protest movements, processes of cultural transfer, and global networks of dissent, e.g. with respect to 1960/70s protest movements, the African American freedom struggle in the 20th century, or the grassroots activism of the 1980s.   Bio   Martin Klimke studied at the University of Goettingen, Amherst College, and the University of Heidelberg. Before joining New York University Abu Dhabi, he taught at the University of Heidelberg, Georgetown University, Rutgers University, and Meiji University, Tokyo.       He is currently co-directing the research projects and digital archives The Civil Rights Struggle, African American GIs, and Germany and The Civil Rights Struggle, African American GIs, and Germany (www.aacvr-germany.org) and Nuclear Crisis: Cold War Cultures and the Politics of Peace and Security, 1975-1990 (www.nuclearcrisis.org).

Bio &amp; Publications            About the Course   New York City, growing from the small Dutch commercial settlement of New Amsterdam early in the seventeenth century into a bustling multi-cultural city of more than 8 million and metropolis of more than 18 million by the twentieth century, is a place with many stories. A semester of 14 weeks can only touch on some of them.   Key Topics   This course will focus on the social history of the city \u2013 the peoples who have built the city and competing efforts by different numbers to authorize their dreams for the city. As arguably the capital for global capitalism today, one focus of this course will seek to plot its development and legacy for the shaping of the city. A more particular and related local story will be studied as well, however: the political and cultural interests, ideologies and players who shape and reshape the city as Manhattan, as New York and as the Metropolis.

It is dedicated to the role of America in the world with an emphasis on processes of transnational exchange in U.S.-European relations in the twentieth century, and more particularly in the period of the Cold War. Klimke analyzes the multi-faceted impact \u201cAmerican\u201d ideas and cultural practices have had once adopted in different sociopolitical settings, and the ways in which U.S. history has become intertwined with other countries\u2019 politics and societies. The increasingly global cultural, political, and military presence of the United States, especially after World War II, as well as the country\u2019s complex entanglement with the forces of globalization, are at the center of his scholarly interests. A special focus of his research is transnational protest movements, processes of cultural transfer, and global networks of dissent, e.g. with respect to 1960/70s protest movements, the African American freedom struggle in the 20th century, or the grassroots activism of the 1980s.
