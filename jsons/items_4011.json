Through close and critical readings of primary texts we will explore how certain themes (e.g. justice, truth, love, desire, writing, persuasion) are expressed across different genres, and how (and how successfully) philosophy and the emerging arts of poetics and rhetoric distinguish themselves from one another throughout classical antiquity. Throughout our study we will take gender as a guiding question, asking how the texts construct and portray gender, how gender is deployed as an organizing principle, and how conceptions of gender are thereby developed and consolidated in them. Authors include Homer, Heraclitus, Parmenides, Plato, Aristotle, Sappho, Euripides, Aristophanes, Horace, Longinus, and various recent commentators. All readings will be in translation; students with Greek/Latin are encouraged to refer to the original texts.  Junior Theory Seminar: Modernity  Iampolski   Modernity is a product of Enlightenment that dramatically changed the face of the Western culture by proclaiming the autonomy and supremacy of human Reason. This new attitude allowed an unprecedented development of science and became a basis for many fundamental achievements of the Western civilization. However the same attitude has created a lot of contradictions that define modernity. The course is designed to analyze the antinomies of the culture of modernity. We will start with a founding document of European rationalism - philosophical statements by Descartes and will see how the cult of Reason and the great western political principles (equality of rights, the rule of law) related to the dominance of Reason are paradoxically responsible for new kinds of violence and social exclusion. The following subjects will be discussed: individual and masses in modern society; violence and modern war; totalitarianism; mechanization of life, alienation, machines; the emergence of subjectivity and the \"loss experience\"; market, capitalism, and many others.  Topics in 20th Century Lit: The Literature of Dictatorship in Spain and Latin America Matos-Martin This course will analyze representations of the traumatic dictatorial histories of Spain and the Southern Cone countries (Argentina, Chile and Uruguay) from a comparative perspective. We will focus on literary and visual sources such as short stories, novels, fiction films or documentaries, and we will examine topics such as the politics of memory, fascism, political disappearance, war, resistance or violence. Some authors and filmmakers whose works we might engage include Manuel Rivas, Alberto M\u00e9ndez, Luisa Valenzuela, Julio Cort\u00e1zar, Isaac Rosa, Mario Benedetti, Eduardo Galeano, Andr\u00e9s Wood, Marco Bechis, Guillermo del Toro, Agust\u00edn Villaronga, and Ken Loach. Primary materials will be paired with texts by leading cultural and political thinkers working on questions of memory, fascism, terror and violence.  Readings in Contemporary Literary Theory: Theory of Narrative Sanders Have you wondered how a novel or short story guides you as a reader toward a particular interpretation? How is the meaning of a given work generated by the way in which the work is constructed? This is the central question posed by the theory of narrative. Addressing key narratological topics such as point of view, levels of narration, character and plot, and narrative time, we will read selected realist, modernist, and postmodernist works of growing narrative complexity from across the globe. With works by Balzac, Conrad, Robbe-Grillet, Coetzee, and Wicomb as our primary texts, we will explore how the theory of narrative may usefully complement deconstructive, psychoanalytic, feminist, and postcolonial approaches to reading fictional (and non-fictional) narrative texts. We shall also explore issues of filmic narrative as arise in the adaptation of novels for the screen. Our theoretical works will include writings by Mieke Bal, Roland Barthes, Fredric Jameson, and others.  Evolution of Literary Archetypes: Comparative Romanticisms Sieburth Virginia Woolf once quipped, \u201cOn or about December 1910, human character changed,\u201d but she was probably off by more than a century. Most cultural historians would instead locate this seismic shift in the late eighteenth-century with the emergence of the phenomenon loosely termed Romanticism. Rousseau\u2019s Confessions (posthumously published in 1782) are to our modernity what Augustine\u2019s were to Antiquity and provide the foundational text for what it sometimes called our contemporary Culture of Narcissism. Rousseau\u2019s writings, and in particular his emphasis on the individual\u2019s victimization by society, make possible Goethe\u2019s Storm-and-Stress hero, Werther (who commits suicide) and B\u00fcchner\u2019s Lenz and Woyzeck (both of whom go mad). After exploring these various figures of the Pariah, we will examine the Promethean Overreacher, embodied by Goethe\u2019s Faust and Mary Shelley\u2019s Victor Frankenstein. The social and political ferment that accompanied these emerging archetypes of the Romantic Hero finds its most violent expression in the ideal of Revolution. We will read the American and French Revolutions from the perspectives of Blake ( in his early prophecies), Wordsworth (in selections from The Prelude), and Hugo (in his gothic novel about the Haitian Revolution, Bug-Jargal). The final portion of the semester will be devoted to the Romantic Heroine, as depicted in Bront\u00eb\u2019s Wuthering Heights and Flaubert\u2019s Madame Bovary.  Senior Seminar in Comparative Literature: Honors Thesis Vatulescu This seminar, limited to senior Comparative Literature majors engaged in writing a senior honors thesis, is designed to be a writing workshop. Students will articulate and research a thesis topic, identify an appropriate critical approach and methodology, and write at least one chapter of their thesis. Periodical writing installments give the students the opportunity to receive feed-back from their peers and instructor as well as to learn to critique others' work-in-progress. Permission of the DUGS is required to enroll in the course. Students must also have a 3.65 or better GPA, both overall and in the major. The Senior Thesis Seminar must be followed by Independent Study (COLIT-UA 997) to complete the honors thesis.  MAP : Texts and Ideas: Animal Humans Lezra \"One might go so far as to define man as a creature that has failed in its effort to keep its animalness\u2026\" So writes the German philosopher Peter Sloterdijk. What sort of animal were we? Where, how, and by whom has the line between the human and the animal been drawn? With what consequences for our \"human\" understanding of the world? Of concepts like the \"soul,\" \"society,\" politics, the family? Is the line between the human and the animal drawn differently in different genres--in literary works, theological treatises, natural histories, paintings, films? We come at these questions from different angles, following them from antiquity to early modern responses to these questions, and in essays by contemporary philosophers and advocates. Readings: Genesis, Numbers, Euripides' Bacchae, Plato's Phaedrus, Ovid's Metamorphoses, Apuleius' Golden Ass, Marie de France' Bisclavret, Shakespeare's Midsummer Night's Dream, Montaigne's \"Apology in Defense of Raymond Sebond, Machiavelli's Prince, H. G. Wells's Island of Dr. Moreau and Island of Lost Souls, Derrida's \"The Animal that therefore I am,\" selections from Boccaccio, Peter Singer, Giorgio Agamben, Donna Haraway.  Readings in Contemporary Literary Theory: Metropolis and World Literature Zhang As an introduction to the concept and discipline of comparative literature, this course examines how modern metropolises in different parts of the world nourish and challenge literary sensibilities, and how modern literature, by treating the city as both its environment and its hero, evolves from realism to modernism and beyond. Our goal is two-fold: On the one hand, and more immediately concerning literature, it seeks to revive Goethe\u2019s notion of Weltliteratur (world literature) in our own time, not by searching for an overarching theme of human experience and culture in which a universal definition of humanity can be reached once and for all, but only by going through different historical, social, and national situations which manifest themselves in terms of cultural and political differences and self-assertions. On the other hand, and regarding a broader interest in the city itself and its representation in the major works of world literature and film, the course is also intended to engage in common issues of our times such as individuality versus community and collectivity; locality versus globality; past versus present, as they are mediated and intensified by urban forms, experiences, and sensibilities. By hopping from city to city, we hope to construct a trajectory of world literature and its world-historical moments of intensity, which is often articulated through the self-images of the great cities. We will be particularly concerned with how the city and literary imagination interact with one another; how the city can be seen as a producer of cultures, subjectivities, diversity, dissent, and unity; and how the urban experience shapes our understanding of time, space, self, and other. The course is also an imagined field trip to some of the major cities on the literary and intellectual map of the modern world. We will visit London in Charles Dickens and T.S. Eliot; Paris in Hugo, Baudelaire, and Flaubert; Dublin in Joyce, Berlin in Water Benjamin; St. Petersburgh in Dostoyevsky and Andre Bely, New York in Dreiser and Fitzgerald, and finally, across the Pacific, Shanghai, and Beijing, the two urban centers that capture the imagination of modern China as they are portrayed in Lao She and Mao Dun, two leading writers of Chinese realist literature. The EuroAmreican and East Asian focus is by no means limiting. There will be a few classes reserved for students who are interested in reading and discussing other cities in other national literary and cultural traditions. Our readings will be centrally literary but some films will be introduced, both as a visual aid and more importantly a different regime of senses and symbolisms entangled with the city. Each class period will be divided into a short lecture and sustained discussions. Students are also expected to do class presentations and act as discussion leaders. Grades will be based on a 1-2 pp weekly journal on the assignment, and a 10pp final paper.

We will start with a   founding document of European rationalism - philosophical statements by   Descartes and will see how the cult of Reason and the great western   political principles (equality of rights, the rule of law) related to   the dominance of Reason are paradoxically responsible for new kinds of   violence and social exclusion.The following subjects will be discussed: - Individual and masses in modern society; - Violence and modern war; - Totalitarianism; - Mechanization of life, alienation, machines; - The emergence of subjectivity and the \"loss experience\"; - Market, capitalism, and many others. Senior Seminar in Comparative Literature: Honors Thesis Garcia This   seminar, limited to senior Comparative Literature majors engaged in   writing a senior honors thesis, is designed to be a writing workshop.   Students will articulate and research a thesis topic, identify an   appropriate critical approach and methodology, and write at least one   chapter of their thesis. Periodical writing installments give the   students the opportunity to receive feed-back from their peers and   instructor as well as to learn to critique others' work-in-progress.   Permission of the DUS is required to enroll in the course. Students   must also have a 3.65 or better GPA, both overall and in the major. The   Senior Thesis Seminar must be followed by Independent Study (COLIT-UA   997) to complete the honors thesis. Topics in Asian Studies: The Planetary Imagination Kaffen The planetary has emerged a contested site across a variety of fields   from comparative literature and area studies to media studies and   philosophy. Partly marking itself off from older universalist claims   (cosmopolitanism, world history, globalization), the planetary   imagination as we will discuss it in this class foregrounds an   ecological dimension and at the same time, shifts the grounds of   human-centered thought and politics. While touching on a wide variety of   issues, including technology, scale, identity, and ethics, the core   problem for the class will be to consider \u201cthe world\u201d from a standpoint   that does not privilege the human as its center or apex. The goal of the   course is neither to immediately endorse nor repudiate a critique of   anthropocentrism, but to examine some of its diverse forms of   expression, underlying assumptions, and possible repercussions. To that   end, this class seeks to explore the planetary imagination from a   broadly (and possibly contradictory) humanities-based perspective, at   the intersection of area studies (East Asia in particular) and   comparative literature\u2014through fiction, philosophy, and contemporary   arts and media. Travel Literature Halim  The course \u201cTravel Literature\u201d  brings together a set of theoretical, critical and literary texts about travel  from the Middle Ages to the present. While transnationalism and mobility appear  to typify our times, this course traces much older trajectories of travel in  relation to questions of motive (e.g.: imperialism, ethnography, hajj ), genre (guidebook, letters home, travelogue,   Rihla , travel blog, etc.) and shifting  perceptions of \u201cEast\u201d and \u201cWest.\u201d The course brings together theoretical  readings\u2014by, among others, James Clifford, Mary Louise Pratt and Edward Said\u2014and  literary texts\u2014by, among others, Ibn Battuta, Rifa\u2019a Rafi\u2019 al-Tahtawi, Edward  Lane, Mourid Barghouti, and Jamaica Kincaid.      Culture and Politics in the Hispanic World: A Transatlantic Perspective Matos-Martin      This course will explore the intersections of culture and  politics in Spain and Latin America with a special focus on their entangled  histories. In that light, we will consider different issues to engage  \u201cTransatlantic\u201d perspective as a comparative paradigm to flesh out shared  histories and experiences. These may include colonialism, dictatorships and  exile, immigration processes, exclusions, or today\u2019s neoliberal States. We will  analyze literary and visual sources such as short stories, novels, poems,  painting, fiction films or documentaries. Primary materials will be paired with  texts by leading cultural and political thinkers working on questions of  biopolitics, transatlantic studies, immigration, globalization, exclusion or  violence. Readings in Contemporary Literary Theory: Conflict Sanders      Conflict is an underlying theme  in many, if not most, contemporary theorists. In this class, we will explore  some of the forerunners of this conflict thinking in Marx, Nietzsche, and  Freud, as well as in its uses, sometimes critical, by, among others, Carl  Schmitt, Melanie Klein, Jacques Derrida, Judith Butler, Slavoj Zizek, and  Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak. In order to measure the explanatory power of our  theorists, we shall read them over against more literal accounts of  conflict\u2014the famous war memoirs of Ernst J\u00fcnger and Michael Herr.

In other words, we like to think of ourselves as subjects. The self-conscious and autonomous subject constitutes itself in relation to what is \u2018other.\u2019 But what is this \u2018other\u2019? The word \u2018other\u2019 does not always refer to another person: It may also refer to constitutive events, or \u2018necessary fictions.\u2019 These \u2018others\u2019 may be the addressees of our poems, the material and immaterial products of our imaginations, and indeed the otherness we find in ourselves. How do we relate to these \u2018others\u2019? How do desire, action, and ethical duty (but also fate, guilt, and the law), allow us to perceive ourselves as free? We will explore these and other questions as they have been posed in literary works by Aeschylus, Sophocles, Plato, Ovid, Garcilaso de la Vega, Racine, Keats, Poe, Gautier, Baudelaire, Melville, Lorca, Kafka, Beckett, paintings by Da Vinci and Vel\u00e1zquez, and philosophical and theoretical writings by Kant, Hegel, Freud, Marx, Saussure, Heidegger, Lacan, and Levinas. Though the tragic fate of Agamemnon or Oedipus appears inevitable, in our reading we explore how fate is a necessary fiction that enables action. Today we have transferred the power of fate onto other essentialized constructs such as the free market, advertising, or intelligence organizations which come to structure our desires and dictate the course of our lives. We will trace how inspiration may be found in negation by reading literary texts on the unknown contents of letters \u2013 as in Poe \u2013or on endless waiting for what will never come\u2014as in Melville and Beckett. Situated at intersection of the different discourses that comprise Comparative Literature \u2013 fiction, poetry, art, philosophy, psychoanalysis, and political theory \u2013 this class aims to problematize the notion of modern subjectivity. Our primary concerns will be at once ethical and poetic: How can what exceeds knowledge and representation signal itself in thought?            Classical Literature &amp; Philosophy: Gender &amp; Genre    Bianchi    Thurs   11:00-1:45pm   COLIT-UA 160   In this course we will explore the co-emergence of philosophy and various literary genres (epic, lyric poetry, dialogue, tragedy, comedy) in ancient Greece and Rome, as well as the development of literary and rhetorical theory. Through close readings of primary texts we will observe how certain themes (e.g. justice, love, desire) are expressed across different genres, and how (and how successfully) philosophy and the emerging arts of poetics and rhetoric distinguish themselves and develop throughout the classical antiquity. Authors include Homer, the Presocratic philosophers, Plato,Aristotle, Sappho, Euripides, Aristophanes, Lucretius, Cicero, Horace, Longinus, Quintilian, and various modern and contemporary commentators. Our study will be divided into five thematic units: 1. First Beginnings; 2. Philosophy and Poetry; 3. Love and Desire in Ancient Greek Philosophy and Literature; 4. Classical Rhetoric. The course will be primarily discussion based. We will work on carefully understanding, analyzing, and criticizing texts, considering the significance of genre in classical thinking, appreciating classical texts in their cultural context, and developing written and spoken skills. Each week students will be required to read approximately 60-120 pages of text (toward the upper end for literary texts, and the lower end for philosophical/theoretical texts).        African Literature: Arts, Literature &amp; Film    Diawara Thurs 2:00-4:45pm COLIT-UA 844   A look at contemporary African Literature, film and art as a way of examining different outcomes of postcolonial cultural policies and practices in Africa. The main topics include 1) a discussion of the Negritude Movement and the artistic legacy of Leopold Sedar Senghor; 2) a close look at the Guinean Cultural Revolution and the African experimentations with Marxist and socialist realist art forms; 3) Pan-Africanism and art; and 4) the post-nationalist writers and video artists of Nigeria. The aim of the class is to provide students with a sense of the context of artistic productions in Africa. It is hoped that students will gain an understanding of some of the major trends in African literature and film; and become conversant with the politics, aesthetics and reception theories behind African imaginative works.      Topics in Film and Literature: South by South: Ideological Maps And Fictions of Uneven Development Dopico Tues 2-4:45pm COLIT-UA 300.001 SPAN-UA 551.002 This course considers the \u201cidea of  the South\u201d as geopolitical territory, imaginary landscape and ideological  map:a fictive and creative topos where  regional mythology, racial divisions, national contests, and cultural  imperialism together produce extraordinary narratives and alternative histories.  Reading comparatively, south by south,  we discover a dynamic cultural genealogy from the global South\u2019s western  hemisphere that precedes the urgency of current debates about uneven  development and the problems of North and South. We will encounter artists who manipulate and  contest the political imaginary and the fictive qualities  assigned to the South and its subjects.Engaging works that exalt or decry that ideological geography, we will  examine how these artists remake \u201cthe South,\u201d and how they engage the North and  its fictions.    Lectures and section discussions will  consider works that reflect on different Souths and consider how they portray  seductive, dangerous, infantile, charming, backward, or even criminal cultures.  In texts, visual art, and films from Europe and the Americas, we will consider  how realities and fantasies of the South are represented, how a global South  becomes a true fiction, and how writers from \u201cSouthern\u201d places respond to the  realities of uneven development and to their own barbarous, childlike, or  exotic status on political maps and cultural markets. We will question why writers explore lost  worlds, or belatedly return to a region\u2019s buried history to fictively rework  and revive the past. We will consider  why outsiders, children, and outlaws are central tropes. We will think about  the exceptional \u201crepresentational burden\u201d of Southern artists and consider how  they negotiate their double bind -- how they engage the biases and appetites of  the North and at the same time respond to the weight of history, self-hatred  and loyalty in the South. In our reading  we will trace the tension of the North-South axis in narratives that \u201cexplain\u201d  the South and those who live or pass through it. We will consider stories that manipulate the  status of the native artist (or native informant), the promise and mirage of  the cultural tourist, the uneasy spectatorship of the imperial traveler, the ressentiment   of the exile, and the collecting and  correcting anthropology of the political and economic immigrant. Thinking about the relationship between geopolitics  and regional mythology, we will consider the enduring forms of this imaginary  and ideological mapping, how it has been vital to nationalism, empire and  neo-colonialism, but also how it continues to function in the political  conflicts and cultural markets of \u201cglobalization.   Primary texts will include many  of the following Giuseppe di Lampedusa, The Leopard, Leonardo Sciascia, The  Wine Dark Sea, Thomas Mann, \u201cDeath in Venice,\u201d \u201cMario and the Magician,\u201d   Albert Camus, The Stranger, Andr\u00e9 Gide, \u201c The Immoralist,\u201d W.E.B DuBois, The Souls of Black Folk, William  Faulkner, Absalom, Absalom!, Zora Neale Hurston, Their Eyes Were  Watching God, Richard Wright, Black  Boy , selections from Uncle Tom\u2019s Children, Flannery O\u2019Connor, Wise  Blood , The Violent Bear It Away, Dorothy Allison, Bastard out of  Carolina, Alejo Carpentier, The Lost Steps, Juan Rulfo, Pedro  P\u00e1ramo, Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez, One Hundred Years of Solitud, Junot D\u00edaz, The Brief Wondrous Life of  Oscar Wao. Films will  include a selection from: The Leopard, Salvatore  Giuliano, Rocco and His Brothers, Divorce Italian Style, La terra trema, Death  in Venice, L\u2019America, Birth of a Nation,  The Emperor Jones, Baby Doll, Suddenly Last Summer, Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, Cabin  in the Sky, Raisin in the Sun, Daughters of the Dust, Gone With the Wind,  Jezebel, The Little Foxes, To Kill a Mockingbird, Cape Fear, Cool Hand Luke, Deliverance,  The Heart is a Lonely Hunter, Slingblade, La ultima cena, Memorias del subdesarrollo, Lugar sin l\u00edmites       Topics in 20th Century Literature: Richard Wright's Books   Garcia    Mon 12:30-3:15pm   COLIT-UA 190.002   SCA-UA 715 In a scene from his classic book Black Boy, Richard Wright describes the clandestine means by which he obtained library books otherwise unavailable to him in the segregated, color-coded social world of the early twentieth-century U.S. South. By the early 1940s, when he became the most famous black writer in the world and acquired a global reading public, Wright had amassed a wide range of books across many genres and literary traditions. This course explores Wright's career through an examination of works that figured in his intellectual formation and works by authors Wright in turn influenced. The course begins with key writings by Wright and the critical reception of his work in the U.S. and Europe during his lifetime and proceeds through a chronological examination of pivotal texts he encountered. Works by Marx, Proust, Horatio Alger, Gertrude Stein, H. L. Mencken, Theodore Dreiser, Jean-Paul Sartre, Ralph Ellison, George Lamming, Lillian Smith, James Baldwin, William James, and Kenneth Burke, among others, will form the course reading list.      Jr. Theory Seminar: Modernity    Iampolski    Tues 4:55-7:35pm   COLIT-UA 200   Modernity is a product of  Enlightenment that dramatically changed the face of the Western culture by  proclaiming the autonomy and supremacy of human Reason. This new attitude  allowed an unprecedented development of science and became a basis for many fundamental achievements of the Western  civilization. However the same attitude has created a lot of contradictions  that define modernity. The course is designed to analyze the antinomies of the  culture of modernity. We will start with a founding  document of European rationalism - philosophical statements by Descartes and  will see how the cult of Reason and the great western political principles (equality of rights, the rule of  law) related to the dominance of Reason are paradoxically responsible for new  kinds of violence and social exclusion.   The following subjects (among  others) will be discussed:   -- Modern Rationality and Modern  Science.   -- Changing notion of Experience.   -- New understanding of Space, Distance, Time.   -- Culture of appearances.   -- Nation, State.   -- Democracy and Totalitarianism.   -- Violence, War and Discipline.   -- Machines.   -- Market, Money and the Struggle for Survival.   -- Commodity and Desire.    Readings include: Marx,  Freud, Descartes, Arendt, Foucault, Benjamin, Elias, Deleuze, Balibar, Lefort  and many others.      Topics in 20th Century Literature: Paranoid Narratives Sanders Wed 12:30-3:15pm COLIT-UA 190   It\u2019s no secret that we live in an age of paranoia. What  began as a psychiatric diagnosis may now be the predominant form taken by our  experience of politics and of technology. But could there be something about  the very structure of narrative itself\u2014its \u201cvoices\u201d and its \u201cspeakers\u201d\u2014that is  paranoid, or gives rise to paranoia? Tracing psychoanalytic theories of  paranoia (Sigmund Freud, Melanie Klein), and attending no less to their   narrative structure, we address this question and others by reading key  autobiographical and fictional works, such as may include Daniel Paul  Schreber\u2019s Memoirs of My Nervous Illness , George Orwell\u2019s Nineteen  Eighty-Four , James Ellroy\u2019s American  Tabloid , as well as political writings and documents by Richard Hofstadter,  Michel Foucault, Julian Assange (Wikileaks), South African AIDS denialists, and  Rwandan g\u00e9nocidaires .      Studies in Prose Genres: Autobiography Sieburth Mon/Wed 11:00-12:15pm COLIT-UA 125   The word Autobiography can be etymologically decomposed  into: autos (\u201cself\u201d) + bios (\u201clife\u201d) + graph\u00ea (\u201cwriting\u201d), and over the course of the semester we will be looking at the interaction of these three elements as the genre of autobiography evolves over time. Until the 20 th century, autobiography has been, for the most, a predominantly Western practice\u2014for very specific religious and cultural reasons, which we shall explore and which have to do with the particular constructions of the \u201cself\u201d associated with the Judeo-Christian tradition. Examples of autobiographical writing, however, can also be found in classical Chinese and Japanese cultures, and we shall accordingly examine a few samples of these at the outset of the course by reading a few short Confucian autobiographies, selections from The Pillow Book of Sei Shonagan , and Shen Fu\u2019s Six Records of a Floating Life . We will then turn our attention to the Confessions of St. Augustine, a conversion narrative which in many ways provides the master-text of Western autobiography. This will be followed by another Christian \u201cLife,\u201d the earliest known text of its sort in vernacular English, the 15 th -century Book of Margery Kempe . Selections from Montaigne\u2019s Essays will then be placed against this religious tradition of autobiography: emphasis will be laid not only on the more secularized or \u201chumanist\u201d notions of the self emerging during the Renaissance, but on the essay-form itself as providing a non-narrative model for self-portraiture. From Montaigne, we will turn to Puritan and early Republican America, represented by the \u201ccaptivity narrative\u201d of Mary Rowlandson and by Ben Franklin\u2019s slippery account of his self-fashioning into celebrity. This will lead into a reading of the first six books of Rousseau\u2019s Confessions , which rewrite Augustine while setting the agenda for the next two centuries of modern autobiography. Equally influential, at least insofar as the African American literary tradition is concerned, is the Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass , which blends elements of the sentimental novel and the European picaresque into a call for political self-liberation through writing. The final unit of the course will focus on the impact of psychiatry and psychoanalysis on modern autobiography: the texts include Aur\u00e9lia , G\u00e9rard de Nerval\u2019s account of his descent into \u201cmadness,\u201d Michel Leiris\u2019s post-surrealist Manhood , and the poet H.D.\u2019s account of her analysis in Vienna with the master himself, Tribute to Freud. Note: Course enrollment limited to 20. Requirements: Four short papers (5-7 pp.) over the course of the semester.

Through close and critical readings of primary texts we will explore how certain themes (e.g. justice, truth, love, desire, writing, persuasion) are expressed across different genres, and how (and how successfully) philosophy and the emerging arts of poetics and rhetoric distinguish themselves from one another throughout classical antiquity. Throughout our study we will take gender as a guiding question, asking how the texts construct and portray gender, how gender is deployed as an organizing principle, and how conceptions of gender are thereby developed and consolidated in them. Authors include Homer, Heraclitus, Parmenides, Plato, Aristotle, Sappho, Euripides, Aristophanes, Horace, Longinus, and various recent commentators. All readings will be in translation; students with Greek/Latin are encouraged to refer to the original texts.  Junior Theory Seminar: Modernity  Iampolski   Modernity is a product of Enlightenment that dramatically changed the face of the Western culture by proclaiming the autonomy and supremacy of human Reason. This new attitude allowed an unprecedented development of science and became a basis for many fundamental achievements of the Western civilization. However the same attitude has created a lot of contradictions that define modernity. The course is designed to analyze the antinomies of the culture of modernity. We will start with a founding document of European rationalism - philosophical statements by Descartes and will see how the cult of Reason and the great western political principles (equality of rights, the rule of law) related to the dominance of Reason are paradoxically responsible for new kinds of violence and social exclusion. The following subjects will be discussed: individual and masses in modern society; violence and modern war; totalitarianism; mechanization of life, alienation, machines; the emergence of subjectivity and the \"loss experience\"; market, capitalism, and many others.  Topics in 20th Century Lit: The Literature of Dictatorship in Spain and Latin America Matos-Martin This course will analyze representations of the traumatic dictatorial histories of Spain and the Southern Cone countries (Argentina, Chile and Uruguay) from a comparative perspective. We will focus on literary and visual sources such as short stories, novels, fiction films or documentaries, and we will examine topics such as the politics of memory, fascism, political disappearance, war, resistance or violence. Some authors and filmmakers whose works we might engage include Manuel Rivas, Alberto M\u00e9ndez, Luisa Valenzuela, Julio Cort\u00e1zar, Isaac Rosa, Mario Benedetti, Eduardo Galeano, Andr\u00e9s Wood, Marco Bechis, Guillermo del Toro, Agust\u00edn Villaronga, and Ken Loach. Primary materials will be paired with texts by leading cultural and political thinkers working on questions of memory, fascism, terror and violence.  Readings in Contemporary Literary Theory: Theory of Narrative Sanders Have you wondered how a novel or short story guides you as a reader toward a particular interpretation? How is the meaning of a given work generated by the way in which the work is constructed? This is the central question posed by the theory of narrative. Addressing key narratological topics such as point of view, levels of narration, character and plot, and narrative time, we will read selected realist, modernist, and postmodernist works of growing narrative complexity from across the globe. With works by Balzac, Conrad, Robbe-Grillet, Coetzee, and Wicomb as our primary texts, we will explore how the theory of narrative may usefully complement deconstructive, psychoanalytic, feminist, and postcolonial approaches to reading fictional (and non-fictional) narrative texts. We shall also explore issues of filmic narrative as arise in the adaptation of novels for the screen. Our theoretical works will include writings by Mieke Bal, Roland Barthes, Fredric Jameson, and others.  Evolution of Literary Archetypes: Comparative Romanticisms Sieburth Virginia Woolf once quipped, \u201cOn or about December 1910, human character changed,\u201d but she was probably off by more than a century. Most cultural historians would instead locate this seismic shift in the late eighteenth-century with the emergence of the phenomenon loosely termed Romanticism. Rousseau\u2019s Confessions (posthumously published in 1782) are to our modernity what Augustine\u2019s were to Antiquity and provide the foundational text for what it sometimes called our contemporary Culture of Narcissism. Rousseau\u2019s writings, and in particular his emphasis on the individual\u2019s victimization by society, make possible Goethe\u2019s Storm-and-Stress hero, Werther (who commits suicide) and B\u00fcchner\u2019s Lenz and Woyzeck (both of whom go mad). After exploring these various figures of the Pariah, we will examine the Promethean Overreacher, embodied by Goethe\u2019s Faust and Mary Shelley\u2019s Victor Frankenstein. The social and political ferment that accompanied these emerging archetypes of the Romantic Hero finds its most violent expression in the ideal of Revolution. We will read the American and French Revolutions from the perspectives of Blake ( in his early prophecies), Wordsworth (in selections from The Prelude), and Hugo (in his gothic novel about the Haitian Revolution, Bug-Jargal). The final portion of the semester will be devoted to the Romantic Heroine, as depicted in Bront\u00eb\u2019s Wuthering Heights and Flaubert\u2019s Madame Bovary.  Senior Seminar in Comparative Literature: Honors Thesis Vatulescu This seminar, limited to senior Comparative Literature majors engaged in writing a senior honors thesis, is designed to be a writing workshop. Students will articulate and research a thesis topic, identify an appropriate critical approach and methodology, and write at least one chapter of their thesis. Periodical writing installments give the students the opportunity to receive feed-back from their peers and instructor as well as to learn to critique others' work-in-progress. Permission of the DUGS is required to enroll in the course. Students must also have a 3.65 or better GPA, both overall and in the major. The Senior Thesis Seminar must be followed by Independent Study (COLIT-UA 997) to complete the honors thesis.  MAP : Texts and Ideas: Animal Humans Lezra \"One might go so far as to define man as a creature that has failed in its effort to keep its animalness\u2026\" So writes the German philosopher Peter Sloterdijk. What sort of animal were we? Where, how, and by whom has the line between the human and the animal been drawn? With what consequences for our \"human\" understanding of the world? Of concepts like the \"soul,\" \"society,\" politics, the family? Is the line between the human and the animal drawn differently in different genres--in literary works, theological treatises, natural histories, paintings, films? We come at these questions from different angles, following them from antiquity to early modern responses to these questions, and in essays by contemporary philosophers and advocates. Readings: Genesis, Numbers, Euripides' Bacchae, Plato's Phaedrus, Ovid's Metamorphoses, Apuleius' Golden Ass, Marie de France' Bisclavret, Shakespeare's Midsummer Night's Dream, Montaigne's \"Apology in Defense of Raymond Sebond, Machiavelli's Prince, H. G. Wells's Island of Dr. Moreau and Island of Lost Souls, Derrida's \"The Animal that therefore I am,\" selections from Boccaccio, Peter Singer, Giorgio Agamben, Donna Haraway.  Readings in Contemporary Literary Theory: Metropolis and World Literature Zhang As an introduction to the concept and discipline of comparative literature, this course examines how modern metropolises in different parts of the world nourish and challenge literary sensibilities, and how modern literature, by treating the city as both its environment and its hero, evolves from realism to modernism and beyond. Our goal is two-fold: On the one hand, and more immediately concerning literature, it seeks to revive Goethe\u2019s notion of Weltliteratur (world literature) in our own time, not by searching for an overarching theme of human experience and culture in which a universal definition of humanity can be reached once and for all, but only by going through different historical, social, and national situations which manifest themselves in terms of cultural and political differences and self-assertions. On the other hand, and regarding a broader interest in the city itself and its representation in the major works of world literature and film, the course is also intended to engage in common issues of our times such as individuality versus community and collectivity; locality versus globality; past versus present, as they are mediated and intensified by urban forms, experiences, and sensibilities. By hopping from city to city, we hope to construct a trajectory of world literature and its world-historical moments of intensity, which is often articulated through the self-images of the great cities. We will be particularly concerned with how the city and literary imagination interact with one another; how the city can be seen as a producer of cultures, subjectivities, diversity, dissent, and unity; and how the urban experience shapes our understanding of time, space, self, and other. The course is also an imagined field trip to some of the major cities on the literary and intellectual map of the modern world. We will visit London in Charles Dickens and T.S. Eliot; Paris in Hugo, Baudelaire, and Flaubert; Dublin in Joyce, Berlin in Water Benjamin; St. Petersburgh in Dostoyevsky and Andre Bely, New York in Dreiser and Fitzgerald, and finally, across the Pacific, Shanghai, and Beijing, the two urban centers that capture the imagination of modern China as they are portrayed in Lao She and Mao Dun, two leading writers of Chinese realist literature. The EuroAmreican and East Asian focus is by no means limiting. There will be a few classes reserved for students who are interested in reading and discussing other cities in other national literary and cultural traditions. Our readings will be centrally literary but some films will be introduced, both as a visual aid and more importantly a different regime of senses and symbolisms entangled with the city. Each class period will be divided into a short lecture and sustained discussions. Students are also expected to do class presentations and act as discussion leaders. Grades will be based on a 1-2 pp weekly journal on the assignment, and a 10pp final paper.

We will explore the materiality and history of the letter as form as well as the philosophical and literary performances and interventions letters and letter \u00adwriters make. Texts will include letters by Horace, Cicero, Ovid, St. Paul, Abelard &amp; Heloise, Petrarch, Cl\u00e9ment Marot, Jacopo Sadoleto &amp; John Calvin, John Donne, John Milton, and modern treatments of the epistolary form by Sigmund Freud &amp; Wilhelm Fliess, Jacques Lacan, Jacques Derrida, and Chris Kraus. Along the way, we will also explore the history and technology of letter writing from classical antiquity through to the European Renaissance. Junior Theory Seminar: Modernity Iampolski Modernity is a product of Enlightenment that dramatically changed the   face of the Western culture by proclaiming the autonomy and supremacy of   human Reason. This new attitude allowed an unprecedented development of   science and became a basis for many fundamental achievements of the   Western civilization. However the same attitude has created a lot of   contradictions that define modernity. The course is designed to analyze   the antinomies of the culture of modernity. We will start with a   founding document of European rationalism - philosophical statements by   Descartes and will see how the cult of Reason and the great western   political principles (equality of rights, the rule of law) related to   the dominance of Reason are paradoxically responsible for new kinds of   violence and social exclusion.The following subjects will be discussed: - Individual and masses in modern society; - Violence and modern war; - Totalitarianism; - Mechanization of life, alienation, machines; - The emergence of subjectivity and the \"loss experience\"; - Market, capitalism, and many others. Senior Seminar in Comparative Literature: Honors Thesis Garcia This   seminar, limited to senior Comparative Literature majors engaged in   writing a senior honors thesis, is designed to be a writing workshop.   Students will articulate and research a thesis topic, identify an   appropriate critical approach and methodology, and write at least one   chapter of their thesis. Periodical writing installments give the   students the opportunity to receive feed-back from their peers and   instructor as well as to learn to critique others' work-in-progress.   Permission of the DUS is required to enroll in the course. Students   must also have a 3.65 or better GPA, both overall and in the major. The   Senior Thesis Seminar must be followed by Independent Study (COLIT-UA   997) to complete the honors thesis. Topics in Asian Studies: The Planetary Imagination Kaffen The planetary has emerged a contested site across a variety of fields   from comparative literature and area studies to media studies and   philosophy. Partly marking itself off from older universalist claims   (cosmopolitanism, world history, globalization), the planetary   imagination as we will discuss it in this class foregrounds an   ecological dimension and at the same time, shifts the grounds of   human-centered thought and politics. While touching on a wide variety of   issues, including technology, scale, identity, and ethics, the core   problem for the class will be to consider \u201cthe world\u201d from a standpoint   that does not privilege the human as its center or apex. The goal of the   course is neither to immediately endorse nor repudiate a critique of   anthropocentrism, but to examine some of its diverse forms of   expression, underlying assumptions, and possible repercussions. To that   end, this class seeks to explore the planetary imagination from a   broadly (and possibly contradictory) humanities-based perspective, at   the intersection of area studies (East Asia in particular) and   comparative literature\u2014through fiction, philosophy, and contemporary   arts and media. Travel Literature Halim  The course \u201cTravel Literature\u201d  brings together a set of theoretical, critical and literary texts about travel  from the Middle Ages to the present. While transnationalism and mobility appear  to typify our times, this course traces much older trajectories of travel in  relation to questions of motive (e.g.: imperialism, ethnography, hajj ), genre (guidebook, letters home, travelogue,   Rihla , travel blog, etc.) and shifting  perceptions of \u201cEast\u201d and \u201cWest.\u201d The course brings together theoretical  readings\u2014by, among others, James Clifford, Mary Louise Pratt and Edward Said\u2014and  literary texts\u2014by, among others, Ibn Battuta, Rifa\u2019a Rafi\u2019 al-Tahtawi, Edward  Lane, Mourid Barghouti, and Jamaica Kincaid.      Culture and Politics in the Hispanic World: A Transatlantic Perspective Matos-Martin      This course will explore the intersections of culture and  politics in Spain and Latin America with a special focus on their entangled  histories. In that light, we will consider different issues to engage  \u201cTransatlantic\u201d perspective as a comparative paradigm to flesh out shared  histories and experiences. These may include colonialism, dictatorships and  exile, immigration processes, exclusions, or today\u2019s neoliberal States. We will  analyze literary and visual sources such as short stories, novels, poems,  painting, fiction films or documentaries. Primary materials will be paired with  texts by leading cultural and political thinkers working on questions of  biopolitics, transatlantic studies, immigration, globalization, exclusion or  violence. Readings in Contemporary Literary Theory: Conflict Sanders      Conflict is an underlying theme  in many, if not most, contemporary theorists. In this class, we will explore  some of the forerunners of this conflict thinking in Marx, Nietzsche, and  Freud, as well as in its uses, sometimes critical, by, among others, Carl  Schmitt, Melanie Klein, Jacques Derrida, Judith Butler, Slavoj Zizek, and  Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak. In order to measure the explanatory power of our  theorists, we shall read them over against more literal accounts of  conflict\u2014the famous war memoirs of Ernst J\u00fcnger and Michael Herr.

In other words, we like to think of ourselves as subjects. The self-conscious and autonomous subject constitutes itself in relation to what is \u2018other.\u2019 But what is this \u2018other\u2019? The word \u2018other\u2019 does not always refer to another person: It may also refer to constitutive events, or \u2018necessary fictions.\u2019 These \u2018others\u2019 may be the addressees of our poems, the material and immaterial products of our imaginations, and indeed the otherness we find in ourselves. How do we relate to these \u2018others\u2019? How do desire, action, and ethical duty (but also fate, guilt, and the law), allow us to perceive ourselves as free? We will explore these and other questions as they have been posed in literary works by Aeschylus, Sophocles, Plato, Ovid, Garcilaso de la Vega, Racine, Keats, Poe, Gautier, Baudelaire, Melville, Lorca, Kafka, Beckett, paintings by Da Vinci and Vel\u00e1zquez, and philosophical and theoretical writings by Kant, Hegel, Freud, Marx, Saussure, Heidegger, Lacan, and Levinas. Though the tragic fate of Agamemnon or Oedipus appears inevitable, in our reading we explore how fate is a necessary fiction that enables action. Today we have transferred the power of fate onto other essentialized constructs such as the free market, advertising, or intelligence organizations which come to structure our desires and dictate the course of our lives. We will trace how inspiration may be found in negation by reading literary texts on the unknown contents of letters \u2013 as in Poe \u2013or on endless waiting for what will never come\u2014as in Melville and Beckett. Situated at intersection of the different discourses that comprise Comparative Literature \u2013 fiction, poetry, art, philosophy, psychoanalysis, and political theory \u2013 this class aims to problematize the notion of modern subjectivity. Our primary concerns will be at once ethical and poetic: How can what exceeds knowledge and representation signal itself in thought?            Classical Literature &amp; Philosophy: Gender &amp; Genre    Bianchi    Thurs   11:00-1:45pm   COLIT-UA 160   In this course we will explore the co-emergence of philosophy and various literary genres (epic, lyric poetry, dialogue, tragedy, comedy) in ancient Greece and Rome, as well as the development of literary and rhetorical theory. Through close readings of primary texts we will observe how certain themes (e.g. justice, love, desire) are expressed across different genres, and how (and how successfully) philosophy and the emerging arts of poetics and rhetoric distinguish themselves and develop throughout the classical antiquity. Authors include Homer, the Presocratic philosophers, Plato,Aristotle, Sappho, Euripides, Aristophanes, Lucretius, Cicero, Horace, Longinus, Quintilian, and various modern and contemporary commentators. Our study will be divided into five thematic units: 1. First Beginnings; 2. Philosophy and Poetry; 3. Love and Desire in Ancient Greek Philosophy and Literature; 4. Classical Rhetoric. The course will be primarily discussion based. We will work on carefully understanding, analyzing, and criticizing texts, considering the significance of genre in classical thinking, appreciating classical texts in their cultural context, and developing written and spoken skills. Each week students will be required to read approximately 60-120 pages of text (toward the upper end for literary texts, and the lower end for philosophical/theoretical texts).        African Literature: Arts, Literature &amp; Film    Diawara Thurs 2:00-4:45pm COLIT-UA 844   A look at contemporary African Literature, film and art as a way of examining different outcomes of postcolonial cultural policies and practices in Africa. The main topics include 1) a discussion of the Negritude Movement and the artistic legacy of Leopold Sedar Senghor; 2) a close look at the Guinean Cultural Revolution and the African experimentations with Marxist and socialist realist art forms; 3) Pan-Africanism and art; and 4) the post-nationalist writers and video artists of Nigeria. The aim of the class is to provide students with a sense of the context of artistic productions in Africa. It is hoped that students will gain an understanding of some of the major trends in African literature and film; and become conversant with the politics, aesthetics and reception theories behind African imaginative works.      Topics in Film and Literature: South by South: Ideological Maps And Fictions of Uneven Development Dopico Tues 2-4:45pm COLIT-UA 300.001 SPAN-UA 551.002 This course considers the \u201cidea of  the South\u201d as geopolitical territory, imaginary landscape and ideological  map:a fictive and creative topos where  regional mythology, racial divisions, national contests, and cultural  imperialism together produce extraordinary narratives and alternative histories.  Reading comparatively, south by south,  we discover a dynamic cultural genealogy from the global South\u2019s western  hemisphere that precedes the urgency of current debates about uneven  development and the problems of North and South. We will encounter artists who manipulate and  contest the political imaginary and the fictive qualities  assigned to the South and its subjects.Engaging works that exalt or decry that ideological geography, we will  examine how these artists remake \u201cthe South,\u201d and how they engage the North and  its fictions.    Lectures and section discussions will  consider works that reflect on different Souths and consider how they portray  seductive, dangerous, infantile, charming, backward, or even criminal cultures.  In texts, visual art, and films from Europe and the Americas, we will consider  how realities and fantasies of the South are represented, how a global South  becomes a true fiction, and how writers from \u201cSouthern\u201d places respond to the  realities of uneven development and to their own barbarous, childlike, or  exotic status on political maps and cultural markets. We will question why writers explore lost  worlds, or belatedly return to a region\u2019s buried history to fictively rework  and revive the past. We will consider  why outsiders, children, and outlaws are central tropes. We will think about  the exceptional \u201crepresentational burden\u201d of Southern artists and consider how  they negotiate their double bind -- how they engage the biases and appetites of  the North and at the same time respond to the weight of history, self-hatred  and loyalty in the South. In our reading  we will trace the tension of the North-South axis in narratives that \u201cexplain\u201d  the South and those who live or pass through it. We will consider stories that manipulate the  status of the native artist (or native informant), the promise and mirage of  the cultural tourist, the uneasy spectatorship of the imperial traveler, the ressentiment   of the exile, and the collecting and  correcting anthropology of the political and economic immigrant. Thinking about the relationship between geopolitics  and regional mythology, we will consider the enduring forms of this imaginary  and ideological mapping, how it has been vital to nationalism, empire and  neo-colonialism, but also how it continues to function in the political  conflicts and cultural markets of \u201cglobalization.   Primary texts will include many  of the following Giuseppe di Lampedusa, The Leopard, Leonardo Sciascia, The  Wine Dark Sea, Thomas Mann, \u201cDeath in Venice,\u201d \u201cMario and the Magician,\u201d   Albert Camus, The Stranger, Andr\u00e9 Gide, \u201c The Immoralist,\u201d W.E.B DuBois, The Souls of Black Folk, William  Faulkner, Absalom, Absalom!, Zora Neale Hurston, Their Eyes Were  Watching God, Richard Wright, Black  Boy , selections from Uncle Tom\u2019s Children, Flannery O\u2019Connor, Wise  Blood , The Violent Bear It Away, Dorothy Allison, Bastard out of  Carolina, Alejo Carpentier, The Lost Steps, Juan Rulfo, Pedro  P\u00e1ramo, Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez, One Hundred Years of Solitud, Junot D\u00edaz, The Brief Wondrous Life of  Oscar Wao.

By the early 1940s, when he became the most famous black writer in the world and acquired a global reading public, Wright had amassed a wide range of books across many genres and literary traditions. This course explores Wright's career through an examination of works that figured in his intellectual formation and works by authors Wright in turn influenced. The course begins with key writings by Wright and the critical reception of his work in the U.S. and Europe during his lifetime and proceeds through a chronological examination of pivotal texts he encountered. Works by Marx, Proust, Horatio Alger, Gertrude Stein, H. L. Mencken, Theodore Dreiser, Jean-Paul Sartre, Ralph Ellison, George Lamming, Lillian Smith, James Baldwin, William James, and Kenneth Burke, among others, will form the course reading list.      Jr. Theory Seminar: Modernity    Iampolski    Tues 4:55-7:35pm   COLIT-UA 200   Modernity is a product of  Enlightenment that dramatically changed the face of the Western culture by  proclaiming the autonomy and supremacy of human Reason. This new attitude  allowed an unprecedented development of science and became a basis for many fundamental achievements of the Western  civilization. However the same attitude has created a lot of contradictions  that define modernity. The course is designed to analyze the antinomies of the  culture of modernity. We will start with a founding  document of European rationalism - philosophical statements by Descartes and  will see how the cult of Reason and the great western political principles (equality of rights, the rule of  law) related to the dominance of Reason are paradoxically responsible for new  kinds of violence and social exclusion.   The following subjects (among  others) will be discussed:   -- Modern Rationality and Modern  Science.   -- Changing notion of Experience.   -- New understanding of Space, Distance, Time.   -- Culture of appearances.   -- Nation, State.   -- Democracy and Totalitarianism.   -- Violence, War and Discipline.   -- Machines.   -- Market, Money and the Struggle for Survival.   -- Commodity and Desire.    Readings include: Marx,  Freud, Descartes, Arendt, Foucault, Benjamin, Elias, Deleuze, Balibar, Lefort  and many others.      Topics in 20th Century Literature: Paranoid Narratives Sanders Wed 12:30-3:15pm COLIT-UA 190   It\u2019s no secret that we live in an age of paranoia. What  began as a psychiatric diagnosis may now be the predominant form taken by our  experience of politics and of technology. But could there be something about  the very structure of narrative itself\u2014its \u201cvoices\u201d and its \u201cspeakers\u201d\u2014that is  paranoid, or gives rise to paranoia? Tracing psychoanalytic theories of  paranoia (Sigmund Freud, Melanie Klein), and attending no less to their   narrative structure, we address this question and others by reading key  autobiographical and fictional works, such as may include Daniel Paul  Schreber\u2019s Memoirs of My Nervous Illness , George Orwell\u2019s Nineteen  Eighty-Four , James Ellroy\u2019s American  Tabloid , as well as political writings and documents by Richard Hofstadter,  Michel Foucault, Julian Assange (Wikileaks), South African AIDS denialists, and  Rwandan g\u00e9nocidaires .      Studies in Prose Genres: Autobiography Sieburth Mon/Wed 11:00-12:15pm COLIT-UA 125   The word Autobiography can be etymologically decomposed  into: autos (\u201cself\u201d) + bios (\u201clife\u201d) + graph\u00ea (\u201cwriting\u201d), and over the course of the semester we will be looking at the interaction of these three elements as the genre of autobiography evolves over time. Until the 20 th century, autobiography has been, for the most, a predominantly Western practice\u2014for very specific religious and cultural reasons, which we shall explore and which have to do with the particular constructions of the \u201cself\u201d associated with the Judeo-Christian tradition. Examples of autobiographical writing, however, can also be found in classical Chinese and Japanese cultures, and we shall accordingly examine a few samples of these at the outset of the course by reading a few short Confucian autobiographies, selections from The Pillow Book of Sei Shonagan , and Shen Fu\u2019s Six Records of a Floating Life . We will then turn our attention to the Confessions of St. Augustine, a conversion narrative which in many ways provides the master-text of Western autobiography. This will be followed by another Christian \u201cLife,\u201d the earliest known text of its sort in vernacular English, the 15 th -century Book of Margery Kempe . Selections from Montaigne\u2019s Essays will then be placed against this religious tradition of autobiography: emphasis will be laid not only on the more secularized or \u201chumanist\u201d notions of the self emerging during the Renaissance, but on the essay-form itself as providing a non-narrative model for self-portraiture. From Montaigne, we will turn to Puritan and early Republican America, represented by the \u201ccaptivity narrative\u201d of Mary Rowlandson and by Ben Franklin\u2019s slippery account of his self-fashioning into celebrity. This will lead into a reading of the first six books of Rousseau\u2019s Confessions , which rewrite Augustine while setting the agenda for the next two centuries of modern autobiography. Equally influential, at least insofar as the African American literary tradition is concerned, is the Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass , which blends elements of the sentimental novel and the European picaresque into a call for political self-liberation through writing. The final unit of the course will focus on the impact of psychiatry and psychoanalysis on modern autobiography: the texts include Aur\u00e9lia , G\u00e9rard de Nerval\u2019s account of his descent into \u201cmadness,\u201d Michel Leiris\u2019s post-surrealist Manhood , and the poet H.D.\u2019s account of her analysis in Vienna with the master himself, Tribute to Freud.
