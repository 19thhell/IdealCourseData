Taking into account the cultural and economic impact of the visual arts, nationally and internationally, as well as the challenges facing the arts today, the program prepares students to become leaders in a broad range of arts organizations. The Visual Arts Administration MA program addresses the whole art ecology, including the cultural environment in which art and arts organizations operate; the role of the artist in society; how artwork is documented, presented and interpreted; the structure and management of organizations that display artwork &ndash; both non-profit and for-profit; and the role of art theorists, critics, curators, and collectors. The program curriculum also considers how education in arts organizations expands knowledge and builds audiences, the increasing role of art in urban development and public spaces, and new approaches and tools for encouraging access and participation. A strong emphasis is placed on acquiring the theoretical and practical tools for fundraising, financial management, marketing and knowledge of new media and technology in the visual arts. While the program is primarily oriented toward the non-profit segment of the field, it also offers a strong for-profit concentration. Emphasis is placed on collaboration across the visual arts administration field. The program takes advantage of its position in New York City to utilize the variety of arts organizations and professionals available through case studies, focus groups, site visits and examples of theory applied to practice. Using the program's extensive internship and alumni networks allows students access to a wide range of individuals and organizations in the field and increases the depth of their understanding of the complexities of this challenging area. Since its beginnings, the program has taken an extensive and integrated international outlook. The curriculum fosters a global perspective within course readings and discussions, and through several study abroad options. In London, for example, students analyze the exhibition and display of art in material culture through a dynamic curriculum that blends classroom sessions and site visits. In the Netherlands and Berlin, Performing Arts Administration and Visual Arts Administration students compare and contrast the management of cultural institutions in the U.S. and Europe, with an emphasis on cultural policy, cultural diplomacy, funding mechanisms, globalism and mobility, and cultural identity and diversity.    Student Learning Outcomes    Upon completion of our program, our students will:       Demonstrate an understanding of the creative process, how art and artists function in society    Analyze the economic, political and social environment in which artists and arts organizations operate, including legal, ethical and policy issues    Identify and evaluate how artwork is interpreted, presented, documented and archived    Critique and compare the structure, operations and management of organizations that present or produce artwork on various scales    Outline strategies for marketing, audience development, outreach and community development in the arts    Acquire business skills in accounting, finance, organizational theory and management as well as arts-related media and technology    Develop an expansive and inclusive world view of the field that values different global perspectives, identities, concerns and goals       For More Information    Grad Info Night Wednesday, October 29 6-8 pm 34 Stuyvesant Street Please RSVP .

Alumni hold positions at all levels of responsibility in diverse arts organizations, including, for example, president of The Philadelphia Orchestra, marketing and planning director of the Metropolitan Opera Association, executive director of The Sundance Foundation, finance director of Jazz at Lincoln Center, associate development director of Merce Cunningham Dance, and chief arts officer of the Hewlett Packard Foundation. Many others serve as faculty and administrators in higher education in Europe, Asia, and the Americas.    Our students come with a solid background in at least one of the performing arts forms: dance, theatre, music, opera, or film. Their performing arts backgrounds act as foundations for our program&rsquo;s intensive and systematic studies in performing arts management which is combined with course work in related disciplines such as economics, statistics, marketing, accounting, finance, planning, law, cultural policy, and philanthropic development.    Many courses in the curriculum are offered through NYU&rsquo;s Leonard N. Stern School of Business and the Wagner Graduate School of Public Service. Annually, the program places students in approximately 75 internships locally and abroad. These enriching and closely monitored and mentored internships are the bridge from classroom to practice in leading performing arts organizations. Our faculty advises and oversees all internships. Mentoring is a constant ingredient throughout four semesters of study.    Our popular summer study abroad program in Europe further enhances students&rsquo; learning by providing varied overseas perspectives. Our studies abroad program was the first in the nation to take students and professionals abroad to study cultural policy, public funding, sponsorship, and marketing in locations as varied as The Netherlands, Berlin, Madrid, Barcelona, Bilbao, Paris, London, and Vienna. The innovation of these abroad programs is that they are interdisciplinary with visual and performing arts professionals focusing on management issues of the performing and visual arts.    In New York, our students receive unparalleled training within a university that is acclaimed for its preparation of leaders in business, management, and the arts. Faculty and students in our program frequently collaborate with Steinhardt&rsquo;s programs in music business and visual arts administration and with the Stern School of Business and the Wagner Graduate School of Public Service. Equipped with outstanding practica, international, and interdisciplinary experiences during their studies, our graduates enjoy high demand in the field. They are frequently recruited by our own alumni who hold positions of responsibility and who are eager to fill staff openings with our graduates.
