Eggers joined New York University Stern School of Business as an Assistant Professor of Management and Organizations in July 2008. Professor Eggers teaches the core M.B.A. strategy class and a strategy capstone elective.     Professor Eggers's research interests focus on technological change, decision-making under uncertainty and new product development. Specifically, he studies the challenges faced by managers and executives in making good decisions and addressing new opportunities in emerging technologies. His recent work examines firms that backed the wrong technology during the emergence of the flat panel display industry and the role that managerial cognition played in determining the course of organizational action during the early years of the fiber optics industry.     Prior to his academic career, Professor Eggers was a strategy consultant with two firms, Kurt Salmon Associates and Viant, Inc., both of which specialize in product development strategy and new technology projects for firms ranging from Nordstrom to NASCAR and from Coca-Cola to YKK Zippers. He also worked as a political consultant on congressional, senatorial and gubernatorial campaigns across the United States.     Professor Eggers received his B.A. in History from Amherst College, his M.B.A. in Management from the Goizueta Business School at Emory University and his Ph.D. in Management from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania.
