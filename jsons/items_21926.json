During this period students should get references, clarify ideas or approaches, and submit drafts of chapters for feedback.   Students should plan ahead to ensure that they are able to meet the thesis defense deadline for the semester in which they plan to graduate.     If you have questions about the thesis defense process, please write to gallatin.thesis@nyu.edu .               Selecting the Thesis Committee                                           As early in the process as possible, students should select the members of the thesis committee.                                   Each thesis committee includes three panelists who will read the thesis and participate in the thesis defense. Of the three panelists, one must be the student's primary academic adviser, and at least one must be a full-time Gallatin faculty member. If the academic adviser is a full-time Gallatin faculty member, the student may opt to ask two other non-Gallatin faculty members to serve on the committee.   Students are responsible for selecting and confirming the participation of each panelist. Students should consult with their primary advisers about composing the committee. The M.A. program directors are also available to help students with this process.                         Submitting the Thesis to the Adviser                                           Students are required to submit a copy of the thesis to the adviser no less than ten weeks before the anticipated defense date.                                   At this stage, the student solicits feedback from the adviser and other committee members, but does not submit the thesis to Gallatin.                         Submitting the Thesis to Gallatin and to the Thesis Defense Committee                                           After the adviser has approved the thesis and thinks the student is ready for the defense, the student should submit the thesis to Gallatin and to the thesis committee no less than four weeks before the anticipated defense date.                                 To submit the thesis to Gallatin and to the thesis committee, students should use the online Thesis Submission form. This form will send copies of the thesis to the adviser and to the second and third reader. At this stage, Gallatin will contact the adviser to confirm his or her approval of the thesis. Gallatin must have confirmation of the adviser's approval before the student will be allowed to schedule the defense.     Students completing an artistic thesis that entails a performance must arrange to have the committee members see the performance no less than one week before the defense.                           Scheduling the Defense                                           After the thesis has been submitted to Gallatin and to the thesis committee, the student should set a date and time for the defense and register this information with Gallatin at least three weeks prior to the defense.                                 By the time the student has submitted the thesis to Gallatin, he or she should be finalizing arrangements for the defense. Students should consult with all three panelists regarding the dates and times when they are available. When an acceptable date and time have been arranged, the student should complete the online Thesis Defense Registration form, which must be submitted at least three weeks prior to the defense. In addition to the date and time of the defense, the student should provide on the form the names of the committee members and their email addresses. A defense confirmation will be emailed to the student, the adviser, the second reader, and the third reader.   Please note: The student is responsible for acting as the liaison among the three members of the defense committee. Students must work with their committee members to find an acceptable date. The defense will, of course, be contingent upon final approval of the thesis itself by all three committee members. If one of the members rejects the paper, or requests substantial revisions, the defense date may have to be postponed unless changes can be made in time.   Students should also be aware that they may encounter some difficulties in finding committee members or arranging a date for a defense in January or September because of the limited availability of faculty during the summer months and winter recess.                           Defending the Thesis                                           On the appointed date the student will defend the thesis in a one-and-a half hour discussion with the three members of the committee.                                   If the thesis is approved at the defense, the committee will sign the final approval document and forward it to the Registrar's Office. Students who have passed the defense and have met all other degree requirements will be eligible for graduation.   If the committee asks for revisions, the student will have a specified amount of time to produce them and have them approved. (Such revisions may or may not set back the graduation date, depending on how long they take.) The committee may also ask for minor editorial changes, which will not delay graduation. Students will have up to 30 days to make these changes and submit the final thesis to Gallatin. In some cases, the committee may ask to see the revised thesis before it is added to the Gallatin Master's Thesis Archive .                           Submitting the Final Thesis                                           Within 30 days of the defense, students must submit the final version of the thesis to Gallatin.                                   At the time of the defense, the committee will complete the Instructions for the Final Thesis form. This form indicates what type of changes the student needs to make to the thesis before submitting the final thesis to Gallatin.   Within 30 days after the defense, the student must submit the final, corrected version of the thesis (please see the formatting guidelines for more information). The final thesis must be submitted electronically by completing the online Final Thesis Submission form.                      Thesis Defense Deadlines   In planning the date of the thesis defense, students must adhere to the scheduling calendar below. Students should note these time allowances do not include university holidays such as spring break and the winter recess. Therefore, if you are planning a May graduation and submitting your thesis to your adviser early in the spring semester, you will need to do this 11 weeks prior to your defense date (as opposed to normal 10 weeks), due to spring recess. Students should discuss the scheduling of their thesis completion with their advisers several months before the deadlines stated below.         Thesis submission deadline to adviser   Thesis submission deadline to Gallatin and to second and third readers Thesis defense registration deadline Term in which the student plans to complete the thesis Final date to defend the thesis          10 weeks prior to the defense date                  4 weeks prior to the defense date                  3 weeks prior to the defense date               Summer 2014*  September 18, 2014  Fall 2014  January 22, 2015  Spring 2015  May 15, 2015  Summer 2015*  September 23, 2015  Fall 2015  January 20, 2016  Spring 2016  TBA      * Due to the limited availability of faculty during the summer months and winter recess, students should be aware that they may encounter some difficulties in finding committee members or arranging a date for a defense in January or September. September graduation is appropriate for students who have completed most of the thesis by the late spring. Students must register for thesis advisement in the summer, if they plan on graduating in September.   Please note that these time allowances do not include university holidays such as spring break and the winter recess.        Matriculation Policy   Students must be matriculated at the time they defend the thesis. That is, students must be registered for Master\u2019s Thesis and Defense (for students who started in Spring 2013 or earlier) or Master's Thesis II (for students who started in Summer 2013 or later). Students who need additional time to complete the thesis must then register for Thesis Advisement each term (including the summer, if they plan on graduating in September) until they have successfully defended the thesis. Note that any credits earned through Thesis Advisement are not included in the 40-credit requirement for the master\u2019s degree. Thesis Advisement has a special tuition rate of $400 (plus a nonrefundable registration and services fee). Students may not maintain matriculation after completing 37 credits. Rather, they must enroll in Master\u2019s Thesis and Defense, Master's Thesis II, or Thesis Advisement (if appropriate).   Students who defend in time for January graduation do not need to matriculate in the spring semester. Students who defend in time for September graduation do not need to matriculate in the fall term, but do need to matriculate in the summer term. Please note: only students who will defend for September graduation are required to matriculate in the summer term.                    top of page                           Quick Links                            Thesis Submission Form            Thesis Defense Registration Form            Final Thesis Submission Form                                                                            NYU Gallatin Footer              Gallatin School of Individualized Study     1 Washington Place     New York, NY 10003     (212) 998-7370                   A&#8211;Z Index      Directions      Contact Us      Job Opportunities               News      Support Gallatin      Feedback                         Follow us on Facebook      Follow us on Twitter      Follow us on Youtube         Follow us Instagram                 Unless otherwise noted, all content copyright NYU Gallatin.

By the 10th week of their 6th term in the Department, students will submit to the Director of Graduate Studies a proposal for a thesis and suggestions as to whom they would most prefer as advisors. The Director of Graduate Studies will then appoint a committee, of at least two faculty members, but normally three faculty members, who will meet with the candidate about the proposal. This meeting is the oral thesis prospectus examination. This meeting must take place by the end of the third year in order for the student to maintain Good Standing. Once it takes place, the student remains in Good Standing even though the advisors may require him/her to revise the thesis proposal and meet to discuss it further. The student must pass the examination by the end of the 7th term in the Department.      The prospectus should be between 5 and a strict maximum of 15 pages long (double spaced). It should not be a philosophy paper, but rather a thesis plan that (a) clearly articulates an interesting philosophical problem in a way that (b) displays the student's knowledge of the problem's place in the space of philosophical ideas, and in particular, of the leading attempts to resolve the problem and (c) gives as clear an indication as the student can give at this early stage of how he or she intends to organize the thesis, and of what he or she expects her contribution to be, that is, of what he or she can add to the existing literature. (Students writing a thesis consisting of three linked papers should apply these guidelines to each of their topics.) Although the prospectus defense takes the form of an oral examination, its principal purpose is to reach an agreement with prospective future members of the student's thesis committee as to the shape and substance of the project.        Advice about how to proceed      Early in the third year, you should choose a professor and ask if he or she will be your prospectus advisor. It's a good idea to have a professor that you're working with throughout the whole process, even if you're not sure of your topic. So just make your best educated guess of who would be good to have. You can switch prospectus advisors if you end up choosing a topic for which someone else would be a better advisor. Meet with your prospectus advisor regularly to report on your thoughts and to get feedback on drafts of your prospectus, as well as any other writing you're doing in choosing a topic and formulating an idea for your thesis. It's a good idea to often write up five-page pieces on your latest thoughts. Once you have a prospectus advisor, report to the DGS who it is. Anyone currently in the third year or above who does not have a prospectus advisor should get someone within the next month!      Once you've picked a thesis topic (if not before), you should ask two more people to be the other members of your prospectus committee. These three people will examine you during your prospectus defense.      A word on choosing your thesis topic. Remember that the aim is to pick a thesis topic that genuinely interests you, on which you think you will do good work, and in an area that you think you will continue to want to work in after graduate school. Your thesis need not be the *best* topic for you. This is not the last piece of serious philosophical work you will do, nor is it the best work you'll do. You will be better served by getting to work quickly on a thesis topic that is a *good* topic for you than by spending an extra year trying to figure out what the *best* topic would be. (\"Satisfice\" in picking your topic; don't aim to maximize.)      A prospectus is a fifteen-page paper that lays out the topic and plan for your dissertation work. The prospectus and the prospectus defense should convince your prospectus committee that you are ready to write a dissertation.      There are different ways a successful prospectus can be written. One kind of prospectus lays out a question that your thesis will address and discusses the positions that have been taken on the question, and makes some points about those positions. You needn't have come to a conclusion about the issue yourself; you are showing that you are ready to work seriously on the question. Another kind of prospectus proceeds by stating the central claim you plan to argue for in your thesis, and roughly what your argument for this claim will be. It should be clear how your claim and your argument relate to what others have said. In writing this kind of prospectus, you aren't committing to do exactly what you say you'll do\u2014but by making a specific plan you're giving yourself a good way to get started doing focused work. Your central claim, and your argument, can change (indeed, they likely will radically change) as your work proceeds.      Advisors will inevitably differ on exactly what they want from a prospectus, and what they think yours needs to be like given your topic and your philosophical habits. Work closely with your advisor and take her advice seriously. And get the other two members of your prospectus committee involved sooner rather than later.

During this period students should get references, clarify ideas or approaches, and submit drafts of chapters for feedback.   Students should plan ahead to ensure that they are able to meet the thesis defense deadline for the semester in which they plan to graduate.     If you have questions about the thesis defense process, please write to gallatin.thesis@nyu.edu .               Selecting the Thesis Committee                                           As early in the process as possible, students should select the members of the thesis committee.                                   Each thesis committee includes three panelists who will read the thesis and participate in the thesis defense. Of the three panelists, one must be the student's primary academic adviser, and at least one must be a full-time Gallatin faculty member. If the academic adviser is a full-time Gallatin faculty member, the student may opt to ask two other non-Gallatin faculty members to serve on the committee.   Students are responsible for selecting and confirming the participation of each panelist. Students should consult with their primary advisers about composing the committee. The M.A. program directors are also available to help students with this process.                         Submitting the Thesis to the Adviser                                           Students are required to submit a copy of the thesis to the adviser no less than ten weeks before the anticipated defense date.                                   At this stage, the student solicits feedback from the adviser and other committee members, but does not submit the thesis to Gallatin.                         Submitting the Thesis to Gallatin and to the Thesis Defense Committee                                           After the adviser has approved the thesis and thinks the student is ready for the defense, the student should submit the thesis to Gallatin and to the thesis committee no less than four weeks before the anticipated defense date.                                 To submit the thesis to Gallatin and to the thesis committee, students should use the online Thesis Submission form. This form will send copies of the thesis to the adviser and to the second and third reader. At this stage, Gallatin will contact the adviser to confirm his or her approval of the thesis. Gallatin must have confirmation of the adviser's approval before the student will be allowed to schedule the defense.     Students completing an artistic thesis that entails a performance must arrange to have the committee members see the performance no less than one week before the defense.                           Scheduling the Defense                                           After the thesis has been submitted to Gallatin and to the thesis committee, the student should set a date and time for the defense and register this information with Gallatin at least three weeks prior to the defense.                                 By the time the student has submitted the thesis to Gallatin, he or she should be finalizing arrangements for the defense. Students should consult with all three panelists regarding the dates and times when they are available. When an acceptable date and time have been arranged, the student should complete the online Thesis Defense Registration form, which must be submitted at least three weeks prior to the defense. In addition to the date and time of the defense, the student should provide on the form the names of the committee members and their email addresses. A defense confirmation will be emailed to the student, the adviser, the second reader, and the third reader.   Please note: The student is responsible for acting as the liaison among the three members of the defense committee. Students must work with their committee members to find an acceptable date. The defense will, of course, be contingent upon final approval of the thesis itself by all three committee members. If one of the members rejects the paper, or requests substantial revisions, the defense date may have to be postponed unless changes can be made in time.   Students should also be aware that they may encounter some difficulties in finding committee members or arranging a date for a defense in January or September because of the limited availability of faculty during the summer months and winter recess.                           Defending the Thesis                                           On the appointed date the student will defend the thesis in a one-and-a half hour discussion with the three members of the committee.                                   If the thesis is approved at the defense, the committee will sign the final approval document and forward it to the Registrar's Office. Students who have passed the defense and have met all other degree requirements will be eligible for graduation.   If the committee asks for revisions, the student will have a specified amount of time to produce them and have them approved. (Such revisions may or may not set back the graduation date, depending on how long they take.) The committee may also ask for minor editorial changes, which will not delay graduation. Students will have up to 30 days to make these changes and submit the final thesis to Gallatin. In some cases, the committee may ask to see the revised thesis before it is added to the Gallatin Master's Thesis Archive .                           Submitting the Final Thesis                                           Within 30 days of the defense, students must submit the final version of the thesis to Gallatin.                                   At the time of the defense, the committee will complete the Instructions for the Final Thesis form. This form indicates what type of changes the student needs to make to the thesis before submitting the final thesis to Gallatin.   Within 30 days after the defense, the student must submit the final, corrected version of the thesis (please see the formatting guidelines for more information). The final thesis must be submitted electronically by completing the online Final Thesis Submission form.                      Thesis Defense Deadlines   In planning the date of the thesis defense, students must adhere to the scheduling calendar below. Students should note these time allowances do not include university holidays such as spring break and the winter recess. Therefore, if you are planning a May graduation and submitting your thesis to your adviser early in the spring semester, you will need to do this 11 weeks prior to your defense date (as opposed to normal 10 weeks), due to spring recess. Students should discuss the scheduling of their thesis completion with their advisers several months before the deadlines stated below.         Thesis submission deadline to adviser   Thesis submission deadline to Gallatin and to second and third readers Thesis defense registration deadline Term in which the student plans to complete the thesis Final date to defend the thesis          10 weeks prior to the defense date                  4 weeks prior to the defense date                  3 weeks prior to the defense date               Summer 2014*  September 18, 2014  Fall 2014  January 22, 2015  Spring 2015  May 15, 2015  Summer 2015*  September 23, 2015  Fall 2015  January 20, 2016  Spring 2016  TBA      * Due to the limited availability of faculty during the summer months and winter recess, students should be aware that they may encounter some difficulties in finding committee members or arranging a date for a defense in January or September. September graduation is appropriate for students who have completed most of the thesis by the late spring. Students must register for thesis advisement in the summer, if they plan on graduating in September.   Please note that these time allowances do not include university holidays such as spring break and the winter recess.        Matriculation Policy   Students must be matriculated at the time they defend the thesis. That is, students must be registered for Master\u2019s Thesis and Defense (for students who started in Spring 2013 or earlier) or Master's Thesis II (for students who started in Summer 2013 or later). Students who need additional time to complete the thesis must then register for Thesis Advisement each term (including the summer, if they plan on graduating in September) until they have successfully defended the thesis. Note that any credits earned through Thesis Advisement are not included in the 40-credit requirement for the master\u2019s degree. Thesis Advisement has a special tuition rate of $400 (plus a nonrefundable registration and services fee). Students may not maintain matriculation after completing 37 credits. Rather, they must enroll in Master\u2019s Thesis and Defense, Master's Thesis II, or Thesis Advisement (if appropriate).   Students who defend in time for January graduation do not need to matriculate in the spring semester. Students who defend in time for September graduation do not need to matriculate in the fall term, but do need to matriculate in the summer term. Please note: only students who will defend for September graduation are required to matriculate in the summer term.                    top of page                           Quick Links                            Thesis Submission Form            Thesis Defense Registration Form            Final Thesis Submission Form                                                                            NYU Gallatin Footer              Gallatin School of Individualized Study     1 Washington Place     New York, NY 10003     (212) 998-7370                   A&#8211;Z Index      Directions      Contact Us      Job Opportunities               News      Support Gallatin      Feedback                         Follow us on Facebook      Follow us on Twitter      Follow us on Youtube         Follow us Instagram                 Unless otherwise noted, all content copyright NYU Gallatin.
