Rather than attempting to predict the future of the country, \u201cSyria 2018\u201d projects these three plausible alternative scenarios and their consequences for U.S. interests.    In Scenario One, \u201cRegionalized Conflict,\u201d regional powers contend for influence within Syria through imperfectly-controlled proxies. Escalated fighting fragments the country along sectarian and ethnic lines, putting to rest any hope for a negotiated settlement. The conflict bleeds across borders, effectively overturning the post-World War I regional order in the Middle East, and invites competitive intervention by the great powers. This worst-case scenario is the current trajectory of Syrian events.    In Scenario Two, \u201cContained Civil War,\u201d great powers and regional actors conclude that unrestrained support to favored factions within Syria has produced diminishing returns, thus creating an opportunity to limit regional spillover. This restraint does not, however, permit a resolution to the conflict. Instead, the civil war remains tenuously contained within Syria, settling into a protracted, multi-sided sectarian conflict with aspects of proxy war among regional rivals. This is less likely than the regional conflict scenario, but more plausible than a negotiated settlement.    In Scenario Three, \u201cNegotiated Settlement,\u201d a subtle and potentially transitory shift in the power balance within Syria creates sufficient incentive for both parties to negotiate, and enables outside actors to exert pressure toward a settlement. As century-old political boundaries dissolve and sectarian enclaves emerge, a north-south partition and ceasefire holds, with the potential for a formalized political settlement on the horizon. The combination of coordinated outside action and internal political accommodation makes this the least likely of the three scenarios.    \u201cThe report contains several observations on U.S. policy for Syria that emerge from the alternate futures,\u201d said Michael Oppenheimer, the NYU-SCPS Center for Global Affairs clinical professor who leads the Scenarios Initiative. \u201cEach argues that the current U.S. posture of reactive and incremental escalation is insufficient to influence Syrian outcomes, whether the preferred outcome is a negotiated settlement, containment of the conflict within its current boundaries, or a victory by the opposition.\u201d    As the Obama Administration contemplates its response to the use of chemical weapons by the Assad regime, thinking about alternate scenarios is essential for placing policy options in context. A response seen as largely symbolic will have only transitory effect on the fundamentals, and will fail to alter the worst-case path towards regional sectarian conflict and state failure (scenario one). A robust response with no clear act two will lead to further escalation, not deterrence. Only a response with meaningful impacts on the ground and a clear willingness to preserve these advantages, will generate the leverage essential to either containment (scenario two) or negotiation (scenario three).

Rather than attempting to predict the future of the country, \u201cSyria 2018\u201d projects these three plausible alternative scenarios and their consequences for U.S. interests.    In Scenario One, \u201cRegionalized Conflict,\u201d regional powers contend for influence within Syria through imperfectly-controlled proxies. Escalated fighting fragments the country along sectarian and ethnic lines, putting to rest any hope for a negotiated settlement. The conflict bleeds across borders, effectively overturning the post-World War I regional order in the Middle East, and invites competitive intervention by the great powers. This worst-case scenario is the current trajectory of Syrian events.    In Scenario Two, \u201cContained Civil War,\u201d great powers and regional actors conclude that unrestrained support to favored factions within Syria has produced diminishing returns, thus creating an opportunity to limit regional spillover. This restraint does not, however, permit a resolution to the conflict. Instead, the civil war remains tenuously contained within Syria, settling into a protracted, multi-sided sectarian conflict with aspects of proxy war among regional rivals. This is less likely than the regional conflict scenario, but more plausible than a negotiated settlement.    In Scenario Three, \u201cNegotiated Settlement,\u201d a subtle and potentially transitory shift in the power balance within Syria creates sufficient incentive for both parties to negotiate, and enables outside actors to exert pressure toward a settlement. As century-old political boundaries dissolve and sectarian enclaves emerge, a north-south partition and ceasefire holds, with the potential for a formalized political settlement on the horizon. The combination of coordinated outside action and internal political accommodation makes this the least likely of the three scenarios.    \u201cThe report contains several observations on U.S. policy for Syria that emerge from the alternate futures,\u201d said Michael Oppenheimer, the NYU-SCPS Center for Global Affairs clinical professor who leads the Scenarios Initiative. \u201cEach argues that the current U.S. posture of reactive and incremental escalation is insufficient to influence Syrian outcomes, whether the preferred outcome is a negotiated settlement, containment of the conflict within its current boundaries, or a victory by the opposition.\u201d    As the Obama Administration contemplates its response to the use of chemical weapons by the Assad regime, thinking about alternate scenarios is essential for placing policy options in context. A response seen as largely symbolic will have only transitory effect on the fundamentals, and will fail to alter the worst-case path towards regional sectarian conflict and state failure (scenario one). A robust response with no clear act two will lead to further escalation, not deterrence. Only a response with meaningful impacts on the ground and a clear willingness to preserve these advantages, will generate the leverage essential to either containment (scenario two) or negotiation (scenario three). The risks of this path are clear, but can be assessed rationally only by considering the consequences of the current direction towards a regional conflagration with severe global consequences.    The CGA Scenarios Initiative aims to raise the quality of U.S. foreign policy by improving policymakers\u2019 understanding of and reaction to change. The project gathers experts from diverse skill sets and nationalities to participate in interactive scenario-building workshops.    The Initiative has attracted leading experts representing a wide range of academic, commercial, and diplomatic expertise in each of the target countries. These workshops are unscripted and conversational in nature. The format enables the participants to challenge prevailing assumptions and attitudes towards the country under analysis and express their personal views. Oppenheimer, its leader, has provided research, consulting, and policy advice for the U.S. foreign policy and intelligence communities, using similar scenario-building exercises, for almost four decades.    This latest report, funded by the Carnegie Corporation of New York, is the eighth in the CGA series that examines likely foreign policy issues facing the United States.

The first is that the United States can still dominate the U.N. when it wants to. The second is that a clear majority of other countries\u2019 leaders are quite relieved to follow an American lead. But the third is that the U.N. is only really still relevant in two\u2014admittedly sensitive\u2014regions: Africa and the Middle East.

From eastern Ukraine to northern Africa, conflicts crowd in on the European Union (EU). Yet the bloc\u2019s security may actually benefit from the ongoing instability in cases such as Ukraine, Mali and even Syria. The longer these conflicts absorb the energies of potential foes, ranging from Russian President Vladimir Putin to various Islamist radical groups, the less likely they are to menace the EU directly.

Nearly half a year after the furiously hyped but fundamentally hopeless peace talks between the government and moderate rebels in Geneva, no end to the fighting is in sight.

For more than a year they have played a major role in talks on humanitarian aid to Syria, forging a fragile consensus with Russia and China on the need to assist the suffering.
