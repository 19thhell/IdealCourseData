Some traditional marketing strategies are now completely outdated, others have been deeply transformed, and new digital marketing strategies are continuously emerging based on the unprecedented access to vast amounts of information about products, firms, and consumer behavior. From Twitter to Facebook to Google to GroupOn to Apple, the shared infrastructure of IT-enabled platforms are playing a transformational role in today\u2019s digital age.    The Internet is now encroaching core business activities such as new product design, advertising, marketing and sales, creation of word-of-mouth and customer service. It is fostering newer kinds of community-based business models. There is a lot of economic value accruing from the content generated in spaces mediated by social media. There are tangible means for monetization of content through newer forms of online advertising and interactive marketing tools on the mobile web. These processes are just beginning and will have enormous impact on our activities and the way we relate to people and organizations. Traditional marketing has always been about the 4Ps: Product, Price, Place, and Promotion. This course will examine how the digital revolution has transformed all of the above, and augmented them with the 5th P of Participation (by consumers).    In this program, we will examine best-practices related to the business use of social media and digital marketing. While there will be sufficient attention given to top level strategy used by companies adopting social media and digital marketing, the course will also focus on digital analytics oriented tools: how to make organizations more intelligent in how they conduct business in the digital age. Measurement plays a big role in this space. Thriving in such an environment requires the understanding and leveraging of the major mega-trends of today such as Digital Attribution Social Listening, Big Data and the Social-Graph for external and internal business innovation. Based on the composition of the participants, we will discuss how specific firms can create a comprehensive social media and digital marketing plan and execute it. At the end of two days, they will be able to speak the digital language and sell it internally.
