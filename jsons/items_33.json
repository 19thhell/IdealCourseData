Our mission is to prepare students to be thought leaders and successful global citizens. We do this by creating unique academic opportunities for student and faculty engagement that emphasize research and scholarly communication. Part of the College\u2019s Honors Program, the Advanced Honors Seminars place students in small classes with distinguished faculty to study topics that have the potential to change how we think and how we work. As such, they are ideal gateways for the intellectually stimulating discussions we aim to foster. They challenge students and faculty to engage intensively within and beyond their fields of study, and they inspire intellectual responsibility towards the scholarly community and the wider world. In spring 2005, the College of Arts and Science launched the Advanced Honors Seminar program, which extends the basic principles behind the Freshman Honors Seminars to upper-level courses (open to sophomores, juniors, and seniors). Distinguished professors drawn not only from the College\u2019s faculty but also from NYU\u2019s professional schools, and from among New York\u2019s professional, cultural, and governmental leaders, teach these small classes. In many instances, the seminars are cross-listed with departments and students may count the classes toward their majors or minors; in some cases, the classes will count only as electives. Advanced Honors Seminars have three central goals: to create close mentoring relationships between exceptional faculty and students; to challenge students intellectually through honors-level work in critical thinking, writing, and conversing; and to strengthen students\u2019 interest in and aptitude for conducting independent research (e.g. a DURF grant or a Senior Honors Thesis). They are designed to foster scholarly insight and debate and to nurture the intellectual passions of students and faculty alike. We encourage you to try one this year! G. Gabrielle Starr Seryl Kushner Dean of the College of Arts and Science Patrick Deer Director of College Honors Programs   Course Descriptions Past and Present in Irish Archaeology AHSEM-UA 134 Instructor: Pam Crabtree Monday and Wednesday, 12:30\u20131:45 p.m. Ireland has a rich archaeological heritage that includes hunter-gatherers of the Mesolithic Period, Megalithic tombs at Knowth and Newgrange, the Hill of Tara, early Christian monasteries such as Clonmacnoise, and the Viking settlements in Dublin itself. This course will consider how the Irish past has been constructed and what role that this construction has played in the modern world. We will review the archaeology of Ireland from its initial settlement in the Mesolithic through the British colonization of Northern Ireland in the early Modern Era. The course will also examine the impact of rapid economic development on Ireland\u2019s archaeological resources, including the current debate surrounding the site of Tara. Cross-listed with Anthropology as ANTH-UA 213.001 . Pam Crabtree , Associate Professor of Anthropology, is a zooarchaeologist whose research interests center broadly on the uses of faunal remains to study past animal husbandry patterns, hunting practices and diet. She is also interested in the use of archaeologically recovered animal remains to study trade, social status, ethnicity and prehistoric ritual. Her primary area of interest is later prehistoric and early medieval Europe, but she has also worked on Natufian settlement and subsistence in the Southern Levant and on 18th- and 19th-century sites in eastern North America. She is currently a member of an archaeological team that is surveying the Irish royal site of Dun Ailinne in Ireland. Her work has been published in a number of edited volumes and journals, including the Journal of Field Archaeology and World Archaeology . She and her co-author Bradley Adams recently completed a book entitled Comparative Skeletal Anatomy . Political Cinema and Representation of the \u2018Other\u2019 AHSEM-UA 170 Instructor: Shimon Dotan Monday, 6:20-8:50 p.m. In contemporary war, the \u2018Other\u2019 is viewed not only as an enemy to be fought but, often, as one to be eliminated. How do filmmakers fight against or, alternatively, reinforce, such deadly representations? This seminar will focus primarily, though not exclusively, on one of the world\u2019s most conflict-ridden regions\u2014the Middle East\u2014though it will also explore films from Soviet Russia, Nazi Germany, France and the United States. Through selected readings and film screenings, we will explore how the \u2018Other\u2019 is constructed politically, aesthetically and ethically. This class is designed for anyone interested in filmmaking and film criticism, in contemporary politics and history, especially those of the Middle East, in cinema of conflict and violence, and the ethical questions associated with them. Shimon Dotan , a Fellow of the New York Institute for the Humanities at NYU, is an award-winning filmmaker with thirteen feature films to his credit. His films have been the recipients of the Silver Bear Award at the Berlin Film Festival ( The Smile of the Lamb ), numerous Israeli Academy Awards, including Best Film and Best Director ( Repeat Dive; The Smile of the Lamb ), and Best Film at the Newport Beach Film Festival ( You Can Thank Me Later ). His film Hot House won the Special Jury Prize at Sundance in 2007. Dotan has taught filmmaking and film studies at Tel Aviv University in Israel and at Concordia University in Montreal, and is a member of the Directors and Writers Guilds of America. Country and City in Modern Chinese Literature and Film AHSEM-UA 178 Instructor: Jing Wang Monday, 3:30-6:00 p.m. This Seminar focuses on the tension and mutual dependency between the country and the city in modern China through the prism of modern Chinese fiction and Chinese film. The story of modern China, in a sense, is the story of the transformation of a rural society into an urban, industrial one. This profound change in the socioeconomic sphere has produced equally profound changes in people\u2019s experience and consciousness, which in turn produce their cultural visions and artistic expressions. The story of modern China is also a story about an organic member of an intimate social setting (say the family or the village) who becomes an enlightened, independent but lonely and alienated \u201cindividual\u201d amidst the crowd of strangers in the modern city. Or, conversely, it is about this cosmopolitan intellectual or professional\u2019s uneasy return to the hometown, to the countryside, about his or her confrontation with an embarrassing past, which can be disengaged rationally but not emotionally. These issues, to be sure, are not unique or particular to China; rather, they speak to contemporary men and women worldwide. To study the particular historical experience and cultural formations of modern China may help us better grapple with many central concerns of contemporary life as well as our understanding of it. The compressed temporality in China\u2019s rapid metamorphosis from a sleepy rural giant to the \u201cworkshop of the world\u201d not only means the mushrooming of Chinese cities, but also, and more importantly, an intense drama of social change, moral conflict, cultural diversity, and emotional strain. All of these have found their representation in literature and film: the rural-urban relationship offers us an excellent opportunity to examine and rethink the epic experience of modern China as exemplary of the human experience of modernity. Writers and works to be discussed include Lu Xun\u2019s \u201cHometown\u201d and \u201cNew Year\u2019s Sacrifice\u201d; Lao She\u2019s \u201cCamel Xiangzi\u201d; Mao Dun\u2019s \u201cSpring Silkworm\u201d; Shen Congwen\u2019s \u201cVegetable Garden\u201d; Ailing Chang\u2019s \u201cSealed Off\u201d, among others. Films to be screened and discussed include \u201cCrows and Sparrows\u201d and \u201cThe World.\u201d Jing Wang is Assistant Research Scholar in the College of Arts and Science and in the Department of East Asian Studies, where, from 1999 to 2006, she was Lecturer in Chinese. She is the editor and translator of Anthology of Short Stories by American Women Writers in the 1990\u2019s.

In addition to literary translations, she also publishes personal essays. Jews and Other Minorities in Nazi Germany AHSEM-UA 199 Instructor: Marion Kaplan Tuesday, 9:30 a.m.\u201312:00 p.m. The destruction of European Jewry has been a central focus in studying Nazi extermination policies. This course will look at Nazi policies towards the Jewish people and examine how the \u201cracial state\u201d (or racist state) dealt with those it deemed \u201cracially unfit\u201d to belong to the German Volk. It will analyze the ways in which the Nazis sought to create a nation based on blood and race. By studying policies towards the so-called \u201cenemies\u201d of the Third Reich -- including Jews, Sinti and Roma (Gypsies), the physically and mentally disabled, homosexuals, Afro-Germans, \u201casocials,\u201d etc. -- the course will also highlight how these policies interacted with each other. It will examine measures that the government enacted to delegitimize, isolate, rob, incarcerate, sterilize, and/or murder many of these minorities as well as measures intended to increase the \u201cAryan\u201d population. The course will also look at theories as to why many German perpetrators and bystanders participated in or allowed discrimination or murder to occur.

Music and Masquerade AHSEM-UA 200 Instructor: Edward Hubbard Tuesday and Thursday, 9:30\u201310:45 a.m. This course focuses on two specific cultural contexts \u2013 Brazil and Trinidad and Tobago \u2013 examining the work of artists who have integrated avant-garde and popular modes of expression. We will explore in close relation to each other the tropic\u00e1lia music movement of Brazil of the 1960\u2019s and 1970\u2019s and the artistry of Trinidadian carnival. Themes to be discussed include: the relationships that these cultural products have had with their publics; the merging of experimentalism and mass consumption; the sustained attack on the opposition of high and low culture; and the sociopolitical background to the works. Using the category of \u201cavant-pop,\u201d we will analyze the challenges that music and masquerade as expressive forms have posed to social conventions and to racial and cultural essentialisms. Cross-listed with Social and Cultural Analysis as SCA-UA 180.003. Edward Akintola Hubbard is Assistant Professor/Faculty Fellow in the Africana Studies Program. He holds a B.A. from the University of the West Indies (Jamaica), an M.A. from the University of Chicago and a Ph.D from Harvard University.

His dissertation research, based on three years of multi-sited fieldwork, is entitled Creolization and Contemporary Pop Iconicity in Cape Verde . His forthcoming publications include articles that explore black abjection in creole cultures by way of analysis of multiple forms of ethnographic data, primarily blason populaire; an experimental piece on race and the experience of the uncanny in ethnographic research; and a monograph on the globalization of acoustic batuku music in Cape Verde. Food, Land and Power AHSEM-UA 201 Instructor: Dean Itsuji Saranillio Monday, 4:55\u20137:35 p.m. This course explores settler colonial power within the context of Empire. As a comparative survey in Indigenous studies, this course highlights movements around sustainability, cultural regeneration, and food sovereignty that oppose and seek to replace industries founded upon resource extraction, a military industrial complex, and genetically modified crops. Using both historical and contemporary case studies, we will examine Indigenous movements that offer alternative economies as a means of producing alternative futures. That is to say, this course highlights the ways in which many Indigenous movements articulate their aims as liberation from the state itself rather than liberating the state from corruption. Cross-listed with Social and Cultural Analysis as SCA-UA 380.004 . Dean Itsuji Saranillio is Assistant Professor in the Department of Social and Cultural Analysis and the Director of the Asian/Pacific/American Studies program at NYU.

His current book project, Unsustainable Empire: Hawai\u2018i Statehood and the Theatricality of the Settler State , offers a genealogy of the state agencies that normalized public opinion for statehood while actively containing Native Hawaiian opposition through intimidation. Picturing Place: Images and Urban Change AHSEM-UA 202 Instructor: Mariana Mogilevich Wednesday, 9:30 a.m.\u201312:15 p.m. This seminar explores the roles that visual languages have in the production of the built environment and the interactive relationships between images and cities. We will look at how images of cities - like plans, maps, and digital renderings - and images in cities \u2013 such as billboards and community murals - influence urban change and perceptions of place. Exploring methods of visual analysis and debates in the history of urban planning and design, we will ask how images created in the studio and encountered on the street connect to larger power struggles over the future of the city. Cross-listed with Social and Cultural Analysis as SCA-UA 680.002. Mariana Mogilevich is a Visiting Assistant Professor of Metropolitan Studies in the Department of Social and Cultural Analysis. She holds a Ph.D in Architecture from Harvard University, and teaches courses in the history of architecture and the built environment.

She has written on waste landscapes and the politics of playground design, among other topics, and is at work a book on urban design in New York City and the invention of public space. Saloon Keepers, Seamstresses, and Servant Girls: A Social Survey of Irish New York in 1880 AHSEM-UA 203 Instructor: Nicholas Wolf Thursday, 9:30 a.m.\u201312:15 p.m. In 1880, following over a century of robust migration from Ireland, 750,000 residents of New York City could claim Irish ancestry, with a third of these first-generation immigrants. More Irish and their descendants were living in New York than in Dublin in that year, and it is this population that will serve as the basis for a semester-long research investigation of the demographic, social, and cultural dynamics of these residents as revealed in the 1880 U.S. census. The course will be built around the acquisition and deployment of digital analysis techniques for historical census data, focusing on the population of New York City. Skills emphasized will be collecting and organizing demographic data, statistical analysis of historical sources, and conveying research findings using today's digital mapping and chart-production programs. No prior knowledge in digital tools is required, although the aim will be for students to acquire digital analytical skills useful for a broad range of research. Cross-listed with History as HIST-UA 275.001 and with Irish Studies as IRISH-UA 181.003. Nicholas Wolf is Assistant Professor/Faculty Fellow at Glucksman Ireland House. He previously taught at Virginia Commonwealth University and was a Western Civilization Postdoctoral Fellow at George Mason University. He received his Ph.D at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.

Making History: Culture and Politics in the Caribbean AHSEM-UA 204 Instructor: Sibylle Fischer Wednesday, 3:30\u20136:10 p.m. The culture and history of the Spanish Caribbean islands \u2013 Cuba, Puerto Rico, Dominican Republic \u2013 will be at the center of this seminar. In addition, we will briefly study the French and English speaking Caribbean and the complicated place of the Caribbean coastal regions in continental Spanish America. The class will be organized around key moments of Caribbean history: slavery and the struggles against it; colonialism and independence movements; U.S. occupations, dictatorships and revolutionary movements; the massive growth of a Caribbean diaspora; and the transformation of the Caribbean islands into so many tourist destinations. We will work with primary sources such as slave testimonies, declarations of independence, and revolutionary discourses, and read literary texts by authors such as Julia Alvarez, Alejo Carpentier, Junot Diaz, Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez, Gertrudis G\u00f3mez de Avellaneda, and Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed. We will also study some of the most influential approaches to the Caribbean in cultural studies, anthropology and history.

Understanding Modern War Culture AHSEM-UA 205 Instructor: Patrick Deer Monday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m. What impact has war had on literature and culture? How have writers, intellectuals and citizens struggled to find a voice during wartime in the face of censorship, propaganda, trauma and the technologies of violence? What does it mean to live in a culture of war? This course explores these questions in a range of British, American and postcolonial novels, poems, and films. Beginning with some foundational representations of war cultures by Homer, Shakespeare and Tolstoy, we will chart the transformations and mutations of modern war culture from the era of colonial warfare, total warfare during the First World War, and imperial air power. We will explore the ways that writers, artists and film-makers have represented more recent conflicts like the \u201cPeople\u2019s War\u201d of World War Two, the apocalyptic imaginary of Cold War, guerilla warfare and counterinsurgency, to the mythology of \u201chigh tech warfare\u201d and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Focusing in particular on questions of gender, imperialism and resistance, we will read novels, poetry, memoirs, military writings and theoretical texts. Readings may be drawn from the work of: Homer, Shakespeare, Tolstoy, W.B. Yeats, Siegfried Sassoon and Wilfred Owen, Ernst Junger, Ernest Hemingway, Rebecca West, Virginia Woolf, George Orwell, W.H. Auden, Elizabeth Bowen, Graham Greene, Tim O\u2019Brien, Martin Amis, Michael Ondaatje, Anthony Swofford, and Riverbend. The course will also include discussions of a wide variety of films and popular culture.

Fictions of the Self AHSEM-UA 206 Instructor: Laura Levine Tuesday, 3:30\u20136:00 p.m. In two radically different ways, this course investigates the various fictions by which we invent a \u201cself:\u201d first through the study of memoirs, autobiographies, first person narratives, solo performances and case histories in which a \u201cself\u201d and an \u201cother\u201d are constructed; and second through the imitation of these forms. Student writing will be split between analytical essays on writers like Turgenev, Peter Handke, Maxine Hong Kingston, Faulkner, Kafka, Freud and Toibin and Friel and the production of original work using the forms and constraints these writers employed as objects of imitation. Such forms include the letter, the case history, the mystery, stream-of-consciousness and the invocation of biblical or classical material. In addition to exploring different genres as methods of creating a self, the course will examine the use of different subjects through which a \u201cself\u201d is imagined: mothers (Peter Handke, Maxine Hong Kingston, Colm Toibin), fathers (Kafka), siblings (Benjy\u2019s section of The Sound and The Fur y) and early love (Turgenev). We will also examine the process by which narratives constructed for the page are re-shaped as productions for the stage (comparison of Mark Haddon\u2019s Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night to the current London production) and to the use of multiple sustained monologues in plays like Faith Healer . This is a course specially designed for students with an interest in producing autobiographical work, work in the first person that \u201cposes\u201d as autobiography, or work that draws on the deliberate constraints of a form (letter, case history, mystery) as a way to illuminate autobiographical material. Laura Levine is Associate Professor of Theater Studies in Drama at Tisch, where she teaches courses in Shakespeare, Renaissance studies, and autobiography and solo performance.

The Crusades and their Legacy AHSEM-UA 207 Instructor: Jill Claster Thursday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m. The Crusades form one of the most important chapters in the history of the interactions among Christianity, Islam, and Judaism. They began at the end of the 11th century as religious wars to recover the holy places venerated by Christians in the city of Jerusalem. The unexpected result of the First Crusade was the conquest of lands in the Middle East known as the Latin Kingdom. For two hundred years, against all odds, the Crusaders managed to keep some of their newly won lands. They lost more of them with every passing decade, however, until at last the Muslims triumphed and the kingdom in the Middle East was lost to Western Christendom. We live in a time when the memory and the rhetoric about the crusades, for good or ill, permeate the Western World and the Islamic World, especially in the Middle East. This seminar addresses the many aspects of the crusading fervor which inform beliefs and politics to this day, such the nature of a Christian holy war and the nature of jihad; the question of whether the Crusades were the first manifestation of European imperialism in the Middle East; and the relations among the three great religious groups and how it came about that they all claim Jerusalem for their own. Cross-listed with History as HIST-UA 113.001. Jill N. Claster is Professor of History Emerita with a specialty in the Middle Ages; she has taught and studied the era of the Crusades extensively and is the author of the recently published book, Sacred Violence: The European Crusades to the Middle East, 1096\u20131396 .

Exploring the Archive: New York City &amp; Beyond AHSEM-UA 208 Instructors: Karen Karbiener and Marvin Taylor Wednesday, 2:00-4:45 p.m. This seminar is designed for juniors and seniors working on advanced research projects in the humanities. It will serve as an introduction to archival research while addressing the scholarly issues raised by the students\u2019 projects. Presentations are thus to be organized with students\u2019 projects in mind, and designed to enable archival research in a range of topics, periods of specialization, and languages. In addition to on-site workshops utilizing NYU\u2019s Fales Library and Special Collections, the course introduces students to the vast array of archival resources offered by New York City; an overnight trip to a distant archive (perhaps the Library of Congress or the Beinecke Library, both of which offer junior-level research fellowships that may be of interest) and information sessions on the construction and use of internet archives broaden the experience beyond city limits. In many humanities courses, students learn about a subject through reading secondary materials. Their research, however, is rarely significant in terms of discovering new knowledge or generating new perspectives. Working with primary materials in special collections, students in this class have an opportunity to work on materials and ideas that have not previously been considered. Participants will be guided as to how they might contribute original and truly \u2018new\u2019 discoveries to their fields of interest. Cross-listed with Global Liberal Studies as SCAI-UF 401.005.

Latinos, Im/Migration and Race AHSEM-UA 209 Instructor: Luisa Heredia Tuesday, 4:55-7:35 p.m. This course examines Latino immigration to, and integration in the United States. It will cover broad themes like why people migrate and what accounts for their integration into society, and the future of the U.S. racial hierarchy. More specifically it will trace the history of Latin American and Caribbean immigration, their distinct trajectories in the United States along a series of indicators and the impact of Latinos on U.S. society. The course will include, for example, investigations of Mexican and Dominican immigration to the United States as well as Puerto Rican migration from the island to the mainland. We will also examine important topics such as racialization processes, citizenship, and transnationalism. Through their engagement with course materials, assignments, and in discussions with their peers, students will bridge the academic literature on immigration with ongoing debates. Cross-listed with Social and Cultural Analysis as SCA-UA 541.002.  Luisa Laura Heredia is Assistant Professor/Faculty Fellow in the Latino Studies Program in the Department of Social and Cultural Analysis. She holds a Ph.D from Harvard University and came to NYU in the fall of 2011. Her work centers on Latino and immigration politics with an emphasis on migration control, social movements, religion, and membership and belonging in the United States and Spain. She is completing a book, Illegal Redemption: The Catholic Church and Latino Political Power in Era of Immigration Restriction , which explores how religion is strategically leveraged to challenge the state\u2019s production of a growing restrictive regime of immigration control in the United States and the inequality in citizenship it produces. She offers courses in Latino Studies and in SCA on immigrants and political engagement, the production of \u201cillegality\u201d in the United States and immigration politics and movements, and on U.S. Latinos and an evolving politics of citizenship and race. Politics of Resistance: Latin American Cultures in Neoliberal Times AHSEM-UA 210 Instructor: Gabriel Giorgi Tuesday and Thursday, 11:00 a.m.-12:15 p.m. From the \u201cChilean September 11th\u201d in 1973 to the recent massive mobilizations in Brazil in defense of public spaces threatened by privatizations, the last four decades of Latin American social life have revolved around the effects of neoliberalism. Dominant in the aftermath of the defeat of revolutionary movements in the 1970\u2019s, neoliberalism was imposed with unique force by its defenders as the region's only chance to develop modernizing economies and modern democracies. Since then, both at the heights of its influence in the 1980\u2019s and 1990\u2019s, and persistently contested after the 2000\u2019s, the \u201cneoliberal era\u201d shaped the destiny of most Latin American nations. In this context, Latin America will become a laboratory of creative interventions that explore new formats and new audiences, as in the emergence of the cartoneras publishing houses, the interface between technology and collective mobilization, and the networks between art collectives and social movements. Analyzing literary and cinematographic works by figures such Lucrecia Martel, Eduardo Coutinho and Roberto Bola\u00f1o, installations by Teresa Margolles, together with diverse experiences of cultural collectives, this course will explore the ways in which culture produces not only critical insights about neoliberal society but also alternatives to its most pervasive effects. Cross-listed with Spanish as SPAN-UA 551.004. Gabriel Giorgi is Associate Professor at the Department of Spanish and Portuguese Languages and Literatures. His research revolves around the politics of culture in Latin America since the 1960\u2019s, and the transformation of the status of art and culture. He has written about the relation between culture and sexuality in Argentina, the transformation of cultural cartographies of the Latin American city in the last decades, and the tensions between culture and neoliberalism, among other issues. His most recent book is Common Forms: Animal, Culture, Biopolitics , where he explores the place of the animal in contemporary Latin American culture. Nationalism and Global History AHSEM-UA 211 Instructor: Manu Goswami Tuesday and Thursday, 9:30-10:45 a.m. Nationalism is a major political, social, and cultural phenomenon of the modern world. This course explores the emergence and circulation of ideas of nationhood and national belonging in diverse yet interlinked regions, including present day Latin America and the Caribbean, South Asia and South-East Asia, and Europe. The course opens with a set of general readings that help establish the larger historical and analytical issues at stake. The central questions and themes of the course include: How did ideas of nationhood and national belonging emerge within and across regions? What was the relation between empire and nation? Did nationalist movements alter the meaning and significance of collective identities based on religion, gender, or class? How were concepts of nation, territory, and economy placed together in different nationalist movements? Does contemporary globalization signal the fading of nationalisms and nation-states? Secondary readings (historical and anthropological works) will be read alongside primary materials (novels, pamphlets, and archival documents) to address the historical and conceptual issues raised by nationalism as a global phenomenon. Cross-listed with History as HIST-UA 175.002. Manu Goswami is Associate Professor of History and the author of Producing India: From Colonial Economy to National Space (2004). Her research interests include nationalism and internationalism, political economy and economic thought, social theory and historical methods. Her articles have appeared in Comparative Studies of Society and History , American Historical Review , boundary 2 , Journal of Historical Sociology and Political Power and Social Theory , among others. Implications of Moral Diversity AHSEM-UA 212 Instructor: Steven Lukes Thursday, 3:30\u20136:10 p.m. This seminar focuses on a set of questions that arise from the recognition that there are diverse moral outlooks that involve incompatible moral judgments. How much diversity is there and how deep does it go? What makes an outlook and judgment moral? How recent is this recognition: does it arise from our increasingly multicultural societies and from the ever more prevalent discourse of human rights across the world? To what extent is that discourse ethnocentric\u2014a kind of moral imperialism? Are there non-Western (e.g. East Asian) cultures, which offer a challenge and alternative to talk of human rights? Do different moralities correlate with cultural differences? Are we witnessing a \u2018clash of civilizations\u2019? How should we respond to the claims of cultural relativism? We will read some classical texts\u2014such as Michel de Montaigne\u2019s Essays on custom and on cannibalism and Ruth Benedict on patterns of culture, and also contemporary work by sociologists, moral philosophers and others that discusses multiculturalism, moral and cultural relativism and the theory and practice of human rights. Cross-listed with Sociology as SOC-UA 939.001. Steven Lukes is Professor of Sociology. He studied philosophy, politics, and economics at Oxford, where he obtained his doctorate, writing a thesis on Durkheim under the supervision of the anthropologist E. E. Evans-Prichard.

He is also co-editor of Rationality and Relativism and The Category of the Person: Anthropology, Philosophy, History . His most recent book is Moral Relativism . Crowds and Collective Action AHSEM-UA 213 Instructor: William Klein Wednesday, 3:30\u20136:00 p.m. The word \"crowd\" today tends to suggest attendees of a sports or music event, and so if you google \"crowd control\" you will initially find security firms offering \"stanchions, barriers and accessories\" to help you manage your event--as though contemporary populations have been domesticated to the level of cattle. Though the Arab Spring, the Indignados movement and Occupy Wall Street have reminded everyone that crowds of a different sort are still capable of engaging in collective action, it is possible that contemporary mass demonstrations do not behave much like any of the various types of crowds of the past. Cities may have been designed and have certainly been policed to prevent spontaneous crowd formation; social media have changed the way crowds are organized and articulate themselves; and other media may have contributed to shifts in attitudes towards crowds. Yet at the same time, increasingly dysfunctional \"normal\" politics in the West, along with rising levels of displaced, dispossessed and persecuted people everywhere, are calling forth a resurgence of crowd activity, from the camp to the public square. This course offers a survey of the classic literature on crowds, (Le Bon, Freud, Cannetti, Rud\u00e9) as well as more recent contributions (Hardt and Negri's Multitudes ) in order to open a discussion about what has happened in the past and what is happening today in direct collective action. William Klein studied the history of political theory under J.G.A.   Pocock at Johns Hopkins and, as a Fulbright Scholar, under Quentin   Skinner at Cambridge. He specializes in legal and political theory, and   has served on the editorial review board of the Journal of the History of Philosophy .   At NYU, he teaches the history of ideas in Liberal Studies, and has   taught in the Freshman Honors Seminar program since 2003. He is   currently writing a study of the history and theory of sedition and has   also published works of fiction and art criticism. Language and Empire in the Americas AHSEM-UA 214 Instructor: Mary Pratt Friday, 11:00 a.m.\u20131:45 p.m. Empires by definition are multilingual regimes that bring languages into contact in highly charged, dynamic relations of power that continue to unfold after empires themselves dissolve. To translate is to enter but also empower the other\u2019s language. To be bilingual is to inhabit two worlds and be unfaithful to both. This course studies the unfolding drama of language and empire at two main sites: 1) the United States, where English only ideologies persist alongside a permanently renewed multilingualism, and 2) Spanish America, in the encounter between the Spanish imperialism and the Aztec and Inca empires, still resonating today. No background in linguistics is required, but linguistics students are welcome. Taught in English. (Counts as elective for these SCA majors/minors: AMST, LAT, SCA; Counts as elective for all majors in Spanish &amp; Portuguese Dept.)

Her seminal publications within these disciplines include: Imperial Eyes: Travel Writing and Transculturation (1992), an explanation on the discursive formation of Latin America and Africa as formulated by metropolitan writers; it has been called one of the most widely influential works of the last decade. Medieval Spain in Modern Fiction AHSEM-UA 215 Instructor: S.J. Pearce Tuesday and Thursday, 11:00 a.m.-12:15 p.m. In recent years, the idea of \u201cthe three cultures\u201d of medieval Spain \u2014 Christianity, Islam and Judaism \u2014 has become a popular ideal and model for modernity among a wide variety of thinkers and writers; and both utopian and distopian visions of Sefarad and Andalus (the Hebrew and Arabic terms that refer to the Iberian Peninsula) permeate discourses on politics, religion and even education. This course will examine the ways in which that nostalgia for a lost Andalus or Sefarad is both explored as a theme and used as a device in a wide variety of modern novels and short stories (as well as some poetry), and the ways in which modern authors deploy this trope to comment on the worlds they inhabit. Reading medieval Spanish texts alongside the writing they inspired in modernity will provide a diachronic framework for better understanding medieval Iberian literature and will also raise questions about the salience of the past for the present. Modern readings will include The Moor's Last Sigh by Salman Rushdie, Averroes' Search by Jorge Luis Borges, The Tamarit Diwan by Federico Garcia Lorca, and others.

Our mission is to prepare students to be thought leaders and successful global citizens. We do this by creating unique academic opportunities for student and faculty engagement that emphasize research and scholarly communication. Part of the College\u2019s Honors Program, the Advanced Honors Seminars place students in small classes with distinguished faculty to study topics that have the potential to change how we think and how we work. As such, they are ideal gateways for the intellectually stimulating discussions we aim to foster. They challenge students and faculty to engage intensively within and beyond their fields of study, and they inspire intellectual responsibility towards the scholarly community and the wider world. In spring 2005, the College of Arts and Science launched the Advanced Honors Seminar program, which extends the basic principles behind the Freshman Honors Seminars to upper-level courses (open to sophomores, juniors, and seniors). Distinguished professors drawn not only from the College\u2019s faculty but also from NYU\u2019s professional schools, and from among New York\u2019s professional, cultural, and governmental leaders, teach these small classes. In many instances, the seminars are cross-listed with departments and students may count the classes toward their majors or minors; in some cases, the classes will count only as electives. Advanced Honors Seminars have three central goals: to create close mentoring relationships between exceptional faculty and students; to challenge students intellectually through honors-level work in critical thinking, writing, and conversing; and to strengthen students\u2019 interest in and aptitude for conducting independent research (e.g. a DURF grant or a Senior Honors Thesis). They are designed to foster scholarly insight and debate and to nurture the intellectual passions of students and faculty alike. We encourage you to try one this year! G. Gabrielle Starr Seryl Kushner Dean of the College of Arts and Science Patrick Deer Director of College Honors Programs   Course Descriptions Past and Present in Irish Archaeology AHSEM-UA 134 Instructor: Pam Crabtree Monday and Wednesday, 12:30\u20131:45 p.m. Ireland has a rich archaeological heritage that includes hunter-gatherers of the Mesolithic Period, Megalithic tombs at Knowth and Newgrange, the Hill of Tara, early Christian monasteries such as Clonmacnoise, and the Viking settlements in Dublin itself. This course will consider how the Irish past has been constructed and what role that this construction has played in the modern world. We will review the archaeology of Ireland from its initial settlement in the Mesolithic through the British colonization of Northern Ireland in the early Modern Era. The course will also examine the impact of rapid economic development on Ireland\u2019s archaeological resources, including the current debate surrounding the site of Tara. Cross-listed with Anthropology as ANTH-UA 213.001 . Pam Crabtree , Associate Professor of Anthropology, is a zooarchaeologist whose research interests center broadly on the uses of faunal remains to study past animal husbandry patterns, hunting practices and diet. She is also interested in the use of archaeologically recovered animal remains to study trade, social status, ethnicity and prehistoric ritual. Her primary area of interest is later prehistoric and early medieval Europe, but she has also worked on Natufian settlement and subsistence in the Southern Levant and on 18th- and 19th-century sites in eastern North America. She is currently a member of an archaeological team that is surveying the Irish royal site of Dun Ailinne in Ireland. Her work has been published in a number of edited volumes and journals, including the Journal of Field Archaeology and World Archaeology . She and her co-author Bradley Adams recently completed a book entitled Comparative Skeletal Anatomy . Political Cinema and Representation of the \u2018Other\u2019 AHSEM-UA 170 Instructor: Shimon Dotan Monday, 6:20-8:50 p.m. In contemporary war, the \u2018Other\u2019 is viewed not only as an enemy to be fought but, often, as one to be eliminated. How do filmmakers fight against or, alternatively, reinforce, such deadly representations? This seminar will focus primarily, though not exclusively, on one of the world\u2019s most conflict-ridden regions\u2014the Middle East\u2014though it will also explore films from Soviet Russia, Nazi Germany, France and the United States. Through selected readings and film screenings, we will explore how the \u2018Other\u2019 is constructed politically, aesthetically and ethically. This class is designed for anyone interested in filmmaking and film criticism, in contemporary politics and history, especially those of the Middle East, in cinema of conflict and violence, and the ethical questions associated with them. Shimon Dotan , a Fellow of the New York Institute for the Humanities at NYU, is an award-winning filmmaker with thirteen feature films to his credit. His films have been the recipients of the Silver Bear Award at the Berlin Film Festival ( The Smile of the Lamb ), numerous Israeli Academy Awards, including Best Film and Best Director ( Repeat Dive; The Smile of the Lamb ), and Best Film at the Newport Beach Film Festival ( You Can Thank Me Later ). His film Hot House won the Special Jury Prize at Sundance in 2007. Dotan has taught filmmaking and film studies at Tel Aviv University in Israel and at Concordia University in Montreal, and is a member of the Directors and Writers Guilds of America. Country and City in Modern Chinese Literature and Film AHSEM-UA 178 Instructor: Jing Wang Monday, 3:30-6:00 p.m. This Seminar focuses on the tension and mutual dependency between the country and the city in modern China through the prism of modern Chinese fiction and Chinese film. The story of modern China, in a sense, is the story of the transformation of a rural society into an urban, industrial one. This profound change in the socioeconomic sphere has produced equally profound changes in people\u2019s experience and consciousness, which in turn produce their cultural visions and artistic expressions. The story of modern China is also a story about an organic member of an intimate social setting (say the family or the village) who becomes an enlightened, independent but lonely and alienated \u201cindividual\u201d amidst the crowd of strangers in the modern city. Or, conversely, it is about this cosmopolitan intellectual or professional\u2019s uneasy return to the hometown, to the countryside, about his or her confrontation with an embarrassing past, which can be disengaged rationally but not emotionally. These issues, to be sure, are not unique or particular to China; rather, they speak to contemporary men and women worldwide. To study the particular historical experience and cultural formations of modern China may help us better grapple with many central concerns of contemporary life as well as our understanding of it. The compressed temporality in China\u2019s rapid metamorphosis from a sleepy rural giant to the \u201cworkshop of the world\u201d not only means the mushrooming of Chinese cities, but also, and more importantly, an intense drama of social change, moral conflict, cultural diversity, and emotional strain. All of these have found their representation in literature and film: the rural-urban relationship offers us an excellent opportunity to examine and rethink the epic experience of modern China as exemplary of the human experience of modernity. Writers and works to be discussed include Lu Xun\u2019s \u201cHometown\u201d and \u201cNew Year\u2019s Sacrifice\u201d; Lao She\u2019s \u201cCamel Xiangzi\u201d; Mao Dun\u2019s \u201cSpring Silkworm\u201d; Shen Congwen\u2019s \u201cVegetable Garden\u201d; Ailing Chang\u2019s \u201cSealed Off\u201d, among others. Films to be screened and discussed include \u201cCrows and Sparrows\u201d and \u201cThe World.\u201d Jing Wang is Assistant Research Scholar in the College of Arts and Science and in the Department of East Asian Studies, where, from 1999 to 2006, she was Lecturer in Chinese.

Jews and Other Minorities in Nazi Germany AHSEM-UA 199 Instructor: Marion Kaplan Tuesday, 9:30 a.m.\u201312:00 p.m. The destruction of European Jewry has been a central focus in studying Nazi extermination policies. This course will look at Nazi policies towards the Jewish people and examine how the \u201cracial state\u201d (or racist state) dealt with those it deemed \u201cracially unfit\u201d to belong to the German Volk. It will analyze the ways in which the Nazis sought to create a nation based on blood and race. By studying policies towards the so-called \u201cenemies\u201d of the Third Reich -- including Jews, Sinti and Roma (Gypsies), the physically and mentally disabled, homosexuals, Afro-Germans, \u201casocials,\u201d etc. -- the course will also highlight how these policies interacted with each other. It will examine measures that the government enacted to delegitimize, isolate, rob, incarcerate, sterilize, and/or murder many of these minorities as well as measures intended to increase the \u201cAryan\u201d population. The course will also look at theories as to why many German perpetrators and bystanders participated in or allowed discrimination or murder to occur. Cross-listed with Hebrew and Judaic Studies as HBRJD-UA 720.001 and with History as HIST-UA 720.001 . Marion Kaplan is Skirball Professor of Modern Jewish History.

Music and Masquerade AHSEM-UA 200 Instructor: Edward Hubbard Tuesday and Thursday, 9:30\u201310:45 a.m. This course focuses on two specific cultural contexts \u2013 Brazil and Trinidad and Tobago \u2013 examining the work of artists who have integrated avant-garde and popular modes of expression. We will explore in close relation to each other the tropic\u00e1lia music movement of Brazil of the 1960\u2019s and 1970\u2019s and the artistry of Trinidadian carnival. Themes to be discussed include: the relationships that these cultural products have had with their publics; the merging of experimentalism and mass consumption; the sustained attack on the opposition of high and low culture; and the sociopolitical background to the works. Using the category of \u201cavant-pop,\u201d we will analyze the challenges that music and masquerade as expressive forms have posed to social conventions and to racial and cultural essentialisms. Cross-listed with Social and Cultural Analysis as SCA-UA 180.003. Edward Akintola Hubbard is Assistant Professor/Faculty Fellow in the Africana Studies Program. He holds a B.A. from the University of the West Indies (Jamaica), an M.A. from the University of Chicago and a Ph.D from Harvard University.

His regional focus is the Afro-Atlantic \u2013 specifically Cape Verde, Brazil and the Caribbean \u2013 with interests in pop culture, media, creolization, globalization, gothic and carnivalesque aesthetics, gender and sexuality. His dissertation research, based on three years of multi-sited fieldwork, is entitled Creolization and Contemporary Pop Iconicity in Cape Verde . His forthcoming publications include articles that explore black abjection in creole cultures by way of analysis of multiple forms of ethnographic data, primarily blason populaire; an experimental piece on race and the experience of the uncanny in ethnographic research; and a monograph on the globalization of acoustic batuku music in Cape Verde. Food, Land and Power AHSEM-UA 201 Instructor: Dean Itsuji Saranillio Monday, 4:55\u20137:35 p.m. This course explores settler colonial power within the context of Empire. As a comparative survey in Indigenous studies, this course highlights movements around sustainability, cultural regeneration, and food sovereignty that oppose and seek to replace industries founded upon resource extraction, a military industrial complex, and genetically modified crops. Using both historical and contemporary case studies, we will examine Indigenous movements that offer alternative economies as a means of producing alternative futures. That is to say, this course highlights the ways in which many Indigenous movements articulate their aims as liberation from the state itself rather than liberating the state from corruption. Cross-listed with Social and Cultural Analysis as SCA-UA 380.004 . Dean Itsuji Saranillio is Assistant Professor in the Department of Social and Cultural Analysis and the Director of the Asian/Pacific/American Studies program at NYU. He teaches courses on social movements, U.S. militarism and cultural politics at the intersection of Asian American and Indigenous studies. His current book project, Unsustainable Empire: Hawai\u2018i Statehood and the Theatricality of the Settler State , offers a genealogy of the state agencies that normalized public opinion for statehood while actively containing Native Hawaiian opposition through intimidation. Picturing Place: Images and Urban Change AHSEM-UA 202 Instructor: Mariana Mogilevich Wednesday, 9:30 a.m.\u201312:15 p.m. This seminar explores the roles that visual languages have in the production of the built environment and the interactive relationships between images and cities. We will look at how images of cities - like plans, maps, and digital renderings - and images in cities \u2013 such as billboards and community murals - influence urban change and perceptions of place. Exploring methods of visual analysis and debates in the history of urban planning and design, we will ask how images created in the studio and encountered on the street connect to larger power struggles over the future of the city. Cross-listed with Social and Cultural Analysis as SCA-UA 680.002. Mariana Mogilevich is a Visiting Assistant Professor of Metropolitan Studies in the Department of Social and Cultural Analysis. She holds a Ph.D in Architecture from Harvard University, and teaches courses in the history of architecture and the built environment.

She has written on waste landscapes and the politics of playground design, among other topics, and is at work a book on urban design in New York City and the invention of public space. Saloon Keepers, Seamstresses, and Servant Girls: A Social Survey of Irish New York in 1880 AHSEM-UA 203 Instructor: Nicholas Wolf Thursday, 9:30 a.m.\u201312:15 p.m. In 1880, following over a century of robust migration from Ireland, 750,000 residents of New York City could claim Irish ancestry, with a third of these first-generation immigrants. More Irish and their descendants were living in New York than in Dublin in that year, and it is this population that will serve as the basis for a semester-long research investigation of the demographic, social, and cultural dynamics of these residents as revealed in the 1880 U.S. census. The course will be built around the acquisition and deployment of digital analysis techniques for historical census data, focusing on the population of New York City. Skills emphasized will be collecting and organizing demographic data, statistical analysis of historical sources, and conveying research findings using today's digital mapping and chart-production programs. No prior knowledge in digital tools is required, although the aim will be for students to acquire digital analytical skills useful for a broad range of research. Cross-listed with History as HIST-UA 275.001 and with Irish Studies as IRISH-UA 181.003. Nicholas Wolf is Assistant Professor/Faculty Fellow at Glucksman Ireland House. He previously taught at Virginia Commonwealth University and was a Western Civilization Postdoctoral Fellow at George Mason University. He received his Ph.D at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. He teaches and researches on a wide variety of topics related to the culture of 18th and 19th century Ireland, including Irish religious history, the Irish language, demography, and historical geography. Making History: Culture and Politics in the Caribbean AHSEM-UA 204 Instructor: Sibylle Fischer Wednesday, 3:30\u20136:10 p.m. The culture and history of the Spanish Caribbean islands \u2013 Cuba, Puerto Rico, Dominican Republic \u2013 will be at the center of this seminar. In addition, we will briefly study the French and English speaking Caribbean and the complicated place of the Caribbean coastal regions in continental Spanish America. The class will be organized around key moments of Caribbean history: slavery and the struggles against it; colonialism and independence movements; U.S. occupations, dictatorships and revolutionary movements; the massive growth of a Caribbean diaspora; and the transformation of the Caribbean islands into so many tourist destinations. We will work with primary sources such as slave testimonies, declarations of independence, and revolutionary discourses, and read literary texts by authors such as Julia Alvarez, Alejo Carpentier, Junot Diaz, Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez, Gertrudis G\u00f3mez de Avellaneda, and Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed. We will also study some of the most influential approaches to the Caribbean in cultural studies, anthropology and history. While the class will be taught in English, reading knowledge of Spanish and French is very welcome. Cross-listed with Spanish as SPAN-UA 551.001. Sibylle Fischer holds a Ph.D in Comparative Literature and Spanish from Columbia University. She has held teaching positions at Duke as well as at Princeton and now teaches in the Department of Spanish &amp; Portuguese and the Center for Latin American and Caribbean Studies at NYU, with affiliations with Comparative Literature and Africana Studies.

Her study of the Haitian Revolution (1791-1804) and its impact on Caribbean national cultures, Modernity Disavowed , won book awards from the Modern Language Association, the Latin American Studies Association, The Caribbean Cultural Studies Association, and the Caribbean Philosophical Association. Understanding Modern War Culture AHSEM-UA 205 Instructor: Patrick Deer Monday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m. What impact has war had on literature and culture? How have writers, intellectuals and citizens struggled to find a voice during wartime in the face of censorship, propaganda, trauma and the technologies of violence? What does it mean to live in a culture of war? This course explores these questions in a range of British, American and postcolonial novels, poems, and films. Beginning with some foundational representations of war cultures by Homer, Shakespeare and Tolstoy, we will chart the transformations and mutations of modern war culture from the era of colonial warfare, total warfare during the First World War, and imperial air power. We will explore the ways that writers, artists and film-makers have represented more recent conflicts like the \u201cPeople\u2019s War\u201d of World War Two, the apocalyptic imaginary of Cold War, guerilla warfare and counterinsurgency, to the mythology of \u201chigh tech warfare\u201d and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Focusing in particular on questions of gender, imperialism and resistance, we will read novels, poetry, memoirs, military writings and theoretical texts. Readings may be drawn from the work of: Homer, Shakespeare, Tolstoy, W.B. Yeats, Siegfried Sassoon and Wilfred Owen, Ernst Junger, Ernest Hemingway, Rebecca West, Virginia Woolf, George Orwell, W.H. Auden, Elizabeth Bowen, Graham Greene, Tim O\u2019Brien, Martin Amis, Michael Ondaatje, Anthony Swofford, and Riverbend. The course will also include discussions of a wide variety of films and popular culture.

He is currently writing Deep England: Forging British Culture After Empire , and working on a book project on contemporary U.S. and British war culture, whose working title is Surge and Silence . Fictions of the Self AHSEM-UA 206 Instructor: Laura Levine Tuesday, 3:30\u20136:00 p.m. In two radically different ways, this course investigates the various fictions by which we invent a \u201cself:\u201d first through the study of memoirs, autobiographies, first person narratives, solo performances and case histories in which a \u201cself\u201d and an \u201cother\u201d are constructed; and second through the imitation of these forms. Student writing will be split between analytical essays on writers like Turgenev, Peter Handke, Maxine Hong Kingston, Faulkner, Kafka, Freud and Toibin and Friel and the production of original work using the forms and constraints these writers employed as objects of imitation. Such forms include the letter, the case history, the mystery, stream-of-consciousness and the invocation of biblical or classical material. In addition to exploring different genres as methods of creating a self, the course will examine the use of different subjects through which a \u201cself\u201d is imagined: mothers (Peter Handke, Maxine Hong Kingston, Colm Toibin), fathers (Kafka), siblings (Benjy\u2019s section of The Sound and The Fur y) and early love (Turgenev). We will also examine the process by which narratives constructed for the page are re-shaped as productions for the stage (comparison of Mark Haddon\u2019s Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night to the current London production) and to the use of multiple sustained monologues in plays like Faith Healer . This is a course specially designed for students with an interest in producing autobiographical work, work in the first person that \u201cposes\u201d as autobiography, or work that draws on the deliberate constraints of a form (letter, case history, mystery) as a way to illuminate autobiographical material. Laura Levine is Associate Professor of Theater Studies in Drama at Tisch, where she teaches courses in Shakespeare, Renaissance studies, and autobiography and solo performance. She did her doctoral work in English at Johns Hopkins University, and holds an M.A. in English and an M.F.A. in fiction writing from Columbia University as well as a B.A. from Bryn Mawr College. Her first book, Men in Women\u2019s Clothing: Anti-theatricality and Effeminization, 1579\u20131642 , examines anxieties about boy actors on the Renaissance stage. She is at work on a book about anxieties about witchcraft during the early modern period. She also writes about ballet. She is the recipient of grants from the NEH, the Mary Ingraham Bunting Association, and the Folger Shakespeare Library and is a 2010 winner of NYU\u2019s Distinguished Teaching Award. The Crusades and their Legacy AHSEM-UA 207 Instructor: Jill Claster Thursday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m. The Crusades form one of the most important chapters in the history of the interactions among Christianity, Islam, and Judaism. They began at the end of the 11th century as religious wars to recover the holy places venerated by Christians in the city of Jerusalem. The unexpected result of the First Crusade was the conquest of lands in the Middle East known as the Latin Kingdom. For two hundred years, against all odds, the Crusaders managed to keep some of their newly won lands. They lost more of them with every passing decade, however, until at last the Muslims triumphed and the kingdom in the Middle East was lost to Western Christendom. We live in a time when the memory and the rhetoric about the crusades, for good or ill, permeate the Western World and the Islamic World, especially in the Middle East. This seminar addresses the many aspects of the crusading fervor which inform beliefs and politics to this day, such the nature of a Christian holy war and the nature of jihad; the question of whether the Crusades were the first manifestation of European imperialism in the Middle East; and the relations among the three great religious groups and how it came about that they all claim Jerusalem for their own. Cross-listed with History as HIST-UA 113.001. Jill N. Claster is Professor of History Emerita with a specialty in the Middle Ages; she has taught and studied the era of the Crusades extensively and is the author of the recently published book, Sacred Violence: The European Crusades to the Middle East, 1096\u20131396 . She served as Dean of the College of Arts and Science and as Director of the Kevorkian Center for Near Eastern Studies. She was the recipient of a Fulbright grant and was honored with the Distinguished Alumni Award by the Alumni Association of NYU. Exploring the Archive: New York City &amp; Beyond AHSEM-UA 208 Instructors: Karen Karbiener and Marvin Taylor Wednesday, 2:00-4:45 p.m. This seminar is designed for juniors and seniors working on advanced research projects in the humanities. It will serve as an introduction to archival research while addressing the scholarly issues raised by the students\u2019 projects. Presentations are thus to be organized with students\u2019 projects in mind, and designed to enable archival research in a range of topics, periods of specialization, and languages. In addition to on-site workshops utilizing NYU\u2019s Fales Library and Special Collections, the course introduces students to the vast array of archival resources offered by New York City; an overnight trip to a distant archive (perhaps the Library of Congress or the Beinecke Library, both of which offer junior-level research fellowships that may be of interest) and information sessions on the construction and use of internet archives broaden the experience beyond city limits. In many humanities courses, students learn about a subject through reading secondary materials. Their research, however, is rarely significant in terms of discovering new knowledge or generating new perspectives. Working with primary materials in special collections, students in this class have an opportunity to work on materials and ideas that have not previously been considered.

Latinos, Im/Migration and Race AHSEM-UA 209 Instructor: Luisa Heredia Tuesday, 4:55-7:35 p.m. This course examines Latino immigration to, and integration in the United States. It will cover broad themes like why people migrate and what accounts for their integration into society, and the future of the U.S. racial hierarchy. More specifically it will trace the history of Latin American and Caribbean immigration, their distinct trajectories in the United States along a series of indicators and the impact of Latinos on U.S. society. The course will include, for example, investigations of Mexican and Dominican immigration to the United States as well as Puerto Rican migration from the island to the mainland. We will also examine important topics such as racialization processes, citizenship, and transnationalism. Through their engagement with course materials, assignments, and in discussions with their peers, students will bridge the academic literature on immigration with ongoing debates. Cross-listed with Social and Cultural Analysis as SCA-UA 541.002.  Luisa Laura Heredia is Assistant Professor/Faculty Fellow in the Latino Studies Program in the Department of Social and Cultural Analysis.

Her work centers on Latino and immigration politics with an emphasis on migration control, social movements, religion, and membership and belonging in the United States and Spain. She is completing a book, Illegal Redemption: The Catholic Church and Latino Political Power in Era of Immigration Restriction , which explores how religion is strategically leveraged to challenge the state\u2019s production of a growing restrictive regime of immigration control in the United States and the inequality in citizenship it produces. She offers courses in Latino Studies and in SCA on immigrants and political engagement, the production of \u201cillegality\u201d in the United States and immigration politics and movements, and on U.S. Latinos and an evolving politics of citizenship and race. Politics of Resistance: Latin American Cultures in Neoliberal Times AHSEM-UA 210 Instructor: Gabriel Giorgi Tuesday and Thursday, 11:00 a.m.-12:15 p.m. From the \u201cChilean September 11th\u201d in 1973 to the recent massive mobilizations in Brazil in defense of public spaces threatened by privatizations, the last four decades of Latin American social life have revolved around the effects of neoliberalism. Dominant in the aftermath of the defeat of revolutionary movements in the 1970\u2019s, neoliberalism was imposed with unique force by its defenders as the region's only chance to develop modernizing economies and modern democracies. Since then, both at the heights of its influence in the 1980\u2019s and 1990\u2019s, and persistently contested after the 2000\u2019s, the \u201cneoliberal era\u201d shaped the destiny of most Latin American nations. In this context, Latin America will become a laboratory of creative interventions that explore new formats and new audiences, as in the emergence of the cartoneras publishing houses, the interface between technology and collective mobilization, and the networks between art collectives and social movements. Analyzing literary and cinematographic works by figures such Lucrecia Martel, Eduardo Coutinho and Roberto Bola\u00f1o, installations by Teresa Margolles, together with diverse experiences of cultural collectives, this course will explore the ways in which culture produces not only critical insights about neoliberal society but also alternatives to its most pervasive effects. Cross-listed with Spanish as SPAN-UA 551.004. Gabriel Giorgi is Associate Professor at the Department of Spanish and Portuguese Languages and Literatures. His research revolves around the politics of culture in Latin America since the 1960\u2019s, and the transformation of the status of art and culture. He has written about the relation between culture and sexuality in Argentina, the transformation of cultural cartographies of the Latin American city in the last decades, and the tensions between culture and neoliberalism, among other issues. His most recent book is Common Forms: Animal, Culture, Biopolitics , where he explores the place of the animal in contemporary Latin American culture. Nationalism and Global History AHSEM-UA 211 Instructor: Manu Goswami Tuesday and Thursday, 9:30-10:45 a.m. Nationalism is a major political, social, and cultural phenomenon of the modern world. This course explores the emergence and circulation of ideas of nationhood and national belonging in diverse yet interlinked regions, including present day Latin America and the Caribbean, South Asia and South-East Asia, and Europe. The course opens with a set of general readings that help establish the larger historical and analytical issues at stake. The central questions and themes of the course include: How did ideas of nationhood and national belonging emerge within and across regions? What was the relation between empire and nation? Did nationalist movements alter the meaning and significance of collective identities based on religion, gender, or class? How were concepts of nation, territory, and economy placed together in different nationalist movements? Does contemporary globalization signal the fading of nationalisms and nation-states? Secondary readings (historical and anthropological works) will be read alongside primary materials (novels, pamphlets, and archival documents) to address the historical and conceptual issues raised by nationalism as a global phenomenon. Cross-listed with History as HIST-UA 175.002. Manu Goswami is Associate Professor of History and the author of Producing India: From Colonial Economy to National Space (2004).

Implications of Moral Diversity AHSEM-UA 212 Instructor: Steven Lukes Thursday, 3:30\u20136:10 p.m. This seminar focuses on a set of questions that arise from the recognition that there are diverse moral outlooks that involve incompatible moral judgments. How much diversity is there and how deep does it go? What makes an outlook and judgment moral? How recent is this recognition: does it arise from our increasingly multicultural societies and from the ever more prevalent discourse of human rights across the world? To what extent is that discourse ethnocentric\u2014a kind of moral imperialism? Are there non-Western (e.g. East Asian) cultures, which offer a challenge and alternative to talk of human rights? Do different moralities correlate with cultural differences? Are we witnessing a \u2018clash of civilizations\u2019? How should we respond to the claims of cultural relativism? We will read some classical texts\u2014such as Michel de Montaigne\u2019s Essays on custom and on cannibalism and Ruth Benedict on patterns of culture, and also contemporary work by sociologists, moral philosophers and others that discusses multiculturalism, moral and cultural relativism and the theory and practice of human rights. Cross-listed with Sociology as SOC-UA 939.001. Steven Lukes is Professor of Sociology.

Crowds and Collective Action AHSEM-UA 213 Instructor: William Klein Wednesday, 3:30\u20136:00 p.m. The word \"crowd\" today tends to suggest attendees of a sports or music event, and so if you google \"crowd control\" you will initially find security firms offering \"stanchions, barriers and accessories\" to help you manage your event--as though contemporary populations have been domesticated to the level of cattle. Though the Arab Spring, the Indignados movement and Occupy Wall Street have reminded everyone that crowds of a different sort are still capable of engaging in collective action, it is possible that contemporary mass demonstrations do not behave much like any of the various types of crowds of the past. Cities may have been designed and have certainly been policed to prevent spontaneous crowd formation; social media have changed the way crowds are organized and articulate themselves; and other media may have contributed to shifts in attitudes towards crowds. Yet at the same time, increasingly dysfunctional \"normal\" politics in the West, along with rising levels of displaced, dispossessed and persecuted people everywhere, are calling forth a resurgence of crowd activity, from the camp to the public square. This course offers a survey of the classic literature on crowds, (Le Bon, Freud, Cannetti, Rud\u00e9) as well as more recent contributions (Hardt and Negri's Multitudes ) in order to open a discussion about what has happened in the past and what is happening today in direct collective action. William Klein studied the history of political theory under J.G.A.   Pocock at Johns Hopkins and, as a Fulbright Scholar, under Quentin   Skinner at Cambridge. He specializes in legal and political theory, and   has served on the editorial review board of the Journal of the History of Philosophy .   At NYU, he teaches the history of ideas in Liberal Studies, and has   taught in the Freshman Honors Seminar program since 2003. He is   currently writing a study of the history and theory of sedition and has   also published works of fiction and art criticism. Language and Empire in the Americas AHSEM-UA 214 Instructor: Mary Pratt Friday, 11:00 a.m.\u20131:45 p.m. Empires by definition are multilingual regimes that bring languages into contact in highly charged, dynamic relations of power that continue to unfold after empires themselves dissolve. To translate is to enter but also empower the other\u2019s language. To be bilingual is to inhabit two worlds and be unfaithful to both. This course studies the unfolding drama of language and empire at two main sites: 1) the United States, where English only ideologies persist alongside a permanently renewed multilingualism, and 2) Spanish America, in the encounter between the Spanish imperialism and the Aztec and Inca empires, still resonating today. No background in linguistics is required, but linguistics students are welcome. Taught in English.

Medieval Spain in Modern Fiction AHSEM-UA 215 Instructor: S.J. Pearce Tuesday and Thursday, 11:00 a.m.-12:15 p.m. In recent years, the idea of \u201cthe three cultures\u201d of medieval Spain \u2014 Christianity, Islam and Judaism \u2014 has become a popular ideal and model for modernity among a wide variety of thinkers and writers; and both utopian and distopian visions of Sefarad and Andalus (the Hebrew and Arabic terms that refer to the Iberian Peninsula) permeate discourses on politics, religion and even education. This course will examine the ways in which that nostalgia for a lost Andalus or Sefarad is both explored as a theme and used as a device in a wide variety of modern novels and short stories (as well as some poetry), and the ways in which modern authors deploy this trope to comment on the worlds they inhabit. Reading medieval Spanish texts alongside the writing they inspired in modernity will provide a diachronic framework for better understanding medieval Iberian literature and will also raise questions about the salience of the past for the present. Modern readings will include The Moor's Last Sigh by Salman Rushdie, Averroes' Search by Jorge Luis Borges, The Tamarit Diwan by Federico Garcia Lorca, and others.

Our approach to understanding the diversity and evolution of past human behavior emphasizes ancient technologies and the importance of geological and environmental context for interpreting the archaeological record. The study of ancient technologies provides a solid foundation for interpreting the archaeological record and is a major research theme of the archaeology program in the Anthropology Department of New York University. We view artifacts as the basic unit of analysis for archaeologists. Artifacts are important in showing the evolution of technological complexity through time, and perhaps more importantly, provide the opportunity for rare insight into social processes associated with tool manufacture, use, and the ways in which developments in material culture are used as expressions of personal or group identity. The three faculty members provide students with theoretical, methodological, and hands-on training for each of the major technological facets of the archaeological record. They include the analysis of stone tools, artifact forms that dominate much of the 2.5 million years of the archaeological record; the production of symbolic artifacts that are crucial indicators of complex means of constructing identity through material goods (White), the production of pottery, a major transformation that facilitated increasing urbanization and large scale trade (Wright), and changes in food acquisition and processing (Crabtree) that mark fundamental differences in human interactions with the environment. The department maintains excellent laboratory facilities (experimental, ceramic, lithic and zooarchaeological) for teaching and hands-on research in prehistoric and protohistoric archaeology. These include an array of computer hardware and software, including image analysis and storage capabilities, fully equipped histological laboratory, in house optical and light microscopy, sample preparation, and zooarchaeological, ceramic and lithic technological comparative collections. The archaeologists in the department are committed to integrating students into long-term, ongoing field programs which they direct or in which they are key participants. At present, these include White\u2019s Paleolithic excavations at Abri Castanet, France, Crabtree\u2019s prospection and excavation at Dun Alinne, Ireland, and Wright\u2019s excavations and surveys at Harappa, Pakistan. These field and laboratory opportunities provide intensive training in excavation methods, data collection and analysis, geoarchaeology, total-station technology, remote sensing and Geographic Information Systems (GIS). Through collaboration with other departments and schools, students have access to technical support and courses through New York University, museums, educational institutions and CRM firms within the New York City metropolitan area. Working with small numbers of students (we typically accept two students a year), we are able to form strong collaborative ties and integrative programs among students and faculty. We consider mentoring and professionalization to be among our principal strengths.  SPECIAL RESOURCES AND FACILITIES IN ARCHAEOLOGY The department maintains excellent laboratory facilities for  teaching and research in protohistoric and prehistoric archaeology. An array of  computer hardware and software, including image analysis and storage  capabilities, is available for graduate research projects. In addition, there  is a state-of-the-art photographic laboratory, a thin-section laboratory for  seasonality studies, and excellent microscopic equipment, including access to  scanning electron microscopes. A zooarchaeological reference collection and  ceramics laboratory are available for teaching and research purposes.      Students  benefit from the close ties that exist between the department and other  programs and institutions. These include the Smithsonian Institution, the  American Museum of Natural History, the Museum of the American Indian, the  Museum of the City of New York, the New Jersey State Museum, the Center for  American Archaeology, and many museums, laboratories, and agencies in France,  Britain, Israel, Pakistan, and the former Soviet Union.  The Claire G. Goodman and Bert Salwen Fellowships are awarded   each year to students pursuing archaeological research, either in the   laboratory or in the field. Applications are normally due in mid-March.                  Pam J.
