Including a substantial field-based component, our programs are based on communicative methods of second language acquisition and a reflective model of teaching which incorporate collaboration with colleagues, students, and community. Our goal is to prepare professionals with a firm foundation in language, literacy, and applied linguistics along with an understanding of a range of second language teaching approaches that can be adjusted to suit the needs of different learner populations from diverse educational and ethnic backgrounds. The NYU programs in Bilingual Education affirm the value of heritage languages and cultures and take an additive view of second language acquisition.    Bilingual Education, M.A.    The Master of Arts program prepares teachers for bilingual settings at the early childhood, elementary, secondary, and post-secondary levels.
