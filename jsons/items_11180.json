When proficient, they play in a viol ensemble. The FAS Department lends students a viol and bow from its collection. Qualified students may play with The Teares of the Muses, an ensemble affiliated with the NYU Music Department. The group performs on- and off-campus. Requirements to enroll in the course are previous vocal or instrumental training on any instrument - not limited to strings - and good musicianship skills. *Please note that the class will not actually take place within a structured course time, as listed here. You will set up appointments for lessons with the professor. Introduction to Musicology - MUSIC-GA 2101 Wednesday 3:00-5:00 Instructor: Michael Beckerman This course is intended a) to introduce current scholarship in musicology - its concerns, it methods, its historical, cultural and theoretical foundations; 2) to give specific practice in the skills of critical reading, historical research, interpretation of musical scores, and research project design; 3) to teach writing in diverse genres of musicology and 4) most importantly, to teach students how to teach themselves a field, and how, once they've done so, to capture, refine, and transform into scholarly work the new thoughts and new ideas about various fields that rise from their own imaginations. Ethnomusicology: History and Theory - MUSIC-GA 2136 Thursday 10:30-12:30 Instructor: David Samuels A broad intellectual history of the discipline, surveying landmark studies and important figures. Examines major paradigms, issues, and frameworks in ethnomisucology. The relation to other disciplines, and the relations of knowledge and power that have produced them. Serves as an introduction to the field of ethnomusicology.  Techniques of Music Composition - MUSIC-GA 2162 Tuesday 10:30-12:30 Instructor: Louis Karchin (section 001) Instructor: Jaime Oliver (section 002) * Contact the instructor directly for lesson schedules  Students meet individually with a selected faculty member frequently   throughout the semester, to review and discuss their ongoing creative   work. All students enrolled in this course must also participate a   bi-weekly seminar, led by rotating faculty, that will encompass   discussions of technical, aesthetic, and theoretical issues related to   20th/21st century composition. These seminars may also include talks or   masterclasses by guests actively involved in the creation or performance   of music.   Special Studies: The Sabbateni collection of manuscripts and editions in Fales, and its music - MUSIC-GA 2198 (section 001) Thursday 2:00-4:00 Instructor: Stanley Boorman This course provides the opportunity to work with original sources, manuscripts and editions. The large Sabbateni collection comes from the end of the 16th century, and certainly from Prague. The course will study the sources as documents, the music they contain (by some of the major composers of the time, as well as previously unknown music), performance issues, and the impact of the cultural background of Prague as Imperial capital and hotbed of religious dispute. The course will require continuous work with the original materials, in the Fales collections in Bobst Library.   Special Studies: Luigi Nono - critical thought, compositional pathways, and sonic travels inward - MUSIC-GA 2198 (section 002) Monday 2:00-4:00 Instructor: Elizabeth Hoffman When Luigi Nono encountered a particular medieval inscription on a Spanish monastery toward the end of his life, the phrase spoke to him directly: \"...there are no paths, only traveling itself.\" This course is an in-depth study of Nono's political, social, and musical thought; and a detailed exploration of his compositional practice over the course of his life. The ultimate goal of the course is to consider, with the benefit of the most recent scholarship on Nono and on/by selected colleagues and students, of the relationship of these two realms, i.e., the socio-political and the sonic. We will spend more extended time exploring individual works of music, some of which border on theater of a unique sort, and all of which are highly concerned with prompting heightened consciousness through listening ideals.  Special Studies: Genre and Popular Music - Aesthetics, Economics, Identities - MUSIC-GA 2199 (section 001) Tuesday 2:00-4:00 Instructor: Maureen Mahon Genre, a way of categorizing creative work, plays a significant role in the ways popular music is produced, promoted, circulated, and consumed. In this course, we will discuss popular musical genres, primarily in the 20th &amp; 21st century United States, and consider the following questions: How have music scholars historicized, analyzed, and critiqued the formation of music genres? How do aesthetic considerations, economic interests, and social forces shape the ways musicians, audiences, and music industry professionals define and assign musical sounds and practices to genres? What is the impact of these categories on music making, music marketing, and identity construction? How do musical and \"extra-musical\" factors contribute to the definition of genre? How and why do music genres change? How and why do music genres matter?   Special Studies: Globalization of Irish Music, Dance, Literature and Theatre Performance - MUSIC-GA 2199 (section 002) Monday 6:10-8:40 Instructor: Mick Moloney This seminar is an introduction to the complex processes of cultural globalization. The area of exploration is the cultural landscape of Ireland and Irish America, in particular Irish music, dance, literature and theatre. The seminar leaders Jean Butler and Mick Moloney bring a wide range of experience as performers and teachers to the subject matter. The course will explore the interrelated and codependent dynamics of the local and the global, addressing processes that alter the perception of how culture is constructed, received, transmitted and transformed throughout time and space. As Ireland approaches the centenary of the Easter Uprising of 1916, this course will identify cultural landmarks that illustrate the effect of globalization has on the Irish psyche at home and abroad. The multiple identities of Ireland and its diaspora worldwide are and have been in constant flux through the global re-imaginings of works such as Sean O'Casey's Juno and the Paycock , Brian Friel's Dancing at Lughnasa , the Irish-Step Dance spectacular Riverdance , Michael Keegan Dolan's The Bull, Colin Dunne's Out of Time , John McColgan's Heartbeat of Home , and Martin McDonagh's Cripple of Inishmaan , and various seminal Irish influences on the formation of what are now considered to be central forms of American culture over the past three centuries. Theoretical perspectives will be drawn from a wide range of literature on globalization which transcends nation states and conventional modalities of communication and particular attention will be paid to the experiences and changing cultures of the vast numbers of migrant workers currently on the move all over the world. This seminar will take the form of a reading, discussion and research group whereby students will engage in recent literature on cultural globalization, performance studies and digital video and audio recordings.
