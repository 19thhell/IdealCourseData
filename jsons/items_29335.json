The courses are offered by the Global Institute of Public Health and taught by expert faculty from around the university. In Albert, the courses can be found under the heading of University College and begin with UGPH-GU.   Please note that there may be a few exceptions to the courses below based on specialized degree requirements within a specific major. Students will work with his/her advisor on exact global public health course requirements.          Core Course Descriptions &amp; Syllabi                                                    UGPH-GU 10 Health and Society in a Global Context                               A recent syllabus may be found here.    This course examines social, behavioral and cultural factors that have an impact on public health in community, national and global contexts. We will consider how health is influenced by factors such as age, gender, culture, race and ethnicity, sexual orientation, and social class. Public health problems and their solutions will be analyzed in light of individual risk factors as well as larger structural forces.                                                              UGPH-GU 20 Biostatistics for Public Health                               A recent syllabus may be found here.   This course introduces basic concepts and techniques in the analysis of public health data. It is an applied course, emphasizing use, interpretation and limits of statistical analysis. Real world examples are used as illustrations, and computer-based data analysis is integrated into the course.                                                              UGPH-GU 30 Epidemiology for Global Health                               A recent syllabus may be found here.   Epidemiology is the study of the distribution and determinants of health and illness in human populations worldwide. The overall objective of this course is to introduce students to the history, principles, and methods of epidemiology in a global context. Students will also examine epidemiological theories, analytic approaches, and tools from a global health perspective. Finally, students will develop the necessary skills to critically read, interpret, and appraise published epidemiological studies and to locate, use, evaluate, and synthesize information from mass media sources.                                                              UGPH-GU 40 Health Policy in a Global World                               A recent syllabus may be found here.   This course introduces students to key concepts in health policy formation, implementation and evaluation in a global context. Using a comparative lens, students explore organization, financing and delivery of health care services and health systems around the world. We examine the role of governmental and non-governmental agencies in delivering care and contributing to a health care infrastructure using case studies and other materials in a comparative approach. Key lessons in the implementation of new health policies and initiatives are explored across the developing world, as well as in a US as students explore health system performance, the quality and cost of care, the management of health care services, the process of health improvement and health reform. The course will use a multidisciplinary approach that employs sociological, political, economics, and ethical perspectives. The objective is to build an understanding of the fundamental ideas, issues, and problems currently debated in global health policy and management and to provide a foundation for future studies and careers in the global health field. Epidemiology in a Global World and Health and Society in a Global Context are recommended but not required pre-requisites for the course.                                                              UGPH-GU 50 Environmental Health in a Global World                               This course will examine some of the key issues and principles of environmental health practice. It will focus on the how environmental health issues are defined and approached by civic groups, governmental officials and researchers. It will highlight how environmental threats come to the attention of the public and weigh the options for addressing these threats. Finally, it will underscore the need for multi-disciplinary approaches in understanding these threats and crafting solutions. We will focus on prevention of environmentally mediated diseases and discuss challenges to effective prevention.                                                              UGPH-GU 60 Undergraduate Experiential Learning in Global Public Health                               The global health undergraduate internship has a three-fold goal: It: 1) broadens the student\u2019s exposure to public health issues, 2) facilitates opportunities for student\u2019s to observe public health work and leadership in action, and 3) increases the student\u2019s knowledge of specific career opportunities. The internship is a semester long course where the student engages in fieldwork (a minimum of 90 hours) and attends in-class seminar sessions. The integration of didactic and practice experiences provide the student with opportunities to critically reflect on the fieldwork experience, complete a public health project that is mutually beneficial to the student and the organization, and synthesize public health knowledge, skills, and attitudes.                              Global Public Health Electives        The following courses may be used to satisfy the elective requirement for the global public health major. Please note that the relevant electives use to fulfill the requirement may be taken either through the GPH major (starting with UGPH-GU) or through the major department).                                                  UGPH-GU 80 Public Health Entrepreneurial Ventures                               Fall semester  4 credits  Pre-requisites: UGPH-GU 30 and UGPH-GU 40   A new GIPH course focused on creating sustainable and scalable Public Health business models, either as stand-alone entities or within a larger corporation. Teams of undergraduate students will explore specific Public Health needs that can be addressed via innovative, entrepreneurial ventures and gain increased business and entrepreneurship skills in a Public Health context.                                                              UGPH-GU 90 Topics in Public Health: Controversies and Debates                               Fall semester  4 credits  Pre-requisites: none   The provocative controversy as to whether New York City should ban sugary drinks larger than 16 ounces to lower rates of obesity and diabetes is merely the latest example of the ongoing historical debate over how we should be best protect the public\u2019s health while respecting civil liberties. Modern public health began with the sanitation movement in England in the mid-nineteenth century. Since then, health officials have instituted mandatory vaccine programs, detained infectious patients and passed laws to limit smoking, change people\u2019s diets and mandate traffic safety measures. Despite the improved health that these measures have helped to produce, industry, politicians and libertarian critics have opposed aspects of these initiatives using the mantle of preserving civil rights. This class will use primary and secondary written documents as well as public-service announcements, movies and documentaries to explore how these issues have been characterized and debated in the United States over the past 150 years. Have specific groups in society been unfairly stigmatized by public health efforts? Do we have the right to compel \u201cbetter\u201d behaviors if people are only hurting themselves and not others? Did health officials deliberately exaggerate the dangers of \u201csecond-hand smoke\u201d to get stricter anti-smoking laws passed? Why do we call drunk driving crashes \u201caccidents\u201d when the behavior of drunk drivers is not at all accidental? This course will be multidisciplinary in its attention not only to modern public health debates and their historical precedents but also to the ethical and medical issues raised.                                                                UGPH-GU 100 Pre-Health Honors                               Fall semester  4 credits  Open only to students in the Global Public Health/Pre-Health major    Through analysis of texts, lectures, and in-class assignments, this seminar engages students in conceptualizing and developing a public health honors thesis. In the first part of the course, the seminar engages students in discussion about the aims and content of research on public health topics, and students develop research questions to pursue. In the second part of the course, working closely with faculty, students undertake a research project, completing an honors thesis as the final product.                                                              UGPH-GU 158 History of Medicine                               Fall semester  4 credits  Pre-requisites: none  cross-listed with HIST-UA 158   This seminar will explore the immense historical importance of infectious disease, in particular, using it as a lens to confront larger issues in the changing world of medical practice and investigation. We will study the impact of disease at critical points in American history. We will discuss the great epidemics that devastated our nation, as well as the scientific breakthroughs in epidemiology, vaccines and antibiotics that tamed the scourge of cholera, polio, typhoid fever, and influenza, among other deadly diseases. We will study how the battle against disease revolutionized philanthropy and medical research in the United States. We will see the consequences and cultural impact of disease upon different segments of the American population. And we will look at current diseases yet to be fully understood or conquered, such as HIV/AIDS.

The courses are offered by the Global Institute of Public Health and taught by expert faculty from around the university. In Albert, the courses can be found under the heading of University College and begin with UGPH-GU.   Please note that there may be a few exceptions to the courses below based on specialized degree requirements within a specific major. Students will work with his/her advisor on exact global public health course requirements.          Core Course Descriptions &amp; Syllabi                                                    UGPH-GU 10 Health and Society in a Global Context                               A recent syllabus may be found here.    This course examines social, behavioral and cultural factors that have an impact on public health in community, national and global contexts. We will consider how health is influenced by factors such as age, gender, culture, race and ethnicity, sexual orientation, and social class. Public health problems and their solutions will be analyzed in light of individual risk factors as well as larger structural forces.                                                              UGPH-GU 20 Biostatistics for Public Health                               A recent syllabus may be found here.   This course introduces basic concepts and techniques in the analysis of public health data. It is an applied course, emphasizing use, interpretation and limits of statistical analysis. Real world examples are used as illustrations, and computer-based data analysis is integrated into the course.                                                              UGPH-GU 30 Epidemiology for Global Health                               A recent syllabus may be found here.   Epidemiology is the study of the distribution and determinants of health and illness in human populations worldwide. The overall objective of this course is to introduce students to the history, principles, and methods of epidemiology in a global context. Students will also examine epidemiological theories, analytic approaches, and tools from a global health perspective. Finally, students will develop the necessary skills to critically read, interpret, and appraise published epidemiological studies and to locate, use, evaluate, and synthesize information from mass media sources.                                                              UGPH-GU 40 Health Policy in a Global World                               A recent syllabus may be found here.   This course introduces students to key concepts in health policy formation, implementation and evaluation in a global context. Using a comparative lens, students explore organization, financing and delivery of health care services and health systems around the world. We examine the role of governmental and non-governmental agencies in delivering care and contributing to a health care infrastructure using case studies and other materials in a comparative approach. Key lessons in the implementation of new health policies and initiatives are explored across the developing world, as well as in a US as students explore health system performance, the quality and cost of care, the management of health care services, the process of health improvement and health reform. The course will use a multidisciplinary approach that employs sociological, political, economics, and ethical perspectives. The objective is to build an understanding of the fundamental ideas, issues, and problems currently debated in global health policy and management and to provide a foundation for future studies and careers in the global health field. Epidemiology in a Global World and Health and Society in a Global Context are recommended but not required pre-requisites for the course.                                                              UGPH-GU 50 Environmental Health in a Global World                               This course will examine some of the key issues and principles of environmental health practice. It will focus on the how environmental health issues are defined and approached by civic groups, governmental officials and researchers. It will highlight how environmental threats come to the attention of the public and weigh the options for addressing these threats. Finally, it will underscore the need for multi-disciplinary approaches in understanding these threats and crafting solutions. We will focus on prevention of environmentally mediated diseases and discuss challenges to effective prevention.                                                              UGPH-GU 60 Undergraduate Experiential Learning in Global Public Health                               The global health undergraduate internship has a three-fold goal: It: 1) broadens the student\u2019s exposure to public health issues, 2) facilitates opportunities for student\u2019s to observe public health work and leadership in action, and 3) increases the student\u2019s knowledge of specific career opportunities. The internship is a semester long course where the student engages in fieldwork (a minimum of 90 hours) and attends in-class seminar sessions. The integration of didactic and practice experiences provide the student with opportunities to critically reflect on the fieldwork experience, complete a public health project that is mutually beneficial to the student and the organization, and synthesize public health knowledge, skills, and attitudes.                              Global Public Health Electives        The following courses may be used to satisfy the elective requirement for the global public health major. Please note that the relevant electives use to fulfill the requirement may be taken either through the GPH major (starting with UGPH-GU) or through the major department).                                                  UGPH-GU 80 Public Health Entrepreneurial Ventures                               Fall semester  4 credits  Pre-requisites: UGPH-GU 30 and UGPH-GU 40   A new GIPH course focused on creating sustainable and scalable Public Health business models, either as stand-alone entities or within a larger corporation. Teams of undergraduate students will explore specific Public Health needs that can be addressed via innovative, entrepreneurial ventures and gain increased business and entrepreneurship skills in a Public Health context.                                                              UGPH-GU 90 Topics in Public Health: Controversies and Debates                               Fall semester  4 credits  Pre-requisites: none   The provocative controversy as to whether New York City should ban sugary drinks larger than 16 ounces to lower rates of obesity and diabetes is merely the latest example of the ongoing historical debate over how we should be best protect the public\u2019s health while respecting civil liberties. Modern public health began with the sanitation movement in England in the mid-nineteenth century. Since then, health officials have instituted mandatory vaccine programs, detained infectious patients and passed laws to limit smoking, change people\u2019s diets and mandate traffic safety measures. Despite the improved health that these measures have helped to produce, industry, politicians and libertarian critics have opposed aspects of these initiatives using the mantle of preserving civil rights. This class will use primary and secondary written documents as well as public-service announcements, movies and documentaries to explore how these issues have been characterized and debated in the United States over the past 150 years. Have specific groups in society been unfairly stigmatized by public health efforts? Do we have the right to compel \u201cbetter\u201d behaviors if people are only hurting themselves and not others? Did health officials deliberately exaggerate the dangers of \u201csecond-hand smoke\u201d to get stricter anti-smoking laws passed? Why do we call drunk driving crashes \u201caccidents\u201d when the behavior of drunk drivers is not at all accidental? This course will be multidisciplinary in its attention not only to modern public health debates and their historical precedents but also to the ethical and medical issues raised.                                                                UGPH-GU 100 Pre-Health Honors                               Fall semester  4 credits  Open only to students in the Global Public Health/Pre-Health major    Through analysis of texts, lectures, and in-class assignments, this seminar engages students in conceptualizing and developing a public health honors thesis. In the first part of the course, the seminar engages students in discussion about the aims and content of research on public health topics, and students develop research questions to pursue. In the second part of the course, working closely with faculty, students undertake a research project, completing an honors thesis as the final product.
