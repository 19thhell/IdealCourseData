You may not repeat a course that counts toward the program more than once.   Required Courses (18 Credits)   TR-GY 6013 ( Please refer to the bulletin ) 3.00 Credits Forecasting Urban Travel Demand TR-GY 6113 The purpose of this course is to study methods and models used in estimating and forecasting person travel in urban areas. The objective is to understand the fundamental relationships between land use, transportation level of service and travel demand, and to apply methods and state-of-the-practice models for predicting person travel on the transportation system. Prerequisite/Corequisite: TR-GY 6013 or permission of instructor. TR-GY 6313 ( Please refer to the bulletin ) TR-GY 6323 ( Please refer to the bulletin ) TR-GY 6213 ( Please refer to the bulletin ) 3.00 Credits Intelligent Transportation Systems and Their Applications TR-GY 6223 This course introduces the concepts and applications of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) and its growing role in the management of transportation systems. The course stresses the role of ITS as national policy, as specified in major transportation funding legislation \u2013 ISTEA, TEA21 and SAFETY-LU. A systems engineering approach to overall development of ITS technologies is stressed. Major components of ITS are discussed, and examples of their application treated. Coordination and integration of ITS components are treated. Prerequisite: Graduate status or permission of instructor.

Prerequisite: Graduate Standing 3.00 Credits Urban Public Transportation Systems TR-GY 7133 This course provides a thorough understanding of policy, planning, operational and technical issues that affect urban public transportation. It includes the historical development of cites and the rise of urban transport. Also covered are the characteristics of various urban transportation modes (their specific operating and infrastructure characteristics), as well as key elements that are critical to service provision, such as service planning, scheduling, fare collection, communication and signaling, station design and customer service. The course offers a broad perspective on regional planning, capital programming and policy matters. Special focus will be on emerging technologies and their practical applications. Prerequisite: Graduate status or permission of instructor. 3.00 Credits Design of Parking & Terminal Facilities TR-GY 7323 This course covers design techniques and approaches to a variety of pedestrian and vehicular needs in conjunction with access to land functions. Parking serves as the primary access interface to many land facilities, from shopping centers and sports facilities, to medium- and high-density residential developments. The planning and design of parking facilities, and the planning of access and egress from these facilities, is critical to the economic success of a development. Terminals are inter-modal interface facilities involving the transfer of people and/or goods from one mode of transportation to another. This course covers essential elements of terminal planning and design, including transit stations and terminals, major goods terminals at ports and railheads and others. The design of pedestrian space and ways within terminal structures is also treated Prerequisite: Graduate status or permission of instructor. 3.00 Credits Multimodal Transportation Safety TR-GY 7033 Technology, legislation and market forces have contributed to improved transportation safety for decades.

The program has a strong foundation in traffic engineering, transportation planning, transportation economics, public transportation systems, and intelligent transportation systems. To ensure that you are immediately productive upon graduation, you will tackle projects you will face on the job and work hands-on with modern tools, including, but not limited to Synchro and SIM-Traffic and other simulation programs, HCS+, AutoCAD templates for intersection design, and data collection and processing software.   The program includes a strong focus on the rapidly emerging field of intelligent transportation systems. This field applies telecommunications and information technology to solving a variety of transportation functions, from route guidance systems to automated toll collection systems to the automated highway.   Admission Requirements   You must hold at least a baccalaureate degree from an acceptable institution. You must also have a firm background in quantitative analytic skills. If admitted, students lacking such skills must take remedial courses in addition to degree requirements to strengthen their analytic competency.   In addition, you must show evidence of quantitative analytic ability, generally including a minimum of 2 years of college mathematics. A college-level course in statistics is desirable.   Finally, all foreign students admitted to the program must take an examination in English before registration. Based upon an evaluation of the examination, you may be required to take up to 2 additional courses in English as a Second Language (ESL) for which no graduate credit is given.

You must have a 3.0 GPA or better in all graduate courses and in all guided studies (readings, projects, theses). Averages are separately computed for courses and guided studies. Transfer credits from other institutions are omitted from this average.   In addition, you are required to have an overall 3.0 GPA in all courses required for this degree. You may not repeat a course that counts toward the program more than once.   Required Courses (18 Credits)   TR-GY 6013 ( Please refer to the bulletin ) 3.00 Credits Forecasting Urban Travel Demand TR-GY 6113 The purpose of this course is to study methods and models used in estimating and forecasting person travel in urban areas. The objective is to understand the fundamental relationships between land use, transportation level of service and travel demand, and to apply methods and state-of-the-practice models for predicting person travel on the transportation system. Prerequisite/Corequisite: TR-GY 6013 or permission of instructor. TR-GY 6313 ( Please refer to the bulletin ) TR-GY 6323 ( Please refer to the bulletin ) TR-GY 6213 ( Please refer to the bulletin ) 3.00 Credits Intelligent Transportation Systems and Their Applications TR-GY 6223 This course introduces the concepts and applications of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) and its growing role in the management of transportation systems. The course stresses the role of ITS as national policy, as specified in major transportation funding legislation \u2013 ISTEA, TEA21 and SAFETY-LU. A systems engineering approach to overall development of ITS technologies is stressed. Major components of ITS are discussed, and examples of their application treated. Coordination and integration of ITS components are treated. Prerequisite: Graduate status or permission of instructor.

Prerequisite: Graduate Standing 3.00 Credits Urban Public Transportation Systems TR-GY 7133 This course provides a thorough understanding of policy, planning, operational and technical issues that affect urban public transportation. It includes the historical development of cites and the rise of urban transport. Also covered are the characteristics of various urban transportation modes (their specific operating and infrastructure characteristics), as well as key elements that are critical to service provision, such as service planning, scheduling, fare collection, communication and signaling, station design and customer service. The course offers a broad perspective on regional planning, capital programming and policy matters. Special focus will be on emerging technologies and their practical applications. Prerequisite: Graduate status or permission of instructor. 3.00 Credits Design of Parking & Terminal Facilities TR-GY 7323 This course covers design techniques and approaches to a variety of pedestrian and vehicular needs in conjunction with access to land functions. Parking serves as the primary access interface to many land facilities, from shopping centers and sports facilities, to medium- and high-density residential developments. The planning and design of parking facilities, and the planning of access and egress from these facilities, is critical to the economic success of a development. Terminals are inter-modal interface facilities involving the transfer of people and/or goods from one mode of transportation to another. This course covers essential elements of terminal planning and design, including transit stations and terminals, major goods terminals at ports and railheads and others. The design of pedestrian space and ways within terminal structures is also treated Prerequisite: Graduate status or permission of instructor. 3.00 Credits Multimodal Transportation Safety TR-GY 7033 Technology, legislation and market forces have contributed to improved transportation safety for decades.
