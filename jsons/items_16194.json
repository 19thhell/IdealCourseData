Masters students choose one of three tracks for specialization: European Culture and Society; European Politics and Policy; or Mediterranean Studies. The flexible degree requirements allows students to tailor their studies according to their interests across a range of disciplines, including history; political science; cultural studies; anthropology; art history; French, Italian, German, Irish, the Mediterranean, and other area studies. In addition to CEMS' courses, students are encouraged to take courses at other departments and area studies programs. This master's program is designed to prepare students for professions requiring an advanced understanding of Europe and the Mediterranean region. Through developing country and regional expertise and honing skills in advanced research and analysis--together with opportunities to complete professional internships for course credit\u2014graduates of CEMS are prepared to advance careers in public service/government, nonprofit organizations, cultural institutions, international and regional organizations, international business and law, media, and education. The program also provides a strong platform for pursuing doctoral studies. The program has a history of students pursuing internships and, upon graduation, gaining employment with policy institutes, the U.S. Department of Defense and the U.S. State Department, EU-institutions, and other public or private organizations and companies. Please view this page    to see a list of organizations where M.A. program graduates have   been employed in recent years.  \"The mobility afforded to me by the MA program within the Center   for European and Mediterranean Studies allowed me to gain invaluable   professional contacts in addition to a rich, challenging,   interdisciplinary academic experience. With the support of the Center, I   was able to juggle full-time coursework, internship experiences with   Human Rights Watch and the Institute for International Humanitarian   Affairs, in addition to employment alongside the Center\u2019s dedicated and   experienced staff. I always felt as though the Center was exceptionally   helpful in attaining these internships and understanding the need for a   prudent professional-academic balance.\u201d \u2014Stephen Whittaker, M.A. CEMS '14  Degree Program Requirements Follow this link for information on course credit and other requirements to fulfill the Master's in European and Mediterranean Studies.
