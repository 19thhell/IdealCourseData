Applicants to NYU's New York Campus   Domestic Students : Students who are U.S. citizens or eligible non-citizens and who wish to be considered for financial aid when applying for admission to NYU New York should complete:     The Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) (for new freshmen and continuing students, to be considered for federal financial aid).   The CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE (to be considered for institutional [non-government] financial aid). The CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE is required for new undergraduate domestic students applying for the 2015-2016 academic year who wish to be considered for institutional (non-government) financial aid funds. It is not required for transfer applicants, returning undergraduate students, graduate students, or adult students applying to The Paul McGhee Division at the NYU School of Continuing and Professional Studies.     The New York State Tuition Assistance Program (TAP) grant application, for New York State residents only.   Students seeking financial aid for summer courses must also complete a NYU Summer Aid Application (available from February through July, see the Applications and Forms menu in the column at right).     Admission to NYU New York is need-blind for domestic applicants, and financial support will be tailored for each individual family based upon the results of the FAFSA, PROFILE and TAP applications.   International Students : NYU offers limited financial support in the form of institutional grants/scholarships to international freshmen admitted to our New York campus beginning with the Fall 2013 term. Grants/scholarships will be based upon a combination of financial need and academic merit. Students who are not U.S. citizens or eligible non-citizens and who wish to be considered for institutional financial aid when applying for admission to the NYU New York campus should complete ONLY the CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE to be considered for institutional financial aid funds. International students cannot apply for financial support after they are admitted. Admission to NYU New York is need-aware for international applicants; New York University will consider a family's financial need as reported on the PROFILE when evaluating the student's application for admission.   New York Undocumented Students : Individuals applying for admission as an undocumented undergraduate student may be eligible for NYU scholarship funds. To be considered, please submit:     The CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE.   The Undocumented Student Financial Aid Application (available beginning in October, see the Applications and Forms menu at right).     Please read more information about New York Undocumented Students .   Applicants to NYU's Abu Dhabi Campus   Domestic and International students : All students, regardless of citizenship status (except Emirati nationals), who are applying for admission ONLY to NYU Abu Dhabi (that is, they do not wish to be considered for any other NYU campus) need to complete ONLY the CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE to be considered for institutional financial aid funds. (The CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE is not required for Emirati nationals, who will be automatically evaluated for Exceptional Emirati Scholarship upon acceptance.) International students cannot apply for financial support after they are admitted. Admission to NYU Abu Dhabi is need-blind for all applicants, and financial support will be tailored for each individual family based upon the results of the PROFILE. Students applying ONLY to NYU Abu Dhabi are not required to complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA).   For more information please see NYU Abu Dhabi Financial Support .   Applicants to NYU's Shanghai Campus   Domestic Students : Students who are U.S. citizens or eligible non-citizens and who wish to be considered for financial aid when applying for admission to NYU Shanghai should complete:     The Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) (to be considered for federal financial aid).   The CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE (to be considered for institutional financial aid funds).     Admission to NYU Shanghai is need-blind, and financial support will be tailored for each individual family based upon the results of the FAFSA and PROFILE.     International Students and Chinese Nationals : Students who are not U.S. citizens or eligible non-citizens and who wish to be considered for financial aid when applying for admission to the NYU Shanghai campus should complete ONLY the CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE to be considered for institutional financial aid funds. The PROFILE is not required for Chinese nationals who complete the Gaokao college entrance examination instead of the SAT college admission test. International students cannot apply for financial support after they are admitted. Admission to NYU Shanghai is need-blind, and financial support will be tailored for each indivdual family based upon the results of the PROFILE.     For more information please see Financial Aid at NYU Shanghai .              FAFSA, CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE and TAP     1. Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA)   Students must submit the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) to be considered for any federal financial aid funds. The FAFSA is a confidential fiinancial statement detailing information about your family\u2019s financial circumstances. When you have completed the form, you submit it directly to the U.S. Department of Education. Using a formula mandated by Congress, the U.S. Department of Education makes an evaluation of your family\u2019s financial strength and estimates the amount your family can contribute annually toward your educational expenses. The Department of Education then sends your family\u2019s financial information and its estimate of family contribution to each college you designate to receive the information. (NOTE TO DENTAL STUDENTS: College of Dentistry students seeking certain federal education loans for the health professions (e.g. the Health Professions Student Loan [HPSL] and Loans for Disadvantaged Students [LDS]) must include parents financial data on the FAFSA even if they are financially independent of their parents.)   The FAFSA is available each year beginning January 1, and should be completed as soon as possible, but not later than February 15 (midnight EST) for new freshmen , and not later than May 1 (midnight EDT) for most other students (see Financial Aid Application Priority Deadlines at column upper right for details). Students who miss the FAFSA priority deadline are still encouraged to apply and will be considered for federal student aid, if eligible, but funds become increasingly limited.   Graduate students should refer to their school or department for specific program deadlines.     Click here to begin and submit the FAFSA .

College Scholarship Service Financial Aid PROFILE   The CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE application is administered by the College Scholarship Service (the financial aid division of The College Board) and collects information used by many private universities to award institutional (non-government) financial aid funds.   The CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE can be submitted in the fall as early as October 1 , but not later than February 15 (midnight EST).       Click here to begin and submit the CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE .   REQUIRED the first year for new undergraduate U.S. citizens and eligible non-citizens applying to NYU New York campus who wish to be considered for institutional (non-government) financial aid funds.   NOT REQUIRED for U.S. citizen and eligible non-citizen returning undergraduate students, transfer students, and graduate students at NYU New York campus, or adult students applying to The Paul McGhee Division at the NYU School of Continuing and Professional Studies, New York campus.   REQUIRED every year for international students at NYU New York campus who wish to be considered for institutional (non-government) financial aid funds.   REQUIRED every year for all students at NYU Abu Dhabi who wish to be considered for institutional (non-government) financial aid funds. (NOTE: it is not required for Emirati nationals, who will be automatically evaluated for Exceptional Emirati Scholarship upon acceptance.)   REQUIRED every year for international (not US, not Chinese nationals) students at NYU Shanghai who wish to be considered for institutional (non-government) financial aid funds. (NOTE: it is not required for Chinese nationals who complete the Gaokao college entrance examination instead of the SAT college admission test).   You must list &quot;New York University&quot; as a recipient and include our CSS school code number 2785 when completing your CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE.   Do not wait until your taxes are done before submitting the PROFILE. Although it is better to do your taxes early, it is acceptable to use estimates of your income when you initially file the PROFILE.   NYU does not participate in the CSS IDOC program.   CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE Help: telephone 305-829-9793.     CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE priority deadlines for Freshmen applicants:         Early Decision I: November 15 (midnight EST)    Early Decision II: January 15 (midnight EST)    Regular Decision: February 15 (midnight EST)        College Scholarship Service Noncustodial PROFILE     The CSS Noncustodial PROFILE is also required, if applicable;     Students who have families with separated, divorced, or single parents must also complete the Non-Custodial Parent form, which complements the CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE. NYU requires noncustodial parents to report their income, assets and other information as part of the financial aid application process to assess an applicant\u2019s eligibility for scholarship or other types of aid.   Providing such information does not necessarily mean that the student\u2019s noncustodial parent will be expected or required to contribute to educational costs.   Under certain circumstances NYU will consider waiving the requirement for the CSS Noncustodial PROFILE in the event the information cannot be obtained. Please see the CSS Noncustodial PROFILE Waiver Request form available (October to February) on the Applications and Forms menu in the column at right.   If the CSS Noncustodial PROFILE is required but not submitted, and NYU does not grant the applicant a waiver of this requirement, the student will not be considered for need-based NYU scholarship or grant funds. Please note that this is important because the amount of scholarship a student receives in their first year at NYU is typically the amount they will continue to receive each year if they remain otherwise eligible. Thus, if a student does not receive any NYU grant or scholarship in their freshman year they will likely not receive any in subsequent years. Failing to submit the CSS Noncustodial PROFILE (or the waiver request) for the first year can therefore affect eligibility in future years.     CSS Noncustodial PROFILE priority deadlines for Freshmen applicants:           Early Decision I: November 20 (midnight EST)    Early Decision II: January 20 (midnight EST)    Regular Decision: February 20 (midnight EST)        Please note that the deadlines for the CSS Noncustodial PROFILE application occur 5 days after the corresponding deadlines for the CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE application to allow additional time to provide the information required.             3. NYS Tuition Assistance Program (TAP)   In addition to the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA), New York State residents must also submit an application for the New York State Tuition Assistance Program (TAP). TAP grants are available to qualified students attending New York University.    Start the TAP application process by completing the FAFSA at http://www.fafsa.gov/ . New York State will use your FAFSA information as part of your application for TAP; you can link to the online TAP application directly from the FAFSA on the Web confirmation page.    You will be asked to establish a PIN (Personal Identification Number) for TAP. The TAP PIN will allow you complete your application online, keep track of your application information, or make changes later. Information from your FAFSA and your family's calculated NYS net taxable income will be pre-filled on your TAP on the Web application. Follow the instructions provided.       You must list &quot;New York University&quot; as a recipient and include our state school code number 0555 when completing your TAP application.     If you choose not to apply online, an Express TAP Application (ETA) will be mailed to you by the New York State Higher Education Services Corporation (HESC). Information from your FAFSA and your family's calculated NYS net taxable income will be pre-printed on your ETA. Review this information, change any incorrect items, complete any missing items, then SIGN AND MAIL THE FORM USING THE RETURN ENVELOPE.    If you provide an e-mail address on your FAFSA, HESC will use that address to contact you about your TAP application, give you processing updates, or award information. Please respond to any requests or instructions sent by HESC. If you have submitted applications, you can check the status of your TAP at any time.    If you have already received TAP, you must renew your grant each year by returning to TAP on the Web (via the online FAFSA process) to review and confirm your HESC data. You must submit the FAFSA for each academic year to continue your TAP eligibility. Based upon the data reported on your FAFSA, you will receive confirmation from HESC about your grant eligibility and award. Be sure to verify that all information is accurate, and submit any necessary corrections immediately.                                                         Priority Dates and Deadlines   All students should apply for financial aid every year. Students who miss a financial aid priority deadline are still encouraged to file the FAFSA and will be considered for federal student aid if eligible, but funds become increasingly limited. If you have not applied, do so immediately . Remember, to meet the specified deadline your application, with all necessary signatures, must be received and validated by the processor and released to NYU by the date shown below for priority consideration.   Freshman Applicants: In order to be considered for NYU scholarship, you must complete all required applications by our deadlines . Please review the Applications and Forms section of this website to find out which applications are relevant to you. Late CSS Profile applications will not be accepted for scholarship consideration.

Traditional undergraduates who attended spring semester 2011 and earlier will first be evaluated using the Satisfactory Academic Progress standard defined here, and if a student does not meet this standard, they will then be evaluated based on the SAP standard in effect before summer semester 2011 .     TRADITIONAL UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS   To be considered for financial aid each year, students must make satisfactory academic progress toward completion of their degree requirements. Students must earn a passing grade (A, B, C, D, or P, including accepted credits from Advanced Placement, Advanced Standing, and Transfer Student status) in a minimum of 76 percent of the courses in which they are enrolled each academic year (fall, spring and summer semesters) and maintain a cumulative grade point average of at least 2.0.   ADVANCED PLACEMENT, ADVANCED STANDING AND TRANSFER STUDENTS   Accepted credit points from Advanced Placement, Advanced Standing, and Transfer Student status are considered to be attempted and completed credits for the purpose of evaluating satisfactory academic progress.   HEOP AND CSTEP   Undergraduate students participating in the New York State Higher Education Opportunity Program (HEOP) or the New York State Collegiate Science &amp; Technology Entry Program (CSTEP) must earn a passing grade (A, B, C, D, or P, including accepted credits from Advanced Placement, Advanced Standing, and Transfer Student status) in a minimum of two-thirds (67 percent) of the courses in which they are enrolled each academic year (fall, spring and summer semesters) and maintain a cumulative grade point average of at least 2.0.   PAUL MCGHEE DIVISION   SCPS Paul McGhee Division students must earn a passing grade (A, B, C, D, or P, including accepted credits from Advanced Placement, Advanced Standing, and Transfer Student status)in a minimum of two-thirds (67 percent) of the courses in which they are enrolled each academic year (fall, spring and summer semesters) and maintain a cumulative grade point average of at least 2.0.   GRADUATE STUDENTS   Graduate students must earn a passing grade (A, B, C, D, or P) in a minimum of 80 percent (67 percent for GSAS students, 75 percent for law students) of the courses in which they are enrolled each academic year (fall, spring and summer semesters).   Most graduate schools at the University require a minimum GPA of 3.0. This may vary, so you should consult your academic advisor or refer to the academic requirements published in your school's bulletin. Normal progress requires completing all courses for which you are registered and progressing toward your degree at a level that compares favorably with other registrants working toward the same degree in the same academic program.              * * * * * * *   Extending Your Financial Aid     Financial aid funding (federal, state, and campus-based) is designed to help students complete their degree requirements within a limited period of time and is generally not available beyond that point. However, in certain circumstances the Office of Financial Aid may authorize additional student funding for one or more semesters. To be considered for an extension of financial aid availability please submit an Aid Eligibility Extension Request Form, available on our Applications and Forms menu .              * * * * * * *   Review of Your Academic Progress   Federal regulations require New York University to monitor the academic performance of its students for the purpose of verifying and maintaining their eligibility for federal financial aid. If you do not meet the standard of Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP), your federal financial aid will be suspended. In most cases, state and NYU financial aid (scholarship) require that the same criteria be maintained for continued eligibility. Some graduate schools have different eligibility criteria for their scholarships and students are encouraged to review their school/department criteria accordingly.     NYU does not offer ESL or remedial courses for credit towards any of its undergraduate or graduate degrees.   Most types of financial aid - including federal financial aid - require students be enrolled in courses that are necessary to fulfill their degree requirements; therefore, students enrolling in an excessive number of electives that are not applicable to their degree may have their financial aid revoked. To ensure applicable courses are taken, students are encouraged to seek out guidance from their academic advisors.     For students who change schools or change majors within NYU, all credits that count towards their degree in their new school or towards their new major are considered both attempted credits and earned credits. Credits that are not applied towards the degree in the student\u2019s new school or towards their new major count neither as attempted credits nor as earned credits.   All repeated courses count as both attempted and earned credits and all types of incompletes count as attempted credits but not as earned credits.     An academic progress calculator is available here as a guide to your status.   The Office of Financial Aid typically conducts a SAP review at least annually at the conclusion of each academic year, and students who do not meet the requirement receive a notice on their NYU Albert account.   FINANCIAL AID SUSPENSION   Students who do not meet the SAP requirement are automatically placed on financial aid suspension (unless the student is approved for financial aid probation, see below). During suspension, the student will not be eligible for financial aid. (Students may continue to acquire private non-NYU scholarships and private non-federal loans.) Eligibility for financial aid will be returned when the student meets the SAP standard.   FINANCIAL AID PROBATION   All students have the right to appeal the suspension of their financial aid. Students may appeal only once for each academic degree in most circumstances (an exception may be granted in the event of illness or injury).   You may avoid financial aid suspension by asking to be placed on financial aid probation, which requires the submission of the Satisfactory Academic Progress Appeal Form, available on our Applications and Forms menu .   Students who are approved will be placed on financial aid probation for one semester. The student will remain eligible for financial aid and will continue to receive financial assistance during the approved probationary semester.   Students who meet the SAP standard at the end of their probationary semester will be restored to Satisfactory Academic Progress status. Students who do not meet the SAP requirements at the end of the probationary period will be placed on financial aid suspension (described above).   Students are permitted only one semester of financial aid probation. If a student meets the SAP requirement at the end of their probationary semester but later fails again to meet the SAP requirement, the student is not eligible for additional financial aid probation, except in the event of illness or injury.   NOTICE: The current SAP standard for traditional undergraduate students is effective beginning summer semester 2011. Traditional undergraduates who attended spring semester 2011 and earlier will first be evaluated using the current SAP standard, and if a student does not meet this standard, they will then be evaluated based on the SAP standard in effect before summer semester 2011 .     ********************************************************************             Enrollment Status   To be considered for any type of student aid you must be officially admitted to New York University or matriculated in a degree program, and be making satisfactory academic progress toward degree requirements. Students in certain certificate or diploma programs may also be eligible for consideration. Generally, University-administered aid is awarded only to full-time students.   Part-Time Status :Part-time students (fewer than 12 points per semester) may be eligible for a Federal Direct Loan or a Federal Direct PLUS Loan, but they must also maintain satisfactory academic progress. Undergraduate students may also be eligible for Aid for Part-Time Study (APTS) (New York State residents only \u2014 separate application available here ) or for Pell Grants.     Half-Time/Full-Time Equivalency :Graduate students may be eligible for a half-time or full-time equivalency, based upon the determination of their academic department,even if they are not enrolled for actual credits. Limited financial aid may be available to students with posted equivalencies. Cost of attendance for students with equivalencies is based upon living and miscellaneous expenses and not tuition and fees.       Deferred Enrollment   Freshmen applicants who have been offered admission to NYU may submit a request to the Office of Undergraduate Admissions to defer their enrollment for up to one year. Students approved for deferral who received a financial aid package with their original offer of admission can expect that the NYU portion of their package (University scholarships and grants) will also be deferred and received in full as originally offered. It is not necessary to resubmit the CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE, and scholarship eligibility will not be reevaluated. Deferred students must, however, reapply for any federal or state funds that were awarded as part of the original package by completing and submitting a new Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) by the following February 15.   On some occasions a student may be approved to defer their enrollment for a second year. In such cases the student must reapply for all types of financial aid by submitting both a new CSS PROFILE and a new FAFSA by February 15 prior to the fall semester of entry.     ********************************************************************                     Renewal Eligibility    Financial aid awards are not automatically renewed each year. Students must apply for aid each year to renew their eligibility for all types of assistance (including NYU scholarships), continue to demonstrate financial need, make satisfactory progress toward degree requirements, and be in good academic standing.          ********************************************************************                    Citizenship Documentation   Students who are not U.S.citizens are subject to different regulations which may require supporting documentation, depending upon the type of financial aid sought. You will be contacted if this applies to you. U.S. citizens may also be required to document their citizenship status.            To be eligible for aid from NYU and from federal and state government sources, students must be classified either as U.S. citizens or as eligible non-citizens. Students are considered to be eligible non-citizens for financial aid purposes if one of the following conditions applies:                  U.S. permanent resident with an Alien Registration Receipt Card I-551 (\"green card\").    Other eligible non-citizen with an Arrival-Departure Record (I-94) showing any one of the following designations: (a) \"Refugee,\" (b) \"Indefinite Parole,\" (c) \"Humanitarian Parole,\" (d) \"Asylum Granted,\" or (e)\"Cuban-Haitian Entrant.\"             ********************************************************************             NYU Employees and Their Dependents   Members of New York University staff, faculty, and officers or  administrators, and their dependents who are eligible for tuition  remission are encouraged to apply for financial aid (by submitting the  FAFSA). Financial aid consists of Federal Subsidized Loans, Federal  Unsubsidized Loans, Federal PLUS Loans, Federal Pell Grants and the  Federal TEACH Grant, as well as private (non-federal) alternative loan  programs. Please contact the NYU Benefits Office for details about tuition remission, and learn also how to apply online . Please  note, if you were offered an NYU Scholarship and you have elected to  utilize tuition remission, you are no longer eligible for the NYU  Scholarship.     ********************************************************************                   Social Security Administration   Students who wish to apply for federal financial aid must include their Social Security number on the NYU Application for Admission (or provide it to the University Registrar following enrollment) and on the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA).            The federal government will confirm that the Social Security number on the FAFSA application matches other data in their files. Students whose records do not match will be required to verify their Social Security number. If you have changed your name you must notify the Social Security Administration before financial aid can be disbursed. See their web site for more information: www.ssa.gov        ********************************************************************                   Selective Service System   Males born on or after January 1, 1960 must register with Selective Service to qualify for federal aid. The federal government may require students to verify registration. Financial aid cannot be secured without such verification. See the Selective Service web site for more information: www.sss.gov       ********************************************************************               Tax Information and Income/Asset Verification   It is not necessary to submit copies of your tax returns or any other family financial records or supporting documentation to the Office of Financial Aid unless you are specifically asked for additional information. Unsolicited material will be destroyed without review. If you have unusual financial circumstances that may increase your eligibility for financial aid, contact the Office of Financial Aid AFTER you have received your award letter.   You may also be required to provide appropriate tax records if your application for financial aid is selected by the U.S. Department of Education for income and asset verification. You will be notified if this is necessary. The verification process may result in an adjustment to your financial aid award, and can occur at any time throughout the year. If you do not provide tax returns when requested, your financial aid may be revoked.     Go to Verification       ********************************************************************               Withdrawal   Students should refer to the official academic withdrawal policy described in their school bulletin, and then use the Semester Withdrawal Form available on NYU Albert (see information at the University Registrar ). For students receiving federal aid who withdraw completely before attending 60 percent of the semester, NYU is required to calculate how much of federal student aid funds must be returned. Those receiving federal aid who withdraw completely may be billed for remaining balances resulting from the mandatory return of funds to the U.S. government. The amount of federal aid &quot;earned&quot; is determined by the withdrawal date and a calculation based upon the federal formula. Generally, federal assistance is earned on a pro-rata basis. The withdrawal date is calculated based on the date the withdrawal form is submitted, unless the University has other information that demonstrates the withdrawal and/or last day of attendance was an earlier date.   The portion of federal aid that was not earned by a student will be returned from the appropriate federal student aid program(s) in the following order, Federal Direct Unsubsidized Loan, Federal Direct Subsidized Loan, Federal Perkins Loan, Federal Graduate PLUS Loan, Federal Direct Parent PLUS Loan, Federal Pell Grant, and Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (FSEOG).

Applicants to NYU's New York Campus   Domestic Students : Students who are U.S. citizens or eligible non-citizens and who wish to be considered for financial aid when applying for admission to NYU New York should complete:     The Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) (for new freshmen and continuing students, to be considered for federal financial aid).   The CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE (to be considered for institutional [non-government] financial aid). The CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE is required for new undergraduate domestic students applying for the 2015-2016 academic year who wish to be considered for institutional (non-government) financial aid funds. It is not required for transfer applicants, returning undergraduate students, graduate students, or adult students applying to The Paul McGhee Division at the NYU School of Continuing and Professional Studies.     The New York State Tuition Assistance Program (TAP) grant application, for New York State residents only.   Students seeking financial aid for summer courses must also complete a NYU Summer Aid Application (available from February through July, see the Applications and Forms menu in the column at right).     Admission to NYU New York is need-blind for domestic applicants, and financial support will be tailored for each individual family based upon the results of the FAFSA, PROFILE and TAP applications.   International Students : NYU offers limited financial support in the form of institutional grants/scholarships to international freshmen admitted to our New York campus beginning with the Fall 2013 term. Grants/scholarships will be based upon a combination of financial need and academic merit. Students who are not U.S. citizens or eligible non-citizens and who wish to be considered for institutional financial aid when applying for admission to the NYU New York campus should complete ONLY the CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE to be considered for institutional financial aid funds. International students cannot apply for financial support after they are admitted. Admission to NYU New York is need-aware for international applicants; New York University will consider a family's financial need as reported on the PROFILE when evaluating the student's application for admission.   New York Undocumented Students : Individuals applying for admission as an undocumented undergraduate student may be eligible for NYU scholarship funds. To be considered, please submit:     The CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE.   The Undocumented Student Financial Aid Application (available beginning in October, see the Applications and Forms menu at right).     Please read more information about New York Undocumented Students .   Applicants to NYU's Abu Dhabi Campus   Domestic and International students : All students, regardless of citizenship status (except Emirati nationals), who are applying for admission ONLY to NYU Abu Dhabi (that is, they do not wish to be considered for any other NYU campus) need to complete ONLY the CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE to be considered for institutional financial aid funds. (The CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE is not required for Emirati nationals, who will be automatically evaluated for Exceptional Emirati Scholarship upon acceptance.) International students cannot apply for financial support after they are admitted. Admission to NYU Abu Dhabi is need-blind for all applicants, and financial support will be tailored for each individual family based upon the results of the PROFILE. Students applying ONLY to NYU Abu Dhabi are not required to complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA).   For more information please see NYU Abu Dhabi Financial Support .   Applicants to NYU's Shanghai Campus   Domestic Students : Students who are U.S. citizens or eligible non-citizens and who wish to be considered for financial aid when applying for admission to NYU Shanghai should complete:     The Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) (to be considered for federal financial aid).   The CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE (to be considered for institutional financial aid funds).     Admission to NYU Shanghai is need-blind, and financial support will be tailored for each individual family based upon the results of the FAFSA and PROFILE.     International Students and Chinese Nationals : Students who are not U.S. citizens or eligible non-citizens and who wish to be considered for financial aid when applying for admission to the NYU Shanghai campus should complete ONLY the CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE to be considered for institutional financial aid funds. The PROFILE is not required for Chinese nationals who complete the Gaokao college entrance examination instead of the SAT college admission test. International students cannot apply for financial support after they are admitted. Admission to NYU Shanghai is need-blind, and financial support will be tailored for each indivdual family based upon the results of the PROFILE.     For more information please see Financial Aid at NYU Shanghai .              FAFSA, CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE and TAP     1. Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA)   Students must submit the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) to be considered for any federal financial aid funds. The FAFSA is a confidential fiinancial statement detailing information about your family\u2019s financial circumstances. When you have completed the form, you submit it directly to the U.S. Department of Education. Using a formula mandated by Congress, the U.S. Department of Education makes an evaluation of your family\u2019s financial strength and estimates the amount your family can contribute annually toward your educational expenses. The Department of Education then sends your family\u2019s financial information and its estimate of family contribution to each college you designate to receive the information. (NOTE TO DENTAL STUDENTS: College of Dentistry students seeking certain federal education loans for the health professions (e.g. the Health Professions Student Loan [HPSL] and Loans for Disadvantaged Students [LDS]) must include parents financial data on the FAFSA even if they are financially independent of their parents.)   The FAFSA is available each year beginning January 1, and should be completed as soon as possible, but not later than February 15 (midnight EST) for new freshmen , and not later than May 1 (midnight EDT) for most other students (see Financial Aid Application Priority Deadlines at column upper right for details). Students who miss the FAFSA priority deadline are still encouraged to apply and will be considered for federal student aid, if eligible, but funds become increasingly limited.   Graduate students should refer to their school or department for specific program deadlines.     Click here to begin and submit the FAFSA .

College Scholarship Service Financial Aid PROFILE   The CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE application is administered by the College Scholarship Service (the financial aid division of The College Board) and collects information used by many private universities to award institutional (non-government) financial aid funds.   The CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE can be submitted in the fall as early as October 1 , but not later than February 15 (midnight EST).       Click here to begin and submit the CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE .   REQUIRED the first year for new undergraduate U.S. citizens and eligible non-citizens applying to NYU New York campus who wish to be considered for institutional (non-government) financial aid funds.   NOT REQUIRED for U.S. citizen and eligible non-citizen returning undergraduate students, transfer students, and graduate students at NYU New York campus, or adult students applying to The Paul McGhee Division at the NYU School of Continuing and Professional Studies, New York campus.   REQUIRED every year for international students at NYU New York campus who wish to be considered for institutional (non-government) financial aid funds.   REQUIRED every year for all students at NYU Abu Dhabi who wish to be considered for institutional (non-government) financial aid funds. (NOTE: it is not required for Emirati nationals, who will be automatically evaluated for Exceptional Emirati Scholarship upon acceptance.)   REQUIRED every year for international (not US, not Chinese nationals) students at NYU Shanghai who wish to be considered for institutional (non-government) financial aid funds. (NOTE: it is not required for Chinese nationals who complete the Gaokao college entrance examination instead of the SAT college admission test).   You must list &quot;New York University&quot; as a recipient and include our CSS school code number 2785 when completing your CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE.   Do not wait until your taxes are done before submitting the PROFILE. Although it is better to do your taxes early, it is acceptable to use estimates of your income when you initially file the PROFILE.   NYU does not participate in the CSS IDOC program.   CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE Help: telephone 305-829-9793.     CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE priority deadlines for Freshmen applicants:         Early Decision I: November 15 (midnight EST)    Early Decision II: January 15 (midnight EST)    Regular Decision: February 15 (midnight EST)        College Scholarship Service Noncustodial PROFILE     The CSS Noncustodial PROFILE is also required, if applicable;     Students who have families with separated, divorced, or single parents must also complete the Non-Custodial Parent form, which complements the CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE. NYU requires noncustodial parents to report their income, assets and other information as part of the financial aid application process to assess an applicant\u2019s eligibility for scholarship or other types of aid.   Providing such information does not necessarily mean that the student\u2019s noncustodial parent will be expected or required to contribute to educational costs.   Under certain circumstances NYU will consider waiving the requirement for the CSS Noncustodial PROFILE in the event the information cannot be obtained. Please see the CSS Noncustodial PROFILE Waiver Request form available (October to February) on the Applications and Forms menu in the column at right.   If the CSS Noncustodial PROFILE is required but not submitted, and NYU does not grant the applicant a waiver of this requirement, the student will not be considered for need-based NYU scholarship or grant funds. Please note that this is important because the amount of scholarship a student receives in their first year at NYU is typically the amount they will continue to receive each year if they remain otherwise eligible. Thus, if a student does not receive any NYU grant or scholarship in their freshman year they will likely not receive any in subsequent years. Failing to submit the CSS Noncustodial PROFILE (or the waiver request) for the first year can therefore affect eligibility in future years.     CSS Noncustodial PROFILE priority deadlines for Freshmen applicants:           Early Decision I: November 20 (midnight EST)    Early Decision II: January 20 (midnight EST)    Regular Decision: February 20 (midnight EST)        Please note that the deadlines for the CSS Noncustodial PROFILE application occur 5 days after the corresponding deadlines for the CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE application to allow additional time to provide the information required.             3. NYS Tuition Assistance Program (TAP)   In addition to the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA), New York State residents must also submit an application for the New York State Tuition Assistance Program (TAP). TAP grants are available to qualified students attending New York University.    Start the TAP application process by completing the FAFSA at http://www.fafsa.gov/ . New York State will use your FAFSA information as part of your application for TAP; you can link to the online TAP application directly from the FAFSA on the Web confirmation page.    You will be asked to establish a PIN (Personal Identification Number) for TAP. The TAP PIN will allow you complete your application online, keep track of your application information, or make changes later. Information from your FAFSA and your family's calculated NYS net taxable income will be pre-filled on your TAP on the Web application. Follow the instructions provided.       You must list &quot;New York University&quot; as a recipient and include our state school code number 0555 when completing your TAP application.     If you choose not to apply online, an Express TAP Application (ETA) will be mailed to you by the New York State Higher Education Services Corporation (HESC). Information from your FAFSA and your family's calculated NYS net taxable income will be pre-printed on your ETA. Review this information, change any incorrect items, complete any missing items, then SIGN AND MAIL THE FORM USING THE RETURN ENVELOPE.    If you provide an e-mail address on your FAFSA, HESC will use that address to contact you about your TAP application, give you processing updates, or award information. Please respond to any requests or instructions sent by HESC. If you have submitted applications, you can check the status of your TAP at any time.    If you have already received TAP, you must renew your grant each year by returning to TAP on the Web (via the online FAFSA process) to review and confirm your HESC data. You must submit the FAFSA for each academic year to continue your TAP eligibility. Based upon the data reported on your FAFSA, you will receive confirmation from HESC about your grant eligibility and award. Be sure to verify that all information is accurate, and submit any necessary corrections immediately.                                                         Priority Dates and Deadlines   All students should apply for financial aid every year. Students who miss a financial aid priority deadline are still encouraged to file the FAFSA and will be considered for federal student aid if eligible, but funds become increasingly limited. If you have not applied, do so immediately . Remember, to meet the specified deadline your application, with all necessary signatures, must be received and validated by the processor and released to NYU by the date shown below for priority consideration.   Freshman Applicants: In order to be considered for NYU scholarship, you must complete all required applications by our deadlines . Please review the Applications and Forms section of this website to find out which applications are relevant to you. Late CSS Profile applications will not be accepted for scholarship consideration.

Traditional undergraduates who attended spring semester 2011 and earlier will first be evaluated using the Satisfactory Academic Progress standard defined here, and if a student does not meet this standard, they will then be evaluated based on the SAP standard in effect before summer semester 2011 .     TRADITIONAL UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS   To be considered for financial aid each year, students must make satisfactory academic progress toward completion of their degree requirements. Students must earn a passing grade (A, B, C, D, or P, including accepted credits from Advanced Placement, Advanced Standing, and Transfer Student status) in a minimum of 76 percent of the courses in which they are enrolled each academic year (fall, spring and summer semesters) and maintain a cumulative grade point average of at least 2.0.   ADVANCED PLACEMENT, ADVANCED STANDING AND TRANSFER STUDENTS   Accepted credit points from Advanced Placement, Advanced Standing, and Transfer Student status are considered to be attempted and completed credits for the purpose of evaluating satisfactory academic progress.   HEOP AND CSTEP   Undergraduate students participating in the New York State Higher Education Opportunity Program (HEOP) or the New York State Collegiate Science &amp; Technology Entry Program (CSTEP) must earn a passing grade (A, B, C, D, or P, including accepted credits from Advanced Placement, Advanced Standing, and Transfer Student status) in a minimum of two-thirds (67 percent) of the courses in which they are enrolled each academic year (fall, spring and summer semesters) and maintain a cumulative grade point average of at least 2.0.   PAUL MCGHEE DIVISION   SCPS Paul McGhee Division students must earn a passing grade (A, B, C, D, or P, including accepted credits from Advanced Placement, Advanced Standing, and Transfer Student status)in a minimum of two-thirds (67 percent) of the courses in which they are enrolled each academic year (fall, spring and summer semesters) and maintain a cumulative grade point average of at least 2.0.   GRADUATE STUDENTS   Graduate students must earn a passing grade (A, B, C, D, or P) in a minimum of 80 percent (67 percent for GSAS students, 75 percent for law students) of the courses in which they are enrolled each academic year (fall, spring and summer semesters).   Most graduate schools at the University require a minimum GPA of 3.0. This may vary, so you should consult your academic advisor or refer to the academic requirements published in your school's bulletin. Normal progress requires completing all courses for which you are registered and progressing toward your degree at a level that compares favorably with other registrants working toward the same degree in the same academic program.              * * * * * * *   Extending Your Financial Aid     Financial aid funding (federal, state, and campus-based) is designed to help students complete their degree requirements within a limited period of time and is generally not available beyond that point. However, in certain circumstances the Office of Financial Aid may authorize additional student funding for one or more semesters. To be considered for an extension of financial aid availability please submit an Aid Eligibility Extension Request Form, available on our Applications and Forms menu .              * * * * * * *   Review of Your Academic Progress   Federal regulations require New York University to monitor the academic performance of its students for the purpose of verifying and maintaining their eligibility for federal financial aid. If you do not meet the standard of Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP), your federal financial aid will be suspended. In most cases, state and NYU financial aid (scholarship) require that the same criteria be maintained for continued eligibility. Some graduate schools have different eligibility criteria for their scholarships and students are encouraged to review their school/department criteria accordingly.     NYU does not offer ESL or remedial courses for credit towards any of its undergraduate or graduate degrees.   Most types of financial aid - including federal financial aid - require students be enrolled in courses that are necessary to fulfill their degree requirements; therefore, students enrolling in an excessive number of electives that are not applicable to their degree may have their financial aid revoked. To ensure applicable courses are taken, students are encouraged to seek out guidance from their academic advisors.     For students who change schools or change majors within NYU, all credits that count towards their degree in their new school or towards their new major are considered both attempted credits and earned credits. Credits that are not applied towards the degree in the student\u2019s new school or towards their new major count neither as attempted credits nor as earned credits.   All repeated courses count as both attempted and earned credits and all types of incompletes count as attempted credits but not as earned credits.     An academic progress calculator is available here as a guide to your status.   The Office of Financial Aid typically conducts a SAP review at least annually at the conclusion of each academic year, and students who do not meet the requirement receive a notice on their NYU Albert account.   FINANCIAL AID SUSPENSION   Students who do not meet the SAP requirement are automatically placed on financial aid suspension (unless the student is approved for financial aid probation, see below). During suspension, the student will not be eligible for financial aid. (Students may continue to acquire private non-NYU scholarships and private non-federal loans.) Eligibility for financial aid will be returned when the student meets the SAP standard.   FINANCIAL AID PROBATION   All students have the right to appeal the suspension of their financial aid. Students may appeal only once for each academic degree in most circumstances (an exception may be granted in the event of illness or injury).   You may avoid financial aid suspension by asking to be placed on financial aid probation, which requires the submission of the Satisfactory Academic Progress Appeal Form, available on our Applications and Forms menu .   Students who are approved will be placed on financial aid probation for one semester. The student will remain eligible for financial aid and will continue to receive financial assistance during the approved probationary semester.   Students who meet the SAP standard at the end of their probationary semester will be restored to Satisfactory Academic Progress status. Students who do not meet the SAP requirements at the end of the probationary period will be placed on financial aid suspension (described above).   Students are permitted only one semester of financial aid probation. If a student meets the SAP requirement at the end of their probationary semester but later fails again to meet the SAP requirement, the student is not eligible for additional financial aid probation, except in the event of illness or injury.   NOTICE: The current SAP standard for traditional undergraduate students is effective beginning summer semester 2011. Traditional undergraduates who attended spring semester 2011 and earlier will first be evaluated using the current SAP standard, and if a student does not meet this standard, they will then be evaluated based on the SAP standard in effect before summer semester 2011 .     ********************************************************************             Enrollment Status   To be considered for any type of student aid you must be officially admitted to New York University or matriculated in a degree program, and be making satisfactory academic progress toward degree requirements. Students in certain certificate or diploma programs may also be eligible for consideration. Generally, University-administered aid is awarded only to full-time students.   Part-Time Status :Part-time students (fewer than 12 points per semester) may be eligible for a Federal Direct Loan or a Federal Direct PLUS Loan, but they must also maintain satisfactory academic progress. Undergraduate students may also be eligible for Aid for Part-Time Study (APTS) (New York State residents only \u2014 separate application available here ) or for Pell Grants.     Half-Time/Full-Time Equivalency :Graduate students may be eligible for a half-time or full-time equivalency, based upon the determination of their academic department,even if they are not enrolled for actual credits. Limited financial aid may be available to students with posted equivalencies. Cost of attendance for students with equivalencies is based upon living and miscellaneous expenses and not tuition and fees.       Deferred Enrollment   Freshmen applicants who have been offered admission to NYU may submit a request to the Office of Undergraduate Admissions to defer their enrollment for up to one year. Students approved for deferral who received a financial aid package with their original offer of admission can expect that the NYU portion of their package (University scholarships and grants) will also be deferred and received in full as originally offered. It is not necessary to resubmit the CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE, and scholarship eligibility will not be reevaluated. Deferred students must, however, reapply for any federal or state funds that were awarded as part of the original package by completing and submitting a new Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) by the following February 15.   On some occasions a student may be approved to defer their enrollment for a second year. In such cases the student must reapply for all types of financial aid by submitting both a new CSS PROFILE and a new FAFSA by February 15 prior to the fall semester of entry.     ********************************************************************                     Renewal Eligibility    Financial aid awards are not automatically renewed each year. Students must apply for aid each year to renew their eligibility for all types of assistance (including NYU scholarships), continue to demonstrate financial need, make satisfactory progress toward degree requirements, and be in good academic standing.          ********************************************************************                    Citizenship Documentation   Students who are not U.S.citizens are subject to different regulations which may require supporting documentation, depending upon the type of financial aid sought. You will be contacted if this applies to you. U.S. citizens may also be required to document their citizenship status.            To be eligible for aid from NYU and from federal and state government sources, students must be classified either as U.S. citizens or as eligible non-citizens. Students are considered to be eligible non-citizens for financial aid purposes if one of the following conditions applies:                  U.S. permanent resident with an Alien Registration Receipt Card I-551 (\"green card\").    Other eligible non-citizen with an Arrival-Departure Record (I-94) showing any one of the following designations: (a) \"Refugee,\" (b) \"Indefinite Parole,\" (c) \"Humanitarian Parole,\" (d) \"Asylum Granted,\" or (e)\"Cuban-Haitian Entrant.\"             ********************************************************************             NYU Employees and Their Dependents   Members of New York University staff, faculty, and officers or  administrators, and their dependents who are eligible for tuition  remission are encouraged to apply for financial aid (by submitting the  FAFSA). Financial aid consists of Federal Subsidized Loans, Federal  Unsubsidized Loans, Federal PLUS Loans, Federal Pell Grants and the  Federal TEACH Grant, as well as private (non-federal) alternative loan  programs. Please contact the NYU Benefits Office for details about tuition remission, and learn also how to apply online . Please  note, if you were offered an NYU Scholarship and you have elected to  utilize tuition remission, you are no longer eligible for the NYU  Scholarship.     ********************************************************************                   Social Security Administration   Students who wish to apply for federal financial aid must include their Social Security number on the NYU Application for Admission (or provide it to the University Registrar following enrollment) and on the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA).            The federal government will confirm that the Social Security number on the FAFSA application matches other data in their files. Students whose records do not match will be required to verify their Social Security number. If you have changed your name you must notify the Social Security Administration before financial aid can be disbursed. See their web site for more information: www.ssa.gov        ********************************************************************                   Selective Service System   Males born on or after January 1, 1960 must register with Selective Service to qualify for federal aid. The federal government may require students to verify registration. Financial aid cannot be secured without such verification. See the Selective Service web site for more information: www.sss.gov       ********************************************************************               Tax Information and Income/Asset Verification   It is not necessary to submit copies of your tax returns or any other family financial records or supporting documentation to the Office of Financial Aid unless you are specifically asked for additional information. Unsolicited material will be destroyed without review. If you have unusual financial circumstances that may increase your eligibility for financial aid, contact the Office of Financial Aid AFTER you have received your award letter.   You may also be required to provide appropriate tax records if your application for financial aid is selected by the U.S. Department of Education for income and asset verification. You will be notified if this is necessary. The verification process may result in an adjustment to your financial aid award, and can occur at any time throughout the year. If you do not provide tax returns when requested, your financial aid may be revoked.     Go to Verification       ********************************************************************               Withdrawal   Students should refer to the official academic withdrawal policy described in their school bulletin, and then use the Semester Withdrawal Form available on NYU Albert (see information at the University Registrar ). For students receiving federal aid who withdraw completely before attending 60 percent of the semester, NYU is required to calculate how much of federal student aid funds must be returned. Those receiving federal aid who withdraw completely may be billed for remaining balances resulting from the mandatory return of funds to the U.S. government. The amount of federal aid &quot;earned&quot; is determined by the withdrawal date and a calculation based upon the federal formula. Generally, federal assistance is earned on a pro-rata basis. The withdrawal date is calculated based on the date the withdrawal form is submitted, unless the University has other information that demonstrates the withdrawal and/or last day of attendance was an earlier date.   The portion of federal aid that was not earned by a student will be returned from the appropriate federal student aid program(s) in the following order, Federal Direct Unsubsidized Loan, Federal Direct Subsidized Loan, Federal Perkins Loan, Federal Graduate PLUS Loan, Federal Direct Parent PLUS Loan, Federal Pell Grant, and Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (FSEOG).
