Get ready to start a new and exciting semester that will be full of fun events, including Earth Week and other \"Earth April\" events!    Wednesday, April 16, 2008   Earth Matters Supports Upholding NYU's Ban on Coca-Cola   The NYU Senate is considering lifting a 2005 ban that prohibited the sale of Coca-Cola products on NYU's campus. This was ban was put in place after Coke refused to have an independent investigation of the assassination of eight union leaders in a Colombia Coca-Cola plant. Supporters of lifting the ban are citing a report conducted by the International Labor Organization to say that Coke has met the demands of the ban. Earth Matters, along with Students Creating Radical Change, OXFAM, the Law Students for Economic Justice, and Take Back NYU!, does not believe that the ILO report fulfills the ban's requirements for the following reasons:   - The ILO report was not independent. Ed Potter, Coca-Colas Director of Global Relations, has been the International Business Spokesperson of the ILO for the last fifteen years and was the driving force behind Coca-Colas selection of the ILO to conduct this investigation.   - The ILO is not a monitoring organization, does not conduct human rights investigations of individual companies, and is not qualified to do so.   - This ILO mission did not set out to conduct the investigation that NYUs ban requires. The ILO mission explicitly sought only to do an assessment of current conditions, not an investigation of human rights violations.   - Despite the ILO reports probable bias and problematic methodology, it actually finds that Coca-Colas labor rights violations (namely, the tactics used to prevent union organizing and infringement on the freedom to associate) still exist.   - This report does not address the human rights abuses, ties to paramilitaries, or assassinations of union leaders that occurred to inspire the ban by NYU and other universities. In fact, nowhere does the ILO report even mention the words human rights or assassinations.   - For access to the highlights of the ILO report, please visit The PDF file   We hope that our Earth Matters members will support the position we have decided to take to keep the ban of Coca-Cola on campus in place.    Earth Matters Presents: POST APOLCALYPSE PROM Come join us on Thursday, October 23rd at 9pm at the Kimmel Center Rosenthal Pavilion, 10th Floor!

The Green House at NYU is a new residential initiative that intentionally places students into a community where living and learning is dynamic and constant. The focus of this living learning community is to provide an alternative living option that is supportive of a greener student lifestyle, while maintaining opportunities to connect with other students in a community living environment. Some members of Earth Matters have been involved in the planning of the Green House, and we're working on a Green Grant to get some really great stuff going, so check out the ResEd page and consider applying! Friday, February 8, 2008  Green Grant applications The NYU Sustainability Task Force is now accepting applications for the 2008-2009 school year. Green Grants will fund projects that reduce NYUs adverse environmental impacts, engage the campus community, demonstrate the viability of best practices and technologies, and advance applied research and educational goals. For information from the Sustainability website, click here . Earth Matters will be working on a grant in relation to the Green House . To get involved, please contact us . In addition, Shaun Woo will be working on a proposal involving water use at NYU. His email is shw250 at nyu.edu, so contact him to get involved with that.  Friday, February 8, 2008  Get the latest news on climate change, right to your inbox The Daily Climate is a daily email newsletter that compiles all the latest mainstream media articles on a variety of topics related to climate change. It's a really great resource, and it makes it easy to keep up with what's going on.  Sunday, February 3, 2008  How are you connected to mountaintop removal coal? iLoveMountains.org has a new web tool utilizing Google Maps and Google Earth to show how mountaintop removal coal mining affects and involves Americans all across the country. Type in your zip code and see your connection... we bet you're closer than you think.  Friday, November 16, 2007  A new meaning to \"guilt-free\" potato chips Here's a fun story for today: Frito-Lay is embarking on an ambitious plan to change the way its factories operate. Its goal is to take one of its Arizona plants off the power grid, or nearly so, and run it almost entirely on renewable fuels and recycled water. See the New York Times article on what Frito-Lay and some other companies are doing to enhance their \"green\" image. The calories probably still count, though. Thursday, November 15, 2007  Camping pictures posted! Our webmaster has stopped being lazy and has finally posted the pictures from our camping trip to Bear Mountain. They're pretty awesome, so check them out! Thursday, November 15, 2007   Reduce your carbon impact! Footprint Forward week at NYU has arrived - for more info, check out their website .  Tuesday, November 6, 2007   Washington Square Park Stepped It Up! Our Step It Up rally this past weekend was a HUGE success. Pictures will be posted soon, and keep a look out for more Step it Up action tables around the NYU campus over the next few weeks. Tuesday, November 6, 2007  Rainforest Agribusiness Campaign  Rainforest Action Network recently officially launched its Rainforest Agribusiness Campaign targeting U.S. Agribusiness giants ADM, Bunge, and Cargill. By promoting industrially produced soy and palm oil as biofuel, these companies are diverting our resources and attention away from truly renewable energy and profiting off of false solutions to the climate crisis. Check out the campaign's website  for more information, and click here to send a message to the CEOs of these companies telling them how you feel about this issue! Wednesday, October 17, 2007   EM speaker a huge hit! On Tuesday, October 9, John Shegerian, NYU alum and CEO and founder of California's Electronics Recyclers  came to speak to EM about the work his business does, details of the electronics recycling business and crusade, and other environmental issues. Check out our  meetings page for more details. Sunday, October 14, 2007  Recycling Drive a Success! Last week, Earth Matters teamed up with POM Tea to promote recycling, and the event was a HUGE success! We recycled 84 pounds of paper and 176 pounds of cans and bottles. The 176 pounds of cans and bottles consisted of over 2000 bottles! Great job, guys!  Pictures from the event have been posted as well. Wednesday, September 26, 2007  Congratulations to our new e-board members! EM is very excited to announce that Molly Anderson will be our 2007-2008 Secretary, and Alex Neinast will be our PR Chair, a new position we have created for this year to better spread our name and news of our events on campus. Congrats! Thursday, September 20, 2007  Hayden Dining Hall goes green! The Washington Square News had a front-page article today detailing Hayden Dining Hall's transformation to a sustainable eating locale. Hayden is now offering sustainable (and often vegan) eating alternatives, and even the dining hall itself, newly renovated, is made from recycled materials. Get the whole article here . Thursday, September 13, 2007  Court rules against automakers in emissions case On Wednesday, a federal judge in Vermont rejected automakers' challenges to a series of rules passed in California and 13 other states (including Vermont, Connecticut, New Jersey, and New York) that intend to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from cars and light trucks. This ruling was a victory over automakers, and will hopefully embolden Califoria and other states to continue efforts to mitigate climate change, even if (and precisely because) our national government won't. Thursday, September 13, 2007  EM starts the year off right! Our first meeting was this past Monday, and boy was it a success! Click this link for more details! Wednesday, September 12, 2007  NYU Bookstore goes green! The NYU Bookstore is promoting sustainability this fall by encouraging customers to cut down on plastic bag use and by funding environmental causes. Each time a customer declines a plastic bag, the Bookstore will donate 5 cents (the average cost of a plastic bag) to one of four charities: the National Audubon Society, New Yorkers for Parks, the National Wildlife Federation, or Greenpeace. When customers purchase a canvas bag from the Bookstore, they will donate a full dollar! Monday, September 3, 2007  NYU begins work on co-gen plant As you can see from this flyer , NYU has begun work on its new cogeneration plant. The new plant will produce more and cleaner power, resulting in a lowering of emissions for both NYU and NYC!
