Benefits are available for the following chapters:          Post 9/11 GI Bill (Chapter 33 Yellow Ribbon )      Dependents Education Assistance ( Chapter 35 )      Montgomery GI Bill ( Chapter 30 )      Reserve Education Assistance Program ( Chapter 1606 or 1607 )      Vocational Rehabilitation ( Chapter 31 - Disabled Veteran )            After applying for benefits          After the veteran has completed the paperwork through the VA website , a Certificate of Eligibility Letter (COE) will be mailed, indicating the chapter and eligible benefit(s).      If the student is the veteran, they will also need to submit Discharge Document papers ( DD214 ). In order for a service member to be entitled to their benefits they must be honorably discharged.            After acceptance to NYU          When the student/veteran has been accepted by their selected school they should meet with their academic advisor and registering, the COE can be scanned and emailed directly to the NYU Certifying Official or faxed to 212-995-4154 Attention: NYU Certifying Official.      All veterans are expected to reach the objective (bachelor's, master's, doctorate or certificate) authorized by the VA with the minimum number of points required.            The VA may not authorize payments for credits that are in excess of scholastic requirements, that are taken for audit purposes only, or for which non punitive grades are received.                      Supplemental and Concurrent Enrollments     A student may take courses at more than one school that apply to his or her degree. The school that will grant the degree is the student's \"primary\" school; all other schools are \"secondary\" schools. Learn more about supplemental and concurrent enrollments .        Non-Credit/Certificate Programs          School of Continuing and Professional Studies (SCPS) offers several Non-Credit programs . For certificate advisement please contact SCPS .      Veterans are advised to review the VA website to see if the program is approved. If the veteran is interested in a program that is not approved, please contact the NYU Certifying Official .              Programs that are not approved require the approval from the State Approving Agency which determines the eligibility of certificate programs.                       Notes          Veterans are required to contact the NYU Certifying Official every semester upon registering in order to certify their enrollment for the semester.      March 1, 2013 New York University is a participant of the Department of Defense (DOD) Voluntary Education Partnership Memorandum of Understanding (MOU).      The School of Medicine, School of Law, and the Graduate Division of the Stern School of Business have their own Certifying Officials. Please contact the schools directly.      Since interpretation of regulations governing veterans' benefits is subject to change, veterans should refer regularly to the VA website .            Waiting for your VA Education Benefits?     The Department of Veterans Affairs has made funds available for Veteran students who are still awaiting their education benefit claim to be processed. Eligible veterans can receive up to a $3000 advance, which will be recouped from future benefit payments. If you are a student who applied for one of VA's education programs and have not yet received your monthly benefit payment as of August 1, 2011, you can request a one-time advance payment at your local Regional Benefit Office or through the VA's website .
