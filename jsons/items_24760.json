Description: Students will examine, analyze, apply, &amp; evaluate theoretical paradigms &amp; research, drawn from the disciplines of psychology, public health, &amp; education as well as artistic/media reactions in relation to HIV prevention &amp; counseling.

The course utilizes a biopsychosocial framework that emphasizes on theory-based HIV prevention &amp; practice. Students will consider the response to the HIV epidemic in the U.K. &amp; the U.S. from a cross-cultural perspective. Students will participate in on-site visits to local AIDS service organizations in London serving those affected by the disease. Local experts in London will provide guest lectures on the issues of prevention &amp; counseling as they are undertaken in the U.K. &amp; will consider these efforts with regard to the National Health Service (NHS). Students will conduct work with &amp; within the community itself, &amp; consider how the U.K. &amp; the U.S. have responded to the HIV epidemic over the last 30 years.
