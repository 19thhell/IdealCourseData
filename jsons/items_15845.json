                                                          Physics is a broad discipline, ranging from fundamental scientific questions to sophisticated technological applications. At its most basic, it is the study of matter and energy and their manifold interactions. Physicists study topics as wide-ranging as the underlying nature of space and time; the origins, large-scale structure, and future evolution of the universe; the behavior of stars and galaxies; the fundamental constituents of matter; the many different patterns in which matter is organized, including superconductivity, liquid crystals, or the various forms of magnetism in solids; the workings of biological matter, whether in molecules such as DNA, or cellular structures, or the transport of matter and energy in and across cells; and many others. Basic physics research has led to myriad technological advances, which have transformed society in the 20th century through the present day; a small list includes radio and television, computers, lasers, X-rays, magnetic resonance imaging and CAT scans, and the World Wide Web.     Physics is a hands-on discipline, and our students gain expertise not only in the classroom but also in the laboratory. They participate in activities ranging from the writing of realistic computer games to the modeling of financial activities, as well as the more traditional activities of physicists. Those trained in physics are found in many occupations, such as various fields of engineering, computer technology, health, environmental and earth sciences, communications, and science writing. A higher degree opens the possibility of creative research in industry, or teaching and research in colleges and universities. Outstanding and highly motivated students are offered special opportunities for honors work, independent study, summer laboratory research, internships, and other enhancements.

The course introduces the principles and practices of &amp;ldquo;classical&amp;rdquo; physicochemical methods in chemical thermodynamics and kinetics, and continues with modern experimental and computational methods that are widely used in contemporary analytical, organic, physical, and biological chemistry laboratories. The experiments include thermochemical techniques such as calorimetry to determine the heat exchange during chemical reactions or physical processes, construction and interpretation of phase diagrams of binary and ternary mixtures, measurement and prediction of kinetic rates of chemical reactions, determination of rate constants, characterization of colloids, and measuring the electrochemical properties of matter. The experiments will be supported by computer simulations, and are highly focused on the processes of experimentation, data recording, correct analysis, and meaningful interpretation of the observations. After completion of this course, the students will be able to approach a chemical problem, set up a hypothesis, perform accurate measurement, interpret the results, verify the hypothesis, draw conclusions, and communicate effectively the results orally and in writing.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;* 2 credits&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;*Pre or co-requisites are CHEM-AD 103&lt;/p&gt;                                                                      Fall 2013 ;             14 Weeks                                                                                                   Mazin Magzoub , Wael M.

These linear systems, which arise in elasticity, in electrical engineering, and in economics for example, involve linear equations in many unknowns. The associated matrix algebra is a rich and beautiful field of mathematics. It is also central to the analysis of linear ordinary and partial differential equations. The material in this course includes systems of linear equations, Gaussian elimination, matrices, determinants, Cramer&amp;rsquo;s rule, vectors, vector spaces, basis and dimension, linear transformations, eigenvalues, eigenvectors, and quadratic forms.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;*Prerequisites: MATH-AD 110 or MATH-AD 111 or Math Placement.&lt;/p&gt;                                                                      Fall 2012 ;             14 Weeks                                                                                                  Jean-Francois Chassagneux                                          -             UW, 11:20-12:35                                                                                Taught in Abu Dhabi                                                      Spring 2013 ;             14 Weeks                                                                                                   Shafer Smith                                           -             TR, 2:35-3:50 PM                                                                                Taught in Abu Dhabi                                                      Fall 2013 ;             14 Weeks                                                                                                   Alberto Gandolfi                                           -             TR, 11:20AM-12:35PM                                                                                Taught in Abu Dhabi                                                      Fall 2013 ;             14 Weeks                                                                                                   Arman Mimar                                           -             TR, 4:00- 5:15 PM                                                                                Taught in Abu Dhabi                                                      Spring 2014 ;             14 Weeks                                                                                                   Olivier Pauluis                                           -             TR, 11:20-12:35 pm                                                                                Taught in Abu Dhabi                                                      Fall 2014 ;             14 Weeks                                                                                                   Arman Mimar                                           -             MW, 3:35-4:50 pm                                                                                Taught in Abu Dhabi                                                      Fall 2014 ;             14 Weeks                                                                                                  Diogo Ars\u00e9nio                                          -             MW, 2:10-3:25 pm                                                                                Taught in Abu Dhabi                                                      Spring 2015 ;             14 Weeks                                                                                                   Alberto Gandolfi                                           -             MW, 10:40 - 11:55am                                                                                Taught in Abu Dhabi                                                      Fall 2015 ;             14 Weeks                                                                                                   Arman Mimar                                           -             MW, 10:40-11:55 am (Sem 1)                                                                                Taught in Abu Dhabi                                                      Fall 2015 ;             14 Weeks                                                                                                   Alberto Gandolfi                                           -             MW, 3:35-4:50 pm (Sem 2)                                                                                Taught in Abu Dhabi                                          This course appears in...

The prime source of our information is light, and until the 20th century, that meant only optical light, but starting with the discovery of cosmic radio waves in 1931, the rest of the electromagnetic spectrum has been opened up to astronomers. Each region of the spectrum (radio, microwave, infrared, optical, X-ray, and gamma-ray) requires different detection technologies and analysis techniques. Each waveband tells us about different aspects of astronomical sources and the Universe as a whole.

Following an introduction to the physical sciences, the course focuses on velocity, acceleration, forces, and energy, while simultaneously introducing students to atoms and molecules. Chemical reactions are examined, and the energy changes associated with them are investigated via a thorough analysis of the three laws of thermodynamics. Laboratory exercises focus on the guiding principles of the scientific method and an introduction to experimental design, and scientific presentation, including technical writing.

Capacitors, current, and basic circuits are explored with an eye toward understanding their applications to chemical reactions and the behavior of living cells. The rates and directions of chemical reactions are explored as chemical kinetics and chemical equilibrium are investigated with a special focus on acid-base chemistry. These fundamental physical and chemical principles are used to describe basic cellular monomers and polymers including DNA, RNA, and protein, and the sequence of events that leads to information flow and its regulation in the cell nucleus. They are also applied to macroscopic systems found in the biosphere. Laboratory exercises focus on fundamental protocols and tools needed to sharpen basic laboratory skills. Weekly discussion sections are designed to hone proficiency at solving problems in a collaborative, team environment.&lt;/p&gt;                           This course has a laboratory component .

This leads to another question: If a specific function is desired, can a form or shape be engineered or modified to execute or improve that function? The course examines the form/function concept in magnetic and electrical fields, the behavior and design of small molecules, and the activity of proteins as the workhorse in biological systems. Laboratory exercises require students to design experiments related to crystals and crystallography, and to examine chemical forms at the macroscopic and microscopic levels. Weekly discussion sections are designed to hone proficiency at solving problems in a collaborative, team environment.&lt;/p&gt;                           This course has a laboratory component .

In physics, disturbances generate waves that are associated with the transmission of light and sound. These same waves generate responses in living organisms as sensory systems detect them, including nerves in some species. Electromagnetic waves, interactions among light, matter, and living systems are examined. Change during the growth of cells is explored at the molecular level as well. Laboratory exercises fuse physics, chemistry, and biology as students engage in projects related to recombinant DNA technology, gene cloning, and protein synthesis and characterization.&lt;/p&gt;                           This course has a laboratory component .

This is embodied in physics and chemistry in quantum theory and the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. But living systems provide countless examples of oscillatory events that possess inherent uncertainty when scientists try to predict outcomes. Indeed, this final chapter in Foundations of Science challenges students to consider the very nature of studying complex problems and systems and assessing the uncertainty associated with the scientific method. The laboratory exercises involve collaborative projects in which teams of students must apply their acquired knowledge and skills to design experiments focused on answering a question or solving a problem, keeping uncertainty in mind as they report their results and discuss additional data that would be need to provide a better answer or solution.&lt;/p&gt;                            This course has a laboratory component .

                                                          Physics is a broad discipline, ranging from fundamental scientific questions to sophisticated technological applications. At its most basic, it is the study of matter and energy and their manifold interactions. Physicists study topics as wide-ranging as the underlying nature of space and time; the origins, large-scale structure, and future evolution of the universe; the behavior of stars and galaxies; the fundamental constituents of matter; the many different patterns in which matter is organized, including superconductivity, liquid crystals, or the various forms of magnetism in solids; the workings of biological matter, whether in molecules such as DNA, or cellular structures, or the transport of matter and energy in and across cells; and many others. Basic physics research has led to myriad technological advances, which have transformed society in the 20th century through the present day; a small list includes radio and television, computers, lasers, X-rays, magnetic resonance imaging and CAT scans, and the World Wide Web.     Physics is a hands-on discipline, and our students gain expertise not only in the classroom but also in the laboratory. They participate in activities ranging from the writing of realistic computer games to the modeling of financial activities, as well as the more traditional activities of physicists. Those trained in physics are found in many occupations, such as various fields of engineering, computer technology, health, environmental and earth sciences, communications, and science writing. A higher degree opens the possibility of creative research in industry, or teaching and research in colleges and universities. Outstanding and highly motivated students are offered special opportunities for honors work, independent study, summer laboratory research, internships, and other enhancements.

The course introduces the principles and practices of &amp;ldquo;classical&amp;rdquo; physicochemical methods in chemical thermodynamics and kinetics, and continues with modern experimental and computational methods that are widely used in contemporary analytical, organic, physical, and biological chemistry laboratories. The experiments include thermochemical techniques such as calorimetry to determine the heat exchange during chemical reactions or physical processes, construction and interpretation of phase diagrams of binary and ternary mixtures, measurement and prediction of kinetic rates of chemical reactions, determination of rate constants, characterization of colloids, and measuring the electrochemical properties of matter. The experiments will be supported by computer simulations, and are highly focused on the processes of experimentation, data recording, correct analysis, and meaningful interpretation of the observations. After completion of this course, the students will be able to approach a chemical problem, set up a hypothesis, perform accurate measurement, interpret the results, verify the hypothesis, draw conclusions, and communicate effectively the results orally and in writing.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;* 2 credits&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;*Pre or co-requisites are CHEM-AD 103&lt;/p&gt;                                                                      Fall 2013 ;             14 Weeks                                                                                                   Mazin Magzoub , Wael M.

While the derivative measures the instantaneous rate of change of a function, the definite integral measures the total accumulation of a function over an interval. Indeed, the relationship between differentiation (finding a derivative) and integration (determining an integral) is described in the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. In addition to two weekly lectures, students attend a weekly recitation that provides opportunities for rigorous analysis of proofs and theorems associated with the material. This course is primarily intended for students considering Mathematics as a major. Placement into Calculus is decided by discussion with mentors and the results of a mathematics placement examination.

Applications to other disciplines are emphasized. Since the derivative measures the instantaneous rate of change of a function and the definite integral measures the total accumulation of a function over an interval, these two ideas form the basis for nearly all mathematical formulas in science, engineering, economics, and other fields. This course also provides instruction in how to model situations in order to solve problems. Applications include graphing, and maximizing and minimizing functions. In addition to two weekly lectures, students attend a weekly recitation focused on applications. Placement into Calculus with Applications is decided by discussion with mentors and the results of a mathematics placement examination.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;May not be taken if MATH-AD 110 Calculus is completed&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is a required course for Economics majors until the class of 2017.

These linear systems, which arise in elasticity, in electrical engineering, and in economics for example, involve linear equations in many unknowns. The associated matrix algebra is a rich and beautiful field of mathematics. It is also central to the analysis of linear ordinary and partial differential equations. The material in this course includes systems of linear equations, Gaussian elimination, matrices, determinants, Cramer&amp;rsquo;s rule, vectors, vector spaces, basis and dimension, linear transformations, eigenvalues, eigenvectors, and quadratic forms.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;*Prerequisites: MATH-AD 110 or MATH-AD 111 or Math Placement.&lt;/p&gt;                                                                      Fall 2012 ;             14 Weeks                                                                                                  Jean-Francois Chassagneux                                          -             UW, 11:20-12:35                                                                                Taught in Abu Dhabi                                                      Spring 2013 ;             14 Weeks                                                                                                   Shafer Smith                                           -             TR, 2:35-3:50 PM                                                                                Taught in Abu Dhabi                                                      Fall 2013 ;             14 Weeks                                                                                                   Alberto Gandolfi                                           -             TR, 11:20AM-12:35PM                                                                                Taught in Abu Dhabi                                                      Fall 2013 ;             14 Weeks                                                                                                   Arman Mimar                                           -             TR, 4:00- 5:15 PM                                                                                Taught in Abu Dhabi                                                      Spring 2014 ;             14 Weeks                                                                                                   Olivier Pauluis                                           -             TR, 11:20-12:35 pm                                                                                Taught in Abu Dhabi                                                      Fall 2014 ;             14 Weeks                                                                                                   Arman Mimar                                           -             MW, 3:35-4:50 pm                                                                                Taught in Abu Dhabi                                                      Fall 2014 ;             14 Weeks                                                                                                  Diogo Ars\u00e9nio                                          -             MW, 2:10-3:25 pm                                                                                Taught in Abu Dhabi                                                      Spring 2015 ;             14 Weeks                                                                                                   Alberto Gandolfi                                           -             MW, 10:40 - 11:55am                                                                                Taught in Abu Dhabi                                                      Fall 2015 ;             14 Weeks                                                                                                   Arman Mimar                                           -             MW, 10:40-11:55 am (Sem 1)                                                                                Taught in Abu Dhabi                                                      Fall 2015 ;             14 Weeks                                                                                                   Alberto Gandolfi                                           -             MW, 3:35-4:50 pm (Sem 2)                                                                                Taught in Abu Dhabi                                          This course appears in...

The prime source of our information is light, and until the 20th century, that meant only optical light, but starting with the discovery of cosmic radio waves in 1931, the rest of the electromagnetic spectrum has been opened up to astronomers. Each region of the spectrum (radio, microwave, infrared, optical, X-ray, and gamma-ray) requires different detection technologies and analysis techniques. Each waveband tells us about different aspects of astronomical sources and the Universe as a whole.

Following an introduction to the physical sciences, the course focuses on velocity, acceleration, forces, and energy, while simultaneously introducing students to atoms and molecules. Chemical reactions are examined, and the energy changes associated with them are investigated via a thorough analysis of the three laws of thermodynamics. Laboratory exercises focus on the guiding principles of the scientific method and an introduction to experimental design, and scientific presentation, including technical writing.

Capacitors, current, and basic circuits are explored with an eye toward understanding their applications to chemical reactions and the behavior of living cells. The rates and directions of chemical reactions are explored as chemical kinetics and chemical equilibrium are investigated with a special focus on acid-base chemistry. These fundamental physical and chemical principles are used to describe basic cellular monomers and polymers including DNA, RNA, and protein, and the sequence of events that leads to information flow and its regulation in the cell nucleus. They are also applied to macroscopic systems found in the biosphere. Laboratory exercises focus on fundamental protocols and tools needed to sharpen basic laboratory skills. Weekly discussion sections are designed to hone proficiency at solving problems in a collaborative, team environment.&lt;/p&gt;                           This course has a laboratory component .

This leads to another question: If a specific function is desired, can a form or shape be engineered or modified to execute or improve that function? The course examines the form/function concept in magnetic and electrical fields, the behavior and design of small molecules, and the activity of proteins as the workhorse in biological systems. Laboratory exercises require students to design experiments related to crystals and crystallography, and to examine chemical forms at the macroscopic and microscopic levels. Weekly discussion sections are designed to hone proficiency at solving problems in a collaborative, team environment.&lt;/p&gt;                           This course has a laboratory component .

In physics, disturbances generate waves that are associated with the transmission of light and sound. These same waves generate responses in living organisms as sensory systems detect them, including nerves in some species. Electromagnetic waves, interactions among light, matter, and living systems are examined. Change during the growth of cells is explored at the molecular level as well. Laboratory exercises fuse physics, chemistry, and biology as students engage in projects related to recombinant DNA technology, gene cloning, and protein synthesis and characterization.&lt;/p&gt;                           This course has a laboratory component .

This is embodied in physics and chemistry in quantum theory and the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. But living systems provide countless examples of oscillatory events that possess inherent uncertainty when scientists try to predict outcomes. Indeed, this final chapter in Foundations of Science challenges students to consider the very nature of studying complex problems and systems and assessing the uncertainty associated with the scientific method. The laboratory exercises involve collaborative projects in which teams of students must apply their acquired knowledge and skills to design experiments focused on answering a question or solving a problem, keeping uncertainty in mind as they report their results and discuss additional data that would be need to provide a better answer or solution.&lt;/p&gt;                            This course has a laboratory component .

broad discipline, ranging from fundamental scientific questions to sophisticated technological applications. At its most basic, it is the study of matter and energy and their manifold interactions. Physicists study topics as wide-ranging as the underlying nature of space and time; the origins, large-scale structure, and future evolution of the universe; the behavior of stars and galaxies; the fundamental constituents of matter; the many different patterns in which matter is organized, including superconductivity, liquid crystals, or the various forms of magnetism in solids; the workings of biological matter, whether in molecules such as DNA, or cellular structures, or the transport of matter and energy in and across cells; and many others. Basic physics research has led to myriad technological advances, which have transformed society in the 20th century through the present day; a small list includes radio and television, computers, lasers, X-rays, magnetic resonance imaging and CAT scans, and the World Wide Web.     Physics is a hands-on discipline, and our students gain expertise not only in the classroom but also in the laboratory. They participate in activities ranging from the writing of realistic computer games to the modeling of financial activities, as well as the more traditional activities of physicists. Those trained in physics are found in many occupations, such as various fields of engineering, computer technology, health, environmental and earth sciences, communications, and science writing. A higher degree opens the possibility of creative research in industry, or teaching and research in colleges and universities. Outstanding and highly motivated students are offered special opportunities for honors work, independent study, summer laboratory research, internships, and other enhancements.

This course begins with a thorough review of cells, with a special emphasis on eukaryotes and their different compartments. This is followed by an investigation of the structures and functions of biological macromolecules, including proteins, nucleic acids, carbohydrates and lipids. Students gain a deep understanding of information flow in cells via detailed biophysical analysis of replication and gene expression. Ultimately, the principles of biophysics are applied to disease states with an eye toward rational design of therapeutics.

The course introduces the principles and practices of &ldquo;classical&rdquo; physicochemical methods in chemical thermodynamics and kinetics, and continues with modern experimental and computational methods that are widely used in contemporary analytical, organic, physical, and biological chemistry laboratories. The experiments include thermochemical techniques such as calorimetry to determine the heat exchange during chemical reactions or physical processes, construction and interpretation of phase diagrams of binary and ternary mixtures, measurement and prediction of kinetic rates of chemical reactions, determination of rate constants, characterization of colloids, and measuring the electrochemical properties of matter. The experiments will be supported by computer simulations, and are highly focused on the processes of experimentation, data recording, correct analysis, and meaningful interpretation of the observations. After completion of this course, the students will be able to approach a chemical problem, set up a hypothesis, perform accurate measurement, interpret the results, verify the hypothesis, draw conclusions, and communicate effectively the results orally and in writing.    * 2 credits    *Pre or co-requisites are CHEM-AD 103                                                                       Fall 2013 ;             14 Weeks                                                                                                   Mazin Magzoub , Wael M.

While the derivative measures the instantaneous rate of change of a function, the definite integral measures the total accumulation of a function over an interval. Indeed, the relationship between differentiation (finding a derivative) and integration (determining an integral) is described in the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. In addition to two weekly lectures, students attend a weekly recitation that provides opportunities for rigorous analysis of proofs and theorems associated with the material. This course is primarily intended for students considering Mathematics as a major. Placement into Calculus is decided by discussion with mentors and the results of a mathematics placement examination. With permission of the program in mathematics, Calculus with Applications may substitute for Calculus.    This is a required course for Economics majors until the class of 2017.

Applications to other disciplines are emphasized. Since the derivative measures the instantaneous rate of change of a function and the definite integral measures the total accumulation of a function over an interval, these two ideas form the basis for nearly all mathematical formulas in science, engineering, economics, and other fields. This course also provides instruction in how to model situations in order to solve problems. Applications include graphing, and maximizing and minimizing functions. In addition to two weekly lectures, students attend a weekly recitation focused on applications. Placement into Calculus with Applications is decided by discussion with mentors and the results of a mathematics placement examination.    May not be taken if MATH-AD 110 Calculus is completed    This is a required course for Economics majors until the class of 2017. This course can be substituted with MATH-AD 110 Calculus.                                   This course has a discussion section .

Integration and differentiation of functions of several variables require new concepts and techniques. The course has applications to science and engineering as well as economics. Specific topics include vectors in the plane and space; partial derivatives with applications; double and triple integrals; spherical and cylindrical coordinates; surface and line integrals; and divergence, gradient, and curl. In addition, the theorems of Gauss and Stokes are rigorously introduced.

These linear systems, which arise in elasticity, in electrical engineering, and in economics for example, involve linear equations in many unknowns. The associated matrix algebra is a rich and beautiful field of mathematics. It is also central to the analysis of linear ordinary and partial differential equations.

Newton&rsquo;s equations of motion, the rate equations of chemical reactions, the currents flowing in electric circuits, all can be expressed as ordinary differential equations. The solutions of these equations usually evolve a combination of analytic and numerical methods. The course studies first- and second-order equations, solutions using infinite series, Laplace transforms, linear systems, numerical methods.    *MATH-AD 116 can be taken as a corequisite.

It is further used in other branches of mathematics, including algebraic geometry and number theory, and also has diverse applications in science and engineering: fluid dynamics, elasticity, nuclear and electrical engineering, to name just a few examples. The geometrical content of analysis in the complex plane is especially appealing.

PHYS-AD 317 Multi-wavelength Astronomy                                             Multi-wavelength Astronomy is more an observational science than an experimental one. The prime source of our information is light, and until the 20th century, that meant only optical light, but starting with the discovery of cosmic radio waves in 1931, the rest of the electromagnetic spectrum has been opened up to astronomers. Each region of the spectrum (radio, microwave, infrared, optical, X-ray, and gamma-ray) requires different detection technologies and analysis techniques. Each waveband tells us about different aspects of astronomical sources and the Universe as a whole. This course will provide an overview of multi-wavelength astronomy: the telescopes, techniques, emission mechanisms, sources, and primary science questions relevant to each observing band. A good understanding of basic physics will be assumed, but no specialized knowledge in astronomy or advanced physics topics is required.

Through exposure to NYUAD faculty research, students will identify potential areas of interest for their own capstone research, and over the course of the semester develop and put into writing an in-depth biology capstone proposal. The final capstone proposal is due at the end of the seminar series so that students can begin the Capstone Project in the fall semester of their senior year. Beginning in 2014-15 all science majors are expected to take this course in the junior year; it will be offered every semester.

Following an introduction to the physical sciences, the course focuses on velocity, acceleration, forces, and energy, while simultaneously introducing students to atoms and molecules. Chemical reactions are examined, and the energy changes associated with them are investigated via a thorough analysis of the three laws of thermodynamics. Laboratory exercises focus on the guiding principles of the scientific method and an introduction to experimental design, and scientific presentation, including technical writing. Weekly discussion sections are designed to hone proficiency at solving problems in a collaborative, team environment.

Concurrently, atomic theory, the theory of molecular bonding, and atomic and molecular structures and shapes, in which forces and energy play a role, are investigated. Students apply these concepts to understanding molecules related to the life sciences. Laboratory exercises focus on acquisition of data and analysis with a continued emphasis on technical presentation. Weekly discussion sections are designed to hone proficiency at solving problems in a collaborative, team environment.

Capacitors, current, and basic circuits are explored with an eye toward understanding their applications to chemical reactions and the behavior of living cells. The rates and directions of chemical reactions are explored as chemical kinetics and chemical equilibrium are investigated with a special focus on acid-base chemistry. These fundamental physical and chemical principles are used to describe basic cellular monomers and polymers including DNA, RNA, and protein, and the sequence of events that leads to information flow and its regulation in the cell nucleus. They are also applied to macroscopic systems found in the biosphere. Laboratory exercises focus on fundamental protocols and tools needed to sharpen basic laboratory skills. Weekly discussion sections are designed to hone proficiency at solving problems in a collaborative, team environment.

This leads to another question: If a specific function is desired, can a form or shape be engineered or modified to execute or improve that function? The course examines the form/function concept in magnetic and electrical fields, the behavior and design of small molecules, and the activity of proteins as the workhorse in biological systems. Laboratory exercises require students to design experiments related to crystals and crystallography, and to examine chemical forms at the macroscopic and microscopic levels. Weekly discussion sections are designed to hone proficiency at solving problems in a collaborative, team environment.

In physics, disturbances generate waves that are associated with the transmission of light and sound. These same waves generate responses in living organisms as sensory systems detect them, including nerves in some species. Electromagnetic waves, interactions among light, matter, and living systems are examined. Change during the growth of cells is explored at the molecular level as well. Laboratory exercises fuse physics, chemistry, and biology as students engage in projects related to recombinant DNA technology, gene cloning, and protein synthesis and characterization.

This is embodied in physics and chemistry in quantum theory and the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. But living systems provide countless examples of oscillatory events that possess inherent uncertainty when scientists try to predict outcomes. Indeed, this final chapter in Foundations of Science challenges students to consider the very nature of studying complex problems and systems and assessing the uncertainty associated with the scientific method. The laboratory exercises involve collaborative projects in which teams of students must apply their acquired knowledge and skills to design experiments focused on answering a question or solving a problem, keeping uncertainty in mind as they report their results and discuss additional data that would be need to provide a better answer or solution.
