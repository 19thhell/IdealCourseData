Turning data into insight.   Our networked world is generating a deluge of data that no human, or group of humans, can process fast enough. This data deluge has the potential to transform the way business, government, science and healthcare are carried out. The emerging discipline of data science holds the key to unlocking that potential. It uses automated methods to analyze massive amounts of data and extract knowledge from them. Data science combines aspects of computer science, applied mathematics and statistics.

Information visualization, graphic design and human computer interaction all come into play.                                                                                                                                        Where will the data revolution take us?   Data science has already started to revolutionize most areas of intellectual endeavor found at NYU and in the world. We believe this revolution is just beginning. Data science can help us answer not only the great questions and challenges of our time, but also centuries-old questions. Through data science we may improve our understanding of how the brain works, for example. With that understanding we can build intelligent machines capable of advancing life-saving medical research. Data science can help us realize the promises of the digital age.        33% of all data will be stored, or will have passed through the cloud by 2015.     \u201c\u2026Now we really do have essentially free and ubiquitous data. So the complimentary scarce factor is the ability to understand that data and extract value from it.\u201d \u2014Hal Varian, Chief Economist for Google                                                                                                    Unlocking Big Data&#8217;s Potential   From government, social networks and ecommerce sites to sensors, smart meters and mobile networks, data is being collected at an unprecedented speed and scale.

Analyze &amp; Refine   With an explorer\u2019s desire to uncover what others might not see, data scientists analyze data. Their insights are used in sectors ranging from biology to finance to government.       Interaction   Data scientists excel in presenting complicated findings for experts and non-experts alike. Information visualization, graphic design and human computer interaction all come into play.                                                                                                                                        Where will the data revolution take us?   Data science has already started to revolutionize most areas of intellectual endeavor found at NYU and in the world. We believe this revolution is just beginning. Data science can help us answer not only the great questions and challenges of our time, but also centuries-old questions. Through data science we may improve our understanding of how the brain works, for example. With that understanding we can build intelligent machines capable of advancing life-saving medical research. Data science can help us realize the promises of the digital age.        33% of all data will be stored, or will have passed through the cloud by 2015.     \u201c\u2026Now we really do have essentially free and ubiquitous data. So the complimentary scarce factor is the ability to understand that data and extract value from it.\u201d \u2014Hal Varian, Chief Economist for Google                                                                                                    Unlocking Big Data&#8217;s Potential   From government, social networks and ecommerce sites to sensors, smart meters and mobile networks, data is being collected at an unprecedented speed and scale.

The degree focuses on the development of new methods for data science.   We live in the &#8220;Age of the Petabyte,&#8221; soon to become &#8220;The Age of the Exabyte.&#8221; Our networked world is generating a deluge of data that no human, or group of humans, can process fast enough. This data deluge has the potential to transform the way business, government, science, and healthcare are carried out. But too few possess the skills needed to use automated analytical tools and cut through the noise to create knowledge from big data.   A new discipline has emerged to address the need for professionals and researchers to deal with the &#8220;data tidal wave.&#8221; Its object is to provide the underlying theory and methods of the data revolution. This emergent discipline is known by several names. We call it &#8220;data science,\u201d and we have created the world\u2019s first and only MS degree program devoted to it.   36 credits | 2 years   The curriculum is 36 credits, half of which are required courses and half of which are electives. The inaugural class launched in the Fall of 2013 .   Both full-time and part-time students must complete all 36 credits (at least 24 credits in residency) within 5 years of enrolling at NYU as an MS in Data Science candidate.   Scholarships   NYU will offer tuition scholarships to selected students admitted to the program. All applicants for admission will be considered for these awards on a competitive basis. These scholarships will cover a portion of the tuition costs for up to two years. The scholarships do not cover university fees.

Analyze &amp; Refine   With an explorer\u2019s desire to uncover what others might not see, data scientists analyze data. Their insights are used in sectors ranging from biology to finance to government.       Interaction   Data scientists excel in presenting complicated findings for experts and non-experts alike. Information visualization, graphic design and human computer interaction all come into play.                                                                                                                                        Where will the data revolution take us?   Data science has already started to revolutionize most areas of intellectual endeavor found at NYU and in the world. We believe this revolution is just beginning. Data science can help us answer not only the great questions and challenges of our time, but also centuries-old questions. Through data science we may improve our understanding of how the brain works, for example. With that understanding we can build intelligent machines capable of advancing life-saving medical research. Data science can help us realize the promises of the digital age.        33% of all data will be stored, or will have passed through the cloud by 2015.     \u201c\u2026Now we really do have essentially free and ubiquitous data. So the complimentary scarce factor is the ability to understand that data and extract value from it.\u201d \u2014Hal Varian, Chief Economist for Google                                                                                                    Unlocking Big Data&#8217;s Potential   From government, social networks and ecommerce sites to sensors, smart meters and mobile networks, data is being collected at an unprecedented speed and scale.

The degree focuses on the development of new methods for data science.   We live in the &#8220;Age of the Petabyte,&#8221; soon to become &#8220;The Age of the Exabyte.&#8221; Our networked world is generating a deluge of data that no human, or group of humans, can process fast enough. This data deluge has the potential to transform the way business, government, science, and healthcare are carried out. But too few possess the skills needed to use automated analytical tools and cut through the noise to create knowledge from big data.   A new discipline has emerged to address the need for professionals and researchers to deal with the &#8220;data tidal wave.&#8221; Its object is to provide the underlying theory and methods of the data revolution. This emergent discipline is known by several names. We call it &#8220;data science,\u201d and we have created the world\u2019s first and only MS degree program devoted to it.   36 credits | 2 years   The curriculum is 36 credits, half of which are required courses and half of which are electives. The inaugural class launched in the Fall of 2013 .   Both full-time and part-time students must complete all 36 credits (at least 24 credits in residency) within 5 years of enrolling at NYU as an MS in Data Science candidate.   Scholarships   NYU will offer tuition scholarships to selected students admitted to the program. All applicants for admission will be considered for these awards on a competitive basis. These scholarships will cover a portion of the tuition costs for up to two years. The scholarships do not cover university fees.

Data science combines aspects of:                                                     Computer Science                                                Applied Mathematics                                                Statistics                                                Machine Learning                                                Visualization                                        Data science offers new approaches to age-old decision-making and problem-solving processes.       A look at how data science is fundamentally shifting the way professionals do their work:                                                      The Journalist               Databases and visualization software are becoming the newest tools of the trade for investigative journalists. Take for example the The Declassification Engine, a project to sift through a massive amount of declassified U.S. government documents using natural language processing and statistical/machine learning. A group of individuals, let alone an individual journalist, could never reasonably achieve such a feat.                 Listen to a member of the project discuss The Declassification Engine                                                       The Emergency Services Manager               Cities have long collected and analyzed information about emergency response times, but according to Michael Flowers, director of analytics for New York City\u2019s Office of Policy and Strategic Planning, the information has typically been limited to location. With his office\u2019s help, the city is trying to streamline the emergency response process and get to people in need sooner by looking at a wider range of data elements, such as the operator\u2019s script.               Listen to Michael Flowers talk about the way data is improving NYC                                                       The TV/Film Producer               A time-honored way to ensure that a TV program or movie becomes a hit is screening it with test audiences, tweaking the final product in reaction to audience feedback. That\u2019s all changing thanks to online platforms like Netflix that gather information on viewer\u2019s behavior (which episodes are rewatched, at which episode in a series most viewers quit the series, how many minutes into a movie people hit pause) like never before. Such data may change how TV and films are made and distributed. TV and movie makers will have new insight into what audiences like before scripts are shot; producers will be able to target their creations to the individuals that will embrace them most.
