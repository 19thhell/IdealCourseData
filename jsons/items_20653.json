Is NYU's Sociology program an appropriate place for me? NYU's Department of Sociology emphasizes both theoretical scholarship and substantive empirical research. It encourages a range of different analytic perspectives and is strong in both quantitative and qualitative methods. The graduate program complements contemporary American research -- including that focused on New York City -- with international and historical studies. Among its areas of strength are gender studies; political sociology, including social movements and social policy; crime, law and deviance; organizations and economy; culture; urban sociology; education; and social inequality. If your primary areas of interest fall within these broad categories, NYU would be an excellent place for you to do graduate work in sociology. Another way you might examine this issue is by looking at the written work and areas of interest listed by our faculty on the webpage.    Is it feasible for me to apply directly to the Ph.D. program with my B.A.? Yes. This is the situation of most applicants. We do not require that you have previously earned a Master's Degree or even that you have a background in sociology. We are interested in finding the most talented candidates who fit well with our strengths as a department and will excel here.      Do you offer a Master's Degree? Yes, the NYU Department of Sociology does offer a Master's Degree in Applied Quantitative Research (AQR), however the AQR program is a separate program entirely and does not lead to the Ph.D. program.  I have not taken any courses in sociology. Are my qualifications enough to meet the requirements of your program? It is not particularly important whether you have taken sociology courses before applying. We evaluate each student's application according to their (1) GRE scores, (2) grades, (3) letters of recommendation, (4) statement of purpose, and, if applicable, (5) any work or research experiences that seem like a good preparation for graduate training in sociology. If you are strong in most of these categories and IF we think there is a strong fit between your interests and our strengths as a department, then your application will be competitive.    Will my application be automatically rejected if my GRE scores fall below a certain level? No. We have no \"cut off\" level for GRE scores. We weigh the merits of each application on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration all of the factors noted in the answer to the previous question. Obviously, strong GRE scores will make your application more competitive, but they alone do not guarantee admission, nor does any particular GRE score result in an automatic denial of admission.    I definitely need financial assistance. How is financial aid awarded? The NYU Department of Sociology only accepts students whom we can fully fund for a minimum of five years. The funding generally covers full tuition, fees, student health insurance plus a fellowship stipend. In addition, students have the opportunity to teach. Teaching is separate from the funding package, and any teaching compensation is above and beyond the fellowship support.    I am a foreign student, am I still eligible for financial aid? All students who are accepted to the sociology department receive financial aid, regardless of nationality.    How many students are admitted to the program each year? The amount of students admitted every year varies, but, typically, we offer admission to about 15-20 students in an effort to have an entering cohort of approximately 8-10 students.    How many people apply? We typically receive approximately 400 applications.    How do I schedule an interview? We do not schedule interviews for prospective graduate students before admissions decisions are made. Students who are accepted will be invited to an open house in the spring.    What is the school code for application to NYU's sociology department? The school code is 2596.    What is the application deadline? The deadline is January 4th.    When can I expect to hear back about my application? The graduate admissions department expects to mail out decisions by mid-March.    What are the program-specific requirements for sociology? GRE and TOEFL: GRE general test required. TOEFL required of all applicants who are not native English speakers (see Test Score Requirements on page 1).    Writing Sample: A writing sample is required. It should demonstrate the applicant's ability to construct a coherent argument and could be either a paper for an undergraduate class or a publication. It is preferable that the sample be 5-20 pages long and double-spaced.    What is the average GPA and GRE score of students admitted to the Sociology Ph.D. program? We do not keep track of the average GPA or GRE score of admitted students. GPAs and GREs are one of several factors we consider when making admission decisions. We also consider research experiences, statement of research interests, fit with the graduate program, and other factors.              I have a fellowship (such as a Fulbright) that will fund my graduate studies. Does this guarantee that I will be admitted? No. You should indicate that you have a fellowship on your application. But all applicants are reviewed on the basis of their academic qualifications and their fit for the program, and having a fellowship does not guarantee admission.    If I am not offered a fellowship, can I pay my own way into the program? No. All students admitted into the Ph.D. program are offered full funding from NYU. We do not offer additional slots for students who are able to pay for tuition on their own.    Am I a good fit for NYU? This is always a hard question for us to answer. We are a relatively large department with faculty and graduate students working in many areas of sociology, but not all. You should look at the department website to see if there are faculty members who are working on subjects that interest you or using methods that you would like to learn. If you find them, then you are probably a good fit.                  Contact Us | &copy; New York University , Arts and Science"}]},

It signifies that the recipient is able to conduct independent research and has both a broad basic knowledge of all areas of economics and a comprehensive knowledge of one area in particular. The Ph.D. program equips its graduates with modern economic techniques, enabling them to take leadership positions in economic research in the academic, business, and government worlds.    The Department of Economics has risen to prominence in recent years by attracting internationally renowned scholars to its faculty and by carefully selecting its student body. There are many reasons to believe that we can offer students an outstanding intellectual environment. Seven members of our department are Fellows of the Econometric Society, and one is a Nobel Laureate. Many currently serve or have served on the editorial boards of major journals, including the American Economic Review , Econometrica , the Review of Economic Studies , and the Journal of Economic Theory . Perhaps most significantly, the department placed among the top ten in the Tilburg University ranking of economics departments.    ADMISSION REQUIREMENTS    Admission to graduate studies in economics is limited to students of outstanding promise. All applicants must take the general Graduate Record Examination (GRE), which is administered by the Educational Testing Service, Princeton, N.J. 08540. All international students must take the TOEFL (Test of English as a Foreign Language) examination. Exceptions to this rule include students who attended English speaking college-level institutions. Students from English speaking countries, such as the U.K. or Ireland are also exempt from taking the TOEFL exam.    The Ph.D. program is designed for full-time students only. In evaluating applicants for this program, members of the departmental admissions committee consider the following criteria: previous academic performance, quantitative GRE scores, letters of recommendation, personal statement, and background in economics and mathematics. Because of the diverse nature of such information, we do not adhere to strictly defined cut-off points on grade-point averages or GRE scores. Applicants should also remember that the Ph.D. and the M.A. programs are very different and have different objectives and admissions criteria. Admission into the M.A. program does not guarantee eventual admission to the Ph.D program. Those interested in the Ph.D. program are encouraged to apply directly to the Ph.D. program, and not to the M.A. program.    DEPARTMENTAL FELLOWSHIPS, PRIZES, AND AWARDS    There are various sources of funding for students in the Ph.D. program. Our top students receive MacCracken fellowship awards. These fellowships guarantee funding for five years (subject to satisfactory academic performance) in the form of payment of the basic tuition fee as well as a living allowance for the year. Many other students work as teaching adjuncts, sometimes assisting a professor and sometimes teaching a course of their own. Many professors also have research grants from a variety of sources (National Science Foundation, C.V. Starr Center, etc) which provide research assistantships (R.A.'s) to graduate students.
