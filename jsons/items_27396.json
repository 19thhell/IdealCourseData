It is our mission to provide students with an actor training and production program which will prepare them technically, conceptually, and personally to create their own work, and to meet the far-ranging demands of contemporary and traditional directors, playwrights, choreographers, composers and filmmakers. Our goal is to facilitate the development of young artists who have the skill, vision, courage, and will \u2013 as well as the personal and social consciousness \u2013 to create vital new theater art. ETW began in 1975 at New York University. The first faculty was drawn from such major experimental theater companies and other leaders in contemporary theater, dance, and music. This group of artists/teachers collaborated to develop the core ETW curriculum \u2013 a program based on innovative approaches to physically based acting. ETW\u2019s training covers a wide range of approaches to acting, dance, self-scripting, and vocal performance. Rather than imposing a single aesthetic frame, the ETW curriculum provides students with fundamental performance skills, while helping them discover and shape their own unique artistic visions. ETW curriculum is divided into primary training for first- and second-year students, who follow a prescribed course of study, and an upper level for third- and fourth-year students, who choose from a variety of advanced courses in voice, movement, and acting. Also available is an upper level transfer track designed primarily for third- and fourth-year students transferring from other studios in the Drama Department.

A new class on the art and craft of the Cabaret Song from the perspective of both the writer and the performer has been added to the Graduate Musical Theatre Writing curriculum for students in Cycle 21. Led by Artistic Director Kent Gash and Graduate Musical Theatre Writing Chair Sarah Schlesinger, students in their second year of Undergraduate Drama will be collaborating with writers and composers from Cycle 21.    Gash said the idea for the class came about through collaboration itself: \u201cSarah Schlesinger and I were talking about the infinite and wonderful possibilities presented by our two programs working together. I wanted to begin to introduce the New Studio students to new work, and specifically new work that might be written for them or tailored to the unique individual performance characteristics that each of them brings to the work--our programs offered a unique opportunity for this kind of collaborative training. A bulk of what these young artists in New Studio know and have done is established music theatre repertoire. We all felt the songwriting collaborative class would allow us to keep evolving the performance and interpretive skills of the actors, while the Graduate Music Theatre writers and composers got to know the talents of each performer. Then we would evolve working on new songs and songwriting that will lead to four cabaret performances in the spring term of 2012.\u201d    The first class began with New Studio students performing a prepared comedic song from a musical of their choosing. Carver Duncan, 18, from Michigan said he is \u201cexcited to bring his voice to new material,\u201d and Megan Offtermatt, 20, from Ohio said she hopes \u201cto really gain knowledge regarding how composers/lyricists create work, what their perspective is, and how their creation of music affects the performers playing the piece.\u201d While the students are excited to perform their pieces, Gash has specific things in mind he hopes they will get out of the experience: \u201cI'd like the New Studio students to have a clearer sense of what it is to fully inhabit a song and deliver an indelible performance--unique to each of them, but also grounded in fully honoring the intentions of the composer and lyricist. I'd like the Graduate Music Theatre Writing students to feel that they've gained insight into how an actor must approach the learning and performing of material, how a song \u2018lives\u2019 off the page and in the voice, body and being of the performer.\u201d Gash said one of the goals is to build a sense of collaboration between New Studio students and Graduate Musical Theatre Writing students. \u201cSarah and I felt that we'd like to introduce our New Studio students to the unique collaborative possibilities with lyricist/librettist/composer teams, and see how they can serve and inspire their collaborators while allowing them to fully hear whatever their compositions/songs might be. We hope the Graduate Musical Theatre Writing composer-lyricist teams will capitalize on the unique possibility of having an ensemble of singing actors for whom to write, and build material that they can use to immediately give voice to ideas and further develop their work. We\u2019re also hoping that the composer/lyricist teams really get to focus on writing self-contained songs, which is a slightly different goal than a complete score. What is the art of a truly great song, and how must the singer serve that and recognize its components?\u201d The class consists of four different sections that include sixteen students from the New Studio and eight from Graduate Musical Theatre Writing. The groups will be working together through the 2011-2012 school year.
