Custom publishing was created in response to educators needs for current and relevant material to supplement or replace traditional classroom materials.      Coursepacks can contain a range of materials including: articles from journals, newspapers, or magazines; chapters from books; business cases from Harvard or other publishers; your original content or class notes; and the course syllabus.      The NYU Bookstores have partnered with XanEdu, a leading provider of customized digital and print coursepacksto deliver high quality, fully copyright cleared coursepacks.       Why Choose Custom Coursepack Publishing at NYU Bookstores?         Guaranteed 100% Copyright Compliant    Indemnification for the University and for individual Faculty Members in the event of a Copyright Infringement Claim    3 Delivery Formats: Print, Print+Digital and Digital Only    Free Desk Copy for Instructor    Pagination Services Available    Convenient for Students. Students can obtain their coursepacks along with their traditional materials and even order online for home delivery.         Coursepack Details     Length of Time to Obtain Permissions:     XanEdu has some content in its databases for which permissions are immediately cleared. HBS cases clear right away and an HBS-only coursepack can be on the shelf or delivered to students digitally in as little as 5 business days from the date you submit the request. (Digital-only HBS coursepacks can be delivered even more quickly.)      However, a coursepack can only be completed as quickly as the time it takes to receive the slowest response to a request for permission. That is, because every item in a coursepack must have use-permission granted before the coursepack can be sold, one or two slow responses by copyright holders can delay an entire coursepack.      If it is getting close to the start date for your class and there are items in your coursepack that have not cleared permissions, there are several options available to you. You may remove the item(s) from the coursepack and create a second coursepack that will be sold as a supplement or place the item(s) on reserve in the library.      Deadlines:   To assure that course materials will be available for the first day of class, the NYU Bookstores establish a deadline for materials to be turned in to us. We will gladly accept an order for a coursepack after the deadline; however, we cannot guarantee that those materials will be available for the start of classes.                   Term        Target Dates for Coursepack Materials                    Spring        First Monday in November                    Summer        First Monday in April                 Fall        First Monday in July                Royalties:   Most copyright holders charge royalties when granting permission to reproduce copyrighted materials. The cost of royalty payments varies with the content because each copyright holder determines the amount charged. We will contact you when a royalty payment for an item in your coursepack is unusually high and offer you the option of removing or replacing the item.     Desk Copies:    One free desk copy will be provided for each of the coursepacks we produce for you. You may request additional desk copies and pay for them by supplying us with a University budget number or you may distribute the cost of the additional desk copies across the cost of the students coursepacks. In classes with small enrollments, adding the cost of desk copies to the price of the student coursepacks may significantly affect that price.       Returns:      Students may return a coursepack for a full refund as long as the coursepack is unmarked and the student has proof that they have dropped the class.      Since coursepacks are customized materials, we cannot buy them back at the end of the semester as we do with textbooks.

Faculty and students familiar with the case method universally regard it as the most effective and enjoyable way to learn.

Custom publishing was created in response to educators needs for current and relevant material to supplement or replace traditional classroom materials.      Coursepacks can contain a range of materials including: articles from journals, newspapers, or magazines; chapters from books; business cases from Harvard or other publishers; your original content or class notes; and the course syllabus.      The NYU Bookstores have partnered with XanEdu, a leading provider of customized digital and print coursepacksto deliver high quality, fully copyright cleared coursepacks.       Why Choose Custom Coursepack Publishing at NYU Bookstores?         Guaranteed 100% Copyright Compliant    Indemnification for the University and for individual Faculty Members in the event of a Copyright Infringement Claim    3 Delivery Formats: Print, Print+Digital and Digital Only    Free Desk Copy for Instructor    Pagination Services Available    Convenient for Students. Students can obtain their coursepacks along with their traditional materials and even order online for home delivery.         Coursepack Details     Length of Time to Obtain Permissions:     XanEdu has some content in its databases for which permissions are immediately cleared. HBS cases clear right away and an HBS-only coursepack can be on the shelf or delivered to students digitally in as little as 5 business days from the date you submit the request. (Digital-only HBS coursepacks can be delivered even more quickly.)      However, a coursepack can only be completed as quickly as the time it takes to receive the slowest response to a request for permission. That is, because every item in a coursepack must have use-permission granted before the coursepack can be sold, one or two slow responses by copyright holders can delay an entire coursepack.      If it is getting close to the start date for your class and there are items in your coursepack that have not cleared permissions, there are several options available to you. You may remove the item(s) from the coursepack and create a second coursepack that will be sold as a supplement or place the item(s) on reserve in the library.      Deadlines:   To assure that course materials will be available for the first day of class, the NYU Bookstores establish a deadline for materials to be turned in to us. We will gladly accept an order for a coursepack after the deadline; however, we cannot guarantee that those materials will be available for the start of classes.                   Term        Target Dates for Coursepack Materials                    Spring        First Monday in November                    Summer        First Monday in April                 Fall        First Monday in July                Royalties:   Most copyright holders charge royalties when granting permission to reproduce copyrighted materials. The cost of royalty payments varies with the content because each copyright holder determines the amount charged. We will contact you when a royalty payment for an item in your coursepack is unusually high and offer you the option of removing or replacing the item.     Desk Copies:    One free desk copy will be provided for each of the coursepacks we produce for you. You may request additional desk copies and pay for them by supplying us with a University budget number or you may distribute the cost of the additional desk copies across the cost of the students coursepacks. In classes with small enrollments, adding the cost of desk copies to the price of the student coursepacks may significantly affect that price.       Returns:      Students may return a coursepack for a full refund as long as the coursepack is unmarked and the student has proof that they have dropped the class.      Since coursepacks are customized materials, we cannot buy them back at the end of the semester as we do with textbooks.

Apple Magic Mouse         (Specifications)         Product ID Number: 5406351                                 $69.00                              Wireless.                Magic Mouse with its low-profile design and seamless top shell is so sleek and dramatically different, it brings a whole new feel to the way you get around on your Mac. You cant help but marvel at its smooth, buttonless appearance. Then you touch it and instantly appreciate how good it feels in your hand. But its when you start using Magic Mouse that everything comes together.    The Multi-Touch area covers the top surface of Magic Mouse, and the mouse itself is the button. Scroll in any direction with one finger, swipe through web pages and photos with two, and click and double-click anywhere. Inside Magic Mouse is a chip that tells it exactly what you want to do. Which means Magic Mouse wont confuse a scroll with a swipe. It even knows when youre just resting your hand on it.                                               Apple Magic Trackpad         (Specifications)         Product ID Number: 1412611                                 $69.00                              Wireless.                The new Magic Trackpad is the first Multi-Touch trackpad designed to work with your Mac desktop computer. It uses the same Multi-Touch technology you love on the MacBook Pro. And it supports a full set of gestures, giving you a whole new way to control and interact with whats on your screen. Swiping through pages online feels just like flipping through pages in a book or magazine. And inertial scrolling makes moving up and down a page more natural than ever. Magic Trackpad connects to your Mac via Bluetooth wireless technology. Use it in place of a mouse or in conjunction with one on any Mac computer even a notebook.                Magic Trackpad is just like the trackpad on the MacBook Pro but bigger. Its made with the same advanced touch-friendly and wear-resistant glass surface. But with nearly 80 percent more area, its the largest Multi-Touch trackpad made by Apple. So theres even more room for you to scroll, swipe, pinch, and rotate to your fingers content. And since the entire surface is a button that clicks, you can use it in place of a mouse.

Unlike many other reusable batteries, these batteries have an incredibly long service life up to 10 years. Which means you can finally break the cycle of buying and disposing of those toxic, single-use alkaline batteries. The batteries that come with the Apple Battery Charger kit also have an extraordinarily low self-discharge rate. Even after a year of sitting in a drawer, they still retain 80 percent of their original charge. That way you always have backup power when you need it.

Custom publishing was created in response to educators needs for current and relevant material to supplement or replace traditional classroom materials.      Coursepacks can contain a range of materials including: articles from journals, newspapers, or magazines; chapters from books; business cases from Harvard or other publishers; your original content or class notes; and the course syllabus.      The NYU Bookstores have partnered with XanEdu, a leading provider of customized digital and print coursepacksto deliver high quality, fully copyright cleared coursepacks.       Why Choose Custom Coursepack Publishing at NYU Bookstores?         Guaranteed 100% Copyright Compliant    Indemnification for the University and for individual Faculty Members in the event of a Copyright Infringement Claim    3 Delivery Formats: Print, Print+Digital and Digital Only    Free Desk Copy for Instructor    Pagination Services Available    Convenient for Students. Students can obtain their coursepacks along with their traditional materials and even order online for home delivery.         Coursepack Details     Length of Time to Obtain Permissions:     XanEdu has some content in its databases for which permissions are immediately cleared. HBS cases clear right away and an HBS-only coursepack can be on the shelf or delivered to students digitally in as little as 5 business days from the date you submit the request. (Digital-only HBS coursepacks can be delivered even more quickly.)      However, a coursepack can only be completed as quickly as the time it takes to receive the slowest response to a request for permission. That is, because every item in a coursepack must have use-permission granted before the coursepack can be sold, one or two slow responses by copyright holders can delay an entire coursepack.      If it is getting close to the start date for your class and there are items in your coursepack that have not cleared permissions, there are several options available to you. You may remove the item(s) from the coursepack and create a second coursepack that will be sold as a supplement or place the item(s) on reserve in the library.      Deadlines:   To assure that course materials will be available for the first day of class, the NYU Bookstores establish a deadline for materials to be turned in to us. We will gladly accept an order for a coursepack after the deadline; however, we cannot guarantee that those materials will be available for the start of classes.                   Term        Target Dates for Coursepack Materials                    Spring        First Monday in November                    Summer        First Monday in April                 Fall        First Monday in July                Royalties:   Most copyright holders charge royalties when granting permission to reproduce copyrighted materials. The cost of royalty payments varies with the content because each copyright holder determines the amount charged. We will contact you when a royalty payment for an item in your coursepack is unusually high and offer you the option of removing or replacing the item.     Desk Copies:    One free desk copy will be provided for each of the coursepacks we produce for you. You may request additional desk copies and pay for them by supplying us with a University budget number or you may distribute the cost of the additional desk copies across the cost of the students coursepacks. In classes with small enrollments, adding the cost of desk copies to the price of the student coursepacks may significantly affect that price.       Returns:      Students may return a coursepack for a full refund as long as the coursepack is unmarked and the student has proof that they have dropped the class.      Since coursepacks are customized materials, we cannot buy them back at the end of the semester as we do with textbooks.

Custom publishing was created in response to educators needs for current and relevant material to supplement or replace traditional classroom materials.      Coursepacks can contain a range of materials including: articles from journals, newspapers, or magazines; chapters from books; business cases from Harvard or other publishers; your original content or class notes; and the course syllabus.      The NYU Bookstores have partnered with XanEdu, a leading provider of customized digital and print coursepacksto deliver high quality, fully copyright cleared coursepacks.       Why Choose Custom Coursepack Publishing at NYU Bookstores?         Guaranteed 100% Copyright Compliant    Indemnification for the University and for individual Faculty Members in the event of a Copyright Infringement Claim    3 Delivery Formats: Print, Print+Digital and Digital Only    Free Desk Copy for Instructor    Pagination Services Available    Convenient for Students. Students can obtain their coursepacks along with their traditional materials and even order online for home delivery.         Coursepack Details     Length of Time to Obtain Permissions:     XanEdu has some content in its databases for which permissions are immediately cleared. HBS cases clear right away and an HBS-only coursepack can be on the shelf or delivered to students digitally in as little as 5 business days from the date you submit the request. (Digital-only HBS coursepacks can be delivered even more quickly.)      However, a coursepack can only be completed as quickly as the time it takes to receive the slowest response to a request for permission. That is, because every item in a coursepack must have use-permission granted before the coursepack can be sold, one or two slow responses by copyright holders can delay an entire coursepack.      If it is getting close to the start date for your class and there are items in your coursepack that have not cleared permissions, there are several options available to you. You may remove the item(s) from the coursepack and create a second coursepack that will be sold as a supplement or place the item(s) on reserve in the library.      Deadlines:   To assure that course materials will be available for the first day of class, the NYU Bookstores establish a deadline for materials to be turned in to us. We will gladly accept an order for a coursepack after the deadline; however, we cannot guarantee that those materials will be available for the start of classes.                   Term        Target Dates for Coursepack Materials                    Spring        First Monday in November                    Summer        First Monday in April                 Fall        First Monday in July                Royalties:   Most copyright holders charge royalties when granting permission to reproduce copyrighted materials. The cost of royalty payments varies with the content because each copyright holder determines the amount charged. We will contact you when a royalty payment for an item in your coursepack is unusually high and offer you the option of removing or replacing the item.     Desk Copies:    One free desk copy will be provided for each of the coursepacks we produce for you. You may request additional desk copies and pay for them by supplying us with a University budget number or you may distribute the cost of the additional desk copies across the cost of the students coursepacks. In classes with small enrollments, adding the cost of desk copies to the price of the student coursepacks may significantly affect that price.       Returns:      Students may return a coursepack for a full refund as long as the coursepack is unmarked and the student has proof that they have dropped the class.      Since coursepacks are customized materials, we cannot buy them back at the end of the semester as we do with textbooks.

Apple Magic Mouse         (Specifications)         Product ID Number: 5406351                                 $69.00                              Wireless.                Magic Mouse with its low-profile design and seamless top shell is so sleek and dramatically different, it brings a whole new feel to the way you get around on your Mac. You cant help but marvel at its smooth, buttonless appearance. Then you touch it and instantly appreciate how good it feels in your hand. But its when you start using Magic Mouse that everything comes together.    The Multi-Touch area covers the top surface of Magic Mouse, and the mouse itself is the button. Scroll in any direction with one finger, swipe through web pages and photos with two, and click and double-click anywhere. Inside Magic Mouse is a chip that tells it exactly what you want to do. Which means Magic Mouse wont confuse a scroll with a swipe. It even knows when youre just resting your hand on it.                                               Apple Magic Trackpad         (Specifications)         Product ID Number: 1412611                                 $69.00                              Wireless.                The new Magic Trackpad is the first Multi-Touch trackpad designed to work with your Mac desktop computer. It uses the same Multi-Touch technology you love on the MacBook Pro. And it supports a full set of gestures, giving you a whole new way to control and interact with whats on your screen. Swiping through pages online feels just like flipping through pages in a book or magazine. And inertial scrolling makes moving up and down a page more natural than ever. Magic Trackpad connects to your Mac via Bluetooth wireless technology. Use it in place of a mouse or in conjunction with one on any Mac computer even a notebook.                Magic Trackpad is just like the trackpad on the MacBook Pro but bigger. Its made with the same advanced touch-friendly and wear-resistant glass surface. But with nearly 80 percent more area, its the largest Multi-Touch trackpad made by Apple. So theres even more room for you to scroll, swipe, pinch, and rotate to your fingers content. And since the entire surface is a button that clicks, you can use it in place of a mouse.

Unlike many other reusable batteries, these batteries have an incredibly long service life up to 10 years. Which means you can finally break the cycle of buying and disposing of those toxic, single-use alkaline batteries. The batteries that come with the Apple Battery Charger kit also have an extraordinarily low self-discharge rate. Even after a year of sitting in a drawer, they still retain 80 percent of their original charge. That way you always have backup power when you need it.
