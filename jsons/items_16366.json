The  major in Biology is an integrated yet diverse program that builds a solid  foundation in modern biology through coursework in molecular biology, cell  biology, evolution, genetics, developmental biology, physiology, immunology, genomics,  systems biology, computational biology, ecology and environmental biology. From  the very outset of their studies, students are exposed to modern concepts and  state-of-the-art experimental and analytical methods. Upper-level courses emphasize  foundational knowledge as well as laboratory skills, reasoning skills and  quantitative skills. Advanced students may register for graduate-level courses,  which are most often given in the specialized areas of faculty research.      The department also offers  a set of discrete minors in the life sciences, specifically in the areas of  molecular and cell biology, genetics, genomics and bioinformatics, and  environmental biology. Each minor is designed to hone skills in a particular  contemporary area of biology and requires a laboratory experience. The minors  permit students to create a course of study that will meet their unique  academic and career goals.      This program provides  outstanding preparation for careers in research, academia, medicine, dentistry,  and related fields. Graduates of the department have a remarkable record of  success in acceptance into professional schools and in establishing notable  careers in the biomedical sciences.      Other courses offered by  the department are designed to acquaint nonscience majors with contemporary  issues in biology. Such courses are often topical, addressing problems such as  environmental pollution, limits of the earth, and human physiology.      Outstanding and highly  motivated students are offered special opportunities for honors work,  independent study, summer laboratory research, internships, and other  enhancements. Upper-level students may become involved in research projects in  faculty laboratories through the many formal and informal opportunities  afforded by the department. The department has a tradition of important  research accomplishment and contains several specialized research and  laboratory facilities that are integrated into the educational programs. These  include undergraduate labs in molecular biology, cell biology, experimental  physiology, genomics, bioinformatics and ecological analysis. Field studies are  carried out at a variety of regional sites. Department faculty are also  affiliated with the NYU Center for Genomics  and Systems Biology ,  the NYU Center for  Developmental Genetics ,   NYU Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences , the NYU School of Medicine ,  the NYU College of Dentistry , the American Museum of  Natural History , the New York Botanical Garden , and Cold Spring Harbor  Laboratory .      Students with questions about majoring in Biology or minoring in  a specific area of biology should visit the office of the Department of  Biology. Those declaring a major in Biology are assigned a faculty adviser from  the department; students meet with that professor to design a program of study,  determine course selections, and discuss career goals. The faculty adviser is  also available to provide guidance concerning the many options and  opportunities afforded by the department for curricular enhancement, including  research experiences.      Major (Bachelor of Arts)      The Department offers two tracks. The standard biology  track provides the major with a broad background in biology with the  laboratory, quantitative and reasoning skills needed for today\u2019s modern  biology. The ecology track also provides students with the broad background in  modern biology, but with a focus on ecological concepts, approaches and  analytical methods.      In addition, students may pursue a major in Global Public  Health/Science, with a concentration in Biology (see below).      The following sixteen courses (typically 70 points) completed  with grades of C or higher (and a minimum GPA of 2.0 for all courses required  by and taken as electives in the major) are required for the major.      To permit the maximal choice of appropriate upper-level  courses, we strongly recommend that students take Principles of Biology I and   II (BIOL-UA 11, 12), General Chemistry I and II and Laboratories   (CHEM-UA 125, 126), and mathematics in their freshman year. Then as sophomores,  students in the standard track should take Molecular and Cell Biology   (BIOL-UA 21, 22), whereas students in the ecology track should take Fundamentals  of Ecology (BIOL-UA 63).      Programs of majors must be approved each term by a department  adviser.

The  major in Biology is an integrated yet diverse program that builds a solid  foundation in modern biology through coursework in molecular biology, cell  biology, evolution, genetics, developmental biology, physiology, immunology, genomics,  systems biology, computational biology, ecology and environmental biology. From  the very outset of their studies, students are exposed to modern concepts and  state-of-the-art experimental and analytical methods. Upper-level courses emphasize  foundational knowledge as well as laboratory skills, reasoning skills and  quantitative skills. Advanced students may register for graduate-level courses,  which are most often given in the specialized areas of faculty research.      The department also offers  a set of discrete minors in the life sciences, specifically in the areas of  molecular and cell biology, genetics, genomics and bioinformatics, and  environmental biology. Each minor is designed to hone skills in a particular  contemporary area of biology and requires a laboratory experience. The minors  permit students to create a course of study that will meet their unique  academic and career goals.      This program provides  outstanding preparation for careers in research, academia, medicine, dentistry,  and related fields. Graduates of the department have a remarkable record of  success in acceptance into professional schools and in establishing notable  careers in the biomedical sciences.      Other courses offered by  the department are designed to acquaint nonscience majors with contemporary  issues in biology. Such courses are often topical, addressing problems such as  environmental pollution, limits of the earth, and human physiology.      Outstanding and highly  motivated students are offered special opportunities for honors work,  independent study, summer laboratory research, internships, and other  enhancements. Upper-level students may become involved in research projects in  faculty laboratories through the many formal and informal opportunities  afforded by the department. The department has a tradition of important  research accomplishment and contains several specialized research and  laboratory facilities that are integrated into the educational programs. These  include undergraduate labs in molecular biology, cell biology, experimental  physiology, genomics, bioinformatics and ecological analysis. Field studies are  carried out at a variety of regional sites. Department faculty are also  affiliated with the NYU Center for Genomics  and Systems Biology ,  the NYU Center for  Developmental Genetics ,   NYU Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences , the NYU School of Medicine ,  the NYU College of Dentistry , the American Museum of  Natural History , the New York Botanical Garden , and Cold Spring Harbor  Laboratory .      Students with questions about majoring in Biology or minoring in  a specific area of biology should visit the office of the Department of  Biology. Those declaring a major in Biology are assigned a faculty adviser from  the department; students meet with that professor to design a program of study,  determine course selections, and discuss career goals. The faculty adviser is  also available to provide guidance concerning the many options and  opportunities afforded by the department for curricular enhancement, including  research experiences.      Major (Bachelor of Arts)      The Department offers two tracks. The standard biology  track provides the major with a broad background in biology with the  laboratory, quantitative and reasoning skills needed for today\u2019s modern  biology. The ecology track also provides students with the broad background in  modern biology, but with a focus on ecological concepts, approaches and  analytical methods.      In addition, students may pursue a major in Global Public  Health/Science, with a concentration in Biology (see below).      The following sixteen courses (typically 70 points) completed  with grades of C or higher (and a minimum GPA of 2.0 for all courses required  by and taken as electives in the major) are required for the major.      To permit the maximal choice of appropriate upper-level  courses, we strongly recommend that students take Principles of Biology I and   II (BIOL-UA 11, 12), General Chemistry I and II and Laboratories   (CHEM-UA 125, 126), and mathematics in their freshman year. Then as sophomores,  students in the standard track should take Molecular and Cell Biology   (BIOL-UA 21, 22), whereas students in the ecology track should take Fundamentals  of Ecology (BIOL-UA 63).      Programs of majors must be approved each term by a department  adviser.
