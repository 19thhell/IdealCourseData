Genomics and Systems Biology are rapidly emerging fields, in which   sub-disciplines are only beginning to be defined. Genomic science is   founded in the analysis of genomic sequences and their molecular products.   Starting from the complete genomic sequences of one or more species,   functional and evolutionary genomics studies use high-throughput   experimental and integrative computational approaches -- such as   large-scale RNA and protein expression profiling, forward and reverse   genetics, and cross-species comparisons -- to define the functions of genes   and the structures of genetic networks, and how these change during   development, in disease, and between organisms. Systems Biology approaches   integrate different types of genome-scale data to develop predictive models   for gene networks that can be used to derive testable hypotheses about the   emergent properties, functions, and dynamics of organismal systems.        Faculty apply all of these approaches to investigate the structure,   function, and evolution of biological networks in a broad range of   experimental systems spanning bacteria, invertebrates, vertebrates,   mammals, and plants.
