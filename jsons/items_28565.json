Some more info on the chain reaction&#8230;                           When we run the chain reactions, we will want to run them a couple times, hopefully out in the common space of the 4th floor, then probably separate them into individual parts and run them again back\u00a0 in the class room, and talk about them. We would love to see your process when we talk about your Machines. Before you make your final parts you are probably going to do some simple prototypes to show yourself that it will take the alotted time, or knock over the next part, so show us how you tested/prototyped that part.   So, a couple points to emphasize that we didnt in class:  Document your chain reaction. We will ask you to put up pictures or sketches showing how you tested your theories of your machines, or prototyped out your parts. Take pictures, make sketches, put em out when we talk about your Machine. I suppose if you all document the stuff on your individual blogs/sites, we could pull those up during discussion, rather than printing out a bunch of stuff, if you prefer.   Make your Machine re-settable. If it absolutely has to explode in an enormous fireball, then bring spare parts to do it again a couple times, but ideally this is a machine you can re-set, re-use.

The Beginning Engineers&#8217; Checklist and Akin&#8217;s Laws                           Hey folks,   These lists are incredible practical, insightful, and kind of funny. Please read them and come prepared to discuss them in class next week.\u00a0 Be able to share at least one example of how you applied some of this advice to the mousetrap/chain reaction assignment!   http://makezine.com/2011/03/30/the-beginning-mechanical-engineers-checklist/   and   http://spacecraft.ssl.umd.edu/akins_laws.html                    This entry was posted in Uncategorized on February 6, 2015 by Stephan von Muehlen .                                             Hello folks                           We are thrilled you have decided to take our class. As you can probably tell by now, your instructors like to make physical &#8220;stuff&#8221; and we will probably keep this site pretty bare-bones. That said, you can find the basic stuff here\u2013course description, schedule, homework. Who knows, maybe as the class develops, we will get fancy and add more content.   See you on Friday!   \u2013Stephan and Pete                  This entry was posted in Uncategorized on February 3, 2015 by Stephan von Muehlen .
