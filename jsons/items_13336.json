G90.1001 \u2013 Theories and Methods in the Study of Religion (TBA)  Wednesday; 3:30pm\u2013 6:10pm Students explore fundamental theoretical and methodological issues for the academic study of religion, including some of the more important theories of the origin, character, and function of religion as a human phenomenon. Students cover psychological, sociological, anthropological, dialectical, post-colonial and feminist approaches, as well as some problems for the study of religion today: secularization theory and the intersection of religion and media. Same as G14.3395                           xG90.1005 \u2013 Problems and Methods in Hebrew and Judaic Studies (Engel) Tuesday; 4:55pm - 7:35pm This course introduces students to the field of Hebrew and Judaic studies, in its disciplinary, chronological, and geographicdiversity. Contemporary issues and innovative approaches in the various areas of Hebrew and Judaic studies are also explored. This course is sponsored by the Department of Hebrew &amp; Judaic Studies .                      xG90.1224 \u2013 The Jewish Community: Classical Institutions (Chazan) Monday; 4:55pm\u2013 7:35pm Over the ages, Jews have developed a wide range of frameworks for governing themselves. These frameworks range from \u201cnormal\u201d and independent polities to semi-dependent satellite polities to dependent but potently grounded self-governing communities to utterly voluntaristic associations. This course will survey the wide range of arrangements through which Jews have sought to structure their corporate lives. For each of the Jewish communities discussed, we shall examine to the extent possible: the central Jewish authorities; localized authorities; alternative centers of power; evidence of consensus; and evidence of dissent. This course is sponsored by the Department of Hebrew &amp; Judaic Studies .       G90.1409 \u2013 Mystical Elements of 20C Jewish Philosophy (Wolfson)       G90.2467 \u2013 Topics: Religion in and Of the Marketplace  Tuesday; 10:30am \u2013 1:15pm  How do religious practices and beliefs respond to economic logics and  behaviors? Conversely, does capitalism,  with its logic of commodification, articulate and presuppose a \u2018religious\u2019  relationship between consumers and goods?    Finally, how do the social formations of religion respond to the demands  and opportunities of the marketplace?    \u201cReligion in and for the Marketplace,\u201d this year\u2019s Masters\u2019 Seminar in  Religious Studies, broadly addresses this set of questions with reference to three  sets of readings. We begin the semester  with a review of classic texts on religion, capitalism, and theories of value  more generally. Through a consideration  of works by Weber, Marx &amp; Engels, and Simmel, among others, we will  establish a common vocabulary for comprehending the complex relationships  between religion and capitalism.    Following this general discussion, we will examine contemporary theories  of religion and economic behavior. In  this context, we will conduct a critical readi       ng of the sociology of religion forwarded by Rodney Stark and William  Bainbridge, which attempts to comprehend all religious activity through a free  market model. Finally, the most  substantial section of the course will be devoted to specific studies of  economic and religious practice in diverse contexts, including Turkey (Cihan  Tugal\u2019s Passive Revolution), India (Peter Van der Veer\u2019s Gods on Earth), the  United States (Susan Harding\u2019s The Book of Jerry Falwell) and Indonesia (Webb  Keane\u2019s Christian Moderns).  Over the  course of the semester, students will be expected to develop a research project  and paper based on the general themes of the class. At the end of the semester, all class members  will present the results of their research for the class\u2019 consideration.
