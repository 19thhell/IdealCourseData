Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) Scores   TOEFL scores are required for applicants who did not complete an undergraduate degree in the United States or in a country where the only primary language is English.           Minimum scores are 100 on the Internet-based test, 250 on the computer-based test, or 600 on the paper-based test.   IELTS can be submitted in place of the TOEFL; the recommended minimum score is a 7.0.           English Language Assessment   In addition to taking the TOEFL and regardless of their TOEFL score, international applicants are required to participate in an English language assessment consisting of an online test and an interview administered by the NYU School of Professional Studies American Language Institute (ALI). Participation in this assessment will result in the determination of your English Proficiency Level (EPL), which will be reported to the Office of Admissions. International applicants must have submitted an application in order to register for the English language assessment; the fee to register for the assessment is $150.     Based upon your score on the ALI Placement Test, one of four possible outcomes will occur:     You will satisfy the NYU School of Professional Studies English Proficiency Level requirement and will qualify to register for full-time degree study.   You will be conditionally admitted and you will be permitted to enroll in part-time degree coursework as you complete the required ALI English language support courses.   You will be conditionally admitted and you will be required to take English language courses with ALI full-time (for up to one full year) until you are fluent enough to begin degree study.   You will not meet the minimum EPL or the School's other admissions criteria and you will be required to reapply at a later date.     Please review the ALI Online Test Procedures for information on how to register for the test.           Please Note : The NYU School of Professional Studies reserves the right to request a TOEFL, IELTS, or English language assessment conducted by ALI from a U.S. citizen or permanent resident if their primary language is not English.

We use this approach to evaluate your ability to benefit from and contribute to the dynamic learning environment and the challenging curriculum that the School offers.   The following criteria will help you to better understand the admissions process and the types of information that are required to be submitted to the Office of Admissions in addition to your completed online application.         Personal Statement   Evaluated for evidence of an applicant\u2019s motivation for admission and fit for the program. Key indicators include:     Demonstrable progress in your academic and/or professional career   Clearly articulated goals and objectives that align with the mission of the program             R\u00e9sum\u00e9   Evaluated for experience and skills, which would allow for academic and professional success. We consider the following when assessing your field-related experience:     Professional experience\u2014either full-time or part-time job in the industry or relevant internship(s)   Career changers also are evaluated for the transferrable skills they have developed in their current profession   Public service engagements   Professional associations/affiliations               Standardized Tests   Specifically the GRE or GMAT , are not required upon submission of your application. However, submission of these test scores:     Is optional should you wish to provide further evidence of academic potential.   May be required for a thorough evaluation. The Admissions Committee therefore reserves the right to request a test score.     Note: Successful candidates have met the recommended combined score of 310 or 1100 on the GRE or 550 on the GMAT.         Recommendations (two letters)   Evaluated for evidence of potential success during your course of study at the NYU School of Professional Studies and after graduation. Key indicators include:     Professional achievements   Contributions made on the job   Skills developed and knowledge acquired on the job as well as challenge areas   Professional and/or academic recommendations             Academic Background   Evaluated by reviewing your transcripts from all prior colleges and universities attended.  Performance in relevant course work is evaluated as well as achievement levels in your academic career.   Note: Successful candidates normally meet the recommended 3.0 or higher cumulative GPA.           Interviews   Are not required. However, the Admissions Committee may request an interview after reviewing your application. If you are invited for an interview, it will then be a required component of the application process.     Application Fee   Of $150 must be included with your application. The fee for an online application can only be paid by major credit card.            International Students   International applicants greatly enrich our community and are encouraged to apply. Additional criteria for international students include:   Evaluation of Foreign Educational Credentials   If requested by the Office of Admissions, each foreign transcript must also be evaluated for equivalency to the U.S. educational system for admission and transfer credit purposes. Evaluations are acceptable only from evaluation services recognized by the National Association of Credential Evaluation Services . Please request a course-by-course evaluation.         Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) Scores   TOEFL scores are required for applicants who did not complete an undergraduate degree in the United States or in a country where the only primary language is English.           Minimum scores are 100 on the Internet-based test, 250 on the computer-based test, or 600 on the paper-based test.   IELTS can be submitted in place of the TOEFL; the recommended minimum score is a 7.0.           English Language Assessment   In addition to taking the TOEFL and regardless of their TOEFL score, international applicants are required to participate in an English language assessment consisting of an online test and an interview administered by the NYU School of Professional Studies American Language Institute (ALI). Participation in this assessment will result in the determination of your English Proficiency Level (EPL), which will be reported to the Office of Admissions. International applicants must have submitted an application in order to register for the English language assessment; the fee to register for the assessment is $150.     Based upon your score on the ALI Placement Test, one of four possible outcomes will occur:     You will satisfy the NYU School of Professional Studies English Proficiency Level requirement and will qualify to register for full-time degree study.   You will be conditionally admitted and you will be permitted to enroll in part-time degree coursework as you complete the required ALI English language support courses.   You will be conditionally admitted and you will be required to take English language courses with ALI full-time (for up to one full year) until you are fluent enough to begin degree study.   You will not meet the minimum EPL or the School's other admissions criteria and you will be required to reapply at a later date.     Please review the ALI Online Test Procedures for information on how to register for the test.           Please Note : The NYU School of Professional Studies reserves the right to request a TOEFL, IELTS, or English language assessment conducted by ALI from a U.S. citizen or permanent resident if their primary language is not English.

However, we want to bring attention to Steinhardt\u2019s deliberate and conscientious effort to assess our programs and make the results transparent.\u201d   Steinhardt\u2019s comprehensive site, \u201c Teacher Education at Steinhardt ,\u201d offers a broad inventory of the school\u2019s teacher education programming and assessment practices. It contains course syllabi, professors\u2019 biographies, candidate quality data, analyses of graduates\u2019 teaching, assessments of graduates\u2019 K-12 pupils\u2019 learning, testimonials, graduates\u2019 surveys, and an in depth look at Steinhardt\u2019s outcome data showing its effectiveness in training teachers.   \u201cWe all need to know that teacher education programs are producing excellent teachers before they assume responsibility for a classroom,\u201d said Brabeck. \u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s what we are doing and we want the public to see how we are doing it at Steinhardt.\u201d   The issue of how to train students to become effective teachers, and evaluating programs that do this work, is an ongoing debate within the education community. Organizations like the\u00a0 National Council for Teacher Quality (NCTQ), the\u00a0 Teacher Education Accreditation Council (TEAC), the\u00a0 National Council for the Accreditation of Teacher Education (NCATE),\u00a0 the Interstate New Teacher Assessment and Support Consortium (InTASC), and the soon-to-be Commission for Accreditation of Educator Preparation (CAEP) continue to focus their efforts on tackling the issue; each organization is taking a different approach.   NCTQ and\u00a0 U.S. News and World Report are slated to release\u00a0rankings of teacher education programs throughout the country. However, NCTQ\u2019s methodology raises concerns about the meaning of the rankings.   \u201cWe don\u2019t agree with NCTQ\u2019s approach because we believe that teacher education is a dynamic and developmental process that can\u2019t be judged simply based on syllabi and textbooks,\u201d Brabeck said.   In a memo to\u00a0 U.S News Editor Brian Kelly and NCTQ President Kate Walsh, titled, \u201cNCTQ Standards: Identifying the Methodology,\u201d Dean Brabeck, in conjunction with 35 chief academic officers from the education schools of the\u00a0Association of American Universities (AAU), expressed concerns relating to the process of the evaluation. Letters from the\u00a0Council of Great City Schools and\u00a0 Chancellors of the California State University System, the University System of Maryland, and the State University System of New York also raised concerns about NCTQ\u2019s data collection process.   \u201cWe applaud all efforts to turn attention to improving teacher education.&#8221; said\u00a0 Susan Neuman , former U.S. Assistant Secretary for Elementary and Secondary Education and chair of\u00a0 Steinhardt\u2019s Department of Teaching and Learning . \u201cBut\u00a0we take our commitment too seriously to have our efforts evaluated in a simplistic way. We hope our transparency will encourage other programs to stand by their work. We are eager to\u00a0collaborate on how to develop a reliable methodology for evaluation of all teacher education programs.\u201d                                          Posted by Courtney Bowe on June 10, 2013 2:32 pm   | Permalink |   Comments                                       &larr; Gerald Voelbel of Occupational Therapy Department Builds a Case for Brain Mapping        Teaching and Learning Fellowship Students Share Best Practices with Teachers &rarr;                                                      Search At a Glance                                             Follow NYU Steinhardt         Enter your email address now and get news delivered right to your inbox.
