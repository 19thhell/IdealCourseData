Wagner Graduate School of Public Service at New York University (NYU Wagner). \u00a0SNEAC was formed in 2003 to promote discourse on cultural policy and arts management within NYU Wagner, as well as more broadly throughout NYU and across New York City communities.   NYU Wagner promotes learning in public and nonprofit settings across management, finance, policy, urban planning, health, and international affairs. SNEAC provides a bridge between these disciplines and both the local and national arts and cultural sector. Arts and culture are critical to a forward thinking society, and SNEAC aims to raise their importance and effectiveness within public policy and administration.   SNEAC promotes professional development and leadership within various cultural industries including, but not limited to, visual and performing arts, fashion and design, digital media, arts-in-education, community arts/culture, and philanthropy and the arts.   SNEAC engenders conversation on current trends and practices in arts management and cultural policy through discussion panels, career events, brown bag discussions, volunteering, institutional tours, and networking events. To date, themes and topics have explored the intersection of cultural policy with other policy fields; arts management issues; economic impact of the arts; social entrepreneurship; international cultural exchange; and arts and urban revitalization.   In April 2005, SNEAC received the NYU Presidential Service Award for programming.
