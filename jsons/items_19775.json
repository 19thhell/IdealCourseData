De Leon was elevated to IEEE Fellow for his contributions to transformer modeling for electromagnetic transient studies. His research helps ensure that electric-utility equipment is designed to be reliable and resistant to damage from lightning strikes and switching hazards. A devoted teacher as well as researcher, he has led a team of students to perform the transient analysis of the smart-grid technologies implemented by New York City&rsquo;s Con Edison, and also directed a comprehensive study on conservation of energy based on voltage reduction for the company. The widely cited author of more than 100 scholarly papers, De Leon holds several patents and is also an editor of the IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery and editor/coordinator of the IEEE Power Engineering Letters .      Francisco De Leon     Pillai was elevated to Fellow in recognition of his contributions to adaptive signal processing and radar systems&mdash;areas of importance in both military and civilian arenas. Adaptation is the key, he has explained, for anyone needing to transmit a signal because noise and other interference must be taken into account. He cites as an example the trouble that the spinning blades of wind turbines can cause for air traffic controllers. He is recipient of numerous grants from the Office of Naval Research, and points out that with the ever-increasing appetite for extra bandwidth from the wireless world, it is becoming important for the military to transmit signals used for both radar and communications in a bandwidth-efficient manner in time and space, so that, one day, unused bandwidth resources can be diverted to other opportunities. Within the classroom, he has started using short video sessions to complement his lectures, a system wherein students can go back and review source material or view lectures and work out problems before and after class sessions. Pillai has authored and coauthored five textbooks and monographs related to electrical engineering and credits his mentor, NYU School of Engineering Presidential Fellow and Professor Emeritus Dante Youla, for most of his professional success.   The IEEE grade of Fellow is conferred by the organization&rsquo;s Board of Directors upon members with extraordinary records of accomplishments in any of the IEEE fields. The total number selected in any one year never exceeds one-tenth of one percent of the total voting membership.   NYU Dean of Engineering Katepalli R. Sreenivasan said, &ldquo;The election of Francisco De Leon and Unnikrishna Pillai as Fellows of the esteemed IEEE confirms what I have long known&mdash;that our Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering has some of the finest, most accomplished faculty members in the nation. Their staunch commitment to both solving real-world problems and educating the next generation of electrical engineers is everything one could hope for in a professor of engineering, and I congratulate them upon receiving this well-deserved recognition.&rdquo;                                       News    Posted April 27th, 2015  Inno/Vention Demo Day: Learning by Demonstrating  As Attacks Multiply, AIG CEO Hancock Calls for Stronger Cyber Insurance Posted April 9th, 2015  The Jacobs Women: Helping Build a Legacy Posted March 26th, 2015  New Faculty, New Breakthroughs Posted March 19th, 2015        Cable   News from Cable alumni magazine.

De Leon was elevated to IEEE Fellow for his contributions to transformer modeling for electromagnetic transient studies. His research helps ensure that electric-utility equipment is designed to be reliable and resistant to damage from lightning strikes and switching hazards. A devoted teacher as well as researcher, he has led a team of students to perform the transient analysis of the smart-grid technologies implemented by New York City&rsquo;s Con Edison, and also directed a comprehensive study on conservation of energy based on voltage reduction for the company. The widely cited author of more than 100 scholarly papers, De Leon holds several patents and is also an editor of the IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery and editor/coordinator of the IEEE Power Engineering Letters .      Francisco De Leon     Pillai was elevated to Fellow in recognition of his contributions to adaptive signal processing and radar systems&mdash;areas of importance in both military and civilian arenas. Adaptation is the key, he has explained, for anyone needing to transmit a signal because noise and other interference must be taken into account. He cites as an example the trouble that the spinning blades of wind turbines can cause for air traffic controllers. He is recipient of numerous grants from the Office of Naval Research, and points out that with the ever-increasing appetite for extra bandwidth from the wireless world, it is becoming important for the military to transmit signals used for both radar and communications in a bandwidth-efficient manner in time and space, so that, one day, unused bandwidth resources can be diverted to other opportunities. Within the classroom, he has started using short video sessions to complement his lectures, a system wherein students can go back and review source material or view lectures and work out problems before and after class sessions. Pillai has authored and coauthored five textbooks and monographs related to electrical engineering and credits his mentor, NYU School of Engineering Presidential Fellow and Professor Emeritus Dante Youla, for most of his professional success.   The IEEE grade of Fellow is conferred by the organization&rsquo;s Board of Directors upon members with extraordinary records of accomplishments in any of the IEEE fields. The total number selected in any one year never exceeds one-tenth of one percent of the total voting membership.   NYU Dean of Engineering Katepalli R. Sreenivasan said, &ldquo;The election of Francisco De Leon and Unnikrishna Pillai as Fellows of the esteemed IEEE confirms what I have long known&mdash;that our Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering has some of the finest, most accomplished faculty members in the nation. Their staunch commitment to both solving real-world problems and educating the next generation of electrical engineers is everything one could hope for in a professor of engineering, and I congratulate them upon receiving this well-deserved recognition.&rdquo;                                       News    Posted April 27th, 2015  Inno/Vention Demo Day: Learning by Demonstrating  As Attacks Multiply, AIG CEO Hancock Calls for Stronger Cyber Insurance Posted April 9th, 2015  The Jacobs Women: Helping Build a Legacy Posted March 26th, 2015  New Faculty, New Breakthroughs Posted March 19th, 2015        Cable   News from Cable alumni magazine.

Weinert, who studied dance at the School of American Ballet, Vassar, and Julliard before joining Gallatin, put his social and aesthetic theories into practice this summer by staging his Gallatin thesis project, \u201cThe Reaccession of Ted Shawn\u201d at the Museum of Modern Art.   Shawn was a pioneering modernist choreographer who donated films of his works to the museum in the 1940s, and the museum officially deaccessioned, or removed, the works, from their holdings in the 1960s. In 2013, Weinert was invited to reconstruct and perform the early solos of Shawn at the museum as part of the exhibit \u201c20 Dancers of the XXth Century.\u201d Weinert\u2019s performances of Shawn\u2019s work were recorded. To stage his thesis, he used a mobile app, the Dance-Tech Augmented Reality app, which recognizes specific areas and landmarks within the museum and activates video of Weinert\u2019s performances and archival footage on viewer\u2019s smartphones or tablets. The installation began on August 5, 2014, and will be on view indefinitely.   \u201cI wanted to upset some conventionally held beliefs about art,\u201d Weinert says, \u201cby turning an ethereal art form, dance, into an installation, and to point out ways in which the museum is malleable.\u201d                               Type:    Article       top of page                                  NYU Gallatin Footer              Gallatin School of Individualized Study     1 Washington Place     New York, NY 10003     (212) 998-7370                   A&#8211;Z Index      Directions      Contact Us      Job Opportunities               News      Support Gallatin      Feedback                         Follow us on Facebook      Follow us on Twitter      Follow us on Youtube         Follow us Instagram                 Unless otherwise noted, all content copyright NYU Gallatin.
