M. Forster\u2014have found literary inspiration. Students participate in daily workshops and craft seminars and attend a lively series of readings, lectures, and special events. Writing and reading assignments are designed to encourage serious study as well as immersion in the local landscape\u2014for example, students might visit the Galleria degli Uffizi and write ekphrastic poems, conduct literary research in Villa la Pietra's library, or take an afternoon trip to Fiesole, a memorable locale in E.M. Forster's &quot;Room with a View,&quot; for a lesson on fictional settings. On weekends, students have the opportunity to follow in the footsteps of their literary predecessors: they might walk along the Arno River, view the sunset from Piazzale Michelangelo, or stroll through the Boboli gardens.            ACADEMICS      Writers in Florence students focus on either poetry or fiction. Coursework consists of alternating afternoons of craft seminars and writing workshops, as well as daily literary colloquia events, including readings, lectures and tours. The schedule includes time for writing, reading, and exploring Florence, and the program culminates in a celebratory reading showcasing student work.   Students have the opportunity to work closely with two accomplished faculty members\u2014one in the context of the writing workshop, and another in the context of the craft seminar.

Writing and reading assignments are designed to encourage serious study as well as immersion in the local landscape\u2014for example, students might visit the Galleria degli Uffizi and write ekphrastic poems, conduct literary research in Villa la Pietra's library, or take an afternoon trip to Fiesole, a memorable locale in E.M.
