Professor Melissa Rachleff Burtt has been awarded a prestigious Faculty Fellowship at the Humanities Initiative for 2013-2014 in support of her research project , &ldquo; Inventing Downtown .&rdquo; &ldquo; Inventing Downtown: Artist-Run Galleries in New York City, 1950-1965 , &ldquo; is conceived of as an exhibition and book project in collaboration with NYU&rsquo;s Grey Art Gallery, where it will be exhibited in 2016. The exhibition challenges conventional thinking about familiar art historical categories and uses artist-run galleries from the 1950&rsquo;s and 1960&rsquo;s as the core point of reference. Inventing Downtown will also examine the growth of the Lower East Side as an artists&rsquo; neighborhood within a working class Puerto Rican and Eastern European enclave. On April 25, 2013, Professor Rachleff Burtt presented a talk &ldquo;Rethinking Art Administration: A Case Study Partnership between NYU &amp; the Bronx Museum of the Arts&rdquo; which re-situated art administration within a critical dialogue about race, ethnicity, and conceptual practices. The presentation content was based on theories from anthropology, sociology, museum education, and art history as well as original research and studies conducted by both Rachleff Burtt and graduate student Yoi Tanaka Gayler. The goal of the research was an exhibition proposal that was useful to the local Bronx community &ndash; a public school audience was ultimately selected - and the Bronx Museum&rsquo;s permanent collection was utilized.
