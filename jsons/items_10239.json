Space is limited. Please RSVP to (212) 998-IAAA (4222) This program is supported by Institute of French Studies-NYU, The Skirball Department of Hebrew and Judaic Studies-NYU, and The Taub Center for Israel Studies-NYU In her book, Causes Communes: des Juifs et des Noirs , Nicole Lapierre vigorously advocates empathy, recommends  convergence over competition, and solidarity over rivalry. She traces how, in  the twentieth century, the intertwined relationship between Blacks and Jews  emerged from ideals of freedom, equality and dignity. She takes her examples  from different countries and contexts, from New York to Warsaw, from  Mississippi to Uzbekistan, Lithuania to South Africa, and Harlem to Paris, via  the West Indies. She reminds us how the Black experience was re-examined  through the prism of Jewish experience, and vice versa, by individual men and  women of conscience who found the oppression and humiliation of others  unconscionable. For mystical, progressive, conceptual or sentimental reasons,  these outstanding individuals refused to be consigned to their ethnic  pigeonholes. Among them were political leaders, philosophers, writers, poets,  musicians and unknown men and women.      The premise of this research is resolutely rooted in the  opposite camp of the tendency towards \u201ccompeting victims\u201d which is to divide  two equally struggling communities. The tensions that sometimes set these  communities against each other involve all of society: they are primarily the  result of social inequality and of the level of recognition that history grants  to discriminated, oppressed or persecuted people, whoever they may be. This program  will have the opportunity to recall these \"common causes,\" discuss  and examine how these examples drawn from the past may serve as beacons for the  present.      PARTICIPANTS: Nicole Lapierre is director of research at the French National Center for Scientific Research, and professor of socio-anthropology at \u00c9cole des Hautes \u00c9tudes en Sciences Sociales (EHESS). Walter Mosley is the author of more than 37 critically acclaimed books. In his most recent, Twelve Steps to Political Revelation , Mosley outlines a guide to recovery from oppression. David Levering Lewis is Julius Silver University Professor at New York University. Each volume of his two-volume W. E. B. Du Bois biography won the Pulitzer Prize. He is also the author of eight books.                 Contact Us | &copy; New York University , Arts and Science"}]}]
