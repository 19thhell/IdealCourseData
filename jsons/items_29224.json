Prerequisites Film/TV Majors: Sight and Sound Documentary (FMTV-UT 80) and one more Sight and Sound of your choice NYU and Visiting students: Fundamentals of Digital Filmmaking (OART-UT 560) or college level experience in film production/permission of Special Programs. Please note: one college-level Spanish class is highly recommended in advance of the semester for all students Program Curriculum Documentary Video Production (Core) IFMTV-UT 1959 4 units | Melissa Hacker, Instructor This documentary video production course, offered in collaboration with the Cuban National Institute of Film and Television (ICAIC), takes students through all the crucial steps from the development of ideas and research through editing and post-production. Students work in crews of four, learning the basic principles of computer operations, logging systems, and on- and off-line editing. Each student completes a \ufb01nal work for a rough-cut screening at the end of the semester. Students are encouraged to research and connect with aspects of Cuban culture and life that are not often seen in mainstream cinema. All projects will be reviewed by a panel of critics comprised of Cuban filmmakers, artists and faculty. Although documentary production is the primary focus, screenings of Cuban narrative documentaries, workshops, master classes, and class discussions explore various aspects of documentary practice and Cuban cinema. Companion Courses Students earn 12-14 units from the following required courses: Arts and Culture of Cuba IOART-UT 961 4 units Instructor: Ludwig Foundation This course provides a multifaceted understanding of Cuban history, culture, and arts from the period of Spanish colonialism, through the wars of independence and the Revolution, and into the \u201cSpecial Period\u201d of the 1990s following the collapse of the Soviet Union. It examines the many political and cultural transformations and, consequently, how the country\u2019s artistic legacy manifests the spirit of an era through literature, photography, music, dance, theatre, and visual arts. In addition to class discussions and readings, students interact with the country\u2019s leading artists, writers, and performers. Students also attend lectures, performances, and exhibitions at the Ludwig Foundation, ICAIC, and the National Theatre of Cuba. Introductory Spanish IOART-UT 1959 6 units Instructor: University of Havana Designed for beginners who need to acquire the basic language skills for functional and practical pro\ufb01ciency, the course introduces pronunciation, vocabulary, useful expressions, and fundamental grammar that allow communication and provide opportunities for expanding the range of one\u2019s conversational ability. Note: More advanced Spanish courses (IOART-UT 1960 or IOART-UT 1964) are available to students based on the results of a placement exam administered by the University of Havana. The Cuban Image: 1959-Present IOART-UT 971 4 units Instructor: Ludwig Foundation This course will use a wide cinematographic selection, the direct contact with visual artists and filmmakers, and the specialized bibliography and \u201clife histories\u201d of some of the protagonists, to study the cultural history and the main problems in the last fifty years of Cuban society. A special emphasis will be placed on the cultural relationships between Cuba and the United States of America since the very beginning of the 20th century; as well as those from Europe and the so-called Third World Countries. Students will discuss the cultural processes and the artistic samples from different multiple perspectives such as race, marginality and social exclusion, the remarkable role of artists and intellectuals, and the cultural, gender and sexual identities. The course will also analyze the Cuban model: the governmental support for culture. The course will explore the shaping of new cultural processes that conditioned iconographic and any other artistic creations, their evolution and the way they were experienced by individuals. The students will have to forge their own criteria taking in consideration the different perspectives of the available sources. Throughout the course there will be a \u201ccrescendo\u201d on this viewpoint to provide a critical and multifaceted approach to contemporary Cuban reality, revealing the modifications on individuals and groups through time. Thinking about the special nature of the consensus in the Cuban society students will face the transit of the \u201cillusion of homogenization\u201d that was generally accepted for more than forty years to the current \u201ckaleidoscopic\u201d society. The collective subject became invisible; the different individuals didn\u2019t speak the same language anymore and couldn\u2019t recognize their own reflection on an imaginary mirror. Therefore the possibilities to establish a new social consensus seem to be a utopian dream. Having a daily life almost immersed in the actual Cuban conditions the students will be in the privileged position of being able to understand the present crossroads of the Cuban society, its new contradictions and possible future paths. All the students shall watch a minimum number of films, and reading the specialized bibliography will be mandatory. Students will work in teams and individually, and have to produce at least one written essay or an audiovisual material about any of the aspects included in the syllabus. Course includes artists and intellectuals as guest lecturers.
