A significant element of the course is protocol architecture and design. We will use the Internet and its major protocols (IP and TCP) as the basis for our studies. The student will become very familiar with the concept of protocol layers and packet formats. We will look closely at how TCP handles the problems of flow control and congestion control as well as how routing algorithms and protocols work to deliver packets from end to end.    We will use a packet sniffer to help us visualize the concept of layering. Packet sniffers are tools that allow us to see frame and packet data as it flows into and out of a computer system. We will use the Ethereal Packet Sniffer to study examples of LAN and WAN protocols.    Homework will consist of some assignments based on lectures and readings in the course text, packet analysis using Ethereal, and some small programming assignments. The programming assignments show you how to use sockets in UDP and TCP and will introduce you to the use of finite state machines in protocol design. A final project will require the student to develop a program of modest size (about 1000 -1500 lines of code) to implement one or more of the protocols and/or algorithms we will study.    Although I prefer that students write their programming assignments using JAVA, I will try, where possible, to allow development in either JAVA or C.    Topics we will cover are:           Fundamental Data Structures: queues, ring buffers, finite state machines          Data Encoding and Transmission          Local Area Networks and Data Link Control          Wireless Communications          Packet Switching          OSI and Internet Protocol Architecture          Congestion Control and Flow Control Methods          Internet Protocols (IP, ARP, UDP, TCP)          Network (packet) Routing Algorithms (OSPF, Distance Vector)          IP Multicast          Sockets            Prerequisites    You should have completed Programming Languages AND Fundamental Algorithms ( or have a working knowledge of data structures and associated algorithms and be proficient in either C++ or JAVA (preferably JAVA). I will go over some fundamental data structures: FSM, Queues, Ring Buffers, that are common to communications protocol implementation, but it will help if you've had some exposure to them.    If you are new to JAVA, the following text is a good JAVA introduction and reference. Be warned though, that it does not teach object-oriented programming.     The Java Programming Language  , Third Edition , Ken Arnold, James Gosling, David Holmes Addison-Wesley Pub Co; ISBN: 0201704331     If you need a JAVA tutorial that includes an introduction to object oriented programming, try the free JAVA Tutorial at http://www.javasoft.com/docs/books/tutorial.           Required Text    We will be using the following book as our primary reference in class.    Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach Featuring the Internet , 3 rd Edition    James Kurose and Keith Ross, Addison Wesley, 2004, ISBN: 0-321-22735-2                   NOTE:   Changes  and corrections to the text book are here :  Errata                 Recommended Texts     Other communications networking texts that you may find useful in your work or future studies:    Data &amp; Computer Communications Seventh Edition ,    William Stallings, Prentice Hall, 2003, ISBN 0131006819          Computer Networks And Internets with Internet Applications , 3 rd Edition,     Douglas Comer, Prentice Hall, ISBN 0130914495        Internetworking with TCP/IP: Volume III: Client-Server Programming and Applications,  BSD socket version ,     Second Edition, Comer, D.E. and Stevens, D.L. Prentice Hall, ISBN 0-13-260969-X                 Syllabus  (the course Syllabus, including weekly readings )          Lectures  (links to lectures)        Assignments and Student Evaluation    Your final grade will be determined by your scores on a series of homework assignment and your class participation. There a total of five (5) assignments. These assignments will consist of:    o     problems similar to those in the text    o     small (less than 500 lines of code) programs    o     packet analysis using Ethereal packet sniffer    Since some assignments will be more difficult than others, the percent that each represents of your final grade will vary.    About class participation:     I will ask questions during each lecture and I expect that over time you will attempt to answer these questions. I also expect that you will ask questions of me (of relevance to the topic) during our meetings. I will make note of who participates in the class for each meeting. At the end of the year, I will add up to 3 points to your average score from the written assignments depending upon your level of participation.        Grading Group Assignments    I am defining three (3) grading groups, A , B, and C . You are assigned to one of these groups for the entire semester, based upon your student ID as follows:      If your student ID is N10000000 through N13120000, then you are in Group A.       If your student ID is N13120001 through N15400000, then you are in Group B .          If your student ID is N15400001 through N19999999, then you are in Group C .    You must submit your assignment to the TA assigned to your group for the given assignment. The TA assignments are listed in the assignments table above.              Assignment       Percentage       Due Date       Group A       Group B       Group C           Assignment 1       15       9/27/2006       Nguyen       Jeremy       Abid           Assignment 2       15       10/11/2006       Abid       Nguyen       Jeremy           Assignment 3       20       11/01/2006       Jeremy       Abid       Nguyen           Assignment 4       25       11/22/2006       Nguyen       Jeremy       Abid           Assignment 5       25       12/14/2006       Prof       Prof       Prof              How to Submit Assignments    When a given assignment is due, you must email the required items to the grader for your group. I will be grading the final assignment so EVERYONE will send that to me for grading.   When you submit an assignment by email you MUST write the subject as follows:    G22.2262 Assignment N     Where N is the assignment number.    If you are submitting attachments of any kind (source files, text files, any MS documents, etc), I prefer that you put all attachments into a WinZip file else they may rejected by the virus scanner.     Computer Accounts    You will be required to use the Solaris systems in CIMS network for some of your programming assignments. All students taking graduate CS courses should have a CIMS network account :        Rules for Working on Assignments    1.   Unless stated otherwise in the assignment, all assignments must be done individually (see Cheating  below).     2.   Unless stated otherwise in the assignment, all writing and coding must be original.     3.   All assignments must be emailed to the appropriate grader. To avoid problems with &quot;lost emails&quot; (&quot;the Internet ate my homework&quot;) you should save a copy of your EMAIL (not simply the assignment itself).         Late Assignments    Late assignments will be not be accepted. So, even if you have not finished your assignment, you should submit whatever you have completed by the due date. The due date for all assignments will be posted on this web page.        Cheating Policy    You should NOT :       Copy any part of   another student's homework answers.    Allow another student   to copy your homework.    Copy any part of code   found in a book, magazine, the Internet, or other resource.    Present the work of   another as your own. If you use the   idea of another in your work, you MUST provide appropriate attribution   (that is, cite the work and the author).        The penalty for ANY cheating offense is a grade of F for the course.    The Computer Science Department has published a policy for Academic Integrity here . Be sure to read it carefully and follow the rules it presents.   If you have ANY question at all about how you should address an assignment within these guidelines, PLEASE contact me immediately and I will advise you.         Class Email List    All students should register themselves with the class list, which is used for all technical discussions concerning the course. To register, go to the following web page, and follow the instructions:    http://cs.nyu.edu/mailman/listinfo/g22_2262_001_fa06    Please send your questions to this list (NOT TO ME) so that everyone may participate in the discussion."}]},

Each individual college hosts a number of social opportunities, for their students and for the general public, and you might have a look through the schools\u2019 student life pages for more information:   The first office for general extracurricular issues should be the Graduate Student Life office within the Student Resource Center . There are also a number of intramural demographic networks , such as the Center for Multicultural Education and the Office of LGBT Student Services to facilitate communication with your peers.   You might expect that the incredible range of graduate studies at New York University can pose obstacles in interacting with students of other disciplines in a professional setting, but there are in fact many opportunities for interdisciplinary activities. Many graduate research forums are held overlapping schools and areas of study, such as MaRGIN , which can introduce fascinating approaches to current research projects. With the spirit of interdepartmental research, NYU is pleased to outline some of its cross-University initiatives to keep students questioning beyond their schools.   The balance between your educational and professional lives is what makes the graduate student\u2019s position at New York University so important. As such, the participation in graduate representation is especially important for career-minded students. While there are graduate student organizations within each school , students are also invited to take part in the Student Senators Council , the highest student organization in the University.   Of course, grad students need to have lives outside school as well, and the Student Resource Center is an invaluable center for finding extracurricular clubs and organizations\u2014from cultural and spiritual organizations to weekend hiking groups. Don\u2019t forget to take advantage of Ticket Central , a box office that offers discounts to the best theatre and performances in the City, open only to NYU students and affiliates.

A significant element of the course is protocol architecture and design. We will use the Internet and its major protocols (IP and TCP) as the basis for our studies. The student will become very familiar with the concept of protocol layers and packet formats. We will look closely at how TCP handles the problems of flow control and congestion control as well as how routing algorithms and protocols work to deliver packets from end to end.    We will use a packet sniffer to help us visualize the concept of layering. Packet sniffers are tools that allow us to see frame and packet data as it flows into and out of a computer system. We will use the Ethereal Packet Sniffer to study examples of LAN and WAN protocols.    Homework will consist of some assignments based on lectures and readings in the course text, packet analysis using Ethereal, and some small programming assignments. The programming assignments show you how to use sockets in UDP and TCP and will introduce you to the use of finite state machines in protocol design. A final project will require the student to develop a program of modest size (about 1000 -1500 lines of code) to implement one or more of the protocols and/or algorithms we will study.    Although I prefer that students write their programming assignments using JAVA, I will try, where possible, to allow development in either JAVA or C.    Topics we will cover are:           Fundamental Data Structures: queues, ring buffers, finite state machines          Data Encoding and Transmission          Local Area Networks and Data Link Control          Wireless Communications          Packet Switching          OSI and Internet Protocol Architecture          Congestion Control and Flow Control Methods          Internet Protocols (IP, ARP, UDP, TCP)          Network (packet) Routing Algorithms (OSPF, Distance Vector)          IP Multicast          Sockets            Prerequisites    You should have completed Programming Languages AND Fundamental Algorithms ( or have a working knowledge of data structures and associated algorithms and be proficient in either C++ or JAVA (preferably JAVA). I will go over some fundamental data structures: FSM, Queues, Ring Buffers, that are common to communications protocol implementation, but it will help if you've had some exposure to them.    If you are new to JAVA, the following text is a good JAVA introduction and reference. Be warned though, that it does not teach object-oriented programming.     The Java Programming Language  , Third Edition , Ken Arnold, James Gosling, David Holmes Addison-Wesley Pub Co; ISBN: 0201704331     If you need a JAVA tutorial that includes an introduction to object oriented programming, try the free JAVA Tutorial at http://www.javasoft.com/docs/books/tutorial.           Required Text    We will be using the following book as our primary reference in class.

Prentice Hall, ISBN 0-13-260969-X                 Syllabus  (the course Syllabus, including weekly readings )          Lectures  (links to lectures)        Assignments and Student Evaluation    Your final grade will be determined by your scores on a series of homework assignment and your class participation. There a total of five (5) assignments. These assignments will consist of:    o     problems similar to those in the text    o     small (less than 500 lines of code) programs    o     packet analysis using Ethereal packet sniffer    Since some assignments will be more difficult than others, the percent that each represents of your final grade will vary.    About class participation:     I will ask questions during each lecture and I expect that over time you will attempt to answer these questions. I also expect that you will ask questions of me (of relevance to the topic) during our meetings. I will make note of who participates in the class for each meeting. At the end of the year, I will add up to 3 points to your average score from the written assignments depending upon your level of participation.        Grading Group Assignments    I am defining three (3) grading groups, A , B, and C . You are assigned to one of these groups for the entire semester, based upon your student ID as follows:      If your student ID is N10000000 through N13120000, then you are in Group A.       If your student ID is N13120001 through N15400000, then you are in Group B .          If your student ID is N15400001 through N19999999, then you are in Group C .    You must submit your assignment to the TA assigned to your group for the given assignment. The TA assignments are listed in the assignments table above.              Assignment       Percentage       Due Date       Group A       Group B       Group C           Assignment 1       15       9/27/2006       Nguyen       Jeremy       Abid           Assignment 2       15       10/11/2006       Abid       Nguyen       Jeremy           Assignment 3       20       11/01/2006       Jeremy       Abid       Nguyen           Assignment 4       25       11/22/2006       Nguyen       Jeremy       Abid           Assignment 5       25       12/14/2006       Prof       Prof       Prof              How to Submit Assignments    When a given assignment is due, you must email the required items to the grader for your group. I will be grading the final assignment so EVERYONE will send that to me for grading.   When you submit an assignment by email you MUST write the subject as follows:    G22.2262 Assignment N     Where N is the assignment number.    If you are submitting attachments of any kind (source files, text files, any MS documents, etc), I prefer that you put all attachments into a WinZip file else they may rejected by the virus scanner.     Computer Accounts    You will be required to use the Solaris systems in CIMS network for some of your programming assignments. All students taking graduate CS courses should have a CIMS network account :        Rules for Working on Assignments    1.   Unless stated otherwise in the assignment, all assignments must be done individually (see Cheating  below).     2.   Unless stated otherwise in the assignment, all writing and coding must be original.     3.   All assignments must be emailed to the appropriate grader. To avoid problems with &quot;lost emails&quot; (&quot;the Internet ate my homework&quot;) you should save a copy of your EMAIL (not simply the assignment itself).         Late Assignments    Late assignments will be not be accepted. So, even if you have not finished your assignment, you should submit whatever you have completed by the due date. The due date for all assignments will be posted on this web page.        Cheating Policy    You should NOT :       Copy any part of   another student's homework answers.    Allow another student   to copy your homework.    Copy any part of code   found in a book, magazine, the Internet, or other resource.    Present the work of   another as your own. If you use the   idea of another in your work, you MUST provide appropriate attribution   (that is, cite the work and the author).        The penalty for ANY cheating offense is a grade of F for the course.    The Computer Science Department has published a policy for Academic Integrity here . Be sure to read it carefully and follow the rules it presents.   If you have ANY question at all about how you should address an assignment within these guidelines, PLEASE contact me immediately and I will advise you.         Class Email List    All students should register themselves with the class list, which is used for all technical discussions concerning the course. To register, go to the following web page, and follow the instructions:    http://cs.nyu.edu/mailman/listinfo/g22_2262_001_fa06    Please send your questions to this list (NOT TO ME) so that everyone may participate in the discussion."}, {"content": "Media, Culture, and Communication - NYU Steinhardt                                           Skip to content        NYU Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development           apply now     request info     contact                                     Department of Media, Culture, and Communication           Faculty          Full-Time Faculty      Adjunct Faculty      Publications      Research      Editorial Boards      Visiting Scholars              Undergraduate          BS in MCC            Overview     Degree Requirements     Liberal Arts Core     Fields of Study     Restricted Electives     Course Descriptions            BS in MCC/GPH         Overview     Degree Requirements     Liberal Arts Core     Fields of Study     Restricted Electives     GPH Course Descriptions     MCC Course Descriptions           Advising &amp; Registration    Minors    Transfers      Prospective Students         Admissions     Frequently Asked Questions           Honors Program    Comm Club         Master's       Master of Arts    Dual Degree Program      Curriculum         Areas of Study     Course Offerings     Current Course Details     Sample Course Schedules           Current Students         Forms and Procedures      Thesis Abstracts             MA Profiles    Prospective Students         Admissions     Frequently Asked Questions     Chat with Advisor               Doctoral       Doctor of Philosophy    Curriculum         Required Coursework     Course Offerings     Current Course Details           Current Students         Forms and Procedures     Exams     Dissertation Abstracts             PhD Profiles    Prospective Students         Admissions     Principles and Procedures     Funding and Grants     Frequently Asked Questions                Internships         For Students               Program Highlights      Internship Credit      Internship Forms              For Employers           Information for Employers          NYU Career Development                    News and Events         News and Upcoming Events     Annual Events     Department Listserv        Study Abroad         MCC Abroad     Global Media Scholars        Steinhardt Abroad     NYU Abroad           Alumni         MCC Alumni     Steinhardt Alumni     NYU Alumni           Resources         Technical Support     Funding            Find Funding       Faculty Funding       Student Funding              Research     Professional Development     Digital Archives            PDF Archives       Ad Archive       Dead Media Archive               Doctoral Wiki     Teaching Handbook           About         Message from the Chair     Staff     Contact     Request Information     Bulletin     Apply for Admission                MCC Facebook   MCC Twitter   MCC Vimeo   MCC Youtube   MCC Flickr   MCC LinkedIn          Media, Culture, and Communication                       MCC In the News       Up and Away Times Literary Supplement, April 17    Martin Scherzinger's Alternative Calculus in 'African Math' WQXR, April 20    The Plan to Build an Undersea Cable Around the US&mdash;and Why We Need It Gizmodo, April 8    Undersea Cables Transport 99 Percent of International Data Newsweek, April 2    Undersea Cable Network Operates in a State of Alarm Scientific American, March 27    Occupation Apps Jacobin, March 2015    Facebook Says It Needs Your Help To Root Out Offensive Posts Huffington Post, March 16    Comedy Central's New Talk Show Brings Racial Issues and Family Life to Late Night Deseret News, March 13    The Undersea Network by Nicole Starosielski Times Higher Ed, March 5    The Nature of Trance Afropop Worldwide, February 2015    Here&rsquo;s Why You Shouldn&rsquo;t Put Your Baby Photos Online Matter, February 23    NYU Symposium to Discuss the Politics and Potential of Bitcoin Inside Bitcoins, February 10                                   News            Faculty Compilation is WQXR's Album of the Week              The release of MCC Associate Professor Martin Scherzinger's latest work, African Math, has garnered high praise from music critics.
