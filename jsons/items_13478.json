Synopsis: Corridos: Tales of Passion and Revolution, nationally broadcast on PBS and the winner of the George Peabody for excellence      in Television in 1987, was the final result of the El Teatro Campesino's stage production of the same name. The piece began      as a five week workshop in ETC's San Juan Bautista playhouse in the summer of 1982, exploring the stories and narrative lyrics      of Mexican popular ballads or corridos. The workshop production was an instant popular success with audiences and critics.      ETC decided to stage a new production of Corridos at the Marines Memorial Theater in San Francisco, where it ran for three      months to great reviews and eleven Bay Area Critics Awards. Other stagings followed in 1984. Corridos finally evolved into      a full-fledged video production in 1987, after several drafts of the script that not only reworked the selection of ballads,      but also condensed the material to fit into the confines of a one-hour special. The production presents two full-length corridos:      Delgadina (a haunting parable of incest in a wealthy Mexican family), and Soldadera (based on the dispatches of American journalist      John Reed, in which the compelling story of Elizabeta is framed by three songs of women during the 1910 Mexican Revolution).      Highlights from other traditional corridos are connected by engaging narrative sequences: Yo soy El Corrido (the story of      the corrido itself), Rosita Alvirez (a comedic parable of a defiant young woman who meets an early death), and El Lavaplatos      (the story of an immigrant who dreams of becoming a movie star and ends up a dishwasher). Joining members of the original      cast, the production included popular songstress Linda Ronstadt, singer/actor Daniel Valdez, San Francisco Ballet artist Evelyn      Cisneros, and actor Clancy Brown.
