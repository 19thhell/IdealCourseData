[{"detail": [{"content": "Sokal's Reply to Social Text Editorial     Sokal's Reply to Social Text Editorial   I confess to amusement that one Social Text editor still doesn't believe my piece was a parody. Oh, well.   As for Social Text's editorial process, readers can judge for themselves the plausibility of the editors' post facto explanations, which if true may be more damning than the incident itself. Some of their chronology is at variance with the documentary record (e-mail and regular mail between Ross and myself, which I've saved), but let me not beat a dead horse.   More interesting than the scandal provoked by the article's acceptance  is, I think, the scandal that ought to be provoked by its content . My essay, aside from being (if I may quote Katha Pollitt's flattery) \"a hilarious compilation of pomo gibberish,\" is also an annotated bibliography of charlatanism and nonsense by dozens of prominent French and American intellectuals. This goes well beyond the narrow category of \"postmodernism,\" and includes some of the most fashionable thinkers in \"science studies,\" literary criticism, and cultural studies.    In short, there is a lot of sloppy thinking going around about \"social construction,\" often abetted by a vocabulary that intentionally elides the distinction between facts and our knowledge of them. I'm no expert in epistemology, but some of this work is so illogical that it doesn't take an expert to deconstruct it. I've analyzed one representative example in an Afterword submitted for publication in Social Text ; I hope the editors will print it, perhaps along with replies. I'd suggest they also invite contributions from philosophers far sharper than myself, such as Susan Haack and Janet Radcliffe Richards.   Robbins and Ross say that I \"declined to enter into a publishable dialogue\" with them. Quite the contrary: we're having that dialogue right now. What I declined was an oral dialogue, which in my opinion usually yields a low ratio of content to words.   Robbins and Ross guess wrong when they say I feel \"threatened\" by science-studies scholars. My goal isn't to defend science from the barbarian hordes of lit crit (we'll survive just fine, thank you), but to defend the Left from a trendy segment of itself. Like innumerable others from diverse backgrounds and disciplines, I call for the Left to reclaim its Enlightenment roots. We're worried above all for the social sciences and the humanities, not the natural sciences.   In their last two paragraphs, Robbins and Ross bring up a plethora of real issues, but it would take quite a bit of space to disentangle the substance from the rhetoric. They conflate science as an intellectual system with the social and economic role of science and technology. They conflate epistemic and ethical issues.   These confusions lead Robbins and Ross into a serious error: setting up an opposition between science and progressive politics. They describe science as a \"civil religion\" that supports existing social and political structures. It is of course true that scientific research is skewed by the influence of those with power and money. But a scientific worldview, based on a commitment to logic and standards of evidence and to the incessant confrontation of theories with reality, is an essential component of any progressive politics.   Despite these differences, there is a potentially vast common ground between Robbins-Ross and myself. When scientific research is increasingly funded by private corporations that have a financial interest in particular  outcomes of that research -- is the drug effective or not? -- scientific objectivity is undermined. (But to make this argument, one must first have a conception of objectivity: not as a state that human beings can ever attain, but as an ideal standard of comparison.) When universities are more interested in patent royalties than in the open sharing of scientific information, the public suffers. There are hundreds of important political and economic issues surrounding science and technology. Sociology of science, at its best, has done much to clarify these issues. But sloppy sociology, like sloppy science, is useless or even counterproductive."}, {"content": "What the Social Text Affair Does and Does Not Prove                   What the Social Text Affair    Does and Does Not Prove       Alan D.

My larger target is those  contemporaries who -- in repeated acts of wish-fulfillment --  have appropriated conclusions from the philosophy of science  and put them to work in aid of a variety of social cum political  causes for which those conclusions are ill adapted.  Feminists, religious apologists (including ``creation scientists''),  counterculturalists, neoconservatives, and a host of other curious  fellow-travelers have claimed to find crucial grist for their mills  in, for instance, the avowed incommensurability and underdetermination  of scientific theories.  The displacement of the idea that facts and evidence matter  by the idea that everything boils down to subjective interests  and perspectives is -- second only to American political campaigns --  the most prominent and pernicious manifestation of anti-intellectualism  in our time.      -- Larry Laudan, Science and Relativism [1]           I confess to some embarrassment at being asked to contribute an introductory essay to this collection of critical studies in the history, sociology and philosophy of science. After all, I'm neither a historian nor a sociologist nor a philosopher; I'm merely a theoretical physicist with an amateur interest in the philosophy of science and perhaps some modest skill at thinking clearly.  Social Text co-founder Stanley Aronowitz was, alas, absolutely right when he called me ``ill-read and half-educated.'' [2]    My own contribution to this field began, as the reader undoubtedly knows, with an unorthodox (and admittedly uncontrolled) experiment. I wrote a parody of postmodern science criticism, entitled ``Transgressing the Boundaries: Toward a Transformative Hermeneutics of Quantum Gravity'', and submitted it to the cultural-studies journal Social Text  (of course without telling the editors that it was a parody). They published it as a serious scholarly article in their spring 1996 special issue devoted to what they call the ``Science Wars''. [3]  Three weeks later I revealed the hoax in an article in  Lingua Franca [4] , and all hell broke loose. [5]    In this essay I'd like to discuss briefly what I think the `` Social Text affair'' does and does not prove. But first, to fend off the accusation that I'm an arrogant physicist who rejects all sociological intrusion on our ``turf'', I'd like to lay out some positive things that I think social studies of science can accomplish. The following propositions are, I hope, noncontroversial:   1) Science is a human endeavor, and like any other human endeavor it merits being subjected to rigorous social analysis. Which research problems count as important; how research funds are distributed; who gets prestige and power; what role scientific expertise plays in public-policy debates; in what form scientific knowledge becomes embodied in technology, and for whose benefit -- all these issues are strongly affected by political, economic and to some extent ideological considerations, as well as by the internal logic of scientific inquiry. They are thus fruitful subjects for empirical study by historians, sociologists, political scientists and economists.   2) At a more subtle level, even the content of scientific debate -- what types of theories can be conceived and entertained, what criteria are to be used for deciding between competing theories -- is constrained in part by the prevailing attitudes of mind, which in turn arise in part from deep-seated historical factors. It is the task of historians and sociologists of science to sort out, in each specific instance, the roles played by ``external'' and ``internal'' factors in determining the course of scientific development. Not surprisingly, scientists tend to stress the ``internal'' factors while sociologists tend to stress the ``external'', if only because each group tends to have a poor grasp on the other group's concepts. But these problems are perfectly amenable to rational debate.   3) There is nothing wrong with research informed by a political commitment, as long as that commitment does not blind the researcher to inconvenient facts. Thus, there is a long and honorable tradition of socio-political critique of science [6] , including antiracist critiques of anthropological pseudo-science and eugenics [7]  and feminist critiques of psychology and parts of medicine and biology. [8]  These critiques typically follow a standard pattern: First one shows, using conventional scientific arguments, why the research in question is flawed  according to the ordinary canons of good science ; then, and only then , one attempts to explain how the researchers' social prejudices (which may well have been unconscious) led them to violate these canons. Of course, each such critique has to stand or fall on its own merits; having good political intentions doesn't guarantee that one's analysis will constitute good science, good sociology or good history. But this general two-step approach is, I think, sound; and empirical studies of this kind, if conducted with due intellectual rigor, could shed useful light on the social conditions under which good science (defined normatively as the search for truths or at least approximate truths about the world) is fostered or hindered. [9]    Now, I don't want to claim that these three points exhaust  the field of fruitful inquiry for historians and sociologists of science, but they certainly do lay out a big and important area. And yet, some sociologists and literary intellectuals over the past two decades have gotten greedier: roughly speaking, they want to attack the normative conception of scientific inquiry as a search for truths or approximate truths about the world; they want to see science as just another social practice, which produces ``narrations'' and ``myths'' that are no more valid than those produced by other social practices; and some of them want to argue further that these social practices encode a bourgeois and/or Eurocentric and/or masculinist world-view. Of course, like all brief summaries this one is an oversimplification; and in any case there is no canonical doctrine in the ``new'' sociology of science, just a bewildering variety of individuals and schools. More importantly, the task of summarization is here made more difficult by the fact that this literature is often ambiguous in crucial ways about its most fundamental claims (as I'll illustrate later using the cases of Latour and Barnes-Bloor). Still, I think most scientists and philosophers of science would be astonished to learn that ``the natural world has a small or non-existent role in the construction of scientific knowledge'', as prominent sociologist of science Harry Collins claims [10] ; or that ``reality is the consequence rather than the cause'' of the so-called ``social construction of facts'', as Bruno Latour and Steve Woolgar assert. [11]          With this preamble out of the way, I'd now like to consider what (if anything) the `` Social Text affair'' proves -- and also what it does not prove, because some of my over-enthusiastic supporters have claimed too much. In this analysis, it's crucial to distinguish between what can be deduced from the fact of publication  and what can be deduced from the content of the article .    From the mere fact of publication of my parody I think that not much can be deduced. It doesn't prove that the whole field of cultural studies, or cultural studies of science -- much less sociology of science -- is nonsense. Nor does it prove that the intellectual standards in these fields are generally lax. (This might be the case, but it would have to be established  on other grounds.) It proves only that the editors of one rather marginal journal were derelict in their intellectual duty, by publishing an article on quantum physics that they admit they could not understand, without bothering to get an opinion from anyone knowledgeable in quantum physics, solely because it came from a ``conveniently credentialed ally'' (as Social Text co-editor Bruce Robbins  later candidly admitted [12] ), flattered the editors' ideological preconceptions, and attacked their ``enemies''. [13]    To which, one might justifiably respond: So what? [14]    The answer comes from examining the content of the parody. In this regard, one important point has gotten lost in much of the discussion of my article: Yes, the article is screamingly funny -- I'm not modest, I'm proud of my work -- but the most hilarious parts of my article were not written by me. Rather, they're direct quotes from the postmodern Masters, whom I shower with mock praise. In fact, the article is structured around the silliest quotations I could find about mathematics and physics (and the philosophy of mathematics and physics) from some of the most prominent French and American intellectuals; my only contribution was to invent a nonsensical argument linking these quotations together and praising them. This involved, of course, advocating an incoherent mishmash of trendy ideas -- deconstructive literary theory, New Age ecology, so-called ``feminist epistemology'' [15] , extreme social-constructivist philosophy of science, even Lacanian psychoanalysis -- but that just made the parody all the more fun. Indeed, in some cases I took the liberty of parodying extreme or ambiguously stated versions of views that I myself hold in a more moderate and precisely stated form.   Now, what precisely do I mean by ``silliness''? Here's a very rough categorization: First of all, one has meaningless or absurd statements ,  name-dropping , and the display of false erudition . Secondly, one has sloppy thinking and poor philosophy , which come together notably (though not always) in the form of glib relativism .   The first of these categories wouldn't be so important, perhaps, if we were dealing with a few assistant professors of literature making fools of themselves holding forth on quantum mechanics or G&#246;del's theorem. It becomes more relevant because we're dealing with important intellectuals, at least as measured by shelf space in the cultural-studies section of university bookstores. Here, for instance, are Gilles Deleuze and F&#233;lix Guattari holding forth on chaos theory:     To slow down is to set a limit in chaos   to which all speeds are subject, so that they form a variable   determined as abscissa, at the same time as the limit forms a   universal constant that cannot be gone beyond (for example, a maximum   degree of contraction). The first functives are therefore the   limit and the variable, and reference is a relationship between   values of the variable or, more profoundly, the relationship of the   variable, as abscissa of speeds,   with the limit. [16]    And there's much more -- Jacques Lacan and Luce Irigaray on differential topology, Jean-Fran&#231;ois Lyotard on cosmology, Michel Serres on nonlinear time -- but let me not spoil the fun. [17]  (By the way, if you worry that I'm quoting out of context, just follow my footnotes, look up the originals, and decide for yourself. You'll find that these passages are even worse in context than out of context.)   Nor is all the nonsense of French origin. Connoisseurs of fashionable American work in the Cultural Studies of Science will, I think, find ample food for thought.   Fine, the Science Studies contingent might now object: maybe some of our friends in the English Department take Lacan or Deleuze seriously, but no one in our community does. True enough; but then take a look at Bruno Latour's semiotic analysis of the theory of relativity, published in Social Studies of Science , in which ``Einstein's text is read as a contribution to the sociology of delegation''. [18]  Why's that? Because Latour finds Einstein's popular book on relativity full of situations in which the author delegates one observer to stand on the platform and make certain measurements, and another observer to stand on the train and make certain measurements; and of course the results won't obey the Lorentz transformations unless the two observers do what they're told! You think I exaggerate? Latour emphasizes Einstein's     obsession with transporting in formation through   trans formations without de formation;   his passion for the precise superimposition of readings;   his panic at the idea that observers sent away might betray,   might retain privileges, and send reports that could not be   used to expand our knowledge; his desire to discipline the   delegated observers and to turn them into dependent pieces   of apparatus that do nothing but watch the coincidence of   hands and notches ... [19]    Furthermore, because Latour doesn't understand what the term ``frame of reference'' means in physics -- he confuses it with ``actor'' in semiotics -- he claims that relativity cannot deal with the transformation laws between two frames of reference, but needs at least three :     If there are only one, or even two , frames of reference,   no solution can be found ...    Einstein's solution is to consider three actors:   one in the train, one on the   embankment and a third one, the author [enunciator] or one   of its representants, who tries to superimpose the coded   observations sent back by   the two others. [20]    Finally, Latour somehow got the idea that relativity concerns the problems raised by the relative location  (rather than the relative motion ) of different observers. (Of course, even the word ``observer'' here is potentially misleading;  it belongs to the pedagogy of relativity, not to the theory itself.) Here is Latour's summary of the meaning of relativity:     provided the two relativities [special and general] are accepted,  more frames of reference with less privilege can be accessed, reduced,  accumulated and combined, observers can be delegated to a few more  places in the infinitely large (the cosmos) and the infinitely small  (electrons), and the readings they send will be understandable.  His [Einstein's] book could well be titled: ``New Instructions for  Bringing Back Long-Distance  Scientific Travellers''. [21]    I needn't pursue the point: Professor Huth's essay in this volume provides a sober and detailed exegesis of Latour's confusions about relativity. The upshot is that Latour has produced 40 pages of comical misunderstandings of a theory that is nowadays routinely taught to intelligent college freshmen, and Social Studies of Science  found it a worthy scholarly contribution.   OK, enough for examples of nonsense (although a lot more are available). More interesting intellectually, I think, are the sloppy thinking and glib relativism that have become prevalent in many parts of Science Studies (albeit not , by and large, among serious philosophers of science). When one analyzes these writings, one often finds radical-sounding assertions whose meaning is ambiguous, and which can be given two alternate readings: one as interesting, radical, and grossly false; the other as boring and trivially true.   Let me start again with Latour, this time taken from his book Science in Action , in which he develops seven Rules of Method for the sociologist of science. Here is his Third Rule of Method:   Since the settlement of a controversy is the cause of Nature's representation, not the consequence, we can never use the outcome -- Nature -- to explain how and why a controversy has been settled. [22]    Note how Latour slips, without comment or argument, from ``Nature's representation'' in the first half of this sentence to ``Nature'' tout court in the second half. If we were to read ``Nature's representation'' in both halves, then we'd have the truism that scientists' representations of Nature (that is, their theories) are arrived at by a social process, and that the course and outcome of that social process can't be explained simply by its outcome. If, on the other hand, we take seriously ``Nature'' in the second half, linked as it is to the word ``outcome'', then we would have the claim that the external world is created by scientists' negotiations: a claim that is bizarre to say the least, given that the external world has been around for about 10 billion years longer than the human race. [23]  Finally, if we take seriously ``Nature'' in the second half but expunge the word ``outcome'' preceding it, then we would have either (a) the weak (and trivially true) claim that the course and outcome of a scientific controversy cannot be explained  solely by the nature of the external world (obviously some social factors play a role, if only in determining which experiments are technologically feasible at a given time, not to mention other, more subtle social influences); or (b) the strong (and manifestly false) claim that the nature of the external world plays no role in constraining the course and outcome of a scientific controversy. [24]    On the other hand, if we apply the First Rule of Interpretation of Postmodern Academic Writing -- ``no sentence means what it says'' -- we can perhaps make sense of Latour's dictum. Let's read it not as a philosophical principle, but rather as a methodological principle for a sociologist of science -- more precisely, for a sociologist of science who does not have the scientific competence to make an independent assessment of whether the experimental/observational data do in fact warrant the conclusions the scientific community has drawn from them. (The principle applies with particular force when such a sociologist is studying contemporary science, because in this case there is no other scientific community besides the one under study who could provide such an independent assessment. By contrast, for studies of the distant past, one can always look at what subsequent scientists learned, including the results from experiments going beyond those originally performed.) In such a situation, the sociologist will be understandably reluctant to say that ``the scientific community under study came to conclusion X because X is the way the world really is'' --  even if it is in fact the case  that X is the way the world is and that is the reason the scientists came to believe it -- because the sociologist has no independent  grounds to believe that X is the way the world really is other than the fact that the scientific community under study came to believe it.   Of course, the sensible conclusion to draw from this cul de sac  is that sociologists of science ought not to study scientific controversies on which they lack the competence to make an independent assessment of the facts, if there is no other (for example, historically later) scientific community on which they could justifiably rely for such an independent assessment. But it goes without saying that Latour and his colleagues would not enjoy this conclusion, because their goal, as Steve Fuller put it, is to ``employ methods that enable them to fathom both the `inner workings' and the `outer character' of science without having to be expert in the fields they study.'' [25]    It seems to me that much sloppy thinking in Science Studies, like that in Latour's Third Rule of Method, involves conflating concepts that need to be distinguished. Most frequently this conflation is accomplished by terminological fiat: the author intentionally uses an old word or phrase in a radically new sense, thereby undermining any attempt to distinguish between the two meanings. The clear goal here is to achieve by definition what one could not achieve by logic. For example, one often finds phrases like ``the social construction of facts'' [26]  that intentionally elide the distinction between facts and our knowledge of them. Or to take another example, philosophers usually understand the word ``knowledge'' to mean ``justified true belief'' or some similar concept; but Barry Barnes and David Bloor redefine ``knowledge'' to mean ``any collectively accepted system of belief''. [27]  Now, perhaps Barnes and Bloor are uninterested in inquiring whether a given belief is true or rationally justified [28] ; but if they think these properties of beliefs are irrelevant  for their purposes, then they should say so and explain why, without confusing the issue by redefining words. [29]    More generally, it seems to me that much sloppy thinking in Science Studies involves conflating two or more of the following levels of analysis:       Ontology.     What objects exist in the world? What    statements about these objects are true ?     Epistemology.     How can human beings obtain knowledge     of truths about the world? How can they assess    the reliability of that knowledge?     Sociology of knowledge.     To what extent are the truths known (or    knowable ) by humans in any given society    influenced (or determined) by social, economic,    political, cultural and ideological factors? Same    question for the false statements erroneously    believed to be true.     Individual ethics.     What types of research ought a scientist    (or technologist) to undertake (or refuse to    undertake)?     Social ethics.     What types of research ought society to    encourage, subsidize or publicly fund (or    alternatively to discourage, tax or forbid)?     These questions are obviously related -- for example, if there are no objective truths about the world, then there isn't much point in asking how one can know those (nonexistent) truths -- but they are conceptually distinct.   For example, Sandra Harding [30]  (citing the work of Paul Forman [31] ) points out that American research in the 1940s and 50s on quantum electronics was motivated in large part by potential military applications. True enough. Now, quantum mechanics made possible solid-state physics, which in turn made possible quantum electronics (e.g. the transistor), which made possible nearly all of modern technology (e.g. the computer). And the computer has had applications that are beneficial to society (e.g. in allowing the postmodern cultural critic to produce her articles more efficiently) as well as applications that are harmful (e.g. in allowing the U.S. military to kill human beings more efficiently). This raises a host of social and individual ethical questions: Ought society to forbid (or discourage) certain applications of computers? Forbid (or discourage) research on computers per se ? Forbid (or discourage) research on quantum electronics? On solid-state physics? On quantum mechanics? And likewise for individual scientists and technologists. (Clearly, an affirmative answer to these questions becomes harder to justify as one goes down the list; but I do not want to declare any of these questions a priori  illegitimate.) Likewise, sociological questions arise, for example: To what extent is our (true) knowledge of computer science, quantum electronics, solid-state physics and quantum mechanics -- and our lack of knowledge about other scientific subjects, e.g. the global climate -- a result of public-policy choices favoring militarism? To what extent have the erroneous theories (if any) in computer science, quantum electronics, solid-state physics and quantum mechanics been the result (in whole or in part) of social, economic, political, cultural and ideological factors, in particular the culture of militarism? [32]  These are all serious questions, which deserve careful investigation adhering to the highest standards of scientific and historical evidence.  But they have no effect whatsoever on the  underlying scientific questions:  whether atoms (and silicon crystals, transistors and computers) really do behave according to the laws of quantum mechanics (and solid-state physics, quantum electronics and computer science). The militaristic orientation of American science has quite simply no bearing whatsoever on the ontological question, and only under a wildly implausible scenario could it have any bearing on the epistemological question. (E.g. if the worldwide community of solid-state physicists, following what they believe to be the conventional standards of scientific evidence, were to hastily accept an erroneous theory of semiconductor behavior because of their enthusiasm for the breakthrough in military technology that this theory would make possible.)   The extreme versions of social constructivism and relativism -- such as the Edinburgh ``strong programme'' -- are, I think, largely based on the same failure to distinguish clearly between ontology, epistemology, and the sociology of knowledge. Here is how Barnes and Bloor describe the form  of relativism that they defend:    Our equivalence postulate is that all beliefs are on a par  with one another with respect to the causes of their credibility.  It is not that all beliefs are equally true or equally false,  but that regardless of truth and falsity the fact of their  credibility is to be seen as equally problematic.  The position we shall defend is that the incidence of all beliefs  without exception calls for empirical investigation and must be  accounted for by finding the specific, local causes of this credibility.  This means that regardless of whether the sociologist evaluates a belief  as true or rational, or as false and irrational, he must search for  the causes of its credibility. ... All these questions can, and should,  be answered without regard to the status of the belief as it is judged  and evaluated by the sociologist's  own standards. [33]    It seems clear from this passage, as well as from the paragraph that precedes it, that Barnes and Bloor are not advocating an ontological relativism: they recognize that ``to say that all beliefs are equally true encounters the problem of how to handle beliefs which contradict one another'', and that ``to say that all beliefs are equally false poses the problem of the status of the relativist's own claims.'' [34]  They might be advocating an epistemological relativism -- that all beliefs are equally credible, or equally rational -- and indeed, their attack on the universal validity of even the simplest rules of deductive inference (such as modus ponens ) lends some support to this interpretation. [35]  But more likely what they are advocating is some form of  methodological relativism for sociologists of knowledge. The problem is, what form?   If the claim were merely that we should use the same principles of sociology and psychology to explain the causation of all beliefs irrespective of whether we evaluate them as true or false, rational or irrational, then I would have no particular objection (though one might have qualms about the hyper-scientistic attitude that human beliefs are always to be explained causally through social science). But if the claim is that only social causes can enter into such an explanation -- that the way the world is cannot enter -- then I cannot disagree more strenuously. [36]    Let's take a concrete example: Why did the European scientific community become persuaded of the truth of Newtonian mechanics somewhere between 1700 and 1750? Undoubtedly a variety of historical, sociological, ideological and political factors must play a role in this explanation -- one must explain, for example, why Newtonian mechanics was accepted quickly in England but more slowly in France [37]  -- but certainly some part of the explanation (and a rather important part at that) must be that the planets and comets really do move (to a very high degree of approximation, though not exactly) as predicted by Newtonian mechanics. [38]  Or to take another example: Why did the majority view in the European and North American scientific communities shift from creationism to Darwinism over the course of the century? Again, numerous historical, sociological, ideological and political factors will play a role in this explanation; but can one plausibly explain this shift without  any reference to the fossil record or to the Gal&#225;pagos fauna?   In the unlikely event that the argument isn't already clear, here's a more homely example: Suppose we encounter a man running out of a lecture hall screaming at the top of his lungs that there's a stampeding herd of elephants in there. What we are to make of this assertion, and in particular how we are to evaluate its ``causes'', should, I think, depend heavily on whether or not there is in fact a stampeding herd of elephants in there -- or, more precisely, since I admit that we have no direct, unmediated access to external reality -- whether when I and other people peek (cautiously!) into the room  we see or hear a stampeding herd of elephants (or the destruction that such a herd might recently have caused  before themselves exiting the room). If we do see such evidence of elephants, then the most plausible explanation of this set of observations is that there is (or was) in fact a  stampeding herd of elephants in the lecture hall, that the man saw and/or heard it, and that his subsequent fright (which we might well share under the circumstances) led him to exit the room in a hurry and to scream the assertion that we overheard. And our reaction would be to call the police and the zookeepers. If, on the other hand, our own observations reveal no evidence of elephants in the lecture hall, then the most plausible explanation is that there was not in fact a stampeding herd of elephants in the room, that the man imagined the elephants as a result of some psychosis (whether internally or chemically induced), and that this led him to exit the room in a hurry and to scream the assertion that we overheard. And we'd call the police and the psychiatrists. [39]  And I daresay that Barnes and Bloor, whatever they might write in journal articles for sociologists and philosophers, would do the same in real life.   The bottom line, it seems to me, is that there is no fundamental ``metaphysical'' difference between the epistemology of science and the epistemology of everyday life. Historians, detectives and plumbers -- indeed, all human beings -- use the same basic methods of induction, deduction, and assessment of evidence as do physicists or biochemists. Modern science tries to carry out these operations in a more careful and systematic way -- using controls and statistical tests, insisting on replication, and so forth -- but nothing more. [40]  Any philosophy of science -- or methodology for sociologists -- that is so blatantly wrong when applied to the epistemology of everyday life must be severely flawed at its core.   In summary, it seems to me that the ``strong programme'', like Latour's Third Rule of Method, is ambiguous in its intent; and, depending on how one resolves the ambiguity, it becomes either a valid and mildly interesting corrective to the most naive psychological and sociological notions -- reminding us that ``true beliefs have causes too'' -- or else a gross and blatant error.         Professor Kitcher concludes his contribution to this volume by saying, ``I doubt that this essay will please anyone, for it attempts to occupy middle ground.'' In this he's certainly too pessimistic, for there's at least one counterexample: his essay pleases me . Indeed, I agree with nearly everything in it.   Now, perhaps this means only that I too -- arrogant scientist though I may be -- am one of those select few occupying the ``middle ground''. But I suspect that in fact more of us occupy the ``middle ground'' in this debate than might at first appear. The point, of course, isn't to embrace ``middle ground'' (whatever that may be) abstractly and for its own sake, without regard to its content: that would be a grave dereliction of intellectual duty. [41]  But here the middle ground as set forth in Kitcher's essay -- based on a respect for both the ``realist-rationalist cluster'' and the ``socio-historical cluster'', even as we may debate their relative importance in specific cases -- is so eminently sensible that nearly all scientists [42]  and philosophers of science would give their assent, as would most (though apparently not all) sociologists of science. And this fact might give us some cause for reflection about the so-called -- and I think grossly misnamed -- ``Science Wars''.   The term was apparently first coined by Social Text co-editor Andrew Ross, who explained that ``the Science Wars [are] a second front opened up by conservatives cheered by the successes of their legions in the holy Culture Wars. Seeking explanations for their loss of standing in the public eye and the decline in funding from the public purse, conservatives in science have joined the backlash against the (new) usual suspects -- pinkos, feminists, and multiculturalists''. [43]  This theme was further elaborated in the now-famous special issue of Social Text . [44]  But, just as in the dreary ``culture wars'', the truth is rather more complicated than this Manichean portrayal would allow. The alleged one-to-one correspondence between epistemological and political views is a gross misrepresentation. [45]  So, too, is the idea that in this debate there are only two positions.   This conception of debate as combat is, in fact, probably the main reason why the Social Text editors fell for my parody. Acting not as intellectuals seeking the truth, but as self-appointed generals in the ``Science Wars'', they apparently leapt at the chance to get a ``real'' scientist on their ``side''. Now, ruing their blunder, they must surely feel a kinship with the Trojans.   But the military metaphor is a mistake; the Social Text editors are not my enemies. Ross has legitimate concerns about new technologies and about the increasingly unequal distribution of scientific expertise. Aronowitz raises important questions about technological unemployment and the possibility of a ``jobless future''. [46]  But, pace Ross, nothing is gained by denying the existence of objective scientific knowledge; it does exist, whether we like it or not. Political progressives should seek to have that knowledge distributed more democratically and to have it employed for socially useful ends. Indeed, the radical epistemological critique fatally undermines  the needed political critique, by removing its factual basis. After all, the only reason why nuclear weapons are a danger to anyone is that the theories of nuclear physics on which their design is based are, at least to a very high degree of approximation, objectively true . [47]    Science Studies' epistemological conceits are a diversion from the important matters that motivated Science Studies in the first place: namely, the social, economic and political roles of science and technology. To be sure, those conceits are not an accident; they have a history, which can be subjected to sociological study. [48]  But Science Studies practitioners are not obliged to persist in a misguided epistemology; they can give it up, and go on to the serious task of studying science. Perhaps, from the perspective of a few years from now, today's so-called ``Science Wars'' will turn out to have marked such a turning point.

[6]   I limit myself here to critiques  challenging the substantive content of scientific theories or methodology.  Other important types of critiques challenge the uses to which  scientific knowledge is put (e.g. in technology)  or the social structure of the scientific community.    [7]   See, for example,  Stephen Jay Gould, The Mismeasure of Man    (New York: Norton, 1981, 2nd ed. 1996).    [8]   See, for example,  Anne Fausto-Sterling, Myths of Gender: Biological Theories about   Women and Men (New York: Basic Books, 1985, 2nd ed. 1992);  Carol Tavris, The Mismeasure of Woman    (New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, 1992).    [9]   Of course, I don't mean to imply that the only (or even principal)  purpose of the history of science is to help working scientists.  History of science obviously has intrinsic value as a contribution  to the history of human society and human thought.  But it seems to me that history of science, when done well,  can also help working scientists.    [10]   H.M. Collins, ``Stages in the empirical programme of relativism'',   Social Studies of Science 11 (1981): 3-10,   quote at p. 3.  Two qualifications need to be made:  First, this statement is offered as part of Collins' introduction  to a set of studies (edited by him) employing the relativist approach,  and constitutes his summary of that approach;  he does not explicitly endorse this view,  though an endorsement seems implied by the context.  Second, while Collins appears to intend this assertion as an  empirical claim about the history of science,  it is possible that he intends it neither as an empirical claim  nor as a normative principle of epistemology,  but rather as a methodological injunction to sociologists  of science:  namely, to act as if   ``the natural world ha[d] a small or non-existent role in the  construction of scientific knowledge'',  or in other words to ignore (``bracket'')  whatever role the natural world may in fact play  in the construction of scientific knowledge.  I shall argue below, in discussing Barnes-Bloor,  that this approach is seriously deficient  as methodology for sociologists of science.

[14]   Indeed, a mainstream journal in the sociology of science  would almost certainly not have fallen for my parody.  (On the other hand, Social Studies of Science published  a long article on the theory of relativity which,  if it wasn't in fact a parody, might as well have been: see below.)  I chose Social Text because my primary motivation was  political : see Sokal, ``Afterword'' and ``A Plea'',  op. cit.     [15]   I emphasize that this term is a misnomer,  as these ideas are hotly debated among feminists,  among whom I include myself.

This ``rule'' is the culmination of an argument (pp. 96-99)  in which ontology, epistemology and the sociology of knowledge  are gradually conflated.    [23]   You might worry that here my argument is circular, in that it takes  for granted the truth of the current scientific consensus in  cosmology and paleontology. But this is not the case.  First of all, my phrase ``given that ...'' is a rhetorical flourish  that plays no essential role in the argument;  the idea that the external world is created by scientists' negotiations  is bizarre irrespective of the details of cosmology and paleontology.  Secondly, my phrase ``the external world has been around ...''  should, if one wants to be super-precise, be amended to read:  ``there is a vast body of extremely convincing (and diverse) evidence  in support of the belief that the external world has been around ...;  and if this belief is correct, then the claim that  the external world is created by scientists' negotiations  is bizarre to say the least.''  Indeed, all of my assertions of fact -  including ``today in New York it's raining'' -  should be glossed in this way.  Since I shall claim below that much contemporary work in Science Studies  elides the distinction between ontology and epistemology,  I don't want to leave myself open to the same accusation.

[29]   Note indeed how Bloor, only nine pages after enunciating  his non-standard definition of ``knowledge'',  reverts without comment to the standard definition of ``knowledge'',  which he contrasts with ``error'':  ``[I]t would be wrong to assume that the natural working of our  animal resources always produces knowledge.  They produce a mixture of knowledge and error  with equal naturalness ...''  [Bloor, op. cit. , p. 14].    [30]   Sandra Harding, Whose Science? Whose Knowledge?

[32]   I certainly don't exclude the possibility that   present theories in any of these subjects might be  erroneous. But critics wishing to make such a case  would have to provide not only historical evidence of  the claimed cultural influence, but also   scientific evidence that the theory in question is  in fact erroneous. (The same evidentiary standards of  course apply to past erroneous theories; but  in this case the scientists may have already performed  the second task, relieving the cultural critic of the  need to do so from scratch.)    [33]    Barnes and Bloor, op. cit. ,    quote at p. 23.    [34]   Ibid. , p. 22.    [35]   Ibid. , pp. 35-47.    [36]   Bloor does state explicitly that ``Naturally there will be  other types of causes apart from social ones which will cooperate  in bringing about belief.'' [Bloor, op. cit. , p. 7]  The trouble is that he never makes explicit in what way   natural causes will be allowed to enter into the explanation of belief,  or what precisely the symmetry principle will mean in this context.  For a more detailed critique of Bloor's ambiguities  (from a philosophical point of view slightly different from mine),  see Larry Laudan, ``The pseudo-science of science?'',   Philosophy of the Social Sciences 11 (1981): 173-198.  See also Peter Slezak, ``A second look at David Bloor's   Knowledge and Social Imagery '',   Philosophy of the Social Sciences 24 (1994): 336-361.    [37]   The consensus of historians appears to be that  the slow acceptance of Newtonian mechanics in France  arose from scholastic attachment  to Cartesian theories as well as from certain theological considerations:  see, for example, Pierre Brunet, L'introduction des th&#233;ories de  Newton en France au XVIIIe si&#232;cle (Paris, 1931;  reprinted by Slatkine, Gen&#232;ve, 1970);  Betty Jo Teeter Dobbs and Margaret C. Jacob,  Newton and the Culture of Newtonianism   (Atlantic Highlands, New Jersey: Humanities Press, 1995).    [38]   Or more precisely: There is a vast body of extremely convincing  astronomical evidence in support of the belief that the  planets and comets  do move (to a very high degree of approximation, though not exactly)  as predicted by Newtonian mechanics;  and if this belief is correct, then  it is the fact of this motion (and not merely our belief in it)  that forms part of the explanation of why  the 18th-century European scientific community came to believe  in the truth of Newtonian mechanics.    [39]   For what it's worth, these decisions can presumably be justified  on Bayesian grounds, using our prior experience of the probability  of finding elephants in lecture halls, of the incidence of psychosis,  of the reliability of our own visual and auditory perceptions,  and so forth.    [40]   Please note: I am not claiming that inference from  scientific observations to scientific theories is as simple  or unproblematic as inference from seeing elephants in front of me  to the conclusion that elephants are in front of me.  (In truth, even this latter inference is not so simple or unproblematic:  to fully ground it requires some knowledge about optics  and about the mechanisms of human vision.)  As all practicing scientists and historians of science well know,  the reasoning from scientific observations to scientific theories  is far more indirect, and typically involves a vast web of  empirical evidence rather than a single observation.  My point is simply that in all of these cases --  Newtonian mechanics, Darwinian evolution, or elephants --  it is absurd to try to explain the ``causes'' of people's beliefs  without including the natural (non-social) world as one of those causes,  and a rather important one at that.    [41]   In American politics, the baleful consequences of such a search  for ``middle ground'' between two morally and intellectually bankrupt  (and indeed barely distinguishable) positions hardly need further comment.  ``Middle ground'' is, of course, meaningless until one specifies  between what ; and the corporate media's tacit definition  of the outer limits of respectable opinion is, of course, a large part  of the problem. On what grounds, for example, is single-payer  health insurance -- long in use in most industrialized countries --  defined as ``extreme'' and ``unrealistic'' in the United States?    [42]   Including Gross and Levitt, as they make amply clear in their book  [ op. cit ].    [43]   Andrew Ross, ``Science Backlash on Technoskeptics'',   The Nation 261 (10) (October 2, 1995): 346-350,   quote at p. 346.  See also Ross, ``Introduction'', op. cit. , p. 6.    [44] .   Five of the essay titles (Martin, Nelkin, Franklin, Kovel, Aronowitz)  include the term ``Science Wars'',  and three more titles (Rose, Winner, Levidow)  contain assorted martial metaphors.    [45]   My own leftist political views are a matter of record,  as are those of many of my supporters  (e.g. Michael Albert, Barbara Epstein, Meera Nanda, Ruth Rosen and  James Weinstein, among many others).  Even Gross and Levitt, the original targets of Ross's wrath,  make clear that their political views are basically left-liberal;  they note that one of them (Levitt as it turns out)  is a member of Democratic Socialists of America  [Gross and Levitt, op. cit. , p. 261, note 7].    [46]   Stanley Aronowitz and William DiFazio,   The Jobless Future: Sci-Tech and the Dogma of Work    (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1994).

[48]   For an interesting conjecture,  see Meera Nanda, ``The Science Wars in India'',   Dissent 44 (1) (Winter 1997): 78-83, at pp. 79-80.  For a different (but not incompatible) conjecture,  see Gross and Levitt, op. cit. , pp. 74, 82-88, 217-233.  Both these conjectures merit careful empirical investigation  by intellectual historians."}]},
{"detail": [{"content": "Sokal's Reply to Social Text Editorial     Sokal's Reply to Social Text Editorial   I confess to amusement that one Social Text editor still doesn't believe my piece was a parody. Oh, well.   As for Social Text's editorial process, readers can judge for themselves the plausibility of the editors' post facto explanations, which if true may be more damning than the incident itself. Some of their chronology is at variance with the documentary record (e-mail and regular mail between Ross and myself, which I've saved), but let me not beat a dead horse.   More interesting than the scandal provoked by the article's acceptance  is, I think, the scandal that ought to be provoked by its content . My essay, aside from being (if I may quote Katha Pollitt's flattery) \"a hilarious compilation of pomo gibberish,\" is also an annotated bibliography of charlatanism and nonsense by dozens of prominent French and American intellectuals. This goes well beyond the narrow category of \"postmodernism,\" and includes some of the most fashionable thinkers in \"science studies,\" literary criticism, and cultural studies.    In short, there is a lot of sloppy thinking going around about \"social construction,\" often abetted by a vocabulary that intentionally elides the distinction between facts and our knowledge of them. I'm no expert in epistemology, but some of this work is so illogical that it doesn't take an expert to deconstruct it. I've analyzed one representative example in an Afterword submitted for publication in Social Text ; I hope the editors will print it, perhaps along with replies. I'd suggest they also invite contributions from philosophers far sharper than myself, such as Susan Haack and Janet Radcliffe Richards.   Robbins and Ross say that I \"declined to enter into a publishable dialogue\" with them. Quite the contrary: we're having that dialogue right now. What I declined was an oral dialogue, which in my opinion usually yields a low ratio of content to words.   Robbins and Ross guess wrong when they say I feel \"threatened\" by science-studies scholars. My goal isn't to defend science from the barbarian hordes of lit crit (we'll survive just fine, thank you), but to defend the Left from a trendy segment of itself. Like innumerable others from diverse backgrounds and disciplines, I call for the Left to reclaim its Enlightenment roots. We're worried above all for the social sciences and the humanities, not the natural sciences.   In their last two paragraphs, Robbins and Ross bring up a plethora of real issues, but it would take quite a bit of space to disentangle the substance from the rhetoric. They conflate science as an intellectual system with the social and economic role of science and technology. They conflate epistemic and ethical issues.   These confusions lead Robbins and Ross into a serious error: setting up an opposition between science and progressive politics. They describe science as a \"civil religion\" that supports existing social and political structures. It is of course true that scientific research is skewed by the influence of those with power and money. But a scientific worldview, based on a commitment to logic and standards of evidence and to the incessant confrontation of theories with reality, is an essential component of any progressive politics.   Despite these differences, there is a potentially vast common ground between Robbins-Ross and myself. When scientific research is increasingly funded by private corporations that have a financial interest in particular  outcomes of that research -- is the drug effective or not? -- scientific objectivity is undermined. (But to make this argument, one must first have a conception of objectivity: not as a state that human beings can ever attain, but as an ideal standard of comparison.) When universities are more interested in patent royalties than in the open sharing of scientific information, the public suffers. There are hundreds of important political and economic issues surrounding science and technology. Sociology of science, at its best, has done much to clarify these issues. But sloppy sociology, like sloppy science, is useless or even counterproductive."}, {"content": "What the Social Text Affair Does and Does Not Prove                   What the Social Text Affair    Does and Does Not Prove       Alan D.

My larger target is those  contemporaries who -- in repeated acts of wish-fulfillment --  have appropriated conclusions from the philosophy of science  and put them to work in aid of a variety of social cum political  causes for which those conclusions are ill adapted.  Feminists, religious apologists (including ``creation scientists''),  counterculturalists, neoconservatives, and a host of other curious  fellow-travelers have claimed to find crucial grist for their mills  in, for instance, the avowed incommensurability and underdetermination  of scientific theories.  The displacement of the idea that facts and evidence matter  by the idea that everything boils down to subjective interests  and perspectives is -- second only to American political campaigns --  the most prominent and pernicious manifestation of anti-intellectualism  in our time.      -- Larry Laudan, Science and Relativism [1]           I confess to some embarrassment at being asked to contribute an introductory essay to this collection of critical studies in the history, sociology and philosophy of science. After all, I'm neither a historian nor a sociologist nor a philosopher; I'm merely a theoretical physicist with an amateur interest in the philosophy of science and perhaps some modest skill at thinking clearly.  Social Text co-founder Stanley Aronowitz was, alas, absolutely right when he called me ``ill-read and half-educated.'' [2]    My own contribution to this field began, as the reader undoubtedly knows, with an unorthodox (and admittedly uncontrolled) experiment. I wrote a parody of postmodern science criticism, entitled ``Transgressing the Boundaries: Toward a Transformative Hermeneutics of Quantum Gravity'', and submitted it to the cultural-studies journal Social Text  (of course without telling the editors that it was a parody). They published it as a serious scholarly article in their spring 1996 special issue devoted to what they call the ``Science Wars''. [3]  Three weeks later I revealed the hoax in an article in  Lingua Franca [4] , and all hell broke loose. [5]    In this essay I'd like to discuss briefly what I think the `` Social Text affair'' does and does not prove. But first, to fend off the accusation that I'm an arrogant physicist who rejects all sociological intrusion on our ``turf'', I'd like to lay out some positive things that I think social studies of science can accomplish. The following propositions are, I hope, noncontroversial:   1) Science is a human endeavor, and like any other human endeavor it merits being subjected to rigorous social analysis. Which research problems count as important; how research funds are distributed; who gets prestige and power; what role scientific expertise plays in public-policy debates; in what form scientific knowledge becomes embodied in technology, and for whose benefit -- all these issues are strongly affected by political, economic and to some extent ideological considerations, as well as by the internal logic of scientific inquiry. They are thus fruitful subjects for empirical study by historians, sociologists, political scientists and economists.   2) At a more subtle level, even the content of scientific debate -- what types of theories can be conceived and entertained, what criteria are to be used for deciding between competing theories -- is constrained in part by the prevailing attitudes of mind, which in turn arise in part from deep-seated historical factors. It is the task of historians and sociologists of science to sort out, in each specific instance, the roles played by ``external'' and ``internal'' factors in determining the course of scientific development. Not surprisingly, scientists tend to stress the ``internal'' factors while sociologists tend to stress the ``external'', if only because each group tends to have a poor grasp on the other group's concepts. But these problems are perfectly amenable to rational debate.   3) There is nothing wrong with research informed by a political commitment, as long as that commitment does not blind the researcher to inconvenient facts. Thus, there is a long and honorable tradition of socio-political critique of science [6] , including antiracist critiques of anthropological pseudo-science and eugenics [7]  and feminist critiques of psychology and parts of medicine and biology. [8]  These critiques typically follow a standard pattern: First one shows, using conventional scientific arguments, why the research in question is flawed  according to the ordinary canons of good science ; then, and only then , one attempts to explain how the researchers' social prejudices (which may well have been unconscious) led them to violate these canons. Of course, each such critique has to stand or fall on its own merits; having good political intentions doesn't guarantee that one's analysis will constitute good science, good sociology or good history. But this general two-step approach is, I think, sound; and empirical studies of this kind, if conducted with due intellectual rigor, could shed useful light on the social conditions under which good science (defined normatively as the search for truths or at least approximate truths about the world) is fostered or hindered. [9]    Now, I don't want to claim that these three points exhaust  the field of fruitful inquiry for historians and sociologists of science, but they certainly do lay out a big and important area. And yet, some sociologists and literary intellectuals over the past two decades have gotten greedier: roughly speaking, they want to attack the normative conception of scientific inquiry as a search for truths or approximate truths about the world; they want to see science as just another social practice, which produces ``narrations'' and ``myths'' that are no more valid than those produced by other social practices; and some of them want to argue further that these social practices encode a bourgeois and/or Eurocentric and/or masculinist world-view. Of course, like all brief summaries this one is an oversimplification; and in any case there is no canonical doctrine in the ``new'' sociology of science, just a bewildering variety of individuals and schools. More importantly, the task of summarization is here made more difficult by the fact that this literature is often ambiguous in crucial ways about its most fundamental claims (as I'll illustrate later using the cases of Latour and Barnes-Bloor). Still, I think most scientists and philosophers of science would be astonished to learn that ``the natural world has a small or non-existent role in the construction of scientific knowledge'', as prominent sociologist of science Harry Collins claims [10] ; or that ``reality is the consequence rather than the cause'' of the so-called ``social construction of facts'', as Bruno Latour and Steve Woolgar assert. [11]          With this preamble out of the way, I'd now like to consider what (if anything) the `` Social Text affair'' proves -- and also what it does not prove, because some of my over-enthusiastic supporters have claimed too much. In this analysis, it's crucial to distinguish between what can be deduced from the fact of publication  and what can be deduced from the content of the article .    From the mere fact of publication of my parody I think that not much can be deduced. It doesn't prove that the whole field of cultural studies, or cultural studies of science -- much less sociology of science -- is nonsense. Nor does it prove that the intellectual standards in these fields are generally lax. (This might be the case, but it would have to be established  on other grounds.) It proves only that the editors of one rather marginal journal were derelict in their intellectual duty, by publishing an article on quantum physics that they admit they could not understand, without bothering to get an opinion from anyone knowledgeable in quantum physics, solely because it came from a ``conveniently credentialed ally'' (as Social Text co-editor Bruce Robbins  later candidly admitted [12] ), flattered the editors' ideological preconceptions, and attacked their ``enemies''. [13]    To which, one might justifiably respond: So what? [14]    The answer comes from examining the content of the parody. In this regard, one important point has gotten lost in much of the discussion of my article: Yes, the article is screamingly funny -- I'm not modest, I'm proud of my work -- but the most hilarious parts of my article were not written by me. Rather, they're direct quotes from the postmodern Masters, whom I shower with mock praise. In fact, the article is structured around the silliest quotations I could find about mathematics and physics (and the philosophy of mathematics and physics) from some of the most prominent French and American intellectuals; my only contribution was to invent a nonsensical argument linking these quotations together and praising them. This involved, of course, advocating an incoherent mishmash of trendy ideas -- deconstructive literary theory, New Age ecology, so-called ``feminist epistemology'' [15] , extreme social-constructivist philosophy of science, even Lacanian psychoanalysis -- but that just made the parody all the more fun. Indeed, in some cases I took the liberty of parodying extreme or ambiguously stated versions of views that I myself hold in a more moderate and precisely stated form.   Now, what precisely do I mean by ``silliness''? Here's a very rough categorization: First of all, one has meaningless or absurd statements ,  name-dropping , and the display of false erudition . Secondly, one has sloppy thinking and poor philosophy , which come together notably (though not always) in the form of glib relativism .   The first of these categories wouldn't be so important, perhaps, if we were dealing with a few assistant professors of literature making fools of themselves holding forth on quantum mechanics or G&#246;del's theorem. It becomes more relevant because we're dealing with important intellectuals, at least as measured by shelf space in the cultural-studies section of university bookstores. Here, for instance, are Gilles Deleuze and F&#233;lix Guattari holding forth on chaos theory:     To slow down is to set a limit in chaos   to which all speeds are subject, so that they form a variable   determined as abscissa, at the same time as the limit forms a   universal constant that cannot be gone beyond (for example, a maximum   degree of contraction). The first functives are therefore the   limit and the variable, and reference is a relationship between   values of the variable or, more profoundly, the relationship of the   variable, as abscissa of speeds,   with the limit. [16]    And there's much more -- Jacques Lacan and Luce Irigaray on differential topology, Jean-Fran&#231;ois Lyotard on cosmology, Michel Serres on nonlinear time -- but let me not spoil the fun. [17]  (By the way, if you worry that I'm quoting out of context, just follow my footnotes, look up the originals, and decide for yourself. You'll find that these passages are even worse in context than out of context.)   Nor is all the nonsense of French origin. Connoisseurs of fashionable American work in the Cultural Studies of Science will, I think, find ample food for thought.   Fine, the Science Studies contingent might now object: maybe some of our friends in the English Department take Lacan or Deleuze seriously, but no one in our community does. True enough; but then take a look at Bruno Latour's semiotic analysis of the theory of relativity, published in Social Studies of Science , in which ``Einstein's text is read as a contribution to the sociology of delegation''. [18]  Why's that? Because Latour finds Einstein's popular book on relativity full of situations in which the author delegates one observer to stand on the platform and make certain measurements, and another observer to stand on the train and make certain measurements; and of course the results won't obey the Lorentz transformations unless the two observers do what they're told! You think I exaggerate? Latour emphasizes Einstein's     obsession with transporting in formation through   trans formations without de formation;   his passion for the precise superimposition of readings;   his panic at the idea that observers sent away might betray,   might retain privileges, and send reports that could not be   used to expand our knowledge; his desire to discipline the   delegated observers and to turn them into dependent pieces   of apparatus that do nothing but watch the coincidence of   hands and notches ... [19]    Furthermore, because Latour doesn't understand what the term ``frame of reference'' means in physics -- he confuses it with ``actor'' in semiotics -- he claims that relativity cannot deal with the transformation laws between two frames of reference, but needs at least three :     If there are only one, or even two , frames of reference,   no solution can be found ...    Einstein's solution is to consider three actors:   one in the train, one on the   embankment and a third one, the author [enunciator] or one   of its representants, who tries to superimpose the coded   observations sent back by   the two others. [20]    Finally, Latour somehow got the idea that relativity concerns the problems raised by the relative location  (rather than the relative motion ) of different observers. (Of course, even the word ``observer'' here is potentially misleading;  it belongs to the pedagogy of relativity, not to the theory itself.) Here is Latour's summary of the meaning of relativity:     provided the two relativities [special and general] are accepted,  more frames of reference with less privilege can be accessed, reduced,  accumulated and combined, observers can be delegated to a few more  places in the infinitely large (the cosmos) and the infinitely small  (electrons), and the readings they send will be understandable.  His [Einstein's] book could well be titled: ``New Instructions for  Bringing Back Long-Distance  Scientific Travellers''. [21]    I needn't pursue the point: Professor Huth's essay in this volume provides a sober and detailed exegesis of Latour's confusions about relativity. The upshot is that Latour has produced 40 pages of comical misunderstandings of a theory that is nowadays routinely taught to intelligent college freshmen, and Social Studies of Science  found it a worthy scholarly contribution.   OK, enough for examples of nonsense (although a lot more are available). More interesting intellectually, I think, are the sloppy thinking and glib relativism that have become prevalent in many parts of Science Studies (albeit not , by and large, among serious philosophers of science). When one analyzes these writings, one often finds radical-sounding assertions whose meaning is ambiguous, and which can be given two alternate readings: one as interesting, radical, and grossly false; the other as boring and trivially true.   Let me start again with Latour, this time taken from his book Science in Action , in which he develops seven Rules of Method for the sociologist of science. Here is his Third Rule of Method:   Since the settlement of a controversy is the cause of Nature's representation, not the consequence, we can never use the outcome -- Nature -- to explain how and why a controversy has been settled. [22]    Note how Latour slips, without comment or argument, from ``Nature's representation'' in the first half of this sentence to ``Nature'' tout court in the second half. If we were to read ``Nature's representation'' in both halves, then we'd have the truism that scientists' representations of Nature (that is, their theories) are arrived at by a social process, and that the course and outcome of that social process can't be explained simply by its outcome. If, on the other hand, we take seriously ``Nature'' in the second half, linked as it is to the word ``outcome'', then we would have the claim that the external world is created by scientists' negotiations: a claim that is bizarre to say the least, given that the external world has been around for about 10 billion years longer than the human race. [23]  Finally, if we take seriously ``Nature'' in the second half but expunge the word ``outcome'' preceding it, then we would have either (a) the weak (and trivially true) claim that the course and outcome of a scientific controversy cannot be explained  solely by the nature of the external world (obviously some social factors play a role, if only in determining which experiments are technologically feasible at a given time, not to mention other, more subtle social influences); or (b) the strong (and manifestly false) claim that the nature of the external world plays no role in constraining the course and outcome of a scientific controversy. [24]    On the other hand, if we apply the First Rule of Interpretation of Postmodern Academic Writing -- ``no sentence means what it says'' -- we can perhaps make sense of Latour's dictum. Let's read it not as a philosophical principle, but rather as a methodological principle for a sociologist of science -- more precisely, for a sociologist of science who does not have the scientific competence to make an independent assessment of whether the experimental/observational data do in fact warrant the conclusions the scientific community has drawn from them. (The principle applies with particular force when such a sociologist is studying contemporary science, because in this case there is no other scientific community besides the one under study who could provide such an independent assessment. By contrast, for studies of the distant past, one can always look at what subsequent scientists learned, including the results from experiments going beyond those originally performed.) In such a situation, the sociologist will be understandably reluctant to say that ``the scientific community under study came to conclusion X because X is the way the world really is'' --  even if it is in fact the case  that X is the way the world is and that is the reason the scientists came to believe it -- because the sociologist has no independent  grounds to believe that X is the way the world really is other than the fact that the scientific community under study came to believe it.   Of course, the sensible conclusion to draw from this cul de sac  is that sociologists of science ought not to study scientific controversies on which they lack the competence to make an independent assessment of the facts, if there is no other (for example, historically later) scientific community on which they could justifiably rely for such an independent assessment. But it goes without saying that Latour and his colleagues would not enjoy this conclusion, because their goal, as Steve Fuller put it, is to ``employ methods that enable them to fathom both the `inner workings' and the `outer character' of science without having to be expert in the fields they study.'' [25]    It seems to me that much sloppy thinking in Science Studies, like that in Latour's Third Rule of Method, involves conflating concepts that need to be distinguished. Most frequently this conflation is accomplished by terminological fiat: the author intentionally uses an old word or phrase in a radically new sense, thereby undermining any attempt to distinguish between the two meanings. The clear goal here is to achieve by definition what one could not achieve by logic. For example, one often finds phrases like ``the social construction of facts'' [26]  that intentionally elide the distinction between facts and our knowledge of them. Or to take another example, philosophers usually understand the word ``knowledge'' to mean ``justified true belief'' or some similar concept; but Barry Barnes and David Bloor redefine ``knowledge'' to mean ``any collectively accepted system of belief''. [27]  Now, perhaps Barnes and Bloor are uninterested in inquiring whether a given belief is true or rationally justified [28] ; but if they think these properties of beliefs are irrelevant  for their purposes, then they should say so and explain why, without confusing the issue by redefining words. [29]    More generally, it seems to me that much sloppy thinking in Science Studies involves conflating two or more of the following levels of analysis:       Ontology.     What objects exist in the world? What    statements about these objects are true ?     Epistemology.     How can human beings obtain knowledge     of truths about the world? How can they assess    the reliability of that knowledge?     Sociology of knowledge.     To what extent are the truths known (or    knowable ) by humans in any given society    influenced (or determined) by social, economic,    political, cultural and ideological factors? Same    question for the false statements erroneously    believed to be true.     Individual ethics.     What types of research ought a scientist    (or technologist) to undertake (or refuse to    undertake)?     Social ethics.     What types of research ought society to    encourage, subsidize or publicly fund (or    alternatively to discourage, tax or forbid)?     These questions are obviously related -- for example, if there are no objective truths about the world, then there isn't much point in asking how one can know those (nonexistent) truths -- but they are conceptually distinct.   For example, Sandra Harding [30]  (citing the work of Paul Forman [31] ) points out that American research in the 1940s and 50s on quantum electronics was motivated in large part by potential military applications. True enough. Now, quantum mechanics made possible solid-state physics, which in turn made possible quantum electronics (e.g. the transistor), which made possible nearly all of modern technology (e.g. the computer). And the computer has had applications that are beneficial to society (e.g. in allowing the postmodern cultural critic to produce her articles more efficiently) as well as applications that are harmful (e.g. in allowing the U.S. military to kill human beings more efficiently). This raises a host of social and individual ethical questions: Ought society to forbid (or discourage) certain applications of computers? Forbid (or discourage) research on computers per se ? Forbid (or discourage) research on quantum electronics? On solid-state physics? On quantum mechanics? And likewise for individual scientists and technologists. (Clearly, an affirmative answer to these questions becomes harder to justify as one goes down the list; but I do not want to declare any of these questions a priori  illegitimate.) Likewise, sociological questions arise, for example: To what extent is our (true) knowledge of computer science, quantum electronics, solid-state physics and quantum mechanics -- and our lack of knowledge about other scientific subjects, e.g. the global climate -- a result of public-policy choices favoring militarism? To what extent have the erroneous theories (if any) in computer science, quantum electronics, solid-state physics and quantum mechanics been the result (in whole or in part) of social, economic, political, cultural and ideological factors, in particular the culture of militarism? [32]  These are all serious questions, which deserve careful investigation adhering to the highest standards of scientific and historical evidence.  But they have no effect whatsoever on the  underlying scientific questions:  whether atoms (and silicon crystals, transistors and computers) really do behave according to the laws of quantum mechanics (and solid-state physics, quantum electronics and computer science). The militaristic orientation of American science has quite simply no bearing whatsoever on the ontological question, and only under a wildly implausible scenario could it have any bearing on the epistemological question. (E.g. if the worldwide community of solid-state physicists, following what they believe to be the conventional standards of scientific evidence, were to hastily accept an erroneous theory of semiconductor behavior because of their enthusiasm for the breakthrough in military technology that this theory would make possible.)   The extreme versions of social constructivism and relativism -- such as the Edinburgh ``strong programme'' -- are, I think, largely based on the same failure to distinguish clearly between ontology, epistemology, and the sociology of knowledge. Here is how Barnes and Bloor describe the form  of relativism that they defend:    Our equivalence postulate is that all beliefs are on a par  with one another with respect to the causes of their credibility.  It is not that all beliefs are equally true or equally false,  but that regardless of truth and falsity the fact of their  credibility is to be seen as equally problematic.  The position we shall defend is that the incidence of all beliefs  without exception calls for empirical investigation and must be  accounted for by finding the specific, local causes of this credibility.  This means that regardless of whether the sociologist evaluates a belief  as true or rational, or as false and irrational, he must search for  the causes of its credibility. ... All these questions can, and should,  be answered without regard to the status of the belief as it is judged  and evaluated by the sociologist's  own standards. [33]    It seems clear from this passage, as well as from the paragraph that precedes it, that Barnes and Bloor are not advocating an ontological relativism: they recognize that ``to say that all beliefs are equally true encounters the problem of how to handle beliefs which contradict one another'', and that ``to say that all beliefs are equally false poses the problem of the status of the relativist's own claims.'' [34]  They might be advocating an epistemological relativism -- that all beliefs are equally credible, or equally rational -- and indeed, their attack on the universal validity of even the simplest rules of deductive inference (such as modus ponens ) lends some support to this interpretation. [35]  But more likely what they are advocating is some form of  methodological relativism for sociologists of knowledge. The problem is, what form?   If the claim were merely that we should use the same principles of sociology and psychology to explain the causation of all beliefs irrespective of whether we evaluate them as true or false, rational or irrational, then I would have no particular objection (though one might have qualms about the hyper-scientistic attitude that human beliefs are always to be explained causally through social science). But if the claim is that only social causes can enter into such an explanation -- that the way the world is cannot enter -- then I cannot disagree more strenuously. [36]    Let's take a concrete example: Why did the European scientific community become persuaded of the truth of Newtonian mechanics somewhere between 1700 and 1750? Undoubtedly a variety of historical, sociological, ideological and political factors must play a role in this explanation -- one must explain, for example, why Newtonian mechanics was accepted quickly in England but more slowly in France [37]  -- but certainly some part of the explanation (and a rather important part at that) must be that the planets and comets really do move (to a very high degree of approximation, though not exactly) as predicted by Newtonian mechanics. [38]  Or to take another example: Why did the majority view in the European and North American scientific communities shift from creationism to Darwinism over the course of the century? Again, numerous historical, sociological, ideological and political factors will play a role in this explanation; but can one plausibly explain this shift without  any reference to the fossil record or to the Gal&#225;pagos fauna?   In the unlikely event that the argument isn't already clear, here's a more homely example: Suppose we encounter a man running out of a lecture hall screaming at the top of his lungs that there's a stampeding herd of elephants in there. What we are to make of this assertion, and in particular how we are to evaluate its ``causes'', should, I think, depend heavily on whether or not there is in fact a stampeding herd of elephants in there -- or, more precisely, since I admit that we have no direct, unmediated access to external reality -- whether when I and other people peek (cautiously!) into the room  we see or hear a stampeding herd of elephants (or the destruction that such a herd might recently have caused  before themselves exiting the room). If we do see such evidence of elephants, then the most plausible explanation of this set of observations is that there is (or was) in fact a  stampeding herd of elephants in the lecture hall, that the man saw and/or heard it, and that his subsequent fright (which we might well share under the circumstances) led him to exit the room in a hurry and to scream the assertion that we overheard. And our reaction would be to call the police and the zookeepers. If, on the other hand, our own observations reveal no evidence of elephants in the lecture hall, then the most plausible explanation is that there was not in fact a stampeding herd of elephants in the room, that the man imagined the elephants as a result of some psychosis (whether internally or chemically induced), and that this led him to exit the room in a hurry and to scream the assertion that we overheard. And we'd call the police and the psychiatrists. [39]  And I daresay that Barnes and Bloor, whatever they might write in journal articles for sociologists and philosophers, would do the same in real life.   The bottom line, it seems to me, is that there is no fundamental ``metaphysical'' difference between the epistemology of science and the epistemology of everyday life. Historians, detectives and plumbers -- indeed, all human beings -- use the same basic methods of induction, deduction, and assessment of evidence as do physicists or biochemists. Modern science tries to carry out these operations in a more careful and systematic way -- using controls and statistical tests, insisting on replication, and so forth -- but nothing more. [40]  Any philosophy of science -- or methodology for sociologists -- that is so blatantly wrong when applied to the epistemology of everyday life must be severely flawed at its core.   In summary, it seems to me that the ``strong programme'', like Latour's Third Rule of Method, is ambiguous in its intent; and, depending on how one resolves the ambiguity, it becomes either a valid and mildly interesting corrective to the most naive psychological and sociological notions -- reminding us that ``true beliefs have causes too'' -- or else a gross and blatant error.         Professor Kitcher concludes his contribution to this volume by saying, ``I doubt that this essay will please anyone, for it attempts to occupy middle ground.'' In this he's certainly too pessimistic, for there's at least one counterexample: his essay pleases me . Indeed, I agree with nearly everything in it.   Now, perhaps this means only that I too -- arrogant scientist though I may be -- am one of those select few occupying the ``middle ground''. But I suspect that in fact more of us occupy the ``middle ground'' in this debate than might at first appear. The point, of course, isn't to embrace ``middle ground'' (whatever that may be) abstractly and for its own sake, without regard to its content: that would be a grave dereliction of intellectual duty. [41]  But here the middle ground as set forth in Kitcher's essay -- based on a respect for both the ``realist-rationalist cluster'' and the ``socio-historical cluster'', even as we may debate their relative importance in specific cases -- is so eminently sensible that nearly all scientists [42]  and philosophers of science would give their assent, as would most (though apparently not all) sociologists of science. And this fact might give us some cause for reflection about the so-called -- and I think grossly misnamed -- ``Science Wars''.   The term was apparently first coined by Social Text co-editor Andrew Ross, who explained that ``the Science Wars [are] a second front opened up by conservatives cheered by the successes of their legions in the holy Culture Wars. Seeking explanations for their loss of standing in the public eye and the decline in funding from the public purse, conservatives in science have joined the backlash against the (new) usual suspects -- pinkos, feminists, and multiculturalists''. [43]  This theme was further elaborated in the now-famous special issue of Social Text . [44]  But, just as in the dreary ``culture wars'', the truth is rather more complicated than this Manichean portrayal would allow. The alleged one-to-one correspondence between epistemological and political views is a gross misrepresentation. [45]  So, too, is the idea that in this debate there are only two positions.   This conception of debate as combat is, in fact, probably the main reason why the Social Text editors fell for my parody. Acting not as intellectuals seeking the truth, but as self-appointed generals in the ``Science Wars'', they apparently leapt at the chance to get a ``real'' scientist on their ``side''. Now, ruing their blunder, they must surely feel a kinship with the Trojans.   But the military metaphor is a mistake; the Social Text editors are not my enemies. Ross has legitimate concerns about new technologies and about the increasingly unequal distribution of scientific expertise. Aronowitz raises important questions about technological unemployment and the possibility of a ``jobless future''. [46]  But, pace Ross, nothing is gained by denying the existence of objective scientific knowledge; it does exist, whether we like it or not. Political progressives should seek to have that knowledge distributed more democratically and to have it employed for socially useful ends. Indeed, the radical epistemological critique fatally undermines  the needed political critique, by removing its factual basis. After all, the only reason why nuclear weapons are a danger to anyone is that the theories of nuclear physics on which their design is based are, at least to a very high degree of approximation, objectively true . [47]    Science Studies' epistemological conceits are a diversion from the important matters that motivated Science Studies in the first place: namely, the social, economic and political roles of science and technology. To be sure, those conceits are not an accident; they have a history, which can be subjected to sociological study. [48]  But Science Studies practitioners are not obliged to persist in a misguided epistemology; they can give it up, and go on to the serious task of studying science. Perhaps, from the perspective of a few years from now, today's so-called ``Science Wars'' will turn out to have marked such a turning point.

[6]   I limit myself here to critiques  challenging the substantive content of scientific theories or methodology.  Other important types of critiques challenge the uses to which  scientific knowledge is put (e.g. in technology)  or the social structure of the scientific community.    [7]   See, for example,  Stephen Jay Gould, The Mismeasure of Man    (New York: Norton, 1981, 2nd ed. 1996).    [8]   See, for example,  Anne Fausto-Sterling, Myths of Gender: Biological Theories about   Women and Men (New York: Basic Books, 1985, 2nd ed. 1992);  Carol Tavris, The Mismeasure of Woman    (New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, 1992).    [9]   Of course, I don't mean to imply that the only (or even principal)  purpose of the history of science is to help working scientists.  History of science obviously has intrinsic value as a contribution  to the history of human society and human thought.  But it seems to me that history of science, when done well,  can also help working scientists.    [10]   H.M. Collins, ``Stages in the empirical programme of relativism'',   Social Studies of Science 11 (1981): 3-10,   quote at p. 3.  Two qualifications need to be made:  First, this statement is offered as part of Collins' introduction  to a set of studies (edited by him) employing the relativist approach,  and constitutes his summary of that approach;  he does not explicitly endorse this view,  though an endorsement seems implied by the context.  Second, while Collins appears to intend this assertion as an  empirical claim about the history of science,  it is possible that he intends it neither as an empirical claim  nor as a normative principle of epistemology,  but rather as a methodological injunction to sociologists  of science:  namely, to act as if   ``the natural world ha[d] a small or non-existent role in the  construction of scientific knowledge'',  or in other words to ignore (``bracket'')  whatever role the natural world may in fact play  in the construction of scientific knowledge.  I shall argue below, in discussing Barnes-Bloor,  that this approach is seriously deficient  as methodology for sociologists of science.

[14]   Indeed, a mainstream journal in the sociology of science  would almost certainly not have fallen for my parody.  (On the other hand, Social Studies of Science published  a long article on the theory of relativity which,  if it wasn't in fact a parody, might as well have been: see below.)  I chose Social Text because my primary motivation was  political : see Sokal, ``Afterword'' and ``A Plea'',  op. cit.

This ``rule'' is the culmination of an argument (pp. 96-99)  in which ontology, epistemology and the sociology of knowledge  are gradually conflated.    [23]   You might worry that here my argument is circular, in that it takes  for granted the truth of the current scientific consensus in  cosmology and paleontology. But this is not the case.  First of all, my phrase ``given that ...'' is a rhetorical flourish  that plays no essential role in the argument;  the idea that the external world is created by scientists' negotiations  is bizarre irrespective of the details of cosmology and paleontology.  Secondly, my phrase ``the external world has been around ...''  should, if one wants to be super-precise, be amended to read:  ``there is a vast body of extremely convincing (and diverse) evidence  in support of the belief that the external world has been around ...;  and if this belief is correct, then the claim that  the external world is created by scientists' negotiations  is bizarre to say the least.''  Indeed, all of my assertions of fact -  including ``today in New York it's raining'' -  should be glossed in this way.  Since I shall claim below that much contemporary work in Science Studies  elides the distinction between ontology and epistemology,  I don't want to leave myself open to the same accusation.

[32]   I certainly don't exclude the possibility that   present theories in any of these subjects might be  erroneous. But critics wishing to make such a case  would have to provide not only historical evidence of  the claimed cultural influence, but also   scientific evidence that the theory in question is  in fact erroneous. (The same evidentiary standards of  course apply to past erroneous theories; but  in this case the scientists may have already performed  the second task, relieving the cultural critic of the  need to do so from scratch.)

[36]   Bloor does state explicitly that ``Naturally there will be  other types of causes apart from social ones which will cooperate  in bringing about belief.'' [Bloor, op. cit. , p. 7]  The trouble is that he never makes explicit in what way   natural causes will be allowed to enter into the explanation of belief,  or what precisely the symmetry principle will mean in this context.  For a more detailed critique of Bloor's ambiguities  (from a philosophical point of view slightly different from mine),  see Larry Laudan, ``The pseudo-science of science?'',   Philosophy of the Social Sciences 11 (1981): 173-198.  See also Peter Slezak, ``A second look at David Bloor's   Knowledge and Social Imagery '',   Philosophy of the Social Sciences 24 (1994): 336-361.    [37]   The consensus of historians appears to be that  the slow acceptance of Newtonian mechanics in France  arose from scholastic attachment  to Cartesian theories as well as from certain theological considerations:  see, for example, Pierre Brunet, L'introduction des th&#233;ories de  Newton en France au XVIIIe si&#232;cle (Paris, 1931;  reprinted by Slatkine, Gen&#232;ve, 1970);  Betty Jo Teeter Dobbs and Margaret C. Jacob,  Newton and the Culture of Newtonianism   (Atlantic Highlands, New Jersey: Humanities Press, 1995).    [38]   Or more precisely: There is a vast body of extremely convincing  astronomical evidence in support of the belief that the  planets and comets  do move (to a very high degree of approximation, though not exactly)  as predicted by Newtonian mechanics;  and if this belief is correct, then  it is the fact of this motion (and not merely our belief in it)  that forms part of the explanation of why  the 18th-century European scientific community came to believe  in the truth of Newtonian mechanics.    [39]   For what it's worth, these decisions can presumably be justified  on Bayesian grounds, using our prior experience of the probability  of finding elephants in lecture halls, of the incidence of psychosis,  of the reliability of our own visual and auditory perceptions,  and so forth.    [40]   Please note: I am not claiming that inference from  scientific observations to scientific theories is as simple  or unproblematic as inference from seeing elephants in front of me  to the conclusion that elephants are in front of me.  (In truth, even this latter inference is not so simple or unproblematic:  to fully ground it requires some knowledge about optics  and about the mechanisms of human vision.)  As all practicing scientists and historians of science well know,  the reasoning from scientific observations to scientific theories  is far more indirect, and typically involves a vast web of  empirical evidence rather than a single observation.  My point is simply that in all of these cases --  Newtonian mechanics, Darwinian evolution, or elephants --  it is absurd to try to explain the ``causes'' of people's beliefs  without including the natural (non-social) world as one of those causes,  and a rather important one at that.    [41]   In American politics, the baleful consequences of such a search  for ``middle ground'' between two morally and intellectually bankrupt  (and indeed barely distinguishable) positions hardly need further comment.  ``Middle ground'' is, of course, meaningless until one specifies  between what ; and the corporate media's tacit definition  of the outer limits of respectable opinion is, of course, a large part  of the problem. On what grounds, for example, is single-payer  health insurance -- long in use in most industrialized countries --  defined as ``extreme'' and ``unrealistic'' in the United States?

Five of the essay titles (Martin, Nelkin, Franklin, Kovel, Aronowitz)  include the term ``Science Wars'',  and three more titles (Rose, Winner, Levidow)  contain assorted martial metaphors.    [45]   My own leftist political views are a matter of record,  as are those of many of my supporters  (e.g. Michael Albert, Barbara Epstein, Meera Nanda, Ruth Rosen and  James Weinstein, among many others).  Even Gross and Levitt, the original targets of Ross's wrath,  make clear that their political views are basically left-liberal;  they note that one of them (Levitt as it turns out)  is a member of Democratic Socialists of America  [Gross and Levitt, op. cit. , p. 261, note 7].

{"detail": [{"content": "Sokal's Reply to Social Text Editorial     Sokal's Reply to Social Text Editorial   I confess to amusement that one Social Text editor still doesn't believe my piece was a parody. Oh, well.   As for Social Text's editorial process, readers can judge for themselves the plausibility of the editors' post facto explanations, which if true may be more damning than the incident itself. Some of their chronology is at variance with the documentary record (e-mail and regular mail between Ross and myself, which I've saved), but let me not beat a dead horse.   More interesting than the scandal provoked by the article's acceptance  is, I think, the scandal that ought to be provoked by its content . My essay, aside from being (if I may quote Katha Pollitt's flattery) \"a hilarious compilation of pomo gibberish,\" is also an annotated bibliography of charlatanism and nonsense by dozens of prominent French and American intellectuals. This goes well beyond the narrow category of \"postmodernism,\" and includes some of the most fashionable thinkers in \"science studies,\" literary criticism, and cultural studies.    In short, there is a lot of sloppy thinking going around about \"social construction,\" often abetted by a vocabulary that intentionally elides the distinction between facts and our knowledge of them. I'm no expert in epistemology, but some of this work is so illogical that it doesn't take an expert to deconstruct it. I've analyzed one representative example in an Afterword submitted for publication in Social Text ; I hope the editors will print it, perhaps along with replies. I'd suggest they also invite contributions from philosophers far sharper than myself, such as Susan Haack and Janet Radcliffe Richards.   Robbins and Ross say that I \"declined to enter into a publishable dialogue\" with them. Quite the contrary: we're having that dialogue right now. What I declined was an oral dialogue, which in my opinion usually yields a low ratio of content to words.   Robbins and Ross guess wrong when they say I feel \"threatened\" by science-studies scholars. My goal isn't to defend science from the barbarian hordes of lit crit (we'll survive just fine, thank you), but to defend the Left from a trendy segment of itself. Like innumerable others from diverse backgrounds and disciplines, I call for the Left to reclaim its Enlightenment roots. We're worried above all for the social sciences and the humanities, not the natural sciences.   In their last two paragraphs, Robbins and Ross bring up a plethora of real issues, but it would take quite a bit of space to disentangle the substance from the rhetoric. They conflate science as an intellectual system with the social and economic role of science and technology. They conflate epistemic and ethical issues.   These confusions lead Robbins and Ross into a serious error: setting up an opposition between science and progressive politics. They describe science as a \"civil religion\" that supports existing social and political structures. It is of course true that scientific research is skewed by the influence of those with power and money. But a scientific worldview, based on a commitment to logic and standards of evidence and to the incessant confrontation of theories with reality, is an essential component of any progressive politics.   Despite these differences, there is a potentially vast common ground between Robbins-Ross and myself. When scientific research is increasingly funded by private corporations that have a financial interest in particular  outcomes of that research -- is the drug effective or not? -- scientific objectivity is undermined. (But to make this argument, one must first have a conception of objectivity: not as a state that human beings can ever attain, but as an ideal standard of comparison.) When universities are more interested in patent royalties than in the open sharing of scientific information, the public suffers. There are hundreds of important political and economic issues surrounding science and technology. Sociology of science, at its best, has done much to clarify these issues. But sloppy sociology, like sloppy science, is useless or even counterproductive."}, {"content": "What the Social Text Affair Does and Does Not Prove                   What the Social Text Affair    Does and Does Not Prove       Alan D.

My larger target is those  contemporaries who -- in repeated acts of wish-fulfillment --  have appropriated conclusions from the philosophy of science  and put them to work in aid of a variety of social cum political  causes for which those conclusions are ill adapted.  Feminists, religious apologists (including ``creation scientists''),  counterculturalists, neoconservatives, and a host of other curious  fellow-travelers have claimed to find crucial grist for their mills  in, for instance, the avowed incommensurability and underdetermination  of scientific theories.  The displacement of the idea that facts and evidence matter  by the idea that everything boils down to subjective interests  and perspectives is -- second only to American political campaigns --  the most prominent and pernicious manifestation of anti-intellectualism  in our time.      -- Larry Laudan, Science and Relativism [1]           I confess to some embarrassment at being asked to contribute an introductory essay to this collection of critical studies in the history, sociology and philosophy of science. After all, I'm neither a historian nor a sociologist nor a philosopher; I'm merely a theoretical physicist with an amateur interest in the philosophy of science and perhaps some modest skill at thinking clearly.  Social Text co-founder Stanley Aronowitz was, alas, absolutely right when he called me ``ill-read and half-educated.'' [2]    My own contribution to this field began, as the reader undoubtedly knows, with an unorthodox (and admittedly uncontrolled) experiment. I wrote a parody of postmodern science criticism, entitled ``Transgressing the Boundaries: Toward a Transformative Hermeneutics of Quantum Gravity'', and submitted it to the cultural-studies journal Social Text  (of course without telling the editors that it was a parody). They published it as a serious scholarly article in their spring 1996 special issue devoted to what they call the ``Science Wars''. [3]  Three weeks later I revealed the hoax in an article in  Lingua Franca [4] , and all hell broke loose. [5]    In this essay I'd like to discuss briefly what I think the `` Social Text affair'' does and does not prove. But first, to fend off the accusation that I'm an arrogant physicist who rejects all sociological intrusion on our ``turf'', I'd like to lay out some positive things that I think social studies of science can accomplish. The following propositions are, I hope, noncontroversial:   1) Science is a human endeavor, and like any other human endeavor it merits being subjected to rigorous social analysis. Which research problems count as important; how research funds are distributed; who gets prestige and power; what role scientific expertise plays in public-policy debates; in what form scientific knowledge becomes embodied in technology, and for whose benefit -- all these issues are strongly affected by political, economic and to some extent ideological considerations, as well as by the internal logic of scientific inquiry. They are thus fruitful subjects for empirical study by historians, sociologists, political scientists and economists.   2) At a more subtle level, even the content of scientific debate -- what types of theories can be conceived and entertained, what criteria are to be used for deciding between competing theories -- is constrained in part by the prevailing attitudes of mind, which in turn arise in part from deep-seated historical factors. It is the task of historians and sociologists of science to sort out, in each specific instance, the roles played by ``external'' and ``internal'' factors in determining the course of scientific development. Not surprisingly, scientists tend to stress the ``internal'' factors while sociologists tend to stress the ``external'', if only because each group tends to have a poor grasp on the other group's concepts. But these problems are perfectly amenable to rational debate.   3) There is nothing wrong with research informed by a political commitment, as long as that commitment does not blind the researcher to inconvenient facts. Thus, there is a long and honorable tradition of socio-political critique of science [6] , including antiracist critiques of anthropological pseudo-science and eugenics [7]  and feminist critiques of psychology and parts of medicine and biology. [8]  These critiques typically follow a standard pattern: First one shows, using conventional scientific arguments, why the research in question is flawed  according to the ordinary canons of good science ; then, and only then , one attempts to explain how the researchers' social prejudices (which may well have been unconscious) led them to violate these canons. Of course, each such critique has to stand or fall on its own merits; having good political intentions doesn't guarantee that one's analysis will constitute good science, good sociology or good history. But this general two-step approach is, I think, sound; and empirical studies of this kind, if conducted with due intellectual rigor, could shed useful light on the social conditions under which good science (defined normatively as the search for truths or at least approximate truths about the world) is fostered or hindered. [9]    Now, I don't want to claim that these three points exhaust  the field of fruitful inquiry for historians and sociologists of science, but they certainly do lay out a big and important area. And yet, some sociologists and literary intellectuals over the past two decades have gotten greedier: roughly speaking, they want to attack the normative conception of scientific inquiry as a search for truths or approximate truths about the world; they want to see science as just another social practice, which produces ``narrations'' and ``myths'' that are no more valid than those produced by other social practices; and some of them want to argue further that these social practices encode a bourgeois and/or Eurocentric and/or masculinist world-view. Of course, like all brief summaries this one is an oversimplification; and in any case there is no canonical doctrine in the ``new'' sociology of science, just a bewildering variety of individuals and schools. More importantly, the task of summarization is here made more difficult by the fact that this literature is often ambiguous in crucial ways about its most fundamental claims (as I'll illustrate later using the cases of Latour and Barnes-Bloor). Still, I think most scientists and philosophers of science would be astonished to learn that ``the natural world has a small or non-existent role in the construction of scientific knowledge'', as prominent sociologist of science Harry Collins claims [10] ; or that ``reality is the consequence rather than the cause'' of the so-called ``social construction of facts'', as Bruno Latour and Steve Woolgar assert. [11]          With this preamble out of the way, I'd now like to consider what (if anything) the `` Social Text affair'' proves -- and also what it does not prove, because some of my over-enthusiastic supporters have claimed too much. In this analysis, it's crucial to distinguish between what can be deduced from the fact of publication  and what can be deduced from the content of the article .    From the mere fact of publication of my parody I think that not much can be deduced. It doesn't prove that the whole field of cultural studies, or cultural studies of science -- much less sociology of science -- is nonsense. Nor does it prove that the intellectual standards in these fields are generally lax. (This might be the case, but it would have to be established  on other grounds.) It proves only that the editors of one rather marginal journal were derelict in their intellectual duty, by publishing an article on quantum physics that they admit they could not understand, without bothering to get an opinion from anyone knowledgeable in quantum physics, solely because it came from a ``conveniently credentialed ally'' (as Social Text co-editor Bruce Robbins  later candidly admitted [12] ), flattered the editors' ideological preconceptions, and attacked their ``enemies''. [13]    To which, one might justifiably respond: So what? [14]    The answer comes from examining the content of the parody. In this regard, one important point has gotten lost in much of the discussion of my article: Yes, the article is screamingly funny -- I'm not modest, I'm proud of my work -- but the most hilarious parts of my article were not written by me. Rather, they're direct quotes from the postmodern Masters, whom I shower with mock praise. In fact, the article is structured around the silliest quotations I could find about mathematics and physics (and the philosophy of mathematics and physics) from some of the most prominent French and American intellectuals; my only contribution was to invent a nonsensical argument linking these quotations together and praising them. This involved, of course, advocating an incoherent mishmash of trendy ideas -- deconstructive literary theory, New Age ecology, so-called ``feminist epistemology'' [15] , extreme social-constructivist philosophy of science, even Lacanian psychoanalysis -- but that just made the parody all the more fun. Indeed, in some cases I took the liberty of parodying extreme or ambiguously stated versions of views that I myself hold in a more moderate and precisely stated form.   Now, what precisely do I mean by ``silliness''? Here's a very rough categorization: First of all, one has meaningless or absurd statements ,  name-dropping , and the display of false erudition . Secondly, one has sloppy thinking and poor philosophy , which come together notably (though not always) in the form of glib relativism .   The first of these categories wouldn't be so important, perhaps, if we were dealing with a few assistant professors of literature making fools of themselves holding forth on quantum mechanics or G&#246;del's theorem. It becomes more relevant because we're dealing with important intellectuals, at least as measured by shelf space in the cultural-studies section of university bookstores. Here, for instance, are Gilles Deleuze and F&#233;lix Guattari holding forth on chaos theory:     To slow down is to set a limit in chaos   to which all speeds are subject, so that they form a variable   determined as abscissa, at the same time as the limit forms a   universal constant that cannot be gone beyond (for example, a maximum   degree of contraction). The first functives are therefore the   limit and the variable, and reference is a relationship between   values of the variable or, more profoundly, the relationship of the   variable, as abscissa of speeds,   with the limit. [16]    And there's much more -- Jacques Lacan and Luce Irigaray on differential topology, Jean-Fran&#231;ois Lyotard on cosmology, Michel Serres on nonlinear time -- but let me not spoil the fun. [17]  (By the way, if you worry that I'm quoting out of context, just follow my footnotes, look up the originals, and decide for yourself. You'll find that these passages are even worse in context than out of context.)   Nor is all the nonsense of French origin. Connoisseurs of fashionable American work in the Cultural Studies of Science will, I think, find ample food for thought.   Fine, the Science Studies contingent might now object: maybe some of our friends in the English Department take Lacan or Deleuze seriously, but no one in our community does. True enough; but then take a look at Bruno Latour's semiotic analysis of the theory of relativity, published in Social Studies of Science , in which ``Einstein's text is read as a contribution to the sociology of delegation''. [18]  Why's that? Because Latour finds Einstein's popular book on relativity full of situations in which the author delegates one observer to stand on the platform and make certain measurements, and another observer to stand on the train and make certain measurements; and of course the results won't obey the Lorentz transformations unless the two observers do what they're told! You think I exaggerate? Latour emphasizes Einstein's     obsession with transporting in formation through   trans formations without de formation;   his passion for the precise superimposition of readings;   his panic at the idea that observers sent away might betray,   might retain privileges, and send reports that could not be   used to expand our knowledge; his desire to discipline the   delegated observers and to turn them into dependent pieces   of apparatus that do nothing but watch the coincidence of   hands and notches ... [19]    Furthermore, because Latour doesn't understand what the term ``frame of reference'' means in physics -- he confuses it with ``actor'' in semiotics -- he claims that relativity cannot deal with the transformation laws between two frames of reference, but needs at least three :     If there are only one, or even two , frames of reference,   no solution can be found ...    Einstein's solution is to consider three actors:   one in the train, one on the   embankment and a third one, the author [enunciator] or one   of its representants, who tries to superimpose the coded   observations sent back by   the two others. [20]    Finally, Latour somehow got the idea that relativity concerns the problems raised by the relative location  (rather than the relative motion ) of different observers. (Of course, even the word ``observer'' here is potentially misleading;  it belongs to the pedagogy of relativity, not to the theory itself.) Here is Latour's summary of the meaning of relativity:     provided the two relativities [special and general] are accepted,  more frames of reference with less privilege can be accessed, reduced,  accumulated and combined, observers can be delegated to a few more  places in the infinitely large (the cosmos) and the infinitely small  (electrons), and the readings they send will be understandable.  His [Einstein's] book could well be titled: ``New Instructions for  Bringing Back Long-Distance  Scientific Travellers''. [21]    I needn't pursue the point: Professor Huth's essay in this volume provides a sober and detailed exegesis of Latour's confusions about relativity. The upshot is that Latour has produced 40 pages of comical misunderstandings of a theory that is nowadays routinely taught to intelligent college freshmen, and Social Studies of Science  found it a worthy scholarly contribution.   OK, enough for examples of nonsense (although a lot more are available). More interesting intellectually, I think, are the sloppy thinking and glib relativism that have become prevalent in many parts of Science Studies (albeit not , by and large, among serious philosophers of science). When one analyzes these writings, one often finds radical-sounding assertions whose meaning is ambiguous, and which can be given two alternate readings: one as interesting, radical, and grossly false; the other as boring and trivially true.   Let me start again with Latour, this time taken from his book Science in Action , in which he develops seven Rules of Method for the sociologist of science. Here is his Third Rule of Method:   Since the settlement of a controversy is the cause of Nature's representation, not the consequence, we can never use the outcome -- Nature -- to explain how and why a controversy has been settled. [22]    Note how Latour slips, without comment or argument, from ``Nature's representation'' in the first half of this sentence to ``Nature'' tout court in the second half. If we were to read ``Nature's representation'' in both halves, then we'd have the truism that scientists' representations of Nature (that is, their theories) are arrived at by a social process, and that the course and outcome of that social process can't be explained simply by its outcome. If, on the other hand, we take seriously ``Nature'' in the second half, linked as it is to the word ``outcome'', then we would have the claim that the external world is created by scientists' negotiations: a claim that is bizarre to say the least, given that the external world has been around for about 10 billion years longer than the human race. [23]  Finally, if we take seriously ``Nature'' in the second half but expunge the word ``outcome'' preceding it, then we would have either (a) the weak (and trivially true) claim that the course and outcome of a scientific controversy cannot be explained  solely by the nature of the external world (obviously some social factors play a role, if only in determining which experiments are technologically feasible at a given time, not to mention other, more subtle social influences); or (b) the strong (and manifestly false) claim that the nature of the external world plays no role in constraining the course and outcome of a scientific controversy. [24]    On the other hand, if we apply the First Rule of Interpretation of Postmodern Academic Writing -- ``no sentence means what it says'' -- we can perhaps make sense of Latour's dictum. Let's read it not as a philosophical principle, but rather as a methodological principle for a sociologist of science -- more precisely, for a sociologist of science who does not have the scientific competence to make an independent assessment of whether the experimental/observational data do in fact warrant the conclusions the scientific community has drawn from them. (The principle applies with particular force when such a sociologist is studying contemporary science, because in this case there is no other scientific community besides the one under study who could provide such an independent assessment. By contrast, for studies of the distant past, one can always look at what subsequent scientists learned, including the results from experiments going beyond those originally performed.) In such a situation, the sociologist will be understandably reluctant to say that ``the scientific community under study came to conclusion X because X is the way the world really is'' --  even if it is in fact the case  that X is the way the world is and that is the reason the scientists came to believe it -- because the sociologist has no independent  grounds to believe that X is the way the world really is other than the fact that the scientific community under study came to believe it.   Of course, the sensible conclusion to draw from this cul de sac  is that sociologists of science ought not to study scientific controversies on which they lack the competence to make an independent assessment of the facts, if there is no other (for example, historically later) scientific community on which they could justifiably rely for such an independent assessment. But it goes without saying that Latour and his colleagues would not enjoy this conclusion, because their goal, as Steve Fuller put it, is to ``employ methods that enable them to fathom both the `inner workings' and the `outer character' of science without having to be expert in the fields they study.'' [25]    It seems to me that much sloppy thinking in Science Studies, like that in Latour's Third Rule of Method, involves conflating concepts that need to be distinguished. Most frequently this conflation is accomplished by terminological fiat: the author intentionally uses an old word or phrase in a radically new sense, thereby undermining any attempt to distinguish between the two meanings. The clear goal here is to achieve by definition what one could not achieve by logic. For example, one often finds phrases like ``the social construction of facts'' [26]  that intentionally elide the distinction between facts and our knowledge of them. Or to take another example, philosophers usually understand the word ``knowledge'' to mean ``justified true belief'' or some similar concept; but Barry Barnes and David Bloor redefine ``knowledge'' to mean ``any collectively accepted system of belief''. [27]  Now, perhaps Barnes and Bloor are uninterested in inquiring whether a given belief is true or rationally justified [28] ; but if they think these properties of beliefs are irrelevant  for their purposes, then they should say so and explain why, without confusing the issue by redefining words. [29]    More generally, it seems to me that much sloppy thinking in Science Studies involves conflating two or more of the following levels of analysis:       Ontology.     What objects exist in the world? What    statements about these objects are true ?     Epistemology.     How can human beings obtain knowledge     of truths about the world? How can they assess    the reliability of that knowledge?     Sociology of knowledge.     To what extent are the truths known (or    knowable ) by humans in any given society    influenced (or determined) by social, economic,    political, cultural and ideological factors? Same    question for the false statements erroneously    believed to be true.     Individual ethics.     What types of research ought a scientist    (or technologist) to undertake (or refuse to    undertake)?     Social ethics.     What types of research ought society to    encourage, subsidize or publicly fund (or    alternatively to discourage, tax or forbid)?     These questions are obviously related -- for example, if there are no objective truths about the world, then there isn't much point in asking how one can know those (nonexistent) truths -- but they are conceptually distinct.   For example, Sandra Harding [30]  (citing the work of Paul Forman [31] ) points out that American research in the 1940s and 50s on quantum electronics was motivated in large part by potential military applications. True enough. Now, quantum mechanics made possible solid-state physics, which in turn made possible quantum electronics (e.g. the transistor), which made possible nearly all of modern technology (e.g. the computer). And the computer has had applications that are beneficial to society (e.g. in allowing the postmodern cultural critic to produce her articles more efficiently) as well as applications that are harmful (e.g. in allowing the U.S. military to kill human beings more efficiently). This raises a host of social and individual ethical questions: Ought society to forbid (or discourage) certain applications of computers? Forbid (or discourage) research on computers per se ? Forbid (or discourage) research on quantum electronics? On solid-state physics? On quantum mechanics? And likewise for individual scientists and technologists. (Clearly, an affirmative answer to these questions becomes harder to justify as one goes down the list; but I do not want to declare any of these questions a priori  illegitimate.) Likewise, sociological questions arise, for example: To what extent is our (true) knowledge of computer science, quantum electronics, solid-state physics and quantum mechanics -- and our lack of knowledge about other scientific subjects, e.g. the global climate -- a result of public-policy choices favoring militarism? To what extent have the erroneous theories (if any) in computer science, quantum electronics, solid-state physics and quantum mechanics been the result (in whole or in part) of social, economic, political, cultural and ideological factors, in particular the culture of militarism? [32]  These are all serious questions, which deserve careful investigation adhering to the highest standards of scientific and historical evidence.  But they have no effect whatsoever on the  underlying scientific questions:  whether atoms (and silicon crystals, transistors and computers) really do behave according to the laws of quantum mechanics (and solid-state physics, quantum electronics and computer science). The militaristic orientation of American science has quite simply no bearing whatsoever on the ontological question, and only under a wildly implausible scenario could it have any bearing on the epistemological question. (E.g. if the worldwide community of solid-state physicists, following what they believe to be the conventional standards of scientific evidence, were to hastily accept an erroneous theory of semiconductor behavior because of their enthusiasm for the breakthrough in military technology that this theory would make possible.)   The extreme versions of social constructivism and relativism -- such as the Edinburgh ``strong programme'' -- are, I think, largely based on the same failure to distinguish clearly between ontology, epistemology, and the sociology of knowledge. Here is how Barnes and Bloor describe the form  of relativism that they defend:    Our equivalence postulate is that all beliefs are on a par  with one another with respect to the causes of their credibility.  It is not that all beliefs are equally true or equally false,  but that regardless of truth and falsity the fact of their  credibility is to be seen as equally problematic.  The position we shall defend is that the incidence of all beliefs  without exception calls for empirical investigation and must be  accounted for by finding the specific, local causes of this credibility.  This means that regardless of whether the sociologist evaluates a belief  as true or rational, or as false and irrational, he must search for  the causes of its credibility. ... All these questions can, and should,  be answered without regard to the status of the belief as it is judged  and evaluated by the sociologist's  own standards. [33]    It seems clear from this passage, as well as from the paragraph that precedes it, that Barnes and Bloor are not advocating an ontological relativism: they recognize that ``to say that all beliefs are equally true encounters the problem of how to handle beliefs which contradict one another'', and that ``to say that all beliefs are equally false poses the problem of the status of the relativist's own claims.'' [34]  They might be advocating an epistemological relativism -- that all beliefs are equally credible, or equally rational -- and indeed, their attack on the universal validity of even the simplest rules of deductive inference (such as modus ponens ) lends some support to this interpretation. [35]  But more likely what they are advocating is some form of  methodological relativism for sociologists of knowledge. The problem is, what form?   If the claim were merely that we should use the same principles of sociology and psychology to explain the causation of all beliefs irrespective of whether we evaluate them as true or false, rational or irrational, then I would have no particular objection (though one might have qualms about the hyper-scientistic attitude that human beliefs are always to be explained causally through social science). But if the claim is that only social causes can enter into such an explanation -- that the way the world is cannot enter -- then I cannot disagree more strenuously. [36]    Let's take a concrete example: Why did the European scientific community become persuaded of the truth of Newtonian mechanics somewhere between 1700 and 1750? Undoubtedly a variety of historical, sociological, ideological and political factors must play a role in this explanation -- one must explain, for example, why Newtonian mechanics was accepted quickly in England but more slowly in France [37]  -- but certainly some part of the explanation (and a rather important part at that) must be that the planets and comets really do move (to a very high degree of approximation, though not exactly) as predicted by Newtonian mechanics. [38]  Or to take another example: Why did the majority view in the European and North American scientific communities shift from creationism to Darwinism over the course of the century? Again, numerous historical, sociological, ideological and political factors will play a role in this explanation; but can one plausibly explain this shift without  any reference to the fossil record or to the Gal&#225;pagos fauna?   In the unlikely event that the argument isn't already clear, here's a more homely example: Suppose we encounter a man running out of a lecture hall screaming at the top of his lungs that there's a stampeding herd of elephants in there. What we are to make of this assertion, and in particular how we are to evaluate its ``causes'', should, I think, depend heavily on whether or not there is in fact a stampeding herd of elephants in there -- or, more precisely, since I admit that we have no direct, unmediated access to external reality -- whether when I and other people peek (cautiously!) into the room  we see or hear a stampeding herd of elephants (or the destruction that such a herd might recently have caused  before themselves exiting the room). If we do see such evidence of elephants, then the most plausible explanation of this set of observations is that there is (or was) in fact a  stampeding herd of elephants in the lecture hall, that the man saw and/or heard it, and that his subsequent fright (which we might well share under the circumstances) led him to exit the room in a hurry and to scream the assertion that we overheard. And our reaction would be to call the police and the zookeepers. If, on the other hand, our own observations reveal no evidence of elephants in the lecture hall, then the most plausible explanation is that there was not in fact a stampeding herd of elephants in the room, that the man imagined the elephants as a result of some psychosis (whether internally or chemically induced), and that this led him to exit the room in a hurry and to scream the assertion that we overheard. And we'd call the police and the psychiatrists. [39]  And I daresay that Barnes and Bloor, whatever they might write in journal articles for sociologists and philosophers, would do the same in real life.   The bottom line, it seems to me, is that there is no fundamental ``metaphysical'' difference between the epistemology of science and the epistemology of everyday life. Historians, detectives and plumbers -- indeed, all human beings -- use the same basic methods of induction, deduction, and assessment of evidence as do physicists or biochemists. Modern science tries to carry out these operations in a more careful and systematic way -- using controls and statistical tests, insisting on replication, and so forth -- but nothing more. [40]  Any philosophy of science -- or methodology for sociologists -- that is so blatantly wrong when applied to the epistemology of everyday life must be severely flawed at its core.   In summary, it seems to me that the ``strong programme'', like Latour's Third Rule of Method, is ambiguous in its intent; and, depending on how one resolves the ambiguity, it becomes either a valid and mildly interesting corrective to the most naive psychological and sociological notions -- reminding us that ``true beliefs have causes too'' -- or else a gross and blatant error.         Professor Kitcher concludes his contribution to this volume by saying, ``I doubt that this essay will please anyone, for it attempts to occupy middle ground.'' In this he's certainly too pessimistic, for there's at least one counterexample: his essay pleases me . Indeed, I agree with nearly everything in it.   Now, perhaps this means only that I too -- arrogant scientist though I may be -- am one of those select few occupying the ``middle ground''. But I suspect that in fact more of us occupy the ``middle ground'' in this debate than might at first appear. The point, of course, isn't to embrace ``middle ground'' (whatever that may be) abstractly and for its own sake, without regard to its content: that would be a grave dereliction of intellectual duty. [41]  But here the middle ground as set forth in Kitcher's essay -- based on a respect for both the ``realist-rationalist cluster'' and the ``socio-historical cluster'', even as we may debate their relative importance in specific cases -- is so eminently sensible that nearly all scientists [42]  and philosophers of science would give their assent, as would most (though apparently not all) sociologists of science. And this fact might give us some cause for reflection about the so-called -- and I think grossly misnamed -- ``Science Wars''.   The term was apparently first coined by Social Text co-editor Andrew Ross, who explained that ``the Science Wars [are] a second front opened up by conservatives cheered by the successes of their legions in the holy Culture Wars. Seeking explanations for their loss of standing in the public eye and the decline in funding from the public purse, conservatives in science have joined the backlash against the (new) usual suspects -- pinkos, feminists, and multiculturalists''. [43]  This theme was further elaborated in the now-famous special issue of Social Text . [44]  But, just as in the dreary ``culture wars'', the truth is rather more complicated than this Manichean portrayal would allow. The alleged one-to-one correspondence between epistemological and political views is a gross misrepresentation. [45]  So, too, is the idea that in this debate there are only two positions.   This conception of debate as combat is, in fact, probably the main reason why the Social Text editors fell for my parody. Acting not as intellectuals seeking the truth, but as self-appointed generals in the ``Science Wars'', they apparently leapt at the chance to get a ``real'' scientist on their ``side''. Now, ruing their blunder, they must surely feel a kinship with the Trojans.   But the military metaphor is a mistake; the Social Text editors are not my enemies. Ross has legitimate concerns about new technologies and about the increasingly unequal distribution of scientific expertise. Aronowitz raises important questions about technological unemployment and the possibility of a ``jobless future''. [46]  But, pace Ross, nothing is gained by denying the existence of objective scientific knowledge; it does exist, whether we like it or not. Political progressives should seek to have that knowledge distributed more democratically and to have it employed for socially useful ends. Indeed, the radical epistemological critique fatally undermines  the needed political critique, by removing its factual basis. After all, the only reason why nuclear weapons are a danger to anyone is that the theories of nuclear physics on which their design is based are, at least to a very high degree of approximation, objectively true . [47]    Science Studies' epistemological conceits are a diversion from the important matters that motivated Science Studies in the first place: namely, the social, economic and political roles of science and technology. To be sure, those conceits are not an accident; they have a history, which can be subjected to sociological study. [48]  But Science Studies practitioners are not obliged to persist in a misguided epistemology; they can give it up, and go on to the serious task of studying science. Perhaps, from the perspective of a few years from now, today's so-called ``Science Wars'' will turn out to have marked such a turning point.

[6]   I limit myself here to critiques  challenging the substantive content of scientific theories or methodology.  Other important types of critiques challenge the uses to which  scientific knowledge is put (e.g. in technology)  or the social structure of the scientific community.    [7]   See, for example,  Stephen Jay Gould, The Mismeasure of Man    (New York: Norton, 1981, 2nd ed. 1996).    [8]   See, for example,  Anne Fausto-Sterling, Myths of Gender: Biological Theories about   Women and Men (New York: Basic Books, 1985, 2nd ed. 1992);  Carol Tavris, The Mismeasure of Woman    (New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, 1992).    [9]   Of course, I don't mean to imply that the only (or even principal)  purpose of the history of science is to help working scientists.  History of science obviously has intrinsic value as a contribution  to the history of human society and human thought.  But it seems to me that history of science, when done well,  can also help working scientists.    [10]   H.M. Collins, ``Stages in the empirical programme of relativism'',   Social Studies of Science 11 (1981): 3-10,   quote at p. 3.  Two qualifications need to be made:  First, this statement is offered as part of Collins' introduction  to a set of studies (edited by him) employing the relativist approach,  and constitutes his summary of that approach;  he does not explicitly endorse this view,  though an endorsement seems implied by the context.  Second, while Collins appears to intend this assertion as an  empirical claim about the history of science,  it is possible that he intends it neither as an empirical claim  nor as a normative principle of epistemology,  but rather as a methodological injunction to sociologists  of science:  namely, to act as if   ``the natural world ha[d] a small or non-existent role in the  construction of scientific knowledge'',  or in other words to ignore (``bracket'')  whatever role the natural world may in fact play  in the construction of scientific knowledge.  I shall argue below, in discussing Barnes-Bloor,  that this approach is seriously deficient  as methodology for sociologists of science.

[13]   The ``Science Wars'' special issue of Social Text   was conceived primarily to attack  Paul R. Gross and Norman Levitt,   Higher Superstition:  The Academic Left and its Quarrels with Science   (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1994).  See Andrew Ross, ``Introduction'', Social Text #46/47    (spring/summer 1996): 1-13;  and see also Andrew Ross and Stanley Aronowitz,   unpublished letter to the author   (and to other contributors to the ``Science Wars'' issue),   March 8, 1995.    [14]   Indeed, a mainstream journal in the sociology of science  would almost certainly not have fallen for my parody.  (On the other hand, Social Studies of Science published  a long article on the theory of relativity which,  if it wasn't in fact a parody, might as well have been: see below.)  I chose Social Text because my primary motivation was  political : see Sokal, ``Afterword'' and ``A Plea'',  op. cit.     [15]   I emphasize that this term is a misnomer,  as these ideas are hotly debated among feminists,  among whom I include myself.

[22]   Bruno Latour, Science in Action: How to Follow Scientists  and Engineers through Society   (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1987),  pp. 99 and 258.  This ``rule'' is the culmination of an argument (pp. 96-99)  in which ontology, epistemology and the sociology of knowledge  are gradually conflated.    [23]   You might worry that here my argument is circular, in that it takes  for granted the truth of the current scientific consensus in  cosmology and paleontology. But this is not the case.  First of all, my phrase ``given that ...'' is a rhetorical flourish  that plays no essential role in the argument;  the idea that the external world is created by scientists' negotiations  is bizarre irrespective of the details of cosmology and paleontology.  Secondly, my phrase ``the external world has been around ...''  should, if one wants to be super-precise, be amended to read:  ``there is a vast body of extremely convincing (and diverse) evidence  in support of the belief that the external world has been around ...;  and if this belief is correct, then the claim that  the external world is created by scientists' negotiations  is bizarre to say the least.''  Indeed, all of my assertions of fact -  including ``today in New York it's raining'' -  should be glossed in this way.  Since I shall claim below that much contemporary work in Science Studies  elides the distinction between ontology and epistemology,  I don't want to leave myself open to the same accusation.    [24]   Re (b), the ``homely example'' in Gross and Levitt, op. cit. ,  pp. 57-58 makes the point clearly.

[29]   Note indeed how Bloor, only nine pages after enunciating  his non-standard definition of ``knowledge'',  reverts without comment to the standard definition of ``knowledge'',  which he contrasts with ``error'':  ``[I]t would be wrong to assume that the natural working of our  animal resources always produces knowledge.  They produce a mixture of knowledge and error  with equal naturalness ...''  [Bloor, op. cit. , p. 14].    [30]   Sandra Harding, Whose Science? Whose Knowledge?

[32]   I certainly don't exclude the possibility that   present theories in any of these subjects might be  erroneous. But critics wishing to make such a case  would have to provide not only historical evidence of  the claimed cultural influence, but also   scientific evidence that the theory in question is  in fact erroneous. (The same evidentiary standards of  course apply to past erroneous theories; but  in this case the scientists may have already performed  the second task, relieving the cultural critic of the  need to do so from scratch.)    [33]    Barnes and Bloor, op. cit. ,    quote at p. 23.    [34]   Ibid. , p. 22.    [35]   Ibid. , pp. 35-47.    [36]   Bloor does state explicitly that ``Naturally there will be  other types of causes apart from social ones which will cooperate  in bringing about belief.'' [Bloor, op. cit. , p. 7]  The trouble is that he never makes explicit in what way   natural causes will be allowed to enter into the explanation of belief,  or what precisely the symmetry principle will mean in this context.  For a more detailed critique of Bloor's ambiguities  (from a philosophical point of view slightly different from mine),  see Larry Laudan, ``The pseudo-science of science?'',   Philosophy of the Social Sciences 11 (1981): 173-198.  See also Peter Slezak, ``A second look at David Bloor's   Knowledge and Social Imagery '',   Philosophy of the Social Sciences 24 (1994): 336-361.    [37]   The consensus of historians appears to be that  the slow acceptance of Newtonian mechanics in France  arose from scholastic attachment  to Cartesian theories as well as from certain theological considerations:  see, for example, Pierre Brunet, L'introduction des th&#233;ories de  Newton en France au XVIIIe si&#232;cle (Paris, 1931;  reprinted by Slatkine, Gen&#232;ve, 1970);  Betty Jo Teeter Dobbs and Margaret C. Jacob,  Newton and the Culture of Newtonianism   (Atlantic Highlands, New Jersey: Humanities Press, 1995).    [38]   Or more precisely: There is a vast body of extremely convincing  astronomical evidence in support of the belief that the  planets and comets  do move (to a very high degree of approximation, though not exactly)  as predicted by Newtonian mechanics;  and if this belief is correct, then  it is the fact of this motion (and not merely our belief in it)  that forms part of the explanation of why  the 18th-century European scientific community came to believe  in the truth of Newtonian mechanics.    [39]   For what it's worth, these decisions can presumably be justified  on Bayesian grounds, using our prior experience of the probability  of finding elephants in lecture halls, of the incidence of psychosis,  of the reliability of our own visual and auditory perceptions,  and so forth.    [40]   Please note: I am not claiming that inference from  scientific observations to scientific theories is as simple  or unproblematic as inference from seeing elephants in front of me  to the conclusion that elephants are in front of me.  (In truth, even this latter inference is not so simple or unproblematic:  to fully ground it requires some knowledge about optics  and about the mechanisms of human vision.)  As all practicing scientists and historians of science well know,  the reasoning from scientific observations to scientific theories  is far more indirect, and typically involves a vast web of  empirical evidence rather than a single observation.  My point is simply that in all of these cases --  Newtonian mechanics, Darwinian evolution, or elephants --  it is absurd to try to explain the ``causes'' of people's beliefs  without including the natural (non-social) world as one of those causes,  and a rather important one at that.    [41]   In American politics, the baleful consequences of such a search  for ``middle ground'' between two morally and intellectually bankrupt  (and indeed barely distinguishable) positions hardly need further comment.  ``Middle ground'' is, of course, meaningless until one specifies  between what ; and the corporate media's tacit definition  of the outer limits of respectable opinion is, of course, a large part  of the problem. On what grounds, for example, is single-payer  health insurance -- long in use in most industrialized countries --  defined as ``extreme'' and ``unrealistic'' in the United States?    [42]   Including Gross and Levitt, as they make amply clear in their book  [ op. cit ].

Five of the essay titles (Martin, Nelkin, Franklin, Kovel, Aronowitz)  include the term ``Science Wars'',  and three more titles (Rose, Winner, Levidow)  contain assorted martial metaphors.    [45]   My own leftist political views are a matter of record,  as are those of many of my supporters  (e.g. Michael Albert, Barbara Epstein, Meera Nanda, Ruth Rosen and  James Weinstein, among many others).  Even Gross and Levitt, the original targets of Ross's wrath,  make clear that their political views are basically left-liberal;  they note that one of them (Levitt as it turns out)  is a member of Democratic Socialists of America  [Gross and Levitt, op. cit. , p. 261, note 7].

Here, for instance, is Nanda's response to the idea that we must   \"respect\" other people's faith:    I happen to believe that indulging people\u2019s irrational beliefs -- like a parent puts up with a child\u2019s follies -- does not add up to \u201crespect\u201d. In my rulebook, the best way to respect people you care about is to treat them as worthy conversation partners who can be persuaded by reason (or who may persuade you with better arguments and evidence). The way I see it, engaging people in an honest and open dialogue about the matters of ultimate concern is to pay them the highest grade of respect that there is.       \"The science wars redux\" ,  by Michael B&eacute;rub&eacute;   ( Democracy: A Journal of   Ideas , Issue #19, Winter 2011).

Highly recommended: \"This book is a lively, engrossing overview of the philosophical and political issues at stake in the current debates about science. Brown doesn't pull any punches in stating his own views, but he always takes care to present fairly even those arguments with which he disagrees. And he's an equal-opportunity debunker: scientists, sociologists and his fellow philosophers all come in for (mostly justified) criticism.\" See also my review of Who Rules in Science? , published in Science & Society 67, 111-113 (Spring 2003).

Highly recommended:   \"In this courageous and important book, Meera Nanda shows  in dispiriting detail how postmodernist-oriented  Indian intellectuals have unwittingly helped pave the way  for the rise to power of right-wing Hindu nationalists.

Bad Science ,   by Ben Goldacre    (Fourth Estate, September 2008, expanded edition April 2009).   A scary but light-hearted look at what passes for   science reporting in the British media   (including the so-called \"quality\" newspapers) --   along with a straightforward exposition of the tools   needed to make everyone a better bullshit detector.   Highly recommended.   See especially the   \"missing chapter\"    that was deleted from the original edition of the book   because of the scandalous   English libel laws .            Bad Pharma: How drug companies mislead doctors and harm patients ,   by Ben Goldacre    (Fourth Estate, September 2012, to be published in the U.S. in January 2013).   An even scarier book about how evidence-based medicine is being   perverted and undermined by the pharmaceutical companies ---   while government regulators, medical journals and (some)   academic doctors not only do nothing but are in fact actively complicit.   I knew that things were bad, but before reading this book   I didn't realize how bad. The extensive documentation   provided in the endnotes will give me a few decades' worth of   bedtime reading.
