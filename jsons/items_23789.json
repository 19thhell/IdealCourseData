Obligation to Pay Rent   The obligation to pay rent for families residing in Law School dormitory units will be the sole responsibility of the licensee of the family, and the School of Law will look solely to the licensee of the family to fulfill that obligation. No relief from the obligation will be available for the licensee if his or her status in the family changes during the license period.   Eligibility   To be eligible for family housing at the Law School, the applicant for such status must demonstrate that the individual(s) with whom the applicant/licensee is applying share a qualifying family relationship.   Qualifying family relationships under this policy are those relationships that evidence a significant emotional commitment on the part of the members of the relationship. Qualifying relationships do not include, however, a relationship with a lineal ancestor or sibling, other than a minor sibling for whom an adult member of the family is the legal guardian.   Review of Eligibility   All applications for family housing will be reviewed by the Department of Residence Services before being approved. Family housing is not guaranteed as the demand exceeds the supply.   Responsibility   The student member/licensee of the family is solely responsible for the behavior of the family members, and the family members' guests, while residing in NYU School of Law housing. All family housing residents (those not the licensee) must obtain an NYU ID card and are not provided with ResNet or Coles/Palladium access.
