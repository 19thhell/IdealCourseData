MCC-GE 3011    Special Topics in Critical Theory: Suspicion and Interpretation  The philosopher Paul Ricoeur famously labeled Marx, Nietzsche, and Freud the &ldquo;masters of suspicion.&rdquo; Though they practiced theory and theorized practice quite differently, they shared a proclivity for unmasking, unveiling, demystfying. More recently, this hermeneutics of suspicion has been criticized by proponents of the &ldquo;anti-hermeneutic turn,&rdquo; who contend that it reproduces a metaphysics of surface and depth, existence and essence. The objective of this seminar is to read the major theoretical statements of Marx, Nietzsche, and Freud in search of critical theory&rsquo;s suspect origins.           MCC-GE 3012    Special Topics in Critical Theory: Fetishism The concept of \"fetishism\" occupies a special place in critical theory. What began as a relatively minor theme in the works of Marx and Freud has become an indispensable tool for understanding modern culture and media. This seminar will explore the concept's early modern origins, its elaboration in Marxism and psychoanalysis, its appropriation by postwar critical theory, and the question of its usefulness today.          MCC-GE 3100    Doctoral Core Seminar I Advanced reading &amp; discussion of the foundational literature, principles, &amp; paradigms associated with the study of media, culture, &amp; communication.          MCC-GE 3101    Introduction to Communication Research The formulation of doctoral research problems in media, culture, and communication.          MCC-GE 3110    Special Topics in Cultural and Visual Studies This course examines specific topics within the fields of cultural studies &amp; visual culture, with the aim of delving into particular theoretical concerns within these overlapping &amp; interrelated fields of study. It is the aim of Special Topics courses to incorporate historical theoretical frameworks &amp; to examine important recent scholarship on these issues.          MCC-GE 3111    Special Topics in Cultural and Visual Studies: Theories of Visual Consumption/Consumerism Focus is on a genealogy of theories of consumption &amp; consumerism, including visual consumption &amp; reception, cultural consumption, &amp; consumerism more broadly. The aim of this particular course is to chart the history of how consumerism has been theorized since the nineteenth century, &amp; to make clear the connections between the literature on consumerism/consumption &amp; the literature on visual consumption &amp; the relationship of modernity &amp; visuality. The course will thus trace an arc from the literature on nineteenth century practices of visual consumption &amp; the rise of consumer society to contemporary debates about the relationship of consumerism to philanthropy, neoliberalism &amp; global capitalism, &amp; theories of cultural resistance in the context of new media practices.          MCC-GE 3130    Special Topics Global and Transcultural Communication An umbrella course that examines global dynamics in culture &amp; media in a broad international &amp; historical context. Special attention is paid to the social, economic, &amp; political theories that inform our understanding of the phenomena &amp; experience of globalization, &amp; its relationship to media &amp; cultural production, distribution &amp; consumption. Specific courses focus on transnational identity formation, political economy of global media, &amp; regional clusters such as the Middle East, Asia, South America, etc.          MCC-GE 3150    Special Topics in Technology Studies This umbrella course is designed for doctoral students on themes related to the social, cultural, historical, &amp; political economic meanings &amp; effects of communication technologies. Specific themes may include: digital media, social networking, intellectual property &amp; issues of privacy, robotics &amp; artificial intelligence, computer hacking, genetics &amp; biocomputing, the business of new technology.          MCC-GE 3151    Special Topics in Technology Studies: Heidegger and Deleuze In this doctoral seminar we will perform close readings of Heidegger &amp; Deleuze, focusing on their analysis of technology, tools, objects, machines, art. dwellings, &amp; media.          MCC-GE 3152    Special Topics in Technology Studies: Audiovision &ndash; Sound and Listening in Film and Other Media This seminar examines audiovisual phenomena, placing the various senses of sound &amp; image in opera, music theater, video (&amp; gaming), &amp; especially cinema in historical &amp; theoretical contexts. The course examines a history of relationships between the senses of sight &amp; cultural conditions for the shifting modalities of visual &amp; sonic experience, the course attempts to interrogate the ideological stakes of this dichotomy. The course will examine the history of a lopsided dichotomy of the senses in writers ranging from Plato &amp; Boethius via Kant &amp; Schopenhauer to Deleuze, Derrida, &amp; Chion.          MCC-GE 3153    Special Topics in Technology Studies: Politics of Code This course focuses on political analyses of computational media. We begin with an overview of cybernetics, information theory, systems theory, distributed communications networks, &amp; theories of postmodernity. Next, we examine the rise of immaterial labor in the service economies &amp; the extension of codified labor practices into the realm of daily life. The seminar will also consider the ramifications of informatic capture &amp; the formation of coded objects &amp; bodies. Finally, we explore networked struggle &amp;, through it, a political theory of the present moment. The course will favor both close readings of specific technologies as well as social &amp; cultural claims about the information age.          MCC-GE 3200    Doctoral Core Seminar II The second of the two advanced theory seminars taken sequentially during the first year of study. Over the course of the year, all the departmental research areas are surveyed: Cultural Theory &amp; Criticism; Media, Institutions &amp; Technologies; and Rhetoric, Politics, &amp; Public Advocacy.          MCC-GE 3201    Dissertation Proposal Seminar The formulation of doctoral research problems in media, culture, and communication. Planning of relevant methodology; criticism of work in progress.          MCC-GE 3400    Doctoral Research Colloquium Periodic meeting of doctoral students and faculty to discuss current research and professional development. May be used for maintenance of matriculation. Students may be given full-time equivalency if they are eligible. These credits will not count toward the student's total point requirement.

MCC-GE 3010 - Special Topics in Critical Theory   This umbrella course examines select topics in critical, cultural, social, &amp;political theory, with special attention to problems of interpretation in the humanities&amp; related social sciences in both historical &amp; theoretical contexts.          MCC-GE 3011 - Special Topics in Critical Theory: Suspicion and Interpretation   The philosopher Paul Ricoeur famously labeled Marx, Nietzsche, and Freud the \"masters of suspicion.\" Though they practiced theory and theorized practice quite differently,they shared a proclivity for unmasking, unveiling, demystfying. More recently, thishermeneutics of suspicion has been criticized by proponents of the \"anti-hermeneuticturn,\" who contend that it reproduces a metaphysics of surface and depth,existence and essence. The objective of this seminar is to read the major theoretical statements of Marx, Nietzsche, and Freud in search of critical theory's suspectorigins. sample syllabus          MCC-GE 3012 - Special Topics in Critical Theory: Fetishism   The concept of \"fetishism\" occupies a special place in critical theory. What began as a relatively minor theme in the works of Marx and Freud has become an indispensable tool for understanding modern culture and media. This seminar will explore the concept's early modern origins, its elaboration in Marxism and psychoanalysis, its appropriation by postwar critical theory, and the question of its usefulness today.    sample syllabus           MCC-GE 3031 - Special Topics in Media History   An special topics course for doctoral candidates that covers history and historiography of media and communication. Special attention is paid to questions of methodology as well as to theories of history and temporality as they relate to media and mediation. MCC-GE 3031 - Special Topics in Media History: Documents, Documentary, Data, Database This is a doctoral-level seminar aimed at exploring the nexus of fact and format. More particularly, the course will consider the ways that the modern category &ldquo;information&rdquo; has emerged in relation to different media and different genres. What are the social, material, institutional, and semantic conditions that have worked to align communication with truth or authenticity? What routes can be discerned between a history of media and a history of objectivity? Significant attention will be paid to the elaboration of key terms and concepts as well as to different disciplinary and interdisciplinary resources that shape such an inquiry.    sample syllabus          MCC-GE 3100 - Doctoral Core Seminar I   Advanced reading &amp; discussion of the foundational literature, principles, &amp; paradigms associated with the study of media, culture, &amp; communication.    sample syllabus          MCC-GE 3101 - Introduction to Communication Research   The formulation of doctoral research problems in media, culture, and communication.    sample syllabus           MCC-GE 3110 - Special Topics in Cultural and Visual Studies   This course examines specific topics within the fields of cultural studies &amp;visual culture, with the aim of delving into particular theoretical concerns withinthese overlapping &amp; interrelated fields of study. It is the aim of Special Topics courses to incorporate historical theoretical frameworks &amp; to examine importantrecent scholarship on these issues.          MCC-GE 3111 - Special Topics in Cultural and Visual Studies: Theories of Visual Consumption/Consumerism   Focus is on a genealogy of theories of consumption &amp; consumerism, including visual consumption &amp; reception, cultural consumption, &amp; consumerism morebroadly. The aim of this particular course is to chart the history of how consumerism has been theorized since the nineteenth century, &amp; to make clear the connections between the literature on consumerism/consumption &amp; the literature on visual consumption &amp; the relationship of modernity &amp; visuality. The course will thus trace an arc from the literature on nineteenth century practices of visual consumption &amp; the rise of consumer society to contemporary debates about the relationship of consumerism to philanthropy, neoliberalism &amp; global capitalism, &amp; theories of cultural resistance in the context of new media practices. sample syllabus           MCC-GE 3130 - Special Topics in Globalization   An umbrella course that examines global dynamics in culture &amp; media in a broad international &amp; historical context. Special attention is paid to the social,economic, &amp; political theories that inform our understanding of the phenomena &amp; experience of globalization, &amp; its relationship to media &amp; cultural production, distribution &amp; consumption. Specific courses focus on transnational identity formation, political economy of global media, &amp; regional clusters such as the Middle East, Asia, South America, etc.          MCC-GE 3150 - Special Topics in Technology Studies   This umbrella course is designed for doctoral students on themes related to the social, cultural, historical, &amp; political economic meanings &amp; effects of communication technologies. Specific themes may include: digital media, social networking, intellectual property &amp; issues of privacy, robotics &amp; artificial intelligence, computer hacking, genetics &amp; biocomputing, the business of new technology.

The course examines a history of relationships between the senses of sight &amp; cultural conditions for the shifting modalities of visual &amp; sonic experience, the course attempts to interrogate the ideological stakes of this dichotomy. The course will examine the history of a lopsided dichotomyof the senses in writers ranging from Plato &amp; Boethius via Kant &amp; Schopenhauerto Deleuze, Derrida, &amp; Chion.          MCC-GE 3153 - Special Topics in Technology Studies: Politics of Code   This course focuses on political analyses of computational media. We begin withan overview of cybernetics, information theory, systems theory, distributed communications networks, &amp; theories of postmodernity.
