The Carter Lab      Our lab studies the functional properties of neurons and circuits in the prefrontal cortex, using a combination of electrophysiology, microscopy and optogenetics.             Laboratory for Neuroeconomics (Glimcher Lab)    The work of our laboratory seeks to reconcile economically based models  of behavior with neurobiological theories of response generation. Our  long-term goal is to use economic theories of choice as a basis for  developing a biologically testable paradigm rooted in decision theory  and games theory that can replace traditional dualist notions of mind  and body.             Computational Neuroimaging Lab   (Heeger Lab)   The focus of our research is to use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to quantitatively investigate the relationship between brain and behavior.         Visual Neuroscience Laboratory (Kiorpes and Movshon Labs)     The Visual Neuroscience Laboratory is devoted to the study of the function and development of the mammalian visual system, using behavioral, biological, and theoretical techniques.         Emotion, Memory and the Brain (LeDoux Lab)    The LeDoux lab is a behavioral neuroscience lab dedicated to understanding the ways in which the brain forms, stores and retrieves memories about threatening events.             Laboratory for Computational Vision (Simoncelli Lab)     Our laboratory studies the analysis and representation of visual information. The work is inherently interdisciplinary, requiring empirical study of the structure of visual environments, construction of mathematical theories for representation and processing of that structure, implementation and simulat ion of biologically plausible instantiations of these theories, and psychophysical or (through collaboration) physiological investigations designed to test these theories.           Laboratory for the Study of Learning,   Memory and Cognition (Suzuki Lab)    Our goal is to understand how the brain lays down new memories  for facts, events and relationships that we know are dependent  on the medial portion of the brain\u2019s temporal lobe.         CoreVision     A joint project with the Center for Neural Science and the Department of Psychology, CoreVision is a multi-platform framework for performing many kinds of Psychophysics experiments.                       Programs associated with CNS          Center for Brain Imaging  The Center for Brain Imaging, jointly operated by the Center for Neural  Science and the Department of Psychology, supports research in brain  structure and function using a variety of methods including MRI and  fMRI imaging, EEG and ERP recording, and stimulation using TMS.       Center for Neuroeconomics  The Center for Neuroeconomics at New York University is one of the preeminent  institutions for the study of decision making and the brain. The Center  brings together faculty and students from NYU's world-class departments  of Neural Science, Economics and Psychology in classes, seminars  and research groups.          Emotional Brain Institute  The Emotional Brain Institute (EBI) is a joint initiative between New  York University and New York State. The goal of EBI is to understand  emotions and their impact on mind and behavior. A multi-disciplinary  group of researchers is investigating the origins of normal and  pathological emotions from the level of mind and behavior to neural  systems, cell activity, molecules, and genes. In researching these  topics, EBI investigators use state of the art approaches in the study  of brain, mind, and behavior.* *EBI researchers are located at the   Washington Square Campus of NYU and the   NYU Langone  School of Medicine , both in Manhattan, and the   Nathan Kline Institute , in Orangeburg, NY.         NYU Learning, Memory and Emotion Group  The Learning, Memory and Emotion Group at NYU consists of faculty,  postdocs, and students in the Center for Neural Science and Department  of Psychology who study learning, memory, including emotional learning  and memory. The Group meets on the first Friday of each month for the  Memory in Brain (MiB) Journal Club, at which a range of topics in  learning and memory are discussed, often by a guest speaker. Pizza is  served.        NYU ECoG Group  The NYU ECoG Group comprises a diverse group of researchers and clinicians  who are dedicated to advancing our understanding of human cognition and  improving the health of people with cognitive disorders by studying  patients with brain implants. Faculty members come from a number  of departments and institutes at New York University, including the Comprehensive Epilepsy Center, Center for Neural Science, Neuroscience Institute, Department of Psychology, Department of Neurosurgery,  Department of Neurology, and Department of Electrical and  Computer Engineering.          Sloan-Swartz Center for Theoretical Visual Neuroscience   Combines the strong scientific departments at NYU of CNS and the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences (CIMS) with the common goal of integrating as far as possible the research of theoreticians and experimentalists in the study of the brain.
