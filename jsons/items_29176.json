The primary difference between the Steinhardt Music Business program and the Clive Davis School of Recorded Music at the Tisch School of the Arts is the nature of the actual degree.

Tisch offers a Bachelor of Fine Arts. Please visit their website for more detailed information.  How long will it take to complete my degree as a transfer student?

Internships are available in all areas of the music industry, including record labels, publishing companies, performance venues, concert management agencies, music television, and music magazines, among others. Graduate students are also required to do an internship, often starting in their second semester.  Are there non-degree programs or special workshops offered? The program offers an introductory course in the music industry, The Business Structure of the Music Industry , for college credit. For pre-college students, the Music Business program offers a week-long summer institute called What Makes a Star? The program includes lectures, field trips, team projects and industry guest speakers.    Can I take MUSB courses as a non-major?    Yes. Non Mayors may take a maximum of three Music Business courses. However this does not guarantee that non-majors will be able to take as many as three Music Business courses. Majors in the Department of Music and Performing Arts Professions, Stern students in the EMT program, Tisch Recorded Music students, and students in the BEMT minor will be given priority over other non-majors.
