multi-site, organically connected network encompassing key global cities and idea capitals. The network has two foundational, degree-granting campuses: New York and Abu Dhabi (a third portal campus will open in Shanghai in fall 2013), complemented by a network of more than 15 research and study-away sites across five continents. Faculty and students will circulate within this global network in pursuit of common research interests, the promotion of cross-cultural understanding, and solutions for problems, both local and global.   NYU Abu Dhabi seeks to recruit faculty who are at once distinguished in their research and teaching. NYUAD offers undergraduate degrees (it will offer graduate degrees in the future), as well as extraordinary opportunities for faculty research, scholarship, and creative work across the arts, humanities, social sciences, sciences, and engineering. The faculty are academic leaders who value the opportunity to build the institution, shape programs, and foster synergies across fields. Our students are drawn from around the world and surpass all traditional recruitment benchmarks.   Open Faculty Positions         Position   Description   Apply   Inquiries?

multi-site, organically connected network encompassing key global cities and idea capitals. The network has two foundational, degree-granting campuses: New York and Abu Dhabi (a third portal campus will open in Shanghai in fall 2013), complemented by a network of more than 15 research and study-away sites across five continents. Faculty and students will circulate within this global network in pursuit of common research interests, the promotion of cross-cultural understanding, and solutions for problems, both local and global.   NYU Abu Dhabi seeks to recruit faculty who are at once distinguished in their research and teaching. NYUAD offers undergraduate degrees (it will offer graduate degrees in the future), as well as extraordinary opportunities for faculty research, scholarship, and creative work across the arts, humanities, social sciences, sciences, and engineering. The faculty are academic leaders who value the opportunity to build the institution, shape programs, and foster synergies across fields. Our students are drawn from around the world and surpass all traditional recruitment benchmarks.   Open Faculty Positions         Position   Description   Apply   Inquiries?

They will use these accounts for email and Internet access only. Do I need to apply for a Coursework Account?  No. All NYU degree students, faculty, and staff qualify for NYUHome , email, and Internet access, amongst other services. Students do not need to apply for an account; they simply need to activate their NetID at http://start.nyu.edu from nearly any Internet-connected computer (including those at the ITS computer labs ). The activated service will be ready for  use within minutes of activation, and will remain active until the student leaves the University  ( or longer ).    Can I apply for the students as a group?  No. Each student must activate his or her own service online at http://start.nyu.edu .    How do I, as the instructor, and my teaching assistant receive coursework computer accounts?  You and your teaching assistant (you will need to name your assistant on the Coursework Computer Account form) will receive accounts along with the students. Please provide your assistant's NYU NetID and email address.    How long will a coursework computer account remain active?  A coursework computer account is active for the semester only. If a student receives an incomplete,  they may request an extension for their account services with your approval. Inform  the student that they may visit the IT Service Desk (10 Astor Place, 4th Floor,  212-998-3333) to pick up an application form or they may download an application to their desktop, view it on-screen,  and print it, using Adobe  Acrobat Reader .    The students I teach are non-degree students but I would like them to have access to  the Internet and to email for work they will do in my class. Is this possible?  You will need to complete our Request for Coursework Computer Account form. We  will then create accounts for each student for their use during the semester.  These accounts terminate at the end of each semester. Non-degree students are  not eligible for NYUHome Accounts. These accounts are for full-time students in  degree programs.    May I bring my entire class to the lab for hands-on training?  ITS may accommodate your class for hands-on computer training for one or several sessions, depending on your needs. You can conduct the training for your class, or we can provide a person to conduct the training. To reserve multimedia-equipped classroom hours for hands-on training, please visit the   Hands-on Comuputer Classrooms web page.    I am generally confused as to which accounts provide which services. I would like to know which accounts are appropriate for my class.  See the overview of class accounts above, which provides information about eligibility and type of services.     I would like a mailing list set up for my class. What steps do I need to take to ensure that we have this service for our class?  You can exchange information with your students using NYU Classes , NYU Groups , or NYU Lists .    The class I teach is cross-listed between schools. Can I fill out one form for both classes?  No. Although this sounds like a reasonable way to handle your application, ITS does not receive cross-referenced information from the registrar. In order to ensure that both classes are covered adequately with the kinds of services you need, please fill out a separate form for each section.    Page last reviewed: October 1, 2013"}]},

multi-site, organically connected network encompassing key global cities and idea capitals. The network has two foundational, degree-granting campuses: New York and Abu Dhabi (a third portal campus will open in Shanghai in fall 2013), complemented by a network of more than 15 research and study-away sites across five continents. Faculty and students will circulate within this global network in pursuit of common research interests, the promotion of cross-cultural understanding, and solutions for problems, both local and global.   NYU Abu Dhabi seeks to recruit faculty who are at once distinguished in their research and teaching. NYUAD offers undergraduate degrees (it will offer graduate degrees in the future), as well as extraordinary opportunities for faculty research, scholarship, and creative work across the arts, humanities, social sciences, sciences, and engineering.

They will use these accounts for email and Internet access only. Do I need to apply for a Coursework Account?  No. All NYU degree students, faculty, and staff qualify for NYUHome , email, and Internet access, amongst other services. Students do not need to apply for an account; they simply need to activate their NetID at http://start.nyu.edu from nearly any Internet-connected computer (including those at the ITS computer labs ). The activated service will be ready for  use within minutes of activation, and will remain active until the student leaves the University  ( or longer ).    Can I apply for the students as a group?  No. Each student must activate his or her own service online at http://start.nyu.edu .    How do I, as the instructor, and my teaching assistant receive coursework computer accounts?  You and your teaching assistant (you will need to name your assistant on the Coursework Computer Account form) will receive accounts along with the students. Please provide your assistant's NYU NetID and email address.    How long will a coursework computer account remain active?  A coursework computer account is active for the semester only. If a student receives an incomplete,  they may request an extension for their account services with your approval. Inform  the student that they may visit the IT Service Desk (10 Astor Place, 4th Floor,  212-998-3333) to pick up an application form or they may download an application to their desktop, view it on-screen,  and print it, using Adobe  Acrobat Reader .    The students I teach are non-degree students but I would like them to have access to  the Internet and to email for work they will do in my class. Is this possible?  You will need to complete our Request for Coursework Computer Account form. We  will then create accounts for each student for their use during the semester.  These accounts terminate at the end of each semester. Non-degree students are  not eligible for NYUHome Accounts. These accounts are for full-time students in  degree programs.    May I bring my entire class to the lab for hands-on training?  ITS may accommodate your class for hands-on computer training for one or several sessions, depending on your needs. You can conduct the training for your class, or we can provide a person to conduct the training. To reserve multimedia-equipped classroom hours for hands-on training, please visit the   Hands-on Comuputer Classrooms web page.    I am generally confused as to which accounts provide which services. I would like to know which accounts are appropriate for my class.  See the overview of class accounts above, which provides information about eligibility and type of services.     I would like a mailing list set up for my class. What steps do I need to take to ensure that we have this service for our class?  You can exchange information with your students using NYU Classes , NYU Groups , or NYU Lists .    The class I teach is cross-listed between schools. Can I fill out one form for both classes?  No. Although this sounds like a reasonable way to handle your application, ITS does not receive cross-referenced information from the registrar. In order to ensure that both classes are covered adequately with the kinds of services you need, please fill out a separate form for each section.

multi-site, organically connected network encompassing key global cities and idea capitals. The network has two foundational, degree-granting campuses: New York and Abu Dhabi (a third portal campus will open in Shanghai in fall 2013), complemented by a network of more than 15 research and study-away sites across five continents. Faculty and students will circulate within this global network in pursuit of common research interests, the promotion of cross-cultural understanding, and solutions for problems, both local and global.   NYU Abu Dhabi seeks to recruit faculty who are at once distinguished in their research and teaching. NYUAD offers undergraduate degrees (it will offer graduate degrees in the future), as well as extraordinary opportunities for faculty research, scholarship, and creative work across the arts, humanities, social sciences, sciences, and engineering. The faculty are academic leaders who value the opportunity to build the institution, shape programs, and foster synergies across fields. Our students are drawn from around the world and surpass all traditional recruitment benchmarks.   Open Faculty Positions         Position   Description   Apply   Inquiries?

multi-site, organically connected network encompassing key global cities and idea capitals. The network has two foundational, degree-granting campuses: New York and Abu Dhabi (a third portal campus will open in Shanghai in fall 2013), complemented by a network of more than 15 research and study-away sites across five continents. Faculty and students will circulate within this global network in pursuit of common research interests, the promotion of cross-cultural understanding, and solutions for problems, both local and global.   NYU Abu Dhabi seeks to recruit faculty who are at once distinguished in their research and teaching. NYUAD offers undergraduate degrees (it will offer graduate degrees in the future), as well as extraordinary opportunities for faculty research, scholarship, and creative work across the arts, humanities, social sciences, sciences, and engineering. The faculty are academic leaders who value the opportunity to build the institution, shape programs, and foster synergies across fields. Our students are drawn from around the world and surpass all traditional recruitment benchmarks.   Open Faculty Positions         Position   Description   Apply   Inquiries?

They will use these accounts for email and Internet access only. Do I need to apply for a Coursework Account?  No. All NYU degree students, faculty, and staff qualify for NYUHome , email, and Internet access, amongst other services. Students do not need to apply for an account; they simply need to activate their NetID at http://start.nyu.edu from nearly any Internet-connected computer (including those at the ITS computer labs ). The activated service will be ready for  use within minutes of activation, and will remain active until the student leaves the University  ( or longer ).    Can I apply for the students as a group?  No. Each student must activate his or her own service online at http://start.nyu.edu .    How do I, as the instructor, and my teaching assistant receive coursework computer accounts?  You and your teaching assistant (you will need to name your assistant on the Coursework Computer Account form) will receive accounts along with the students. Please provide your assistant's NYU NetID and email address.    How long will a coursework computer account remain active?  A coursework computer account is active for the semester only. If a student receives an incomplete,  they may request an extension for their account services with your approval. Inform  the student that they may visit the IT Service Desk (10 Astor Place, 4th Floor,  212-998-3333) to pick up an application form or they may download an application to their desktop, view it on-screen,  and print it, using Adobe  Acrobat Reader .    The students I teach are non-degree students but I would like them to have access to  the Internet and to email for work they will do in my class. Is this possible?  You will need to complete our Request for Coursework Computer Account form. We  will then create accounts for each student for their use during the semester.  These accounts terminate at the end of each semester. Non-degree students are  not eligible for NYUHome Accounts. These accounts are for full-time students in  degree programs.    May I bring my entire class to the lab for hands-on training?  ITS may accommodate your class for hands-on computer training for one or several sessions, depending on your needs. You can conduct the training for your class, or we can provide a person to conduct the training. To reserve multimedia-equipped classroom hours for hands-on training, please visit the   Hands-on Comuputer Classrooms web page.    I am generally confused as to which accounts provide which services. I would like to know which accounts are appropriate for my class.  See the overview of class accounts above, which provides information about eligibility and type of services.     I would like a mailing list set up for my class. What steps do I need to take to ensure that we have this service for our class?  You can exchange information with your students using NYU Classes , NYU Groups , or NYU Lists .    The class I teach is cross-listed between schools. Can I fill out one form for both classes?  No. Although this sounds like a reasonable way to handle your application, ITS does not receive cross-referenced information from the registrar. In order to ensure that both classes are covered adequately with the kinds of services you need, please fill out a separate form for each section.    Page last reviewed: October 1, 2013"}]},

multi-site, organically connected network encompassing key global cities and idea capitals. The network has two foundational, degree-granting campuses: New York and Abu Dhabi (a third portal campus will open in Shanghai in fall 2013), complemented by a network of more than 15 research and study-away sites across five continents. Faculty and students will circulate within this global network in pursuit of common research interests, the promotion of cross-cultural understanding, and solutions for problems, both local and global.   NYU Abu Dhabi seeks to recruit faculty who are at once distinguished in their research and teaching. NYUAD offers undergraduate degrees (it will offer graduate degrees in the future), as well as extraordinary opportunities for faculty research, scholarship, and creative work across the arts, humanities, social sciences, sciences, and engineering.

They will use these accounts for email and Internet access only. Do I need to apply for a Coursework Account?  No. All NYU degree students, faculty, and staff qualify for NYUHome , email, and Internet access, amongst other services. Students do not need to apply for an account; they simply need to activate their NetID at http://start.nyu.edu from nearly any Internet-connected computer (including those at the ITS computer labs ). The activated service will be ready for  use within minutes of activation, and will remain active until the student leaves the University  ( or longer ).    Can I apply for the students as a group?  No. Each student must activate his or her own service online at http://start.nyu.edu .    How do I, as the instructor, and my teaching assistant receive coursework computer accounts?  You and your teaching assistant (you will need to name your assistant on the Coursework Computer Account form) will receive accounts along with the students. Please provide your assistant's NYU NetID and email address.    How long will a coursework computer account remain active?  A coursework computer account is active for the semester only. If a student receives an incomplete,  they may request an extension for their account services with your approval. Inform  the student that they may visit the IT Service Desk (10 Astor Place, 4th Floor,  212-998-3333) to pick up an application form or they may download an application to their desktop, view it on-screen,  and print it, using Adobe  Acrobat Reader .    The students I teach are non-degree students but I would like them to have access to  the Internet and to email for work they will do in my class. Is this possible?  You will need to complete our Request for Coursework Computer Account form. We  will then create accounts for each student for their use during the semester.  These accounts terminate at the end of each semester. Non-degree students are  not eligible for NYUHome Accounts. These accounts are for full-time students in  degree programs.    May I bring my entire class to the lab for hands-on training?  ITS may accommodate your class for hands-on computer training for one or several sessions, depending on your needs. You can conduct the training for your class, or we can provide a person to conduct the training. To reserve multimedia-equipped classroom hours for hands-on training, please visit the   Hands-on Comuputer Classrooms web page.    I am generally confused as to which accounts provide which services. I would like to know which accounts are appropriate for my class.  See the overview of class accounts above, which provides information about eligibility and type of services.     I would like a mailing list set up for my class. What steps do I need to take to ensure that we have this service for our class?  You can exchange information with your students using NYU Classes , NYU Groups , or NYU Lists .    The class I teach is cross-listed between schools. Can I fill out one form for both classes?  No. Although this sounds like a reasonable way to handle your application, ITS does not receive cross-referenced information from the registrar. In order to ensure that both classes are covered adequately with the kinds of services you need, please fill out a separate form for each section.
