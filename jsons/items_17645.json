Each bead set is coated with a reagent specific to a particular bioassay, allowing the capture and detection of specific analytes from a sample. Inside the Luminex analyzer, a light source excites the internal dyes that identify each microsphere particle, and also any reporter dye captured during the assay. Many readings are made on each bead set, which further validates the results. This xMAP Technology allows multiplexing of up to 500 unique bioassays within a single sample, both rapidly and precisely, using minimal amounts of sample. The Luminex 200 instrument is based on the principles of flow cytometry and integrates xMAP detection components such as lasers, optics, fluidics and high-speed digital signal processors. In the MAGPIX System, the lasers and photo multiplying tubes (PMTs) are replaced with Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs) and a CCD camera which is more compact and easier to use. Both instruments use the xPONENT\u00ae software , which is designed for protocol-based data acquisition with robust data regression analysis.

The Cary 100 Bio UV-Visible Spectrophometer was acquired through the support of New York University.              Storm PhosphorImager :    The Molecular PhosphorImager systems Storm 840 provides users PhosphorImager capability for autoradiography, direct fluorescence for nucleic acid and protein gel analysis, and chemifluorescence for fast blot analysis without exposures. Please clean up the scanner screen with mixture of ethanol/water after each use.  The  Storm PhosphorImager was acquired through the support of New York University.   Circular Dichroism Spectropolarimeter :                  The Department has an Aviv Stopped Flow CD Spectropolarimeter Model 202SF equipped with a thermostated five compartments cell holder. Circular Dichroism is an excellent tool for analyzing peptide/protein and nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) secondary structure in solution. It can be used to follow the changes in folding as a function of temperature, and is also useful for measuring protein-ligand and nucleic acid-ligand interactions.  The  Circular Dichroism Spectropolarimeter was acquired through the support of New York University.                 Perkin Elmer 2400 Series II CHNS/O Elemental Analyzer :    The system can determine weight percent carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, sulfur or oxygen in a variety of sample types, and operate in 3 modes: CHN, CHNS and Oxygen. Currently the system is only operating under the CHN mode. A typical measurement requires 1.5-2.5 mg of sample. Please contact Dr. Chunhua \"Tony\" Hu for training.                 Bruker AXS SMART APEXII Single Crystal Diffractometer :     It is equipped with an APEXII CCD area detector and an Oxford Cryosystems 700 plus Cooler. It is not only used for single crystal structure determination, also can be applied to powder sample for phase identification. Please visit the X-ray Diffraction Facility web page for more information.  The Bruker AXS SMART APEXII Single Crystal Diffractometer was acquired through the support of the Molecular Design Institute in the Department of Chemistry at New York University.                  Bruker AXS D8 DISCOVER with GADDS Diffractometer :    Please visit the X-ray Diffraction Facility web page for more information.  The X-ray microdiffractometer with GADDS was acquired through the support of the National Science Foundation under Award Numbers CRIF/CHE-0840277 and Award Number MRSEC/ DMR-0820341.   Merlin FESEM :     MERLIN (Carl Zeiss) field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM):   The Merlin FESEM features standard detectors, \u2018SE2\u2019 (Everhart-Thornley   type) and \u2018in lens\u2019 (annular secondary electron).  The Merlin FESEM was acquired through the support of the MRI program of the National Science   Foundation under Award Number DMR-0923251.
