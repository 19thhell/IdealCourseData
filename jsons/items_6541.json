[{"detail": [{"content": "Is Science Marketing                       Is Science Marketing?       J. Paul Peter &amp; Jerry C. Olson       (Published in the Journal of Marketing,  Fall 1983, pp. 111-125)             Abstract       Science is  analyzed as a special case of marketing-the marketing of ideas in the form of  substantive and methodological theories. The marketing mix, target markets, and  marketing objectives are developed for the scientific arena, and a formal  analysis of a relativistic/constructionist view of science is used to support  the approach. This view is contrasted with the positivistic/empiricist  perspective of science currently dominant in marketing and other social  sciences. Recommendations are offered for improved methods of developing  knowledge.                    For more than 30 years, marketing scholars have debated whether or  not marketing is a science (e.g., Alderson and Cox 1948, Bartels 1951, Baumol  1957, Buzzell 1963, Converse 1945, Hunt 1976, O'Shaughnessy and Ryan 1979,  Taylor 1965). The typical approach has been to offer a formal definition of  science or describe prototypic methods used in science and then compare  marketing's key features and/or its developmental progress against these  standards. Despite these fairly intense analyses, a consensus regarding the  scientific status of marketing has not yet been achieved. Some believe that marketing  is a science, while others believe that although scientific procedures are  employed in marketing, on the whole, marketing is an art. In contrast to these  two segments, many other marketing scholars seem to be withholding judgment,  perhaps awaiting more compelling arguments one way or the other.      Although well intentioned, we believe the debate regarding whether  or not marketing is a science has been largely unproductive. For the most part,  we attribute the current confusion to the somewhat naive conceptions of science  that have informed the controversy. In particular, we consider the typical  beliefs about how scientists do scientific work and how scientific progress is  achieved to be inconsistent with current views about such issues in the  disciplines of philosophy, sociology, and history of science. That is, in  asking, &quot;Is marketing a science?&quot; marketing scholars have been  comparing theory development and testing in marketing to inappropriate  standards that have little to do with the conduct of scientific inquiry in any  field.      This article presents a relatively new and more useful conception  of science than has been considered to date in the debates regarding  marketing's scientific status. To do so, we turn the tables in this  long-standing debate by asking the more fundamental and interesting question.  &quot;Is science marketing?&quot; In this article we consider whether science  can be effectively analyzed as a special case of marketing-the marketing of  ideas. (For this purpose, we adopt the currently popular definition of  marketing as &quot;human activity directed as satisfying needs and wants  through exchange processes&quot; (Kotler 1980). This is consistent with the  arguments of Bagozzi (1975) and Hunt (1983) that exchange is a key unifying  concept for the field. We suspect that most marketing scholars accept this  definition.)      The article has two major sections. In the first we analyze common  scientific practices in terms of conventional elements of marketing strategy.  Specifically, we consider the elements in the marketing mix, market targets,  and marketing objectives. Although we can consider only a few of the major  concepts in marketing, the examples in this brief analysis provide support for  our contention that science can be viewed as a special case of marketing. In  the second section, we discuss a relativistic/constructionist perspective  derived from recent work in science studies that provide a conceptual rationale  for analyzing science from a marketing perspective. We point out key  differences between this emerging approach to science and the traditional  positivistic/empiricist view that still pervades marketing (see Hunt 1983) and  other social sciences (see Koch 1981). Again, due to space restrictions, we  focus only on major points of departure from the traditional view and cite  major works to which readers can refer for additional information.             Marketing Scientific Theories       What makes a scientific theory successful? Simply stated, a  successful theory is one that is treated seriously and studied by a significant  portion of a research community. Practitioners may even employ such theories as  frameworks for analyzing important problems. In other words, a successful  theory is-one that has been adopted by a substantial market segment, just as is  the case of a successful consumer good. We argue that to successfully achieve  an adequate level of adoption, scientists must (at least implicitly) develop  and carry out a marketing strategy to promote their theories. In this section,  we consider some of the concepts and strategies involved in this process.  First, we describe scientific theories in terms of the four basic elements of  the marketing mix-product, channels of distribution, promotion, and price. Then  we discuss the idea of market segmentation for theories. Finally, we consider  the marketing objectives for scientific work.             Theories  as Products       In the broadest sense, the major products of science are ideas.  Scientific ideas consist of invented constructs and hypothesized relationships  among them. A system of such ideas about a phenomenon may be called a  substantive theory. Scientists also create ideas about methods of obtaining,  analyzing, and interpreting data. These are methodological theories of  measurement, sampling, and data analysis. Regardless of the type of idea or  theory, it should not be forgotten that the entire theory product is invented  or constructed by one or more scientists, just as ideas for consumer products  are invented or constructed. Like ideas for consumer products and the products  themselves, substantive and/or methodological theory products must also be  marketed. (Clearly, an understanding of the processes and/or accidents by which  new theories are created is critical for an understanding of science. While we  will not review the extant literature on the creation of scientific or other  products, i.e. &quot;marketing R&amp;D,&quot; interested readers should see  Zaltman, LeMasters, and Heffring (1982) and Stein (1974, 1975).)      At some point in the development of a theory the scientist usually  produces a manuscript that describes the idea. The manuscript may also present  empirical data that illustrate the idea and/or provide tentative support. A  manuscript is a tangible representation of the invented system of ideas.  Marketing a theory as a tangible manuscript is both easier and more effective  than promoting an intangible set of ideas, for at least four reasons. First,  potential adopters can easily store the theory product for use (study) at a  more convenient time. Second, because the manuscript is always available,  potential adopters can reexamine and reflect on the theory and possibly come to  appreciate its value. Third, the relative permanence of a manuscript allows  wider dissemination of the theory to a secondary, pass-along audience (e.g.,  students). Finally, a tangible manuscript may be used to establish the  scientist/marketer as the inventor of the theory or as the first to borrow the  theory from another area and apply it in a new field.      Over its life cycle a theory may undergo a number of modifications  in response to a variety of potential marketing problems. Customer complaints  regarding measurement difficulties or lack of conceptual clarity, and  competitive theory products marketed by other scientists, are among the many  problems a new theory may face in trying to capture a viable market share of  scientists. Perhaps the most serious problem occurs when a test of a theory  fails to predict adequately. This means that the theory is not meeting the  needs of the largest segment of researchers-those concerned with prediction and  methodological and empirical rigor. If the research community cannot be  convinced that the empirical test procedures were faulty, either the inventor  scientist or another scientist who has adopted the theory may change specific  characteristics of the theory product in response to such problems. However,  the modified theory is seldom renamed, as this might lose loyal customers. Many  of these modifications are made to seem minor and the change process may be  quite gradual, often so much so that the target market of scientists does not  always recognize the changes. However, it should be emphasized that any change  in a theory creates a modified product-i.e., a different theory. For instance,  researchers made a number of seemingly minor conceptual changes in the  Fishbein-type expectancy-value models during the period of major interest in  the marketing literature (1969-1975), yet only the most knowledgeable consumers  were aware that these changes created different theories (e.g., Cohen,  Fishbein, and Ahtola 1972).      Product Attributes. As with consumer products, several key attributes of a theory  have a large effect on marketing success. A major characteristic concerns the  topic, issue, problem, or phenomenon that is addressed. A theory may concern an  issue of major importance, a &quot;big&quot; problem, or a relatively  &quot;small&quot; issue of little theoretical or practical importance (Olson  1982). In some ways it may be easier to market the latter type of theory. For  instance, the most widely adopted theories tend to be those that are easiest to  understand and research empirically, especially in long periods of normal  science (Kuhn 1970). If research on a theory requires special equipment (e.g..  polygraphs for the study of brain waves) or special subject populations (e.g.,  managers or purchasing agents), that theory is not likely to be widely  researched. In contrast, theories that are easily researched with conventional  measurement procedures (e.g., self-report rating scales) and easily accessible  samples (e.g., students) are more likely to achieve higher adoption rates.      A second important attribute of a theory concerns the professional  credentials and status of the inventor or the borrower. Scientists who are well  known and respected, based on their previous contributions to a field, have  better chances of successfully introducing new theories than do less well-known  researchers. The credibility of the scientist/marketer may add a halo effect to  the theory product. Inventors or borrowers who do not enjoy a strong reputation  in their fields (e.g., doctoral students) may need to attract established  researchers (&quot;celebrity scholars&quot;) to help market their theories.      Third, theories that are borrowed and adapted from more  established, familiar fields seem to be more easily marketed than theories  gleaned from unconventional areas or that are constructed &quot;from  scratch.&quot; For example, it is probably easier to promote theories for use  in marketing that are borrowed from psychology and economics rather than from  areas such as anthropology, religion, or art.      Fourth, theories which contain familiar, common, everyday  concepts, words, meanings, and relationships (e.g., needs, attitudes,  personality) may be easier to market successfully than theories which require  learning new words, meanings, and relationships (e.g., shaping, aesthetic  response, semantic relatedness, coherence analysis, negative reinforcement).  Familiar concepts that are learned in childhood and are frequently used in  everyday language may be considered as highly important concepts to be  researched and understood. However, in other cases, new words and meanings can  be useful for marketing theories, since knowledge of them may give a scientist  admission to the cognoscenti of a research community.      Fifth, theories that are consistent with current political and  social values are easier to market (Barnes 1977, Gould 1982). For example, a  theory advocating gender differences in cognitive abilities is difficult to  market in the current environment, even with impressive empirical support (see  Stanley and Benbow 1982). In addition, since political and social values often  determine funding priorities, theories dealing with problems for which ample  research support is available are more easily marketed to potential scientist  adopters.      The sixth (and purposefully last) product attribute is the  preliminary empirical evidence that can be marshaled to support a theory.  Strong empirical support is a highly desirable attribute that will enhance the  marketability of a theory. However, strong empirical evidence is neither  necessary nor sufficient for the successful dissemination of a theory. A number  of theories have been fairly widely adopted, despite poor (or even no) initial  empirical support (e.g., early atomic theory or Freudian personality theory).  Of course scientists differ in the extent to which they are concerned about the  &quot;fit&quot; between data and theory; thus, the importance of empirical  support for a theory is likely to vary for different scientists (see Mitroff  and Kilmann 1978).      Test Marketing. Quite often, scientists test market their theories before  attempting a full-scale introduction via journal publication. Their major goal  is to gauge the reactions of potential adopters of the theory and to identify  and correct any glaring flaws before the theory is introduced on a major scale.  One way to do this is by circulating working papers among colleagues and  friends in the &quot;invisible college&quot; (see Crane 1972). In addition,  colloquia and seminars may be presented to colleagues and students and their  reactions sought. At least three results are possible. First, and least likely,  listeners may judge the theory product to be irretrievably flawed. This seldom  occurs, since the listeners at most test-market presentations are other  scientists who not only share the same worldview as the inventor, but also are  social friends who respect the inventor. Normally, such groups are reluctant to  totally reject the theory product. However, test market presentations to less  hospitable groups occasionally do produce such an extreme rejection. Second, in  equally rare cases, the product may be viewed as a major accomplishment with no  serious problems and judged to be ready for introduction.      Instead, the results of test marketing are likely to suggest a variety  of modifications to the theory. These may involve adding or deleting  constructs, clarifying and redefining constructs, or changing the theoretical  relationships between constructs. At a minimum, cosmetic changes may be made in  the theory's packaging (words and labels used) or suggestions may be made for  repositioning the product. As with traditional consumer products, the  scientist/marketer must consider whether changing the theory according to the  recommendations derived from test marketing will improve the chances of  successfully marketing the product.             Channels  of Distribution for Theories       There are many channels by which scientific theories may be  disseminated to potential adopters. The various channels of distribution have  different levels of effectiveness and may be differentially appropriate at  different stages in the development and testing of the theory. In the early  stages of development, most theories are disseminated via presentations at  colloquia and conferences, and through informally distributed working papers.  While conference and colloquia presentations are especially valuable in that  they provide direct feedback to the scientist/marketer, not many scholars are  likely to adopt a theory distributed in this way. For one thing, relatively few  scholars can be exposed to the theory through these inefficient channels.  Before widespread adoption can be anticipated, most theories must pass the  muster of the gatekeepers in the discipline (the reviewers and editors of  prestigious journals) and thereby achieve both legitimization and widespread  exposure. A theory that is evaluated poorly in test marketing may go no further  than being published in a conference proceedings, if at all. The theory may  languish there for several years before finally fading away or being  resurrected by another scientist who happens to stumble across it.  Occasionally, a theory is published first in a proceedings and later in a  journal, but this is generally considered bad form unless major changes have  occurred in the manuscript.      Some marketers begin the dissemination process by submitting the  manuscript directly to the key channel, a major journal. If the manuscript is  rejected from a number of major journals, the inventor/marketer may attempt to  disseminate the theory through other channels, perhaps less prestigious or  highly specialized journals. Using these channels to distribute a theory  reduces the probability that the theory will enjoy rapid acceptance, although  publication per se does enhance the chances for eventual success. Publication  in even an obscure or specialized journal may still reach the most interested  target market of researchers who may then be influential in further  disseminating the theory throughout the research community. Alternatively, if  the theory cannot be published in a major journal, some marketers may try to  publish the theory in book form or as a chapter in a book. However, this  channel is not readily or equally available to all scientists. Thus, the more  likely outcome is that the marketer will present the theory at one or more  conferences and publish a paper in a proceedings, if available. Of course, the  chances of successfully marketing the theory decrease with the use of more  restricted, less prestigious channels of distribution.             Promotion  of Theories       Throughout the life cycle of a theory, from creation to test  marketing to publication in a major journal to the widespread adoption and use  of a theory by the research community, promotion is a key factor in  successfully marketing a theory. As with consumer goods, a variety of  promotional techniques can be used. Interestingly, and contrary to popular  beliefs, theories that do not provide impressive empirical results, produce a  potential resolution to a major problem in the field (Kuhn 1970, Popper 1959),  or generate novel predictions (Lakatos 1978), can still be marketed  successfully.      Although strong empirical results are very useful in promoting a  theory, they are not absolutely necessary. For example, personality research in  marketing in the 1960s and early 1970s seldom surpassed the relatively trivial  hurdle of obtaining statistically significant correlations between measures of  personality and a variety of other factors (Kassarjian 1971). Yet personality  theory enjoyed wide popularity. Because the weak empirical results were usually  attributed to methodological problems, most researchers did not conclude that  the underlying theory was wrong. In fact, many marketing researchers still  believe in personality theory despite the generally disappointing empirical  results. Recently, new methods have produced more impressive empirical support  for personality theory (see Epstein 1979, 1980), although a resurgence of  interest has not yet occurred in marketing.      It is also possible to successfully market a theory that makes no  unusual or novel predictions and is in fact quite similar to other theories. Of  course, a scientist's promotion task will be easier if the theory product has  unique features (e.g., it generates novel predictions) or it has desirable  attributes of a compelling logic coupled with strongly supportive data.  However, as long as the new theory is relatively consistent with the worldview  of at least a segment of the field, it can be successfully promoted. A new  theory that is based on a different set of metatheoretical assumptions than  those held by most members of a research community can be difficult to  successfully promote and market. This is similar to situations in consumer  goods marketing in which discontinuous innovations that are inconsistent with  consumers' social values and behavior patterns are often hard to sell.  (Strictly speaking, no scientific theory is constructed of totally new concepts  created in isolation from earlier concepts and theories. Previous research and  theorizing certainly has an impact on the scientist/ inventor who is trying to  create a &quot;new&quot; theory. However, some new theories are seen as more  creative and less continuous with previous work than are others. We are merely  arguing that it is more difficult to market the more discontinuous theories.  This discussion should not be taken to imply that scientific work is cumulative  in the sense that a sequence of theories will ultimately lead to a valid  general theory.)      In addition to &quot;direct advertising&quot; via publication in  journals, books, and proceedings, a theory can also be promoted through  publicity and personal selling. Publicity for a theory includes notices of  forthcoming articles in journals, abstracts of published articles printed in  other journals, and notices of working papers in association newsletters.  Occasionally, a scientist/marketer can get other scientists to cite the new  theory, perhaps while still in working paper form. Scientists may be able to  generate discussion of their theory in nonscholarly publications such as  Marketing News or Psychology Today. Finally, if dissertation research testing  the theory wins awards or other recognition, the resulting publicity can be  very helpful in the overall marketing effort. Publicity may perform a useful informational  or reminder role, but is likely to be less persuasive than other forms of  promotion. However, a &quot;bandwagon effect&quot; for a theory might be  enhanced through this kind of promotion.      Personal selling is an important element of the promotional  strategy for theories. Personal selling occurs during formal or informal  presentations of the theory as well as in direct one-on-one discussions with  potential adopters. Moreover, salesmanship is an important aspect of dealing  with editors and reviewers in the revision process. Direct selling can be an  effective method of persuasion since the scientist/marketer can address  counter-arguments of the potential buyer head on and can offer ad hoc  hypotheses to cover many of the perceived weaknesses in the theory. Finally, a  personal selling strategy can be particularly effective with one's doctoral  students.             Price  of Theories       The scientist who adopts a new theory must pay a price that  involves time and money as well as psychological and behavioral costs. Part of  the price of adopting a new theory involves the time spent learning the new  theory and its methods, as well as the associated opportunity costs. The  adopter of a new theory may also incur financial costs in purchasing new  equipment (e.g., a physiology lab) or in education/training costs (e.g.,  attending seminars on causal modeling). Other costs include the psychological  effort and disruption involved in changing one's existing beliefs and  established research behaviors. A major component of the price of adopting a  new theory involves the behavioral effort of actively researching the theory,  writing about it, and performing the behaviors necessary to get the results  published in major journals.      Like consumer products, theories vary in price. Low-priced  theories are those that are consistent with the worldview and existing research  skills of the target market of scientists. Adopting such theories is relatively  inexpensive, as learning time is short and belief and behavior changes are  minimal. That is, the price is within easy reach of many potential consumers.  Thus, the scientist/marketer who prices his/her theory at the low end enhances  the chances that the theory will penetrate the mass market.      In contrast, theories that are radically different from the  established worldview of the research community and/or from the research  procedures common in a field carry a higher price tag. Adopting such theories  may require considerable learning time, extensive belief changes, and major  changes in research behavior. Therefore, such high priced theories need to be  marketed carefully and well. The marketing effort is facilitated if the  scientist can articulate the benefits to be provided by the new theory. Because  these benefits have to be perceived as substantial to justify the high price,  some scientists substantially oversell their substantive or methodological  theories in order to attract consumers (see Churchill and Perrault 1982). For  example, it appears that structural equations methodology has been  substantially oversold in the social sciences (see Cliff 1983, Fornell 1983).      A variety of situational factors can influence the success of a  high priced theory, primarily by making it seem worth the cost to early  adopters. First, it is helpful if the worldview incorporated in established  theories is recognized as problematic by a segment of the research community.  In fact, Kuhn (1970) argues that a scientific revolution cannot take place  unless the traditional view is recognized as failing and an alternative theory  is available. Second, the availability of research funds to investigate the new  theory is a powerful motivator for pursuing a new theory product. For example,  funding for research on the effects of advertising on children lowered the  price of entering this new area. Third, in some situations researchers may be  bored with the traditional approach and, therefore, are willing to incur the  cost of adopting more provocative theories. Similarly, some researchers may  simply feel they can make little marginal contribution to the traditional view  and are seeking to invest in new theories with greater payoff potential. In'  sum, there are particular situations when high priced theories are more likely  to be adopted by a research community. From a marketing strategy perspective,  these situations are strategic windows that the scientist/marketer can use to  advantage in introducing an expensive theory product.      A final consideration regarding the price of a theory concerns the  fact that not all researchers can afford to pay the price required for adoption  of a new theory. A prime determinant of what price an individual scientist can  afford to pay is his/her place in the tenure decision process. Younger  pre-tenure scholars may not feel they can afford a high priced theory. They may  need less expensive theories that have a fairly high probability of producing  rapid benefits, such as easily publishable journal articles. High priced  theories, by their very nature, tend to offer benefits with a longer time  horizon. Moreover, a fairly high degree of risk is associated with most high  priced theories, and many pre-tenure Scientists may not wish to incur such  risks. Therefore, more senior, post-tenure scholars may be more willing to  invest in higher priced theories. Occasionally, beginning scholars, such as  doctoral students, who have relatively little time and effort invested in  traditional theories and methods, may adopt higher priced theories, especially  if encouraged to do so by their post-tenure mentors. However, in these cases,  the theory is probably already in the growth stage of the product life cycle,  or at least appears to be a theory with a high probability of success, based on  its attributes.             Target  Markets for New Theories       A research community can be segmented in a number of ways. As just  discussed, scientists can be divided in terms of their position in the career  life cycle. Three distinct groups can be identified: doctoral students,  pie-tenure scholars, and post-tenure scholars. The latter group might be  further divided by rank into associate and full professors. Theory products  will differentially appeal to these groups and, as noted, these groups can  afford to pay different prices for theories and are willing to incur different  levels of risk. Of course, different marketing strategies may be required for  each of these segments.      A prime target market for a scientist's theory is his/her own  doctoral students, although the students of other scholars are of interest as  well. Usually these potential customers are seeking exactly what the marketer  has to offer a new theory or method in need of empirical research in a  discipline-related context. Ideally, the theory should be somewhat new in order  to establish that the dissertation is a &quot;contribution&quot; to the field.  As mentioned above, this target market may react less negatively if the theory  deviates substantially from the accepted view in the field, partly because its  members have not yet become fully committed to that perspective. Additionally,  doctoral students constitute an important target market because they (I) often  become apostles for the theory once they have invested the time to learn it and  begin to research it, (2) are entering the most active stage of their research  careers and may help market the theory through their writings, and (3) may be  more easily persuaded as they have little investment in competing theories.      The second important target market for a new theory is the group  of active research scholars in the field. This group can be further segmented  into pre- and post-tenure researchers, and each of these segments can be  further divided into adopter categories of opinion leaders, followers, and  laggards. Of these, the opinion leaders are critically important. A single  study on a new theory by an opinion leader may be sufficient to create  widespread interest. Opinion leader scientists are also likely to be mentors  for high quality doctoral students who can be encouraged to research the  theory. In addition, opinion leaders can often directly influence other active  researchers to consider studying and using the theory, thereby increasing its  adoption rate and eventual market share. Finally, studies by opinion leaders  are more likely to be featured in textbooks, which also helps to establish the  theory. (Once a theory has achieved &quot;textbook status,&quot; it tends to  become part of the discipline's body of &quot;knowledge.&quot; Regardless of  whether the measures are subsequently invalidated or empirical results ever  show impressive relationships, such theories are seldom purged entirely from  the literature. Over time the theory may lose followers and interest as new  theories are offered which are perceived to be better or deal with what seem to  be more important or interesting problems. Although some laggard researchers  will continue to investigate the old theory, only occasionally will this work  be published in a major outlet. When it is, it may still be employed in  textbooks for the purpose of giving a fresh reference to an old chapter and for  exemplifying the supposedly cumulative nature of scientific inquiry. In fact,  Kuhn (1970) argues that textbooks rewrite the history of theories in order to  make science appear to be cumulative.)      The scholars least likely to adopt a new theory are those who  remain loyal to a previous theory, particularly if it is their own or one in  which they have invested heavily. In fact, members of this group are more  likely to criticize the new theory and attempt to remove it from the market.  Such attempts may well take the form of &quot;replications&quot; which are intended  to discredit the new theory. Often these attempts are partly successful since  most theories have numerous problems in the early stage of development. For  example, because constructs used in the theory have surplus meaning, parts of  the theory can be interpreted in a manner that reveals inconsistencies and  ambiguities. It may be fairly easy to show that the theoretical concepts have  different meanings than intended by the inventor/marketer, thus adding to the  confusion regarding the theory. Second, since the skeptical researcher now  controls the method in a replication, he/she can usually generate results  inconsistent with the new theory. For example, the design could include too few  subjects to allow sufficient statistical power to detect the effect, or a  research setting involving many uncontrolled sources of variance could be used  to &quot;wash out&quot; an effect. In sum, an antagonistic scientist can often  demonstrate that a new theory's predictions are poorer than previously  reported, or even that &quot;disconfirming&quot; effects are obtained. Finally,  because all research requires a myriad of subjective decisions, the competitor  scientist can usually argue that at least some of the original methodological  decisions were inappropriate and thus produced data that were biased in favor  of the theory. In such controversies, comments, replies, and rejoinders can  continue back and forth to the limits of the tolerance of editors, reviewers,  and the research community.      The market for a new theory can also be segmented in terms of  psychological characteristics. Scientists have differing views about what  counts as important, interesting theory, and these values and beliefs influence  their evaluations of a new theory. Based on such attributes, Mitroff and  Kilmann (1978) have identified four types of scientists. Two of these are  particularly relevant for segmenting scientific markets. The analytical  scientist (AS) is mainly concerned with tightly controlled, highly rigorous  research designs intended to test well-specified hypotheses deduced from  theory. This group seems to be the largest segment in marketing and in most  other fields~ In contrast, the conceptual theorist (CT) is more concerned with  abstract ideas, how they fit logically together, and with their heuristic,  generative power for creating other ideas. This group is small in both  marketing and in most other disciplines. Obviously, the characteristics of a  new theory will strongly influence which of these groups will be more  attracted. The CT group may be more likely to adopt a new theoretical  perspective if it is quite different from existing perspectives and offers  promise for dealing with important, complex phenomena and problems. CT's tend  not to be concerned about a lack of empirical support, especially early in a  theory's development. On the other hand, an AS is not likely to adopt a new  theory until it has been developed to the stage where methods and measures can  be relatively unambiguously applied to test specific aspects of the theory.  Moreover, the preliminary data should look promising.             Marketing  Objectives       Although the marketer of a scientific theory probably has  objectives or goals in mind for that theory, and for his/her career as a  scientist, these goals are not often explicit. For purposes of discussion, we  have roughly categorized scientists' objectives into three groups: noble,  curiosity, and self-serving goals. Conceptually, these three classes are  mutually exclusive; however, more than one type of objective can be achieved  with the same marketing strategy.      Noble objectives are those most commonly associated with science.  Included are such lofty goals as seeking knowledge, attempting to understand a  phenomenon, and contributing to a discipline or to society as a whole. Normally  such goals are considered to be beyond reproach. Note, however, that to  accomplish these goals, a scientist must market his/her work to the scientific  community (or get someone else to do the marketing). A theory can make no  contribution if the work is kept hidden in a file drawer. Thus, scientists must  market their theories to achieve even noble goals.      Curiosity objectives refer to seeking answers to one's personal  questions about the subject of inquiry. Curiosity goals are closely related to  noble goals, and they differ primarily in the degree to which the work is  performed for self versus others. Doing research for the fun of it and the  sheer joy of learning new things are not unknown as motivators in science.  However, if the scientist needs no cooperation from others, contents him-/herself  with the findings, needs no cooperation from others, and shares them with no  one, marketing is not involved. Only when the theory and the findings are  exchanged with someone else does the marketing process for the theory become  relevant.      Self-serving objectives are well known within scientific  communities but are not widely recognized among the general public, nor do  professional philosophers of science usually consider them. Self-serving goals  lead researchers to perform scientific work primarily for the purpose of  personal gain. The rewards for being a successful scientist can be substantial:  promotions, job security, money (in the form of salary, grants, and consulting  fees), release time from other duties, prestige and recognition in the field,  and specific awards and honors. While these gains are usually intended for  scientists who pursue noble goals, they often are awarded to those who seek  mainly self-serving goals. Occasionally, the research community may deny at  least some of the sought rewards to scientists who pursue only self-serving  goals, especially in a blatant manner. The research community may infer that a  particular researcher is seeking only self-serving goals based on the  researcher's verbal reports of objectives, and from practices such as producing  a large number of marginal theory/research papers, or relabeling and publishing  the same paper in multiple channels.      Clearly, different goals may lead researchers to adopt different  marketing strategies. For instance, some scientists who pursue noble goals may  naively believe that overt marketing effort is unnecessary and even demeaning,  since an obviously superior theory will &quot;sell itself.&quot; Of course,  sophisticated marketers can easily recognize this perspective as a sign of a  strong product orientation and not a particularly viable strategy for long-term  success. It is also clear that different goals may lead to the same strategy,  i.e., development and marketing of a high quality theory product with a high  quality marketing plan. Moreover, scientists may have multiple goals that are  consistent. Perhaps it would be worthwhile to study scientists' goals, their  hierarchical relationships, and their impact on scientific progress. However,  the main point here is that accomplishing scientific objectives depends on the  quality of the marketing strategy and the effort exerted.             Summary       In the first part of this article we have demonstrated that basic  marketing concepts and principles can account for many aspects of scientific  activity. Thus far our arguments that science is marketing have been informal.  We have shown that many aspects of science involve social exchanges, and in  particular, the exchange of ideas in the form of theories. Therefore, as the  discipline most concerned with exchange processes, marketing provides a  relevant perspective for understanding science. In addition, we have shown how  certain marketing concepts are or could be used by scientists to develop  effective marketing strategies that could influence other scientists to adopt  their theories.      In the remainder of the article we develop our claim that science  is marketing along more formal lines. We attempt to show how current views on  the nature of science also lead to the conclusion that much of the activity of  science involves marketing processes. The key theoretical ideas used in our  arguments constitute a set of metatheoretical assumptions about the nature of  scientific knowledge and how that knowledge is achieved. Many of these ideas  are radically different from those that underlie the philosophical perspective  currently prominent in marketing and other social sciences.             Metatheoretical Assumptions about Science       Scholars have proposed a variety of philosophical perspectives  regarding science (see Brown 1977, Suppe 1977). These points of view are  characterized by major as well as subtle differences and by a profusion of  terminology (logical positivism, logical empiricism, instrumentalism, realism,  falsificationism, relativism, etc.). We attempt to sidestep much of the  resulting controversy and semantic confusion in the remainder of this article.  First, we briefly describe the reigning philosophical approach in marketing  which we call the Positivistic/Empiricist (P/E) perspective (see Anderson 1983  for a more detailed review). Then, we contrast this view with a newer, more  useful philosophy of science, which we call the Relativistic/Constructionist  approach (R/C). Our intent is to introduce these ideas at a broad, general  level and avoid becoming mired in technical jargon and subtle details. Thus our  coverage of these issues is necessarily an overview.             The  Positivistic/Empiricist Approach       The philosophy of science that presently dominates marketing is a  descendent of logical positivism, commonly called logical empiricism (cf.  Brodbeck 1982, Hunt 1983). (Suppe (1977) and Brown (1977) provide thorough  historical analyses of how these positions have evolved.) The term  &quot;positivism&quot; usually refers to a type of strict empiricism in which  only those knowledge claims that are based directly on experience (i.e.,  empirical observations) are considered important, useful, and/or scientifically  meaningful. Coupled with this strong emphasis on empirical data, positivism  relies heavily on formal symbolic logic as a tool of analysis. Thus,  positivists claim that through formal logical analysis of theories and by means  of unbiased observations, the truth of any (meaningful) proposition can be  determined absolutely.      Logical empiricism is a somewhat more moderate version of  positivism developed to avoid the induction problem-namely that no universal  proposition can be conclusively verified by any set of observations, no matter  how large. Thus logical empiricism tends to favor a view that although  scientific propositions cannot be conclusively verified, they can be  &quot;increasingly confirmed,&quot; again using careful observations (e.g., in  experiments) and the rules of formal logic. In this view, for instance,  theoretical terms derive their meanings through &quot;correspondence rules&quot;  that &quot;connect&quot; them to direct experience (empirical observations).  These observations give meaning to the theoretical terms. The logical  empiricist point of view dominates current marketing research in that much of  our research methodology and approach are based on these philosophical  assumptions.      Popper (1959) proposed a &quot;falsification&quot; strategy to  avoid the inductive problems of the confirmation approach of logical  empiricism. However, as interpreted by many philosophers and marketing  scholars, falsification is merely a somewhat more sophisticated brand of  logical empiricism (cf. Calder, Phillips. and Tybout 1981, 1982; Lynch 1982).  (However, other, less well-recognized aspects of Popper's thinking are fairly  consistent with the perspective we are advocating (see Brown 1977, Chapter 5).)  This approach to science, termed &quot;naive falsificationism&quot; by Likatos  (1970), requires that a researcher consider a theory as false if a key  deductively derived hypothesis is rejected by empirical observations. (It  should be noted that Laudan (1965) clearly demonstrates the impossibility of  falsification.)      In sum, the P/E approach that currently underlies research in  marketing emphasizes (a) the development of axiomatic theory through the use of  deductively-derived hypotheses which are manipulated via formal rules of  symbolic logic, and especially (b) objective empirical observations that give  meaning to the theoretical propositions and are used to rigorously test them,  perhaps even falsify them. Thus, many people consider the P/E approach to be  rational (in the formal logical sense).             The  Relativistic/Constructionist Approach       In the P/E perspective of science, certain factors are excluded  from consideration, including the effects of (a) social interaction and  influence among scientists, (b) the idiosyncratic beliefs and values of  individual scientists, and (c) scientists' subjective interpretations of  observational data. These factors are not a part of the unbiased observations  and formal symbolic logic of the P/E approach; thus they are usually rejected  from consideration as irrelevant for an understanding of scientific progress.  However, in terms of the R/C perspective advocated below, these factors are of  critical importance in understanding how scientific knowledge develops. (We  cast the differences between these approaches in simple dichotomous terms in  order to distinguish them and make our points more clearly. However, a variety  of finer, mom subtle distinctions can be drawn. See Brown (1917) for a review  of the issues involved in this controversy.)      This article is not the place to present a complete discussion and  defense of the R/C approach to science. Others have done so effectively (see  Collins and Cox 1976, Feyerabend 1975, Knorr-Cetina 1981, Kunn 1970, Munvar  1981). Instead, in the rest of the article we identify and briefly discuss some  key distinctions between the P/E view of science and the R/C perspective. A  summary of these distinctions is provided in Table 1.                           TABLE 1    Major Differences between Positivistic/Empiricist and   Relativistic/Constructionist Views of Science                Positivistic/Empiricist   Science          Relativistic/Constructionist Science                Science discovers the true nature of reality.          Science creates many realities.                Only the logic of justification is needed to   understand science.          The processes by which theories are created,   justified, and diffused throughout a research community are needed to understand   science.                Science can be understood without considering   cultural, social, political, and economic factoras.          Science is a social process and cannot be   understood without considering cultural, social, political, and economic   factors.                Science is objective.          Science is subjective.                Scientific knowledge is absolute and cumulative.          Scientific knowledge is relative to a particular   context and period of time in history.                Science is capable of discovering universal laws   that govern the external world.          Science creates ideas that are context-dependent,   i.e., relative to a frame of reference.                Science produces theories that come closer and   closer to absolute truth.          Truth is a subjective evaluation that cannot be   properly inferred outside of the context provided by the theory.                Science is rational since it follows formal rules   of logic,          Science is rational to the degree that it seeks to   improve individual and societal well being by following whatever means are   useful for doing so.                There are specific rules for doing science validly   (e.g.. falsification),          There are many ways of doing science validly that   are appropriate in different situations.                Scientists subject their theories to potential   falsification through rigorous empirical testing.          Scientists seek supportive, confirmatory evidence   in order to market their theories.                Measurement procedures do not influence what is   measured.          Nothing can be measured without changing it.                Data provide objective, independent benchmarks for   testing theories,          Data are created and interpreted by scientists in   terms of a variety of theories, and thus are theory laden.                           Reality  Is Relative       A key difference between the two approaches to science concerns  the assumed nature of reality and how scientists relate to reality through  their theories and observational evidence (see Hooker 1975). Researchers with a  PIE orientation usually take a realist point of view. Although there are  various types of realism, most P/E researchers appear to believe that an  external world exists (usually one world in one way), and that it is possible  to come closer to knowing the true nature of that world through empirical observations  obtained through rigorous methods and analyses. Theories, then, are treated as  general statements about the real world. The goal is to develop theories that  come increasingly closer to being true statements about reality. Alternatively,  researchers with an R/C orientation conceive of many possible realities, each  of which is relative to a specific context or frame of reference. According to  this view, scientists construct &quot;realities&quot; by developing a degree of  social agreement about the meanings of their theories and empirical  observations (e.g., Collins 1975, Collins and Cox 1976, Elkana 1978, Feyerabend  1975, Gilbert 1976, Munvar 1981).             Science  Is a Social Process       Science is an activity performed by interacting human beings, and  thus obviously is a social process: We believe these social interaction  processes are very important for understanding science. In fact, the exchanges  that take place during these social processes constitute a major reason for our  contention that science is marketing.      Until recently, few philosophers of science have considered the  social interaction and social influence processes involved in scientific  progress. P/E philosophers tend to ignore such social factors or even claim  that such processes are unimportant (or &quot;irrational&quot;) and, thus, not  worthy of study. Instead they continue to be concerned with rather formal  logical models for the justification or testing of theories. That is, P/E  philosophers have focused on the formal presumptions about how theories are verified,  corroborated, or falsified, and converted to scientific knowledge.      In contrast, philosophers with an R/C orientation have been  willing to consider the (less formal) social processes in science. For example,  Kuhn (1970) noted the importance of social influence in evaluating alternative  theories: &quot;The superiority of one theory to another is something that  cannot be proved in debate. Instead, I have insisted, each party must try, by  persuasion, to convert the other&quot; (p. 198, emphasis added). Mitroff (1974),  in his analysis of the Apollo moon scientists, found that certain scientists  are so highly committed to their theories that they resist all persuasive  attempts to change their beliefs and continually try to convert other  scientists to their point of view. Recently, sociologists of science have been  actively investigating how social interaction processes affect the development  of social consensus regarding a scientific method, a theory, or even the  appropriate interpretation of empirical evidence (e.g., Collins 1981, Latour  1980, Pinch 1981). Developing a high degree of social consensus among  scientists is a major objective of marketing strategies for scientific  theories.             Science  Is Subjective       The presumed objectivity of science is a key characteristic of the  P/E approach that currently dominates marketing and related social science  disciplines. However, this aura of objectivity has been steadily eroding for  years across all sciences, including physics (see Zukav 1979). All pretensions  to objectivity (in this narrow sense) disappear on adopting an R/C perspective  on science.      P/E approaches tend to treat scientists' perceptions or sense  impressions naively as providing objective, unbiased representations of the  real world. Thus, empirical observations (manifestations of scientists' sense  impressions) are treated as objective data that are independent of any theory.  In contrast, the R/C perspective recognizes that even so-called direct  perceptions are not objective but are influenced by a multitude of factors,  including relevant past experiences and training. For this reason different  scientists may examine the same data and perceive entirely different meanings  (Stent 1975).      Here we consider the process by which scientific meaning is  developed. There are two aspects of this process, one psychological and the  other sociological. No less a scientist than Einstein (1936) has noted the  psychological aspects quite clearly:      Out of the multitude of our sense experiences we take, mentally  and arbitrarily, certain repeatedly occurring complexes of sense impressions .  . . and we attribute to them a meaning-the meaning of the bodily object.  Considered logically this concept is not identical to the totality of sense  impressions referred to; but it is an arbitrary creation of the human (or  animal) mind . . .. The second step . . . we attribute to this concept of the  bodily object a significance, which is to a high degree independent of the  sense impression that originally gives rise to it. This is what we mean when we  attribute to the bodily object 'a real existence' (p. 60, emphasis added).      The sociological aspect refers to the social interaction and  persuasion processes used to generate a degree of social consensus regarding  the scientific meaning of an observation or a theory. Marketing strategies are  used to influence both the psychological (individual level) and social (group  level) aspects of the meaning development process.      Our point here is that all meanings-including the specific,  technical meanings that constitute much of scientific knowledge-are  subjectively determined. Moreover, an R/C approach to science explicitly  recognizes that meaning is never absolute. Meaning is always meaning in  context, i.e., relative to some frame of reference (Mischler 1979). In science,  theories are an important source of context. If the context changes (perhaps  because the theory is changed during a paradigm shift), so does the meaning of  the relevant empirical observations. P/E approaches tend to deny this  subjective aspect of science by claiming that the rules and procedures for  doing science produce objective, absolute meanings. The R/C perspective  recognizes the inherent subjectivity in science and accounts for it in a  relativistic, context-dependent manner.             Science  Is Rational       Contrary to the protests in the P/E literature (e.g., Suppe 1977),  the preceding discussion does not lead to the conclusion that science is  irrational. Individual scientists can reasonably be assumed to attempt to  achieve their objectives in a rational way. That is, scientists borrow or  create those theories that they believe can accomplish their noble, curiosity,  or self-serving goals. Their beliefs may be found on the basis of what the  &quot;hot topic&quot; is in a discipline, whether a particular theory fits well  with their values and predilections, or how easily a theory can be marketed,  among other factors,      Rationality in science does not require the use of formal rules of  symbolic logic. Nor must the objectives and standards for judging progress be  absolute and fixed. In fact, it is quite clear from the history of science that  standards and objectives vary across time and across research communities.  Similarly, scientific rationality does not require that research be conducted  under the guidelines of a single scientific method such as falsification.  Feyerabend (1975) argues that many major discoveries in science could not have  occurred by following &quot;the&quot; scientific method and persuasively argues  against a single approach to science. In fact, Feyerabend recommends that  &quot;anything goes&quot;-i.e., any methodology or theory, no matter how  unconventional, can contribute to scientific progress. (The problem, of course,  comes in marketing unconventional methods and theories to an unappreciative  audience. Many researchers may be committed to a PIE perspective and major  journals may reject Unusual approaches to developing knowledge. Generating  acceptance of new methods that challenge engrained beliefs and established  research procedures is often difficult. In fact, this problem may generate the  need for new channels (journals or books) to provide outlets for such radical  work.)             Theories  Are Not Universal       A theory has meaning only within its own context, i.e., within its  own set of metatheoretical assumptions (Hooker 1975, Mischler 1979). As these  presuppositions change, so does the meaning of the theory. Moreover, a  completely valid, causal explanation of a phenomenon (i.e., a true theory)  cannot be produced since all rival alternative hypotheses can never be eliminated  (i.e., falsified). In fact, scientists are seldom aware of all the existing  hypotheses that could be used to explain a phenomenon, and, of course,  scientists cannot know of hypotheses and explanations yet to be invented.      Much of the logic underlying the extensive use of experimentation,  representative sampling, and inferential statistics in marketing research is  based on the P/E goal of developing universal theories and laws. However, even  statistical inferences drawn by scientists who believe in statistical theory  are relative to the assumed populations of people, stimuli, measures, etc.,  being sampled. It is also clear from the history of science that no universal  laws or theories have ever been advanced that meet strict P/E requirements (see  Feyerabend 1975, Munvar 1981). In marketing, even simple strategic planning  models have been shown to be restricted to particular situations (see Day 1977,  Wensley 1981). Thus, the P/E view of science that pursues objectives, such as  universal laws, seems misguided. In contrast, the R/C perspective explicitly  recognizes the &quot;boundedness&quot; of theories and the relativistic meaning  of observations, and seeks to specify the limits of their generalizability. In  sum, theories are limited to (relative to) specific times and particular  contexts.             Usefulness  of Theories       Theories can be evaluated in terms of their truth con-tent or  their usefulness. P/E approaches usually focus on truth content. However, no  defensible method for establishing the truth of a theory has ever been advanced  (Peter 1983). Therefore, from an R/C perspective, usefulness seems to be a more  appropriate criterion for evaluating a theory. Usefulness is a pragmatic  criterion concerned with the difference it makes to follow the theory's  recommendations. Here the emphasis is on the performance, or potential  performance of a theory (Munvar 1981). Usefulness can be judged in terms of  how effectively a theory enables the user to &quot;get along&quot; in the world  or accomplish some specific task. For example, if application of a marketing  theory leads to an increase in long run profits for a firm, then it may be  inferred that the theory was a good one; that is, it was useful in that  situation and context, given that objective. Note that the usefulness criterion  of the R/C approach provides no direct evidence of the truth content of the  theory; in fact, truth content is basically irrelevant from an R/C perspective  (Olson 1982).      Theories can be useful in a variety of ways. For example, theories  may include new concepts that offer more interesting or precise descriptions of  phenomena than previously popular constructs. Descriptions of certain consumer  behaviors in terms of &quot;attributions&quot; or &quot;semantic  processing&quot; seem so much more precise than &quot;attitudes&quot; or  &quot;perceptions.&quot; In fact, within the context of current cognitive  theory, these are more precise terms. Theories can also be useful in a  heuristic sense for generating other theories or ideas (Gergen 1978).  Ultimately, though, a pragmatic humanist criterion seems critical, i.e., what  does the theory do to increase societal welfare? Humanistic cr1-teria are much  more easily integrated into science from an R/C than from a P/E perspective.             Data  Never Speak for Themselves       Many P/E philosophers and scientists seem to believe that data are  independent of the theories they are used to test. That is, empirical  observations are assumed to provide an objective benchmark against which to  test and compare theories. Yet, philosophers of science have repeatedly shown  that there is no pure observational language, i.e., all data are theory-laden  (see Feyerabend 1975, Kuhn 1970, Lakatos 1978, Popper 1959, among others). This  point is made clearer if we remember that data (empirical observations) are  constructed just as theories are. Data do not exist in the &quot;real  world&quot; waiting to be gathered. Rather, data are created through the  measurement operations used by scientists to produce them. Clearly, the  scientist selects the theory, hypotheses, research setting, test stimuli,  subjects, measures, and statistics to be used. In fact, the scientist controls  the entire production of research data (Peter, in press).      The point is that scientists control the process of generating  research data, and almost always have biases about what they want to find and  how the data are interpreted. If &quot;negative results&quot; are found that  are unpublishable, a new study nearly always can be conducted to produce  &quot;appropriate&quot; results. Although such attempts will not always be  successful in the short run, we suspect that long-term perseverance often  yields the desired results, especially if combined with an effective marketing  strategy to generate at least a minimum level of consensus as to the value of  the work. However, if, after a number of trials, a researcher still cannot  generate empirical support for a theory, the researcher rather than the theory  may warrant condemnation. Alternatively, it may be that the methods required to  provide the desired empirical observations and results are not yet available.             Recommendations       Our R/C view of science as the marketing of ideas conflicts  sharply with what Mitroff (1972) calls the &quot;fairytale description of  science&quot; (i.e., the P/E view) frequently advocated and apparently believed  by many marketing scholars. We view the P/E accounts of objective theory  testing and the reliance on strict methodological rules such as falsification  as stifling creative science rather than facilitating it. The following  recommendations are offered in the hope that the outdated P/E approach to science  can be replaced by more creative, insightful, and useful styles of inquiry  consistent with the R/C perspective.             Scientific  Training       It is clear that far more effort is exerted in training scientists  in methods of testing hypotheses rather than encouraging them to create  important, provocative, meaningful, or useful theories. The typical doctoral  program in marketing contains many courses intended to prepare students to test  hypotheses, yet embarrassingly little attention is given to how to create hypotheses  and evaluate their merits. In fact, creativity may be stifled in the rush to  ensure that students have the requisite methodological and statistical skills  to produce the empirical demonstrations demanded by the P/E approach to  science. While it seems unlikely that creativity can be taught directly, more  hospitable environments could facilitate such learning. Various scholars,  including Davis (1971), McGuire (1973), Webb (1961) and Zaltman, LeMasters, and  Heffring (1982), have suggested a number of ideas for generating interesting,  insightful, useful research questions.      In essence, creative insights are a function of the amount,  quality, and content of what the individual scientist thinks and does. (For  example. see Gruber's' (1981) fascinating account of Charles Darwin's  creativity.) At present, the major efforts in marketing are devoted to  designing research to test ideas borrowed from other disciplines, rather than  creating and developing theoretical ideas about marketing phenomena and  problems (Sheth 1982). Clearly, &quot;replications&quot; in a marketing context  of research ideas gleaned from other fields has some value. However, it is  unlikely that marketing will advance very rapidly or very far as long as we  depend on other scientists, uninterested in our field, to carry the major  responsibility for creating and developing the theories we use. We need to  adapt and further develop the theories we borrow.      In addition, rather than starting research with a borrowed theory  or construct, it may be more useful to begin with a marketing phenomenon or  problem in which we are interested, and then attempt to develop our own  theories about it. While insights from other fields may aid in investigating  the phenomenon or problem, we should guard against letting them dominate any  ideas we have on our own. Further, we should not constrain our search for  additional insights to traditional areas of borrowing, such as economics,  social and cognitive psychology, and statistics. Many disciplines such as  history, anthropology, sociology, and clinical psychology have useful ideas to  offer.             Values  in Science       We must stop deluding ourselves and others that as empirical  scientists, we are impartial to the outcomes of our research, that our research  is objective, and that we are dealing with established facts rather than  inferences of varying quality. Clearly, scientists are advocates for their  theories, hypotheses, and data. Usually &quot;positive findings&quot; must be  produced to persuade others and to successfully market scientific work. To  argue that all &quot;scientific&quot; research should be designed to falsify  specific hypotheses is misleading and dysfunctional for our progress. Empirical  research is certainly valuable. However, data should not be viewed as providing  an objective test of a theory's truth value. Empirical evidence may be more  appropriately viewed as demonstrating the usefulness of a theoretical idea in a  particular context.             Scientific  Behavior       It should be clear that studying science as a social activity can  produce new knowledge, not only about science but also about the behavior of  scientists as well. For example, Mitroff's (1974) classic study of the Apollo  moon scientists, Knorr-Cetina's (1981) investigation of laboratory physicists,  Latour and Woolgar's (1979) description of biology scientists at the Salk  Institute, and Zukav's (1979) insights into the conduct of research on quantum  mechanics provide detailed descriptions of the social nature of science. These  analyses clearly show that scientists are social beings with social needs, not  automatons following a program of formal logical analysis. In addition,  investigations of collaborative research practices (Over 1982), secretiveness  and competitiveness for priority of discovery by researchers (Gaston 1971),  referencing behavior (Gilbert 1977), and outright fudging of research results,  such as the case of Cyril Burt and J. B. Watson (see Samelson 1980), provide  insights about scientific progress and the social behavior of the scientists  involved. Finally, studying the marketing plans of successful scientists could  improve our knowledge of the effectiveness of various marketing strategies and  tactics in producing scientific progress. (For example, see Feyerabend's (1975)  analysis of the strategies followed by Galileo in marketing his radical views  on astronomy.)             Context-Specific  Meaning       We need to investigate meaning in context rather than strive to  produce universal laws and theories. Mischler (1979) and Morgan and Smircich  (1980) suggested some procedures for such research. In fields such as sociology  and organizational behavior, considerable work is currently being done on the  development of new methods of context-specific inquiry (e.g., Knorr-Cetina and  Mulkay 1983, Morgan 1983). At a minimum, consideration of these works points to  the need to more fully observe and report research details in current  approaches to research and to critically evaluate current research methods that  were designed for seeking universal generalizations. In general, less emphasis  on following normative rules of research conduct garnered from P/E accounts of  science may aid in the development of better methods and theories.             Summary  and Conclusions       We have shown that many aspects of scientific activity are  consistent with basic marketing concepts and processes. We have implied that  astute scientists could make good use of basic marketing principles to develop  effective strategies for promoting their theories, In addition, we have shown  that the &quot;science is marketing&quot; perspective is more consistent with  the &quot;new&quot; R/C philosophy of science than with the outdated P/E  orientation that currently dominates marketing research. We have also argued  that adopting an R/C approach in marketing could produce more creative and  useful theories.      While we believe that marketing provides a useful perspective for  analyzing science, other views of science are useful as well. For example,  science can also be analyzed as art and theater (Feyerabend 1968), rhetoric  (Gusfield 1976), communication (Edge 1979), and cognitive psychology (Tweney,  Doherty, and Mynatt 1981). Moreover, aspects of science are similar to  mysticism (Capra 1975) as well as more formally organized religion (Feyerabend  1968). In some situations, even the positivistic/empiricist perspective may offer  useful ideas about science. Future research on science might identify and  create new perspectives, combine and compare alternative perspectives, and  specify the contexts and situations under which one perspective may be more  useful than another.      Finally, it is reasonable to ask what we have learned about the  question, &quot;Is marketing a science?&quot; While we recognize that no  defensible criterion for distinguishing science from nonscience has ever been  found (Laudan 1982), we believe that the main task of science is to create  useful knowledge. To the degree that marketing has done so, then it can be  labeled a science. As marketing scientists we should be concerned to make our  discipline more effective in creating useful knowledge about our subject  matter. We believe that such improvements are best achieved by adopting the  relativistic/constructionist approach to science advocated here. Recognizing  the social processes of science, the context specificity of scientific  knowledge, and other features of the R/C program can give marketing scholars  the freedom and confidence to create new conceptual schemes and perspectives.  This is in contrast to following the outdated rules of the P/E approach that  focus only on testing theories we already have. A creative science of marketing  is more likely to flourish by taking a relativistic/constructionist approach.

This course will serve as an introduction to the diverse perspectives that are taught in the NYU Postdoctoral Program by exposing students to the key ideas and concepts, the historical development, and the clinical approach of each of the major orientations or schools. Ethical considerations relevant to psychoanalytic practice will be emphasized. ( Ethics   component of the course )    Writing Psychoanalytically (PDPSA.4553)  Instructor: Steven Knoblauch    This course is designed to be taken concomitant with any other course in the Postdoctoral Program or as an independent study project. It serves as an opportunity to write about a particular topic or question either emerging within another course taken at the same time as this course, or as an independent writing project. It is unique to the program as it offers six classes in which candidates are able to compare and contrast their writing over time and with each other.    Psychoanalytic Supervision (PDPSA.4543)  Instructor: Helen Gediman        This course reviews the present state of psychoanalytic thinking on the supervisory process with major emphases on the supervisory process in a climate of theoretical diversity and heterogeneity and the supervisory process as a triadic system with multiple interactions as the focus. Readings and clinical presentations by students are utilized to illustrate the main issues being studied.            THE HISTORY &amp; DEVELOPMENT OF PSYCHOANALYSIS FOCUSING ON SPECIFIC CONTRIBUTORS: Selected Topics (PDPSA.4580)    As in the humanities, and unlike some sciences, psychoanalysis must be studied historically. Whatever one\u2019s current point of view, a well-educated analyst must have a solid understanding of Freud\u2019s contributions and texts as well as those of other significant contributors. Often the contributions of seminal psychoanalytic writers must also be studied in conjunction with their school of thought. This course teaches students the theory and practice of psychoanalysis through a study of notable individuals\u2019 contributions, developmentally and historically, as well as by studying the historical development of specific schools of thought. In various semesters or in different sections this course will focus on one contributor or tradition.

This course encourages students to present their own clinical work in detail over time working with feedback from other students and with the guidance of faculty. Depending on the semester or section the focus may be on treatment from a particular theoretical slant or on specific aspects of the treatment.

One factor in individualizing treatment is to take into account diagnostic considerations and various dimensions of psychopathology. This course introduces students to current, sophisticated thinking about how psychoanalysis works with various styles of personality and forms of pathology. Each semester or section will focus on a different category or personality style taught from one or more theoretical perspectives.

This course introduces students to current theories of dreaming, empirical research on dreaming, and clinical work with dreams. Each semester or section will focus on a specific aspect of dreams, such as methodology for dream interpretation or comparative study of dream theories.           Clinical Seminar on Dreams  Instructor: Mark Blechner    Current Perspectives on Dreaming: Theory, Research and Practice  Instructor: James Fosshage   COMPARATIVE PSYCHOANALYSIS: Selected Topics (PDPSA.4584)    Contemporary psychoanalysis is diverse and pluralistic, some might even say fragmented into various schools and theories. This course examines psychoanalytic theories and clinical practices using a model of \u201ccomparative psychoanalysis.\u201d Theories and practices are examined historically, compared along the lines of theoretical and clinical issues, and compared for their implications in the treatment situation. Readings and course discussions add complexity and depth to the student\u2019s sense of the contributions and limitations of each model for clinical practice.

How do we understand the psychoanalytic method? What are the technical implications of diverse theories? What is the relationship between theory and technique and when can theory aid or interfere in treatment? Each semester or section will examine a specific theory and its application in depth and detail.

From this point of view, psychoanalysis itself can be critiqued as constructing and constraining such discourses. In addition, psychoanalysis is viewed as part of the larger mental health system, with all its social welfare and social control functions. But psychoanalysis can also function in service of social critique, as when it offers understandings of socio-economic-political structures that are concealed in the surface of ordinary discourses. These include the workings of power and privilege and how these are distributed along lines of race, social class, culture, gender, and sexual orientation. Each semester or section of this course will focus on various political, spiritual, and cultural issues.

Feminist critiques of those assumptions, both within the field and from psychoanalytic outsiders, have led to dramatic changes in psychoanalytic theory and practice. This course links the psychic and the social in the construction of gender and sexuality. Each semester or section will examine one aspect of this constellation in depth, focusing variously on gender, sexuality, feminism, and/or queer theory.

Classical theory began with a focus on the development of sexuality and the psychosexual stages, but soon analysts were studying the development of the sense of reality and a variety of developmental lines. This course examines various developmental perspectives in psychoanalysis, sometimes by observing young children and at other times retrospectively through the reconstruction of earlier life experience in adults. Some semesters and sections focus on infant research, some on later developmental phases, some on the clinical implications of developmental theory, and some on very specific developmental factors such as early loss or the family context.

Psychoanalytic theory has itself influenced infancy research and infancy research has influenced psychoanalysis. Second-by-second analysis of face-to-face interactions between parent and infant have led to monumental changes in how we understand bodily and affect regulation as well as the early origins of relatedness and patterns of communication that continue to operate through the lifetime. Each semester or section of this course will explore recent developments in infancy research focusing on methodological considerations, theoretical and/or clinical implications.

{"detail": [{"content": "Is Science Marketing                       Is Science Marketing?       J. Paul Peter &amp; Jerry C. Olson       (Published in the Journal of Marketing,  Fall 1983, pp. 111-125)             Abstract       Science is  analyzed as a special case of marketing-the marketing of ideas in the form of  substantive and methodological theories. The marketing mix, target markets, and  marketing objectives are developed for the scientific arena, and a formal  analysis of a relativistic/constructionist view of science is used to support  the approach. This view is contrasted with the positivistic/empiricist  perspective of science currently dominant in marketing and other social  sciences. Recommendations are offered for improved methods of developing  knowledge.                    For more than 30 years, marketing scholars have debated whether or  not marketing is a science (e.g., Alderson and Cox 1948, Bartels 1951, Baumol  1957, Buzzell 1963, Converse 1945, Hunt 1976, O'Shaughnessy and Ryan 1979,  Taylor 1965). The typical approach has been to offer a formal definition of  science or describe prototypic methods used in science and then compare  marketing's key features and/or its developmental progress against these  standards. Despite these fairly intense analyses, a consensus regarding the  scientific status of marketing has not yet been achieved. Some believe that marketing  is a science, while others believe that although scientific procedures are  employed in marketing, on the whole, marketing is an art. In contrast to these  two segments, many other marketing scholars seem to be withholding judgment,  perhaps awaiting more compelling arguments one way or the other.      Although well intentioned, we believe the debate regarding whether  or not marketing is a science has been largely unproductive. For the most part,  we attribute the current confusion to the somewhat naive conceptions of science  that have informed the controversy. In particular, we consider the typical  beliefs about how scientists do scientific work and how scientific progress is  achieved to be inconsistent with current views about such issues in the  disciplines of philosophy, sociology, and history of science. That is, in  asking, &quot;Is marketing a science?&quot; marketing scholars have been  comparing theory development and testing in marketing to inappropriate  standards that have little to do with the conduct of scientific inquiry in any  field.      This article presents a relatively new and more useful conception  of science than has been considered to date in the debates regarding  marketing's scientific status. To do so, we turn the tables in this  long-standing debate by asking the more fundamental and interesting question.  &quot;Is science marketing?&quot; In this article we consider whether science  can be effectively analyzed as a special case of marketing-the marketing of  ideas. (For this purpose, we adopt the currently popular definition of  marketing as &quot;human activity directed as satisfying needs and wants  through exchange processes&quot; (Kotler 1980). This is consistent with the  arguments of Bagozzi (1975) and Hunt (1983) that exchange is a key unifying  concept for the field. We suspect that most marketing scholars accept this  definition.)      The article has two major sections. In the first we analyze common  scientific practices in terms of conventional elements of marketing strategy.  Specifically, we consider the elements in the marketing mix, market targets,  and marketing objectives. Although we can consider only a few of the major  concepts in marketing, the examples in this brief analysis provide support for  our contention that science can be viewed as a special case of marketing. In  the second section, we discuss a relativistic/constructionist perspective  derived from recent work in science studies that provide a conceptual rationale  for analyzing science from a marketing perspective. We point out key  differences between this emerging approach to science and the traditional  positivistic/empiricist view that still pervades marketing (see Hunt 1983) and  other social sciences (see Koch 1981). Again, due to space restrictions, we  focus only on major points of departure from the traditional view and cite  major works to which readers can refer for additional information.             Marketing Scientific Theories       What makes a scientific theory successful? Simply stated, a  successful theory is one that is treated seriously and studied by a significant  portion of a research community. Practitioners may even employ such theories as  frameworks for analyzing important problems. In other words, a successful  theory is-one that has been adopted by a substantial market segment, just as is  the case of a successful consumer good. We argue that to successfully achieve  an adequate level of adoption, scientists must (at least implicitly) develop  and carry out a marketing strategy to promote their theories. In this section,  we consider some of the concepts and strategies involved in this process.  First, we describe scientific theories in terms of the four basic elements of  the marketing mix-product, channels of distribution, promotion, and price. Then  we discuss the idea of market segmentation for theories. Finally, we consider  the marketing objectives for scientific work.             Theories  as Products       In the broadest sense, the major products of science are ideas.  Scientific ideas consist of invented constructs and hypothesized relationships  among them. A system of such ideas about a phenomenon may be called a  substantive theory. Scientists also create ideas about methods of obtaining,  analyzing, and interpreting data. These are methodological theories of  measurement, sampling, and data analysis. Regardless of the type of idea or  theory, it should not be forgotten that the entire theory product is invented  or constructed by one or more scientists, just as ideas for consumer products  are invented or constructed. Like ideas for consumer products and the products  themselves, substantive and/or methodological theory products must also be  marketed. (Clearly, an understanding of the processes and/or accidents by which  new theories are created is critical for an understanding of science. While we  will not review the extant literature on the creation of scientific or other  products, i.e. &quot;marketing R&amp;D,&quot; interested readers should see  Zaltman, LeMasters, and Heffring (1982) and Stein (1974, 1975).)      At some point in the development of a theory the scientist usually  produces a manuscript that describes the idea. The manuscript may also present  empirical data that illustrate the idea and/or provide tentative support. A  manuscript is a tangible representation of the invented system of ideas.  Marketing a theory as a tangible manuscript is both easier and more effective  than promoting an intangible set of ideas, for at least four reasons. First,  potential adopters can easily store the theory product for use (study) at a  more convenient time. Second, because the manuscript is always available,  potential adopters can reexamine and reflect on the theory and possibly come to  appreciate its value. Third, the relative permanence of a manuscript allows  wider dissemination of the theory to a secondary, pass-along audience (e.g.,  students). Finally, a tangible manuscript may be used to establish the  scientist/marketer as the inventor of the theory or as the first to borrow the  theory from another area and apply it in a new field.      Over its life cycle a theory may undergo a number of modifications  in response to a variety of potential marketing problems. Customer complaints  regarding measurement difficulties or lack of conceptual clarity, and  competitive theory products marketed by other scientists, are among the many  problems a new theory may face in trying to capture a viable market share of  scientists. Perhaps the most serious problem occurs when a test of a theory  fails to predict adequately. This means that the theory is not meeting the  needs of the largest segment of researchers-those concerned with prediction and  methodological and empirical rigor. If the research community cannot be  convinced that the empirical test procedures were faulty, either the inventor  scientist or another scientist who has adopted the theory may change specific  characteristics of the theory product in response to such problems. However,  the modified theory is seldom renamed, as this might lose loyal customers. Many  of these modifications are made to seem minor and the change process may be  quite gradual, often so much so that the target market of scientists does not  always recognize the changes. However, it should be emphasized that any change  in a theory creates a modified product-i.e., a different theory. For instance,  researchers made a number of seemingly minor conceptual changes in the  Fishbein-type expectancy-value models during the period of major interest in  the marketing literature (1969-1975), yet only the most knowledgeable consumers  were aware that these changes created different theories (e.g., Cohen,  Fishbein, and Ahtola 1972).      Product Attributes. As with consumer products, several key attributes of a theory  have a large effect on marketing success. A major characteristic concerns the  topic, issue, problem, or phenomenon that is addressed. A theory may concern an  issue of major importance, a &quot;big&quot; problem, or a relatively  &quot;small&quot; issue of little theoretical or practical importance (Olson  1982). In some ways it may be easier to market the latter type of theory. For  instance, the most widely adopted theories tend to be those that are easiest to  understand and research empirically, especially in long periods of normal  science (Kuhn 1970). If research on a theory requires special equipment (e.g..  polygraphs for the study of brain waves) or special subject populations (e.g.,  managers or purchasing agents), that theory is not likely to be widely  researched. In contrast, theories that are easily researched with conventional  measurement procedures (e.g., self-report rating scales) and easily accessible  samples (e.g., students) are more likely to achieve higher adoption rates.      A second important attribute of a theory concerns the professional  credentials and status of the inventor or the borrower. Scientists who are well  known and respected, based on their previous contributions to a field, have  better chances of successfully introducing new theories than do less well-known  researchers. The credibility of the scientist/marketer may add a halo effect to  the theory product. Inventors or borrowers who do not enjoy a strong reputation  in their fields (e.g., doctoral students) may need to attract established  researchers (&quot;celebrity scholars&quot;) to help market their theories.      Third, theories that are borrowed and adapted from more  established, familiar fields seem to be more easily marketed than theories  gleaned from unconventional areas or that are constructed &quot;from  scratch.&quot; For example, it is probably easier to promote theories for use  in marketing that are borrowed from psychology and economics rather than from  areas such as anthropology, religion, or art.      Fourth, theories which contain familiar, common, everyday  concepts, words, meanings, and relationships (e.g., needs, attitudes,  personality) may be easier to market successfully than theories which require  learning new words, meanings, and relationships (e.g., shaping, aesthetic  response, semantic relatedness, coherence analysis, negative reinforcement).  Familiar concepts that are learned in childhood and are frequently used in  everyday language may be considered as highly important concepts to be  researched and understood. However, in other cases, new words and meanings can  be useful for marketing theories, since knowledge of them may give a scientist  admission to the cognoscenti of a research community.      Fifth, theories that are consistent with current political and  social values are easier to market (Barnes 1977, Gould 1982). For example, a  theory advocating gender differences in cognitive abilities is difficult to  market in the current environment, even with impressive empirical support (see  Stanley and Benbow 1982). In addition, since political and social values often  determine funding priorities, theories dealing with problems for which ample  research support is available are more easily marketed to potential scientist  adopters.      The sixth (and purposefully last) product attribute is the  preliminary empirical evidence that can be marshaled to support a theory.  Strong empirical support is a highly desirable attribute that will enhance the  marketability of a theory. However, strong empirical evidence is neither  necessary nor sufficient for the successful dissemination of a theory. A number  of theories have been fairly widely adopted, despite poor (or even no) initial  empirical support (e.g., early atomic theory or Freudian personality theory).  Of course scientists differ in the extent to which they are concerned about the  &quot;fit&quot; between data and theory; thus, the importance of empirical  support for a theory is likely to vary for different scientists (see Mitroff  and Kilmann 1978).      Test Marketing. Quite often, scientists test market their theories before  attempting a full-scale introduction via journal publication. Their major goal  is to gauge the reactions of potential adopters of the theory and to identify  and correct any glaring flaws before the theory is introduced on a major scale.  One way to do this is by circulating working papers among colleagues and  friends in the &quot;invisible college&quot; (see Crane 1972). In addition,  colloquia and seminars may be presented to colleagues and students and their  reactions sought. At least three results are possible. First, and least likely,  listeners may judge the theory product to be irretrievably flawed. This seldom  occurs, since the listeners at most test-market presentations are other  scientists who not only share the same worldview as the inventor, but also are  social friends who respect the inventor. Normally, such groups are reluctant to  totally reject the theory product. However, test market presentations to less  hospitable groups occasionally do produce such an extreme rejection. Second, in  equally rare cases, the product may be viewed as a major accomplishment with no  serious problems and judged to be ready for introduction.      Instead, the results of test marketing are likely to suggest a variety  of modifications to the theory. These may involve adding or deleting  constructs, clarifying and redefining constructs, or changing the theoretical  relationships between constructs. At a minimum, cosmetic changes may be made in  the theory's packaging (words and labels used) or suggestions may be made for  repositioning the product. As with traditional consumer products, the  scientist/marketer must consider whether changing the theory according to the  recommendations derived from test marketing will improve the chances of  successfully marketing the product.             Channels  of Distribution for Theories       There are many channels by which scientific theories may be  disseminated to potential adopters. The various channels of distribution have  different levels of effectiveness and may be differentially appropriate at  different stages in the development and testing of the theory. In the early  stages of development, most theories are disseminated via presentations at  colloquia and conferences, and through informally distributed working papers.  While conference and colloquia presentations are especially valuable in that  they provide direct feedback to the scientist/marketer, not many scholars are  likely to adopt a theory distributed in this way. For one thing, relatively few  scholars can be exposed to the theory through these inefficient channels.  Before widespread adoption can be anticipated, most theories must pass the  muster of the gatekeepers in the discipline (the reviewers and editors of  prestigious journals) and thereby achieve both legitimization and widespread  exposure. A theory that is evaluated poorly in test marketing may go no further  than being published in a conference proceedings, if at all. The theory may  languish there for several years before finally fading away or being  resurrected by another scientist who happens to stumble across it.  Occasionally, a theory is published first in a proceedings and later in a  journal, but this is generally considered bad form unless major changes have  occurred in the manuscript.      Some marketers begin the dissemination process by submitting the  manuscript directly to the key channel, a major journal. If the manuscript is  rejected from a number of major journals, the inventor/marketer may attempt to  disseminate the theory through other channels, perhaps less prestigious or  highly specialized journals. Using these channels to distribute a theory  reduces the probability that the theory will enjoy rapid acceptance, although  publication per se does enhance the chances for eventual success. Publication  in even an obscure or specialized journal may still reach the most interested  target market of researchers who may then be influential in further  disseminating the theory throughout the research community. Alternatively, if  the theory cannot be published in a major journal, some marketers may try to  publish the theory in book form or as a chapter in a book. However, this  channel is not readily or equally available to all scientists. Thus, the more  likely outcome is that the marketer will present the theory at one or more  conferences and publish a paper in a proceedings, if available. Of course, the  chances of successfully marketing the theory decrease with the use of more  restricted, less prestigious channels of distribution.             Promotion  of Theories       Throughout the life cycle of a theory, from creation to test  marketing to publication in a major journal to the widespread adoption and use  of a theory by the research community, promotion is a key factor in  successfully marketing a theory. As with consumer goods, a variety of  promotional techniques can be used. Interestingly, and contrary to popular  beliefs, theories that do not provide impressive empirical results, produce a  potential resolution to a major problem in the field (Kuhn 1970, Popper 1959),  or generate novel predictions (Lakatos 1978), can still be marketed  successfully.      Although strong empirical results are very useful in promoting a  theory, they are not absolutely necessary. For example, personality research in  marketing in the 1960s and early 1970s seldom surpassed the relatively trivial  hurdle of obtaining statistically significant correlations between measures of  personality and a variety of other factors (Kassarjian 1971). Yet personality  theory enjoyed wide popularity. Because the weak empirical results were usually  attributed to methodological problems, most researchers did not conclude that  the underlying theory was wrong. In fact, many marketing researchers still  believe in personality theory despite the generally disappointing empirical  results. Recently, new methods have produced more impressive empirical support  for personality theory (see Epstein 1979, 1980), although a resurgence of  interest has not yet occurred in marketing.      It is also possible to successfully market a theory that makes no  unusual or novel predictions and is in fact quite similar to other theories. Of  course, a scientist's promotion task will be easier if the theory product has  unique features (e.g., it generates novel predictions) or it has desirable  attributes of a compelling logic coupled with strongly supportive data.  However, as long as the new theory is relatively consistent with the worldview  of at least a segment of the field, it can be successfully promoted. A new  theory that is based on a different set of metatheoretical assumptions than  those held by most members of a research community can be difficult to  successfully promote and market. This is similar to situations in consumer  goods marketing in which discontinuous innovations that are inconsistent with  consumers' social values and behavior patterns are often hard to sell.  (Strictly speaking, no scientific theory is constructed of totally new concepts  created in isolation from earlier concepts and theories. Previous research and  theorizing certainly has an impact on the scientist/ inventor who is trying to  create a &quot;new&quot; theory. However, some new theories are seen as more  creative and less continuous with previous work than are others. We are merely  arguing that it is more difficult to market the more discontinuous theories.  This discussion should not be taken to imply that scientific work is cumulative  in the sense that a sequence of theories will ultimately lead to a valid  general theory.)      In addition to &quot;direct advertising&quot; via publication in  journals, books, and proceedings, a theory can also be promoted through  publicity and personal selling. Publicity for a theory includes notices of  forthcoming articles in journals, abstracts of published articles printed in  other journals, and notices of working papers in association newsletters.  Occasionally, a scientist/marketer can get other scientists to cite the new  theory, perhaps while still in working paper form. Scientists may be able to  generate discussion of their theory in nonscholarly publications such as  Marketing News or Psychology Today. Finally, if dissertation research testing  the theory wins awards or other recognition, the resulting publicity can be  very helpful in the overall marketing effort. Publicity may perform a useful informational  or reminder role, but is likely to be less persuasive than other forms of  promotion. However, a &quot;bandwagon effect&quot; for a theory might be  enhanced through this kind of promotion.      Personal selling is an important element of the promotional  strategy for theories. Personal selling occurs during formal or informal  presentations of the theory as well as in direct one-on-one discussions with  potential adopters. Moreover, salesmanship is an important aspect of dealing  with editors and reviewers in the revision process. Direct selling can be an  effective method of persuasion since the scientist/marketer can address  counter-arguments of the potential buyer head on and can offer ad hoc  hypotheses to cover many of the perceived weaknesses in the theory. Finally, a  personal selling strategy can be particularly effective with one's doctoral  students.             Price  of Theories       The scientist who adopts a new theory must pay a price that  involves time and money as well as psychological and behavioral costs. Part of  the price of adopting a new theory involves the time spent learning the new  theory and its methods, as well as the associated opportunity costs. The  adopter of a new theory may also incur financial costs in purchasing new  equipment (e.g., a physiology lab) or in education/training costs (e.g.,  attending seminars on causal modeling). Other costs include the psychological  effort and disruption involved in changing one's existing beliefs and  established research behaviors. A major component of the price of adopting a  new theory involves the behavioral effort of actively researching the theory,  writing about it, and performing the behaviors necessary to get the results  published in major journals.      Like consumer products, theories vary in price. Low-priced  theories are those that are consistent with the worldview and existing research  skills of the target market of scientists. Adopting such theories is relatively  inexpensive, as learning time is short and belief and behavior changes are  minimal. That is, the price is within easy reach of many potential consumers.  Thus, the scientist/marketer who prices his/her theory at the low end enhances  the chances that the theory will penetrate the mass market.      In contrast, theories that are radically different from the  established worldview of the research community and/or from the research  procedures common in a field carry a higher price tag. Adopting such theories  may require considerable learning time, extensive belief changes, and major  changes in research behavior. Therefore, such high priced theories need to be  marketed carefully and well. The marketing effort is facilitated if the  scientist can articulate the benefits to be provided by the new theory. Because  these benefits have to be perceived as substantial to justify the high price,  some scientists substantially oversell their substantive or methodological  theories in order to attract consumers (see Churchill and Perrault 1982). For  example, it appears that structural equations methodology has been  substantially oversold in the social sciences (see Cliff 1983, Fornell 1983).      A variety of situational factors can influence the success of a  high priced theory, primarily by making it seem worth the cost to early  adopters. First, it is helpful if the worldview incorporated in established  theories is recognized as problematic by a segment of the research community.  In fact, Kuhn (1970) argues that a scientific revolution cannot take place  unless the traditional view is recognized as failing and an alternative theory  is available. Second, the availability of research funds to investigate the new  theory is a powerful motivator for pursuing a new theory product. For example,  funding for research on the effects of advertising on children lowered the  price of entering this new area. Third, in some situations researchers may be  bored with the traditional approach and, therefore, are willing to incur the  cost of adopting more provocative theories. Similarly, some researchers may  simply feel they can make little marginal contribution to the traditional view  and are seeking to invest in new theories with greater payoff potential. In'  sum, there are particular situations when high priced theories are more likely  to be adopted by a research community. From a marketing strategy perspective,  these situations are strategic windows that the scientist/marketer can use to  advantage in introducing an expensive theory product.      A final consideration regarding the price of a theory concerns the  fact that not all researchers can afford to pay the price required for adoption  of a new theory. A prime determinant of what price an individual scientist can  afford to pay is his/her place in the tenure decision process. Younger  pre-tenure scholars may not feel they can afford a high priced theory. They may  need less expensive theories that have a fairly high probability of producing  rapid benefits, such as easily publishable journal articles. High priced  theories, by their very nature, tend to offer benefits with a longer time  horizon. Moreover, a fairly high degree of risk is associated with most high  priced theories, and many pre-tenure Scientists may not wish to incur such  risks. Therefore, more senior, post-tenure scholars may be more willing to  invest in higher priced theories. Occasionally, beginning scholars, such as  doctoral students, who have relatively little time and effort invested in  traditional theories and methods, may adopt higher priced theories, especially  if encouraged to do so by their post-tenure mentors. However, in these cases,  the theory is probably already in the growth stage of the product life cycle,  or at least appears to be a theory with a high probability of success, based on  its attributes.             Target  Markets for New Theories       A research community can be segmented in a number of ways. As just  discussed, scientists can be divided in terms of their position in the career  life cycle. Three distinct groups can be identified: doctoral students,  pie-tenure scholars, and post-tenure scholars. The latter group might be  further divided by rank into associate and full professors. Theory products  will differentially appeal to these groups and, as noted, these groups can  afford to pay different prices for theories and are willing to incur different  levels of risk. Of course, different marketing strategies may be required for  each of these segments.      A prime target market for a scientist's theory is his/her own  doctoral students, although the students of other scholars are of interest as  well. Usually these potential customers are seeking exactly what the marketer  has to offer a new theory or method in need of empirical research in a  discipline-related context. Ideally, the theory should be somewhat new in order  to establish that the dissertation is a &quot;contribution&quot; to the field.  As mentioned above, this target market may react less negatively if the theory  deviates substantially from the accepted view in the field, partly because its  members have not yet become fully committed to that perspective. Additionally,  doctoral students constitute an important target market because they (I) often  become apostles for the theory once they have invested the time to learn it and  begin to research it, (2) are entering the most active stage of their research  careers and may help market the theory through their writings, and (3) may be  more easily persuaded as they have little investment in competing theories.      The second important target market for a new theory is the group  of active research scholars in the field. This group can be further segmented  into pre- and post-tenure researchers, and each of these segments can be  further divided into adopter categories of opinion leaders, followers, and  laggards. Of these, the opinion leaders are critically important. A single  study on a new theory by an opinion leader may be sufficient to create  widespread interest. Opinion leader scientists are also likely to be mentors  for high quality doctoral students who can be encouraged to research the  theory. In addition, opinion leaders can often directly influence other active  researchers to consider studying and using the theory, thereby increasing its  adoption rate and eventual market share. Finally, studies by opinion leaders  are more likely to be featured in textbooks, which also helps to establish the  theory. (Once a theory has achieved &quot;textbook status,&quot; it tends to  become part of the discipline's body of &quot;knowledge.&quot; Regardless of  whether the measures are subsequently invalidated or empirical results ever  show impressive relationships, such theories are seldom purged entirely from  the literature. Over time the theory may lose followers and interest as new  theories are offered which are perceived to be better or deal with what seem to  be more important or interesting problems. Although some laggard researchers  will continue to investigate the old theory, only occasionally will this work  be published in a major outlet. When it is, it may still be employed in  textbooks for the purpose of giving a fresh reference to an old chapter and for  exemplifying the supposedly cumulative nature of scientific inquiry. In fact,  Kuhn (1970) argues that textbooks rewrite the history of theories in order to  make science appear to be cumulative.)      The scholars least likely to adopt a new theory are those who  remain loyal to a previous theory, particularly if it is their own or one in  which they have invested heavily. In fact, members of this group are more  likely to criticize the new theory and attempt to remove it from the market.  Such attempts may well take the form of &quot;replications&quot; which are intended  to discredit the new theory. Often these attempts are partly successful since  most theories have numerous problems in the early stage of development. For  example, because constructs used in the theory have surplus meaning, parts of  the theory can be interpreted in a manner that reveals inconsistencies and  ambiguities. It may be fairly easy to show that the theoretical concepts have  different meanings than intended by the inventor/marketer, thus adding to the  confusion regarding the theory. Second, since the skeptical researcher now  controls the method in a replication, he/she can usually generate results  inconsistent with the new theory. For example, the design could include too few  subjects to allow sufficient statistical power to detect the effect, or a  research setting involving many uncontrolled sources of variance could be used  to &quot;wash out&quot; an effect. In sum, an antagonistic scientist can often  demonstrate that a new theory's predictions are poorer than previously  reported, or even that &quot;disconfirming&quot; effects are obtained. Finally,  because all research requires a myriad of subjective decisions, the competitor  scientist can usually argue that at least some of the original methodological  decisions were inappropriate and thus produced data that were biased in favor  of the theory. In such controversies, comments, replies, and rejoinders can  continue back and forth to the limits of the tolerance of editors, reviewers,  and the research community.      The market for a new theory can also be segmented in terms of  psychological characteristics. Scientists have differing views about what  counts as important, interesting theory, and these values and beliefs influence  their evaluations of a new theory. Based on such attributes, Mitroff and  Kilmann (1978) have identified four types of scientists. Two of these are  particularly relevant for segmenting scientific markets. The analytical  scientist (AS) is mainly concerned with tightly controlled, highly rigorous  research designs intended to test well-specified hypotheses deduced from  theory. This group seems to be the largest segment in marketing and in most  other fields~ In contrast, the conceptual theorist (CT) is more concerned with  abstract ideas, how they fit logically together, and with their heuristic,  generative power for creating other ideas. This group is small in both  marketing and in most other disciplines. Obviously, the characteristics of a  new theory will strongly influence which of these groups will be more  attracted. The CT group may be more likely to adopt a new theoretical  perspective if it is quite different from existing perspectives and offers  promise for dealing with important, complex phenomena and problems. CT's tend  not to be concerned about a lack of empirical support, especially early in a  theory's development. On the other hand, an AS is not likely to adopt a new  theory until it has been developed to the stage where methods and measures can  be relatively unambiguously applied to test specific aspects of the theory.  Moreover, the preliminary data should look promising.             Marketing  Objectives       Although the marketer of a scientific theory probably has  objectives or goals in mind for that theory, and for his/her career as a  scientist, these goals are not often explicit. For purposes of discussion, we  have roughly categorized scientists' objectives into three groups: noble,  curiosity, and self-serving goals. Conceptually, these three classes are  mutually exclusive; however, more than one type of objective can be achieved  with the same marketing strategy.      Noble objectives are those most commonly associated with science.  Included are such lofty goals as seeking knowledge, attempting to understand a  phenomenon, and contributing to a discipline or to society as a whole. Normally  such goals are considered to be beyond reproach. Note, however, that to  accomplish these goals, a scientist must market his/her work to the scientific  community (or get someone else to do the marketing). A theory can make no  contribution if the work is kept hidden in a file drawer. Thus, scientists must  market their theories to achieve even noble goals.      Curiosity objectives refer to seeking answers to one's personal  questions about the subject of inquiry. Curiosity goals are closely related to  noble goals, and they differ primarily in the degree to which the work is  performed for self versus others. Doing research for the fun of it and the  sheer joy of learning new things are not unknown as motivators in science.  However, if the scientist needs no cooperation from others, contents him-/herself  with the findings, needs no cooperation from others, and shares them with no  one, marketing is not involved. Only when the theory and the findings are  exchanged with someone else does the marketing process for the theory become  relevant.      Self-serving objectives are well known within scientific  communities but are not widely recognized among the general public, nor do  professional philosophers of science usually consider them. Self-serving goals  lead researchers to perform scientific work primarily for the purpose of  personal gain. The rewards for being a successful scientist can be substantial:  promotions, job security, money (in the form of salary, grants, and consulting  fees), release time from other duties, prestige and recognition in the field,  and specific awards and honors. While these gains are usually intended for  scientists who pursue noble goals, they often are awarded to those who seek  mainly self-serving goals. Occasionally, the research community may deny at  least some of the sought rewards to scientists who pursue only self-serving  goals, especially in a blatant manner. The research community may infer that a  particular researcher is seeking only self-serving goals based on the  researcher's verbal reports of objectives, and from practices such as producing  a large number of marginal theory/research papers, or relabeling and publishing  the same paper in multiple channels.      Clearly, different goals may lead researchers to adopt different  marketing strategies. For instance, some scientists who pursue noble goals may  naively believe that overt marketing effort is unnecessary and even demeaning,  since an obviously superior theory will &quot;sell itself.&quot; Of course,  sophisticated marketers can easily recognize this perspective as a sign of a  strong product orientation and not a particularly viable strategy for long-term  success. It is also clear that different goals may lead to the same strategy,  i.e., development and marketing of a high quality theory product with a high  quality marketing plan. Moreover, scientists may have multiple goals that are  consistent. Perhaps it would be worthwhile to study scientists' goals, their  hierarchical relationships, and their impact on scientific progress. However,  the main point here is that accomplishing scientific objectives depends on the  quality of the marketing strategy and the effort exerted.             Summary       In the first part of this article we have demonstrated that basic  marketing concepts and principles can account for many aspects of scientific  activity. Thus far our arguments that science is marketing have been informal.  We have shown that many aspects of science involve social exchanges, and in  particular, the exchange of ideas in the form of theories. Therefore, as the  discipline most concerned with exchange processes, marketing provides a  relevant perspective for understanding science. In addition, we have shown how  certain marketing concepts are or could be used by scientists to develop  effective marketing strategies that could influence other scientists to adopt  their theories.      In the remainder of the article we develop our claim that science  is marketing along more formal lines. We attempt to show how current views on  the nature of science also lead to the conclusion that much of the activity of  science involves marketing processes. The key theoretical ideas used in our  arguments constitute a set of metatheoretical assumptions about the nature of  scientific knowledge and how that knowledge is achieved. Many of these ideas  are radically different from those that underlie the philosophical perspective  currently prominent in marketing and other social sciences.             Metatheoretical Assumptions about Science       Scholars have proposed a variety of philosophical perspectives  regarding science (see Brown 1977, Suppe 1977). These points of view are  characterized by major as well as subtle differences and by a profusion of  terminology (logical positivism, logical empiricism, instrumentalism, realism,  falsificationism, relativism, etc.). We attempt to sidestep much of the  resulting controversy and semantic confusion in the remainder of this article.  First, we briefly describe the reigning philosophical approach in marketing  which we call the Positivistic/Empiricist (P/E) perspective (see Anderson 1983  for a more detailed review). Then, we contrast this view with a newer, more  useful philosophy of science, which we call the Relativistic/Constructionist  approach (R/C). Our intent is to introduce these ideas at a broad, general  level and avoid becoming mired in technical jargon and subtle details. Thus our  coverage of these issues is necessarily an overview.             The  Positivistic/Empiricist Approach       The philosophy of science that presently dominates marketing is a  descendent of logical positivism, commonly called logical empiricism (cf.  Brodbeck 1982, Hunt 1983). (Suppe (1977) and Brown (1977) provide thorough  historical analyses of how these positions have evolved.) The term  &quot;positivism&quot; usually refers to a type of strict empiricism in which  only those knowledge claims that are based directly on experience (i.e.,  empirical observations) are considered important, useful, and/or scientifically  meaningful. Coupled with this strong emphasis on empirical data, positivism  relies heavily on formal symbolic logic as a tool of analysis. Thus,  positivists claim that through formal logical analysis of theories and by means  of unbiased observations, the truth of any (meaningful) proposition can be  determined absolutely.      Logical empiricism is a somewhat more moderate version of  positivism developed to avoid the induction problem-namely that no universal  proposition can be conclusively verified by any set of observations, no matter  how large. Thus logical empiricism tends to favor a view that although  scientific propositions cannot be conclusively verified, they can be  &quot;increasingly confirmed,&quot; again using careful observations (e.g., in  experiments) and the rules of formal logic. In this view, for instance,  theoretical terms derive their meanings through &quot;correspondence rules&quot;  that &quot;connect&quot; them to direct experience (empirical observations).  These observations give meaning to the theoretical terms. The logical  empiricist point of view dominates current marketing research in that much of  our research methodology and approach are based on these philosophical  assumptions.      Popper (1959) proposed a &quot;falsification&quot; strategy to  avoid the inductive problems of the confirmation approach of logical  empiricism. However, as interpreted by many philosophers and marketing  scholars, falsification is merely a somewhat more sophisticated brand of  logical empiricism (cf. Calder, Phillips. and Tybout 1981, 1982; Lynch 1982).  (However, other, less well-recognized aspects of Popper's thinking are fairly  consistent with the perspective we are advocating (see Brown 1977, Chapter 5).)  This approach to science, termed &quot;naive falsificationism&quot; by Likatos  (1970), requires that a researcher consider a theory as false if a key  deductively derived hypothesis is rejected by empirical observations. (It  should be noted that Laudan (1965) clearly demonstrates the impossibility of  falsification.)      In sum, the P/E approach that currently underlies research in  marketing emphasizes (a) the development of axiomatic theory through the use of  deductively-derived hypotheses which are manipulated via formal rules of  symbolic logic, and especially (b) objective empirical observations that give  meaning to the theoretical propositions and are used to rigorously test them,  perhaps even falsify them. Thus, many people consider the P/E approach to be  rational (in the formal logical sense).             The  Relativistic/Constructionist Approach       In the P/E perspective of science, certain factors are excluded  from consideration, including the effects of (a) social interaction and  influence among scientists, (b) the idiosyncratic beliefs and values of  individual scientists, and (c) scientists' subjective interpretations of  observational data. These factors are not a part of the unbiased observations  and formal symbolic logic of the P/E approach; thus they are usually rejected  from consideration as irrelevant for an understanding of scientific progress.  However, in terms of the R/C perspective advocated below, these factors are of  critical importance in understanding how scientific knowledge develops. (We  cast the differences between these approaches in simple dichotomous terms in  order to distinguish them and make our points more clearly. However, a variety  of finer, mom subtle distinctions can be drawn. See Brown (1917) for a review  of the issues involved in this controversy.)      This article is not the place to present a complete discussion and  defense of the R/C approach to science. Others have done so effectively (see  Collins and Cox 1976, Feyerabend 1975, Knorr-Cetina 1981, Kunn 1970, Munvar  1981). Instead, in the rest of the article we identify and briefly discuss some  key distinctions between the P/E view of science and the R/C perspective. A  summary of these distinctions is provided in Table 1.                           TABLE 1    Major Differences between Positivistic/Empiricist and   Relativistic/Constructionist Views of Science                Positivistic/Empiricist   Science          Relativistic/Constructionist Science                Science discovers the true nature of reality.          Science creates many realities.                Only the logic of justification is needed to   understand science.          The processes by which theories are created,   justified, and diffused throughout a research community are needed to understand   science.                Science can be understood without considering   cultural, social, political, and economic factoras.          Science is a social process and cannot be   understood without considering cultural, social, political, and economic   factors.                Science is objective.          Science is subjective.                Scientific knowledge is absolute and cumulative.          Scientific knowledge is relative to a particular   context and period of time in history.                Science is capable of discovering universal laws   that govern the external world.          Science creates ideas that are context-dependent,   i.e., relative to a frame of reference.                Science produces theories that come closer and   closer to absolute truth.          Truth is a subjective evaluation that cannot be   properly inferred outside of the context provided by the theory.                Science is rational since it follows formal rules   of logic,          Science is rational to the degree that it seeks to   improve individual and societal well being by following whatever means are   useful for doing so.                There are specific rules for doing science validly   (e.g.. falsification),          There are many ways of doing science validly that   are appropriate in different situations.                Scientists subject their theories to potential   falsification through rigorous empirical testing.          Scientists seek supportive, confirmatory evidence   in order to market their theories.                Measurement procedures do not influence what is   measured.          Nothing can be measured without changing it.                Data provide objective, independent benchmarks for   testing theories,          Data are created and interpreted by scientists in   terms of a variety of theories, and thus are theory laden.                           Reality  Is Relative       A key difference between the two approaches to science concerns  the assumed nature of reality and how scientists relate to reality through  their theories and observational evidence (see Hooker 1975). Researchers with a  PIE orientation usually take a realist point of view. Although there are  various types of realism, most P/E researchers appear to believe that an  external world exists (usually one world in one way), and that it is possible  to come closer to knowing the true nature of that world through empirical observations  obtained through rigorous methods and analyses. Theories, then, are treated as  general statements about the real world. The goal is to develop theories that  come increasingly closer to being true statements about reality. Alternatively,  researchers with an R/C orientation conceive of many possible realities, each  of which is relative to a specific context or frame of reference. According to  this view, scientists construct &quot;realities&quot; by developing a degree of  social agreement about the meanings of their theories and empirical  observations (e.g., Collins 1975, Collins and Cox 1976, Elkana 1978, Feyerabend  1975, Gilbert 1976, Munvar 1981).             Science  Is a Social Process       Science is an activity performed by interacting human beings, and  thus obviously is a social process: We believe these social interaction  processes are very important for understanding science. In fact, the exchanges  that take place during these social processes constitute a major reason for our  contention that science is marketing.      Until recently, few philosophers of science have considered the  social interaction and social influence processes involved in scientific  progress. P/E philosophers tend to ignore such social factors or even claim  that such processes are unimportant (or &quot;irrational&quot;) and, thus, not  worthy of study. Instead they continue to be concerned with rather formal  logical models for the justification or testing of theories. That is, P/E  philosophers have focused on the formal presumptions about how theories are verified,  corroborated, or falsified, and converted to scientific knowledge.      In contrast, philosophers with an R/C orientation have been  willing to consider the (less formal) social processes in science. For example,  Kuhn (1970) noted the importance of social influence in evaluating alternative  theories: &quot;The superiority of one theory to another is something that  cannot be proved in debate. Instead, I have insisted, each party must try, by  persuasion, to convert the other&quot; (p. 198, emphasis added). Mitroff (1974),  in his analysis of the Apollo moon scientists, found that certain scientists  are so highly committed to their theories that they resist all persuasive  attempts to change their beliefs and continually try to convert other  scientists to their point of view. Recently, sociologists of science have been  actively investigating how social interaction processes affect the development  of social consensus regarding a scientific method, a theory, or even the  appropriate interpretation of empirical evidence (e.g., Collins 1981, Latour  1980, Pinch 1981). Developing a high degree of social consensus among  scientists is a major objective of marketing strategies for scientific  theories.             Science  Is Subjective       The presumed objectivity of science is a key characteristic of the  P/E approach that currently dominates marketing and related social science  disciplines. However, this aura of objectivity has been steadily eroding for  years across all sciences, including physics (see Zukav 1979). All pretensions  to objectivity (in this narrow sense) disappear on adopting an R/C perspective  on science.      P/E approaches tend to treat scientists' perceptions or sense  impressions naively as providing objective, unbiased representations of the  real world. Thus, empirical observations (manifestations of scientists' sense  impressions) are treated as objective data that are independent of any theory.  In contrast, the R/C perspective recognizes that even so-called direct  perceptions are not objective but are influenced by a multitude of factors,  including relevant past experiences and training. For this reason different  scientists may examine the same data and perceive entirely different meanings  (Stent 1975).      Here we consider the process by which scientific meaning is  developed. There are two aspects of this process, one psychological and the  other sociological. No less a scientist than Einstein (1936) has noted the  psychological aspects quite clearly:      Out of the multitude of our sense experiences we take, mentally  and arbitrarily, certain repeatedly occurring complexes of sense impressions .  . . and we attribute to them a meaning-the meaning of the bodily object.  Considered logically this concept is not identical to the totality of sense  impressions referred to; but it is an arbitrary creation of the human (or  animal) mind . . .. The second step . . . we attribute to this concept of the  bodily object a significance, which is to a high degree independent of the  sense impression that originally gives rise to it. This is what we mean when we  attribute to the bodily object 'a real existence' (p. 60, emphasis added).      The sociological aspect refers to the social interaction and  persuasion processes used to generate a degree of social consensus regarding  the scientific meaning of an observation or a theory. Marketing strategies are  used to influence both the psychological (individual level) and social (group  level) aspects of the meaning development process.      Our point here is that all meanings-including the specific,  technical meanings that constitute much of scientific knowledge-are  subjectively determined. Moreover, an R/C approach to science explicitly  recognizes that meaning is never absolute. Meaning is always meaning in  context, i.e., relative to some frame of reference (Mischler 1979). In science,  theories are an important source of context. If the context changes (perhaps  because the theory is changed during a paradigm shift), so does the meaning of  the relevant empirical observations. P/E approaches tend to deny this  subjective aspect of science by claiming that the rules and procedures for  doing science produce objective, absolute meanings. The R/C perspective  recognizes the inherent subjectivity in science and accounts for it in a  relativistic, context-dependent manner.             Science  Is Rational       Contrary to the protests in the P/E literature (e.g., Suppe 1977),  the preceding discussion does not lead to the conclusion that science is  irrational. Individual scientists can reasonably be assumed to attempt to  achieve their objectives in a rational way. That is, scientists borrow or  create those theories that they believe can accomplish their noble, curiosity,  or self-serving goals. Their beliefs may be found on the basis of what the  &quot;hot topic&quot; is in a discipline, whether a particular theory fits well  with their values and predilections, or how easily a theory can be marketed,  among other factors,      Rationality in science does not require the use of formal rules of  symbolic logic. Nor must the objectives and standards for judging progress be  absolute and fixed. In fact, it is quite clear from the history of science that  standards and objectives vary across time and across research communities.  Similarly, scientific rationality does not require that research be conducted  under the guidelines of a single scientific method such as falsification.  Feyerabend (1975) argues that many major discoveries in science could not have  occurred by following &quot;the&quot; scientific method and persuasively argues  against a single approach to science. In fact, Feyerabend recommends that  &quot;anything goes&quot;-i.e., any methodology or theory, no matter how  unconventional, can contribute to scientific progress. (The problem, of course,  comes in marketing unconventional methods and theories to an unappreciative  audience. Many researchers may be committed to a PIE perspective and major  journals may reject Unusual approaches to developing knowledge. Generating  acceptance of new methods that challenge engrained beliefs and established  research procedures is often difficult. In fact, this problem may generate the  need for new channels (journals or books) to provide outlets for such radical  work.)             Theories  Are Not Universal       A theory has meaning only within its own context, i.e., within its  own set of metatheoretical assumptions (Hooker 1975, Mischler 1979). As these  presuppositions change, so does the meaning of the theory. Moreover, a  completely valid, causal explanation of a phenomenon (i.e., a true theory)  cannot be produced since all rival alternative hypotheses can never be eliminated  (i.e., falsified). In fact, scientists are seldom aware of all the existing  hypotheses that could be used to explain a phenomenon, and, of course,  scientists cannot know of hypotheses and explanations yet to be invented.      Much of the logic underlying the extensive use of experimentation,  representative sampling, and inferential statistics in marketing research is  based on the P/E goal of developing universal theories and laws. However, even  statistical inferences drawn by scientists who believe in statistical theory  are relative to the assumed populations of people, stimuli, measures, etc.,  being sampled. It is also clear from the history of science that no universal  laws or theories have ever been advanced that meet strict P/E requirements (see  Feyerabend 1975, Munvar 1981). In marketing, even simple strategic planning  models have been shown to be restricted to particular situations (see Day 1977,  Wensley 1981). Thus, the P/E view of science that pursues objectives, such as  universal laws, seems misguided. In contrast, the R/C perspective explicitly  recognizes the &quot;boundedness&quot; of theories and the relativistic meaning  of observations, and seeks to specify the limits of their generalizability. In  sum, theories are limited to (relative to) specific times and particular  contexts.             Usefulness  of Theories       Theories can be evaluated in terms of their truth con-tent or  their usefulness. P/E approaches usually focus on truth content. However, no  defensible method for establishing the truth of a theory has ever been advanced  (Peter 1983). Therefore, from an R/C perspective, usefulness seems to be a more  appropriate criterion for evaluating a theory. Usefulness is a pragmatic  criterion concerned with the difference it makes to follow the theory's  recommendations. Here the emphasis is on the performance, or potential  performance of a theory (Munvar 1981). Usefulness can be judged in terms of  how effectively a theory enables the user to &quot;get along&quot; in the world  or accomplish some specific task. For example, if application of a marketing  theory leads to an increase in long run profits for a firm, then it may be  inferred that the theory was a good one; that is, it was useful in that  situation and context, given that objective. Note that the usefulness criterion  of the R/C approach provides no direct evidence of the truth content of the  theory; in fact, truth content is basically irrelevant from an R/C perspective  (Olson 1982).      Theories can be useful in a variety of ways. For example, theories  may include new concepts that offer more interesting or precise descriptions of  phenomena than previously popular constructs. Descriptions of certain consumer  behaviors in terms of &quot;attributions&quot; or &quot;semantic  processing&quot; seem so much more precise than &quot;attitudes&quot; or  &quot;perceptions.&quot; In fact, within the context of current cognitive  theory, these are more precise terms. Theories can also be useful in a  heuristic sense for generating other theories or ideas (Gergen 1978).  Ultimately, though, a pragmatic humanist criterion seems critical, i.e., what  does the theory do to increase societal welfare? Humanistic cr1-teria are much  more easily integrated into science from an R/C than from a P/E perspective.             Data  Never Speak for Themselves       Many P/E philosophers and scientists seem to believe that data are  independent of the theories they are used to test. That is, empirical  observations are assumed to provide an objective benchmark against which to  test and compare theories. Yet, philosophers of science have repeatedly shown  that there is no pure observational language, i.e., all data are theory-laden  (see Feyerabend 1975, Kuhn 1970, Lakatos 1978, Popper 1959, among others). This  point is made clearer if we remember that data (empirical observations) are  constructed just as theories are. Data do not exist in the &quot;real  world&quot; waiting to be gathered. Rather, data are created through the  measurement operations used by scientists to produce them. Clearly, the  scientist selects the theory, hypotheses, research setting, test stimuli,  subjects, measures, and statistics to be used. In fact, the scientist controls  the entire production of research data (Peter, in press).      The point is that scientists control the process of generating  research data, and almost always have biases about what they want to find and  how the data are interpreted. If &quot;negative results&quot; are found that  are unpublishable, a new study nearly always can be conducted to produce  &quot;appropriate&quot; results. Although such attempts will not always be  successful in the short run, we suspect that long-term perseverance often  yields the desired results, especially if combined with an effective marketing  strategy to generate at least a minimum level of consensus as to the value of  the work. However, if, after a number of trials, a researcher still cannot  generate empirical support for a theory, the researcher rather than the theory  may warrant condemnation. Alternatively, it may be that the methods required to  provide the desired empirical observations and results are not yet available.             Recommendations       Our R/C view of science as the marketing of ideas conflicts  sharply with what Mitroff (1972) calls the &quot;fairytale description of  science&quot; (i.e., the P/E view) frequently advocated and apparently believed  by many marketing scholars. We view the P/E accounts of objective theory  testing and the reliance on strict methodological rules such as falsification  as stifling creative science rather than facilitating it. The following  recommendations are offered in the hope that the outdated P/E approach to science  can be replaced by more creative, insightful, and useful styles of inquiry  consistent with the R/C perspective.             Scientific  Training       It is clear that far more effort is exerted in training scientists  in methods of testing hypotheses rather than encouraging them to create  important, provocative, meaningful, or useful theories. The typical doctoral  program in marketing contains many courses intended to prepare students to test  hypotheses, yet embarrassingly little attention is given to how to create hypotheses  and evaluate their merits. In fact, creativity may be stifled in the rush to  ensure that students have the requisite methodological and statistical skills  to produce the empirical demonstrations demanded by the P/E approach to  science. While it seems unlikely that creativity can be taught directly, more  hospitable environments could facilitate such learning. Various scholars,  including Davis (1971), McGuire (1973), Webb (1961) and Zaltman, LeMasters, and  Heffring (1982), have suggested a number of ideas for generating interesting,  insightful, useful research questions.      In essence, creative insights are a function of the amount,  quality, and content of what the individual scientist thinks and does. (For  example. see Gruber's' (1981) fascinating account of Charles Darwin's  creativity.) At present, the major efforts in marketing are devoted to  designing research to test ideas borrowed from other disciplines, rather than  creating and developing theoretical ideas about marketing phenomena and  problems (Sheth 1982). Clearly, &quot;replications&quot; in a marketing context  of research ideas gleaned from other fields has some value. However, it is  unlikely that marketing will advance very rapidly or very far as long as we  depend on other scientists, uninterested in our field, to carry the major  responsibility for creating and developing the theories we use. We need to  adapt and further develop the theories we borrow.      In addition, rather than starting research with a borrowed theory  or construct, it may be more useful to begin with a marketing phenomenon or  problem in which we are interested, and then attempt to develop our own  theories about it. While insights from other fields may aid in investigating  the phenomenon or problem, we should guard against letting them dominate any  ideas we have on our own. Further, we should not constrain our search for  additional insights to traditional areas of borrowing, such as economics,  social and cognitive psychology, and statistics. Many disciplines such as  history, anthropology, sociology, and clinical psychology have useful ideas to  offer.             Values  in Science       We must stop deluding ourselves and others that as empirical  scientists, we are impartial to the outcomes of our research, that our research  is objective, and that we are dealing with established facts rather than  inferences of varying quality. Clearly, scientists are advocates for their  theories, hypotheses, and data. Usually &quot;positive findings&quot; must be  produced to persuade others and to successfully market scientific work. To  argue that all &quot;scientific&quot; research should be designed to falsify  specific hypotheses is misleading and dysfunctional for our progress. Empirical  research is certainly valuable. However, data should not be viewed as providing  an objective test of a theory's truth value. Empirical evidence may be more  appropriately viewed as demonstrating the usefulness of a theoretical idea in a  particular context.             Scientific  Behavior       It should be clear that studying science as a social activity can  produce new knowledge, not only about science but also about the behavior of  scientists as well. For example, Mitroff's (1974) classic study of the Apollo  moon scientists, Knorr-Cetina's (1981) investigation of laboratory physicists,  Latour and Woolgar's (1979) description of biology scientists at the Salk  Institute, and Zukav's (1979) insights into the conduct of research on quantum  mechanics provide detailed descriptions of the social nature of science. These  analyses clearly show that scientists are social beings with social needs, not  automatons following a program of formal logical analysis. In addition,  investigations of collaborative research practices (Over 1982), secretiveness  and competitiveness for priority of discovery by researchers (Gaston 1971),  referencing behavior (Gilbert 1977), and outright fudging of research results,  such as the case of Cyril Burt and J. B. Watson (see Samelson 1980), provide  insights about scientific progress and the social behavior of the scientists  involved. Finally, studying the marketing plans of successful scientists could  improve our knowledge of the effectiveness of various marketing strategies and  tactics in producing scientific progress. (For example, see Feyerabend's (1975)  analysis of the strategies followed by Galileo in marketing his radical views  on astronomy.)             Context-Specific  Meaning       We need to investigate meaning in context rather than strive to  produce universal laws and theories. Mischler (1979) and Morgan and Smircich  (1980) suggested some procedures for such research. In fields such as sociology  and organizational behavior, considerable work is currently being done on the  development of new methods of context-specific inquiry (e.g., Knorr-Cetina and  Mulkay 1983, Morgan 1983). At a minimum, consideration of these works points to  the need to more fully observe and report research details in current  approaches to research and to critically evaluate current research methods that  were designed for seeking universal generalizations. In general, less emphasis  on following normative rules of research conduct garnered from P/E accounts of  science may aid in the development of better methods and theories.             Summary  and Conclusions       We have shown that many aspects of scientific activity are  consistent with basic marketing concepts and processes. We have implied that  astute scientists could make good use of basic marketing principles to develop  effective strategies for promoting their theories, In addition, we have shown  that the &quot;science is marketing&quot; perspective is more consistent with  the &quot;new&quot; R/C philosophy of science than with the outdated P/E  orientation that currently dominates marketing research. We have also argued  that adopting an R/C approach in marketing could produce more creative and  useful theories.      While we believe that marketing provides a useful perspective for  analyzing science, other views of science are useful as well. For example,  science can also be analyzed as art and theater (Feyerabend 1968), rhetoric  (Gusfield 1976), communication (Edge 1979), and cognitive psychology (Tweney,  Doherty, and Mynatt 1981). Moreover, aspects of science are similar to  mysticism (Capra 1975) as well as more formally organized religion (Feyerabend  1968). In some situations, even the positivistic/empiricist perspective may offer  useful ideas about science. Future research on science might identify and  create new perspectives, combine and compare alternative perspectives, and  specify the contexts and situations under which one perspective may be more  useful than another.      Finally, it is reasonable to ask what we have learned about the  question, &quot;Is marketing a science?&quot; While we recognize that no  defensible criterion for distinguishing science from nonscience has ever been  found (Laudan 1982), we believe that the main task of science is to create  useful knowledge. To the degree that marketing has done so, then it can be  labeled a science. As marketing scientists we should be concerned to make our  discipline more effective in creating useful knowledge about our subject  matter. We believe that such improvements are best achieved by adopting the  relativistic/constructionist approach to science advocated here. Recognizing  the social processes of science, the context specificity of scientific  knowledge, and other features of the R/C program can give marketing scholars  the freedom and confidence to create new conceptual schemes and perspectives.  This is in contrast to following the outdated rules of the P/E approach that  focus only on testing theories we already have. A creative science of marketing  is more likely to flourish by taking a relativistic/constructionist approach.

This course will serve as an introduction to the diverse perspectives that are taught in the NYU Postdoctoral Program by exposing students to the key ideas and concepts, the historical development, and the clinical approach of each of the major orientations or schools. Ethical considerations relevant to psychoanalytic practice will be emphasized. ( Ethics   component of the course )    Writing Psychoanalytically (PDPSA.4553)  Instructor: Steven Knoblauch    This course is designed to be taken concomitant with any other course in the Postdoctoral Program or as an independent study project. It serves as an opportunity to write about a particular topic or question either emerging within another course taken at the same time as this course, or as an independent writing project. It is unique to the program as it offers six classes in which candidates are able to compare and contrast their writing over time and with each other.    Psychoanalytic Supervision (PDPSA.4543)  Instructor: Helen Gediman        This course reviews the present state of psychoanalytic thinking on the supervisory process with major emphases on the supervisory process in a climate of theoretical diversity and heterogeneity and the supervisory process as a triadic system with multiple interactions as the focus. Readings and clinical presentations by students are utilized to illustrate the main issues being studied.            THE HISTORY &amp; DEVELOPMENT OF PSYCHOANALYSIS FOCUSING ON SPECIFIC CONTRIBUTORS: Selected Topics (PDPSA.4580)    As in the humanities, and unlike some sciences, psychoanalysis must be studied historically. Whatever one\u2019s current point of view, a well-educated analyst must have a solid understanding of Freud\u2019s contributions and texts as well as those of other significant contributors. Often the contributions of seminal psychoanalytic writers must also be studied in conjunction with their school of thought. This course teaches students the theory and practice of psychoanalysis through a study of notable individuals\u2019 contributions, developmentally and historically, as well as by studying the historical development of specific schools of thought. In various semesters or in different sections this course will focus on one contributor or tradition.

This course encourages students to present their own clinical work in detail over time working with feedback from other students and with the guidance of faculty. Depending on the semester or section the focus may be on treatment from a particular theoretical slant or on specific aspects of the treatment.    Clinical Seminar in Psychoanalytic Process  Instructor: Philip Bromberg    Clinical Case Seminar--Doing the Work: The Experience of Analyst and Patient  Instructor: Barbra Locker         Clinical Case Seminar  Instructor: Jessica Benjamin     The Analytic Relationship: Case Seminar and Clinical Theory  Instructor: Anthony Bass    The Therapeutic Object Relationship  Instructor: Mark Grunes                Countertransference: A Clinical Seminar  Instructor: Irwin Hirsch  Working at the \"Intimate Edge\"  Instructor: Darlene Ehrenberg  Countertransference in Working with Trauma  Instructor: Nina Thomas  Continuous Case Seminar: Problems in Early Integration and the Holding Environment  Instructor: Aaron Thaler  Clinical Case Seminar: How Different Theoretical Approaches Inform the Analyst's Direct Clinical Experience with Patients  Instructor: Warren Wilner The Art of Psychoanalysis: A Clinical Case Seminar on Working (and Playing) with the Unconscious  Instructor: Danielle Knafo Countertransference in Working with Trauma  Instructor: Nina Thomas  Clinical Case Seminar  Instructor: Muriel Dimen    CLINICAL TREATMENT OF SPECIFIC DISORDERS: Selected Topics (PDPSA.4582)         The psychotherapist and psychoanalyst must learn to tailor the treatment to the needs of the individual patient. One factor in individualizing treatment is to take into account diagnostic considerations and various dimensions of psychopathology. This course introduces students to current, sophisticated thinking about how psychoanalysis works with various styles of personality and forms of pathology. Each semester or section will focus on a different category or personality style taught from one or more theoretical perspectives.

This course introduces students to current theories of dreaming, empirical research on dreaming, and clinical work with dreams. Each semester or section will focus on a specific aspect of dreams, such as methodology for dream interpretation or comparative study of dream theories.           Clinical Seminar on Dreams  Instructor: Mark Blechner    Current Perspectives on Dreaming: Theory, Research and Practice  Instructor: James Fosshage   COMPARATIVE PSYCHOANALYSIS: Selected Topics (PDPSA.4584)    Contemporary psychoanalysis is diverse and pluralistic, some might even say fragmented into various schools and theories. This course examines psychoanalytic theories and clinical practices using a model of \u201ccomparative psychoanalysis.\u201d Theories and practices are examined historically, compared along the lines of theoretical and clinical issues, and compared for their implications in the treatment situation. Readings and course discussions add complexity and depth to the student\u2019s sense of the contributions and limitations of each model for clinical practice.

How do we understand the psychoanalytic method? What are the technical implications of diverse theories? What is the relationship between theory and technique and when can theory aid or interfere in treatment?

From this point of view, psychoanalysis itself can be critiqued as constructing and constraining such discourses. In addition, psychoanalysis is viewed as part of the larger mental health system, with all its social welfare and social control functions. But psychoanalysis can also function in service of social critique, as when it offers understandings of socio-economic-political structures that are concealed in the surface of ordinary discourses. These include the workings of power and privilege and how these are distributed along lines of race, social class, culture, gender, and sexual orientation. Each semester or section of this course will focus on various political, spiritual, and cultural issues.

Feminist critiques of those assumptions, both within the field and from psychoanalytic outsiders, have led to dramatic changes in psychoanalytic theory and practice. This course links the psychic and the social in the construction of gender and sexuality. Each semester or section will examine one aspect of this constellation in depth, focusing variously on gender, sexuality, feminism, and/or queer theory.

Classical theory began with a focus on the development of sexuality and the psychosexual stages, but soon analysts were studying the development of the sense of reality and a variety of developmental lines. This course examines various developmental perspectives in psychoanalysis, sometimes by observing young children and at other times retrospectively through the reconstruction of earlier life experience in adults. Some semesters and sections focus on infant research, some on later developmental phases, some on the clinical implications of developmental theory, and some on very specific developmental factors such as early loss or the family context.

Psychoanalytic theory has itself influenced infancy research and infancy research has influenced psychoanalysis. Second-by-second analysis of face-to-face interactions between parent and infant have led to monumental changes in how we understand bodily and affect regulation as well as the early origins of relatedness and patterns of communication that continue to operate through the lifetime. Each semester or section of this course will explore recent developments in infancy research focusing on methodological considerations, theoretical and/or clinical implications.

{"detail": [{"content": "Is Science Marketing                       Is Science Marketing?       J. Paul Peter &amp; Jerry C. Olson       (Published in the Journal of Marketing,  Fall 1983, pp. 111-125)             Abstract       Science is  analyzed as a special case of marketing-the marketing of ideas in the form of  substantive and methodological theories. The marketing mix, target markets, and  marketing objectives are developed for the scientific arena, and a formal  analysis of a relativistic/constructionist view of science is used to support  the approach. This view is contrasted with the positivistic/empiricist  perspective of science currently dominant in marketing and other social  sciences. Recommendations are offered for improved methods of developing  knowledge.                    For more than 30 years, marketing scholars have debated whether or  not marketing is a science (e.g., Alderson and Cox 1948, Bartels 1951, Baumol  1957, Buzzell 1963, Converse 1945, Hunt 1976, O'Shaughnessy and Ryan 1979,  Taylor 1965). The typical approach has been to offer a formal definition of  science or describe prototypic methods used in science and then compare  marketing's key features and/or its developmental progress against these  standards. Despite these fairly intense analyses, a consensus regarding the  scientific status of marketing has not yet been achieved. Some believe that marketing  is a science, while others believe that although scientific procedures are  employed in marketing, on the whole, marketing is an art. In contrast to these  two segments, many other marketing scholars seem to be withholding judgment,  perhaps awaiting more compelling arguments one way or the other.      Although well intentioned, we believe the debate regarding whether  or not marketing is a science has been largely unproductive. For the most part,  we attribute the current confusion to the somewhat naive conceptions of science  that have informed the controversy. In particular, we consider the typical  beliefs about how scientists do scientific work and how scientific progress is  achieved to be inconsistent with current views about such issues in the  disciplines of philosophy, sociology, and history of science. That is, in  asking, &quot;Is marketing a science?&quot; marketing scholars have been  comparing theory development and testing in marketing to inappropriate  standards that have little to do with the conduct of scientific inquiry in any  field.      This article presents a relatively new and more useful conception  of science than has been considered to date in the debates regarding  marketing's scientific status. To do so, we turn the tables in this  long-standing debate by asking the more fundamental and interesting question.  &quot;Is science marketing?&quot; In this article we consider whether science  can be effectively analyzed as a special case of marketing-the marketing of  ideas. (For this purpose, we adopt the currently popular definition of  marketing as &quot;human activity directed as satisfying needs and wants  through exchange processes&quot; (Kotler 1980). This is consistent with the  arguments of Bagozzi (1975) and Hunt (1983) that exchange is a key unifying  concept for the field. We suspect that most marketing scholars accept this  definition.)      The article has two major sections. In the first we analyze common  scientific practices in terms of conventional elements of marketing strategy.  Specifically, we consider the elements in the marketing mix, market targets,  and marketing objectives. Although we can consider only a few of the major  concepts in marketing, the examples in this brief analysis provide support for  our contention that science can be viewed as a special case of marketing. In  the second section, we discuss a relativistic/constructionist perspective  derived from recent work in science studies that provide a conceptual rationale  for analyzing science from a marketing perspective. We point out key  differences between this emerging approach to science and the traditional  positivistic/empiricist view that still pervades marketing (see Hunt 1983) and  other social sciences (see Koch 1981). Again, due to space restrictions, we  focus only on major points of departure from the traditional view and cite  major works to which readers can refer for additional information.             Marketing Scientific Theories       What makes a scientific theory successful? Simply stated, a  successful theory is one that is treated seriously and studied by a significant  portion of a research community. Practitioners may even employ such theories as  frameworks for analyzing important problems. In other words, a successful  theory is-one that has been adopted by a substantial market segment, just as is  the case of a successful consumer good. We argue that to successfully achieve  an adequate level of adoption, scientists must (at least implicitly) develop  and carry out a marketing strategy to promote their theories. In this section,  we consider some of the concepts and strategies involved in this process.  First, we describe scientific theories in terms of the four basic elements of  the marketing mix-product, channels of distribution, promotion, and price. Then  we discuss the idea of market segmentation for theories. Finally, we consider  the marketing objectives for scientific work.             Theories  as Products       In the broadest sense, the major products of science are ideas.  Scientific ideas consist of invented constructs and hypothesized relationships  among them. A system of such ideas about a phenomenon may be called a  substantive theory. Scientists also create ideas about methods of obtaining,  analyzing, and interpreting data. These are methodological theories of  measurement, sampling, and data analysis. Regardless of the type of idea or  theory, it should not be forgotten that the entire theory product is invented  or constructed by one or more scientists, just as ideas for consumer products  are invented or constructed. Like ideas for consumer products and the products  themselves, substantive and/or methodological theory products must also be  marketed. (Clearly, an understanding of the processes and/or accidents by which  new theories are created is critical for an understanding of science. While we  will not review the extant literature on the creation of scientific or other  products, i.e. &quot;marketing R&amp;D,&quot; interested readers should see  Zaltman, LeMasters, and Heffring (1982) and Stein (1974, 1975).)      At some point in the development of a theory the scientist usually  produces a manuscript that describes the idea. The manuscript may also present  empirical data that illustrate the idea and/or provide tentative support. A  manuscript is a tangible representation of the invented system of ideas.  Marketing a theory as a tangible manuscript is both easier and more effective  than promoting an intangible set of ideas, for at least four reasons. First,  potential adopters can easily store the theory product for use (study) at a  more convenient time. Second, because the manuscript is always available,  potential adopters can reexamine and reflect on the theory and possibly come to  appreciate its value. Third, the relative permanence of a manuscript allows  wider dissemination of the theory to a secondary, pass-along audience (e.g.,  students). Finally, a tangible manuscript may be used to establish the  scientist/marketer as the inventor of the theory or as the first to borrow the  theory from another area and apply it in a new field.      Over its life cycle a theory may undergo a number of modifications  in response to a variety of potential marketing problems. Customer complaints  regarding measurement difficulties or lack of conceptual clarity, and  competitive theory products marketed by other scientists, are among the many  problems a new theory may face in trying to capture a viable market share of  scientists. Perhaps the most serious problem occurs when a test of a theory  fails to predict adequately. This means that the theory is not meeting the  needs of the largest segment of researchers-those concerned with prediction and  methodological and empirical rigor. If the research community cannot be  convinced that the empirical test procedures were faulty, either the inventor  scientist or another scientist who has adopted the theory may change specific  characteristics of the theory product in response to such problems. However,  the modified theory is seldom renamed, as this might lose loyal customers. Many  of these modifications are made to seem minor and the change process may be  quite gradual, often so much so that the target market of scientists does not  always recognize the changes. However, it should be emphasized that any change  in a theory creates a modified product-i.e., a different theory. For instance,  researchers made a number of seemingly minor conceptual changes in the  Fishbein-type expectancy-value models during the period of major interest in  the marketing literature (1969-1975), yet only the most knowledgeable consumers  were aware that these changes created different theories (e.g., Cohen,  Fishbein, and Ahtola 1972).      Product Attributes. As with consumer products, several key attributes of a theory  have a large effect on marketing success. A major characteristic concerns the  topic, issue, problem, or phenomenon that is addressed. A theory may concern an  issue of major importance, a &quot;big&quot; problem, or a relatively  &quot;small&quot; issue of little theoretical or practical importance (Olson  1982). In some ways it may be easier to market the latter type of theory. For  instance, the most widely adopted theories tend to be those that are easiest to  understand and research empirically, especially in long periods of normal  science (Kuhn 1970). If research on a theory requires special equipment (e.g..  polygraphs for the study of brain waves) or special subject populations (e.g.,  managers or purchasing agents), that theory is not likely to be widely  researched. In contrast, theories that are easily researched with conventional  measurement procedures (e.g., self-report rating scales) and easily accessible  samples (e.g., students) are more likely to achieve higher adoption rates.      A second important attribute of a theory concerns the professional  credentials and status of the inventor or the borrower. Scientists who are well  known and respected, based on their previous contributions to a field, have  better chances of successfully introducing new theories than do less well-known  researchers. The credibility of the scientist/marketer may add a halo effect to  the theory product. Inventors or borrowers who do not enjoy a strong reputation  in their fields (e.g., doctoral students) may need to attract established  researchers (&quot;celebrity scholars&quot;) to help market their theories.      Third, theories that are borrowed and adapted from more  established, familiar fields seem to be more easily marketed than theories  gleaned from unconventional areas or that are constructed &quot;from  scratch.&quot; For example, it is probably easier to promote theories for use  in marketing that are borrowed from psychology and economics rather than from  areas such as anthropology, religion, or art.      Fourth, theories which contain familiar, common, everyday  concepts, words, meanings, and relationships (e.g., needs, attitudes,  personality) may be easier to market successfully than theories which require  learning new words, meanings, and relationships (e.g., shaping, aesthetic  response, semantic relatedness, coherence analysis, negative reinforcement).  Familiar concepts that are learned in childhood and are frequently used in  everyday language may be considered as highly important concepts to be  researched and understood. However, in other cases, new words and meanings can  be useful for marketing theories, since knowledge of them may give a scientist  admission to the cognoscenti of a research community.      Fifth, theories that are consistent with current political and  social values are easier to market (Barnes 1977, Gould 1982). For example, a  theory advocating gender differences in cognitive abilities is difficult to  market in the current environment, even with impressive empirical support (see  Stanley and Benbow 1982). In addition, since political and social values often  determine funding priorities, theories dealing with problems for which ample  research support is available are more easily marketed to potential scientist  adopters.      The sixth (and purposefully last) product attribute is the  preliminary empirical evidence that can be marshaled to support a theory.  Strong empirical support is a highly desirable attribute that will enhance the  marketability of a theory. However, strong empirical evidence is neither  necessary nor sufficient for the successful dissemination of a theory. A number  of theories have been fairly widely adopted, despite poor (or even no) initial  empirical support (e.g., early atomic theory or Freudian personality theory).  Of course scientists differ in the extent to which they are concerned about the  &quot;fit&quot; between data and theory; thus, the importance of empirical  support for a theory is likely to vary for different scientists (see Mitroff  and Kilmann 1978).      Test Marketing. Quite often, scientists test market their theories before  attempting a full-scale introduction via journal publication. Their major goal  is to gauge the reactions of potential adopters of the theory and to identify  and correct any glaring flaws before the theory is introduced on a major scale.  One way to do this is by circulating working papers among colleagues and  friends in the &quot;invisible college&quot; (see Crane 1972). In addition,  colloquia and seminars may be presented to colleagues and students and their  reactions sought. At least three results are possible. First, and least likely,  listeners may judge the theory product to be irretrievably flawed. This seldom  occurs, since the listeners at most test-market presentations are other  scientists who not only share the same worldview as the inventor, but also are  social friends who respect the inventor. Normally, such groups are reluctant to  totally reject the theory product. However, test market presentations to less  hospitable groups occasionally do produce such an extreme rejection. Second, in  equally rare cases, the product may be viewed as a major accomplishment with no  serious problems and judged to be ready for introduction.      Instead, the results of test marketing are likely to suggest a variety  of modifications to the theory. These may involve adding or deleting  constructs, clarifying and redefining constructs, or changing the theoretical  relationships between constructs. At a minimum, cosmetic changes may be made in  the theory's packaging (words and labels used) or suggestions may be made for  repositioning the product. As with traditional consumer products, the  scientist/marketer must consider whether changing the theory according to the  recommendations derived from test marketing will improve the chances of  successfully marketing the product.             Channels  of Distribution for Theories       There are many channels by which scientific theories may be  disseminated to potential adopters. The various channels of distribution have  different levels of effectiveness and may be differentially appropriate at  different stages in the development and testing of the theory. In the early  stages of development, most theories are disseminated via presentations at  colloquia and conferences, and through informally distributed working papers.  While conference and colloquia presentations are especially valuable in that  they provide direct feedback to the scientist/marketer, not many scholars are  likely to adopt a theory distributed in this way. For one thing, relatively few  scholars can be exposed to the theory through these inefficient channels.  Before widespread adoption can be anticipated, most theories must pass the  muster of the gatekeepers in the discipline (the reviewers and editors of  prestigious journals) and thereby achieve both legitimization and widespread  exposure. A theory that is evaluated poorly in test marketing may go no further  than being published in a conference proceedings, if at all. The theory may  languish there for several years before finally fading away or being  resurrected by another scientist who happens to stumble across it.  Occasionally, a theory is published first in a proceedings and later in a  journal, but this is generally considered bad form unless major changes have  occurred in the manuscript.      Some marketers begin the dissemination process by submitting the  manuscript directly to the key channel, a major journal. If the manuscript is  rejected from a number of major journals, the inventor/marketer may attempt to  disseminate the theory through other channels, perhaps less prestigious or  highly specialized journals. Using these channels to distribute a theory  reduces the probability that the theory will enjoy rapid acceptance, although  publication per se does enhance the chances for eventual success. Publication  in even an obscure or specialized journal may still reach the most interested  target market of researchers who may then be influential in further  disseminating the theory throughout the research community. Alternatively, if  the theory cannot be published in a major journal, some marketers may try to  publish the theory in book form or as a chapter in a book. However, this  channel is not readily or equally available to all scientists. Thus, the more  likely outcome is that the marketer will present the theory at one or more  conferences and publish a paper in a proceedings, if available. Of course, the  chances of successfully marketing the theory decrease with the use of more  restricted, less prestigious channels of distribution.             Promotion  of Theories       Throughout the life cycle of a theory, from creation to test  marketing to publication in a major journal to the widespread adoption and use  of a theory by the research community, promotion is a key factor in  successfully marketing a theory. As with consumer goods, a variety of  promotional techniques can be used. Interestingly, and contrary to popular  beliefs, theories that do not provide impressive empirical results, produce a  potential resolution to a major problem in the field (Kuhn 1970, Popper 1959),  or generate novel predictions (Lakatos 1978), can still be marketed  successfully.      Although strong empirical results are very useful in promoting a  theory, they are not absolutely necessary. For example, personality research in  marketing in the 1960s and early 1970s seldom surpassed the relatively trivial  hurdle of obtaining statistically significant correlations between measures of  personality and a variety of other factors (Kassarjian 1971). Yet personality  theory enjoyed wide popularity. Because the weak empirical results were usually  attributed to methodological problems, most researchers did not conclude that  the underlying theory was wrong. In fact, many marketing researchers still  believe in personality theory despite the generally disappointing empirical  results. Recently, new methods have produced more impressive empirical support  for personality theory (see Epstein 1979, 1980), although a resurgence of  interest has not yet occurred in marketing.      It is also possible to successfully market a theory that makes no  unusual or novel predictions and is in fact quite similar to other theories. Of  course, a scientist's promotion task will be easier if the theory product has  unique features (e.g., it generates novel predictions) or it has desirable  attributes of a compelling logic coupled with strongly supportive data.  However, as long as the new theory is relatively consistent with the worldview  of at least a segment of the field, it can be successfully promoted. A new  theory that is based on a different set of metatheoretical assumptions than  those held by most members of a research community can be difficult to  successfully promote and market. This is similar to situations in consumer  goods marketing in which discontinuous innovations that are inconsistent with  consumers' social values and behavior patterns are often hard to sell.  (Strictly speaking, no scientific theory is constructed of totally new concepts  created in isolation from earlier concepts and theories. Previous research and  theorizing certainly has an impact on the scientist/ inventor who is trying to  create a &quot;new&quot; theory. However, some new theories are seen as more  creative and less continuous with previous work than are others. We are merely  arguing that it is more difficult to market the more discontinuous theories.  This discussion should not be taken to imply that scientific work is cumulative  in the sense that a sequence of theories will ultimately lead to a valid  general theory.)      In addition to &quot;direct advertising&quot; via publication in  journals, books, and proceedings, a theory can also be promoted through  publicity and personal selling. Publicity for a theory includes notices of  forthcoming articles in journals, abstracts of published articles printed in  other journals, and notices of working papers in association newsletters.  Occasionally, a scientist/marketer can get other scientists to cite the new  theory, perhaps while still in working paper form. Scientists may be able to  generate discussion of their theory in nonscholarly publications such as  Marketing News or Psychology Today. Finally, if dissertation research testing  the theory wins awards or other recognition, the resulting publicity can be  very helpful in the overall marketing effort. Publicity may perform a useful informational  or reminder role, but is likely to be less persuasive than other forms of  promotion. However, a &quot;bandwagon effect&quot; for a theory might be  enhanced through this kind of promotion.      Personal selling is an important element of the promotional  strategy for theories. Personal selling occurs during formal or informal  presentations of the theory as well as in direct one-on-one discussions with  potential adopters. Moreover, salesmanship is an important aspect of dealing  with editors and reviewers in the revision process. Direct selling can be an  effective method of persuasion since the scientist/marketer can address  counter-arguments of the potential buyer head on and can offer ad hoc  hypotheses to cover many of the perceived weaknesses in the theory. Finally, a  personal selling strategy can be particularly effective with one's doctoral  students.             Price  of Theories       The scientist who adopts a new theory must pay a price that  involves time and money as well as psychological and behavioral costs. Part of  the price of adopting a new theory involves the time spent learning the new  theory and its methods, as well as the associated opportunity costs. The  adopter of a new theory may also incur financial costs in purchasing new  equipment (e.g., a physiology lab) or in education/training costs (e.g.,  attending seminars on causal modeling). Other costs include the psychological  effort and disruption involved in changing one's existing beliefs and  established research behaviors. A major component of the price of adopting a  new theory involves the behavioral effort of actively researching the theory,  writing about it, and performing the behaviors necessary to get the results  published in major journals.      Like consumer products, theories vary in price. Low-priced  theories are those that are consistent with the worldview and existing research  skills of the target market of scientists. Adopting such theories is relatively  inexpensive, as learning time is short and belief and behavior changes are  minimal. That is, the price is within easy reach of many potential consumers.  Thus, the scientist/marketer who prices his/her theory at the low end enhances  the chances that the theory will penetrate the mass market.      In contrast, theories that are radically different from the  established worldview of the research community and/or from the research  procedures common in a field carry a higher price tag. Adopting such theories  may require considerable learning time, extensive belief changes, and major  changes in research behavior. Therefore, such high priced theories need to be  marketed carefully and well. The marketing effort is facilitated if the  scientist can articulate the benefits to be provided by the new theory. Because  these benefits have to be perceived as substantial to justify the high price,  some scientists substantially oversell their substantive or methodological  theories in order to attract consumers (see Churchill and Perrault 1982). For  example, it appears that structural equations methodology has been  substantially oversold in the social sciences (see Cliff 1983, Fornell 1983).      A variety of situational factors can influence the success of a  high priced theory, primarily by making it seem worth the cost to early  adopters. First, it is helpful if the worldview incorporated in established  theories is recognized as problematic by a segment of the research community.  In fact, Kuhn (1970) argues that a scientific revolution cannot take place  unless the traditional view is recognized as failing and an alternative theory  is available. Second, the availability of research funds to investigate the new  theory is a powerful motivator for pursuing a new theory product. For example,  funding for research on the effects of advertising on children lowered the  price of entering this new area. Third, in some situations researchers may be  bored with the traditional approach and, therefore, are willing to incur the  cost of adopting more provocative theories. Similarly, some researchers may  simply feel they can make little marginal contribution to the traditional view  and are seeking to invest in new theories with greater payoff potential. In'  sum, there are particular situations when high priced theories are more likely  to be adopted by a research community. From a marketing strategy perspective,  these situations are strategic windows that the scientist/marketer can use to  advantage in introducing an expensive theory product.      A final consideration regarding the price of a theory concerns the  fact that not all researchers can afford to pay the price required for adoption  of a new theory. A prime determinant of what price an individual scientist can  afford to pay is his/her place in the tenure decision process. Younger  pre-tenure scholars may not feel they can afford a high priced theory. They may  need less expensive theories that have a fairly high probability of producing  rapid benefits, such as easily publishable journal articles. High priced  theories, by their very nature, tend to offer benefits with a longer time  horizon. Moreover, a fairly high degree of risk is associated with most high  priced theories, and many pre-tenure Scientists may not wish to incur such  risks. Therefore, more senior, post-tenure scholars may be more willing to  invest in higher priced theories. Occasionally, beginning scholars, such as  doctoral students, who have relatively little time and effort invested in  traditional theories and methods, may adopt higher priced theories, especially  if encouraged to do so by their post-tenure mentors. However, in these cases,  the theory is probably already in the growth stage of the product life cycle,  or at least appears to be a theory with a high probability of success, based on  its attributes.             Target  Markets for New Theories       A research community can be segmented in a number of ways. As just  discussed, scientists can be divided in terms of their position in the career  life cycle. Three distinct groups can be identified: doctoral students,  pie-tenure scholars, and post-tenure scholars. The latter group might be  further divided by rank into associate and full professors. Theory products  will differentially appeal to these groups and, as noted, these groups can  afford to pay different prices for theories and are willing to incur different  levels of risk. Of course, different marketing strategies may be required for  each of these segments.      A prime target market for a scientist's theory is his/her own  doctoral students, although the students of other scholars are of interest as  well. Usually these potential customers are seeking exactly what the marketer  has to offer a new theory or method in need of empirical research in a  discipline-related context. Ideally, the theory should be somewhat new in order  to establish that the dissertation is a &quot;contribution&quot; to the field.  As mentioned above, this target market may react less negatively if the theory  deviates substantially from the accepted view in the field, partly because its  members have not yet become fully committed to that perspective. Additionally,  doctoral students constitute an important target market because they (I) often  become apostles for the theory once they have invested the time to learn it and  begin to research it, (2) are entering the most active stage of their research  careers and may help market the theory through their writings, and (3) may be  more easily persuaded as they have little investment in competing theories.      The second important target market for a new theory is the group  of active research scholars in the field. This group can be further segmented  into pre- and post-tenure researchers, and each of these segments can be  further divided into adopter categories of opinion leaders, followers, and  laggards. Of these, the opinion leaders are critically important. A single  study on a new theory by an opinion leader may be sufficient to create  widespread interest. Opinion leader scientists are also likely to be mentors  for high quality doctoral students who can be encouraged to research the  theory. In addition, opinion leaders can often directly influence other active  researchers to consider studying and using the theory, thereby increasing its  adoption rate and eventual market share. Finally, studies by opinion leaders  are more likely to be featured in textbooks, which also helps to establish the  theory. (Once a theory has achieved &quot;textbook status,&quot; it tends to  become part of the discipline's body of &quot;knowledge.&quot; Regardless of  whether the measures are subsequently invalidated or empirical results ever  show impressive relationships, such theories are seldom purged entirely from  the literature. Over time the theory may lose followers and interest as new  theories are offered which are perceived to be better or deal with what seem to  be more important or interesting problems. Although some laggard researchers  will continue to investigate the old theory, only occasionally will this work  be published in a major outlet. When it is, it may still be employed in  textbooks for the purpose of giving a fresh reference to an old chapter and for  exemplifying the supposedly cumulative nature of scientific inquiry. In fact,  Kuhn (1970) argues that textbooks rewrite the history of theories in order to  make science appear to be cumulative.)      The scholars least likely to adopt a new theory are those who  remain loyal to a previous theory, particularly if it is their own or one in  which they have invested heavily. In fact, members of this group are more  likely to criticize the new theory and attempt to remove it from the market.  Such attempts may well take the form of &quot;replications&quot; which are intended  to discredit the new theory. Often these attempts are partly successful since  most theories have numerous problems in the early stage of development. For  example, because constructs used in the theory have surplus meaning, parts of  the theory can be interpreted in a manner that reveals inconsistencies and  ambiguities. It may be fairly easy to show that the theoretical concepts have  different meanings than intended by the inventor/marketer, thus adding to the  confusion regarding the theory. Second, since the skeptical researcher now  controls the method in a replication, he/she can usually generate results  inconsistent with the new theory. For example, the design could include too few  subjects to allow sufficient statistical power to detect the effect, or a  research setting involving many uncontrolled sources of variance could be used  to &quot;wash out&quot; an effect. In sum, an antagonistic scientist can often  demonstrate that a new theory's predictions are poorer than previously  reported, or even that &quot;disconfirming&quot; effects are obtained. Finally,  because all research requires a myriad of subjective decisions, the competitor  scientist can usually argue that at least some of the original methodological  decisions were inappropriate and thus produced data that were biased in favor  of the theory. In such controversies, comments, replies, and rejoinders can  continue back and forth to the limits of the tolerance of editors, reviewers,  and the research community.      The market for a new theory can also be segmented in terms of  psychological characteristics. Scientists have differing views about what  counts as important, interesting theory, and these values and beliefs influence  their evaluations of a new theory. Based on such attributes, Mitroff and  Kilmann (1978) have identified four types of scientists. Two of these are  particularly relevant for segmenting scientific markets. The analytical  scientist (AS) is mainly concerned with tightly controlled, highly rigorous  research designs intended to test well-specified hypotheses deduced from  theory. This group seems to be the largest segment in marketing and in most  other fields~ In contrast, the conceptual theorist (CT) is more concerned with  abstract ideas, how they fit logically together, and with their heuristic,  generative power for creating other ideas. This group is small in both  marketing and in most other disciplines. Obviously, the characteristics of a  new theory will strongly influence which of these groups will be more  attracted. The CT group may be more likely to adopt a new theoretical  perspective if it is quite different from existing perspectives and offers  promise for dealing with important, complex phenomena and problems. CT's tend  not to be concerned about a lack of empirical support, especially early in a  theory's development. On the other hand, an AS is not likely to adopt a new  theory until it has been developed to the stage where methods and measures can  be relatively unambiguously applied to test specific aspects of the theory.  Moreover, the preliminary data should look promising.             Marketing  Objectives       Although the marketer of a scientific theory probably has  objectives or goals in mind for that theory, and for his/her career as a  scientist, these goals are not often explicit. For purposes of discussion, we  have roughly categorized scientists' objectives into three groups: noble,  curiosity, and self-serving goals. Conceptually, these three classes are  mutually exclusive; however, more than one type of objective can be achieved  with the same marketing strategy.      Noble objectives are those most commonly associated with science.  Included are such lofty goals as seeking knowledge, attempting to understand a  phenomenon, and contributing to a discipline or to society as a whole. Normally  such goals are considered to be beyond reproach. Note, however, that to  accomplish these goals, a scientist must market his/her work to the scientific  community (or get someone else to do the marketing). A theory can make no  contribution if the work is kept hidden in a file drawer. Thus, scientists must  market their theories to achieve even noble goals.      Curiosity objectives refer to seeking answers to one's personal  questions about the subject of inquiry. Curiosity goals are closely related to  noble goals, and they differ primarily in the degree to which the work is  performed for self versus others. Doing research for the fun of it and the  sheer joy of learning new things are not unknown as motivators in science.  However, if the scientist needs no cooperation from others, contents him-/herself  with the findings, needs no cooperation from others, and shares them with no  one, marketing is not involved. Only when the theory and the findings are  exchanged with someone else does the marketing process for the theory become  relevant.      Self-serving objectives are well known within scientific  communities but are not widely recognized among the general public, nor do  professional philosophers of science usually consider them. Self-serving goals  lead researchers to perform scientific work primarily for the purpose of  personal gain. The rewards for being a successful scientist can be substantial:  promotions, job security, money (in the form of salary, grants, and consulting  fees), release time from other duties, prestige and recognition in the field,  and specific awards and honors. While these gains are usually intended for  scientists who pursue noble goals, they often are awarded to those who seek  mainly self-serving goals. Occasionally, the research community may deny at  least some of the sought rewards to scientists who pursue only self-serving  goals, especially in a blatant manner. The research community may infer that a  particular researcher is seeking only self-serving goals based on the  researcher's verbal reports of objectives, and from practices such as producing  a large number of marginal theory/research papers, or relabeling and publishing  the same paper in multiple channels.      Clearly, different goals may lead researchers to adopt different  marketing strategies. For instance, some scientists who pursue noble goals may  naively believe that overt marketing effort is unnecessary and even demeaning,  since an obviously superior theory will &quot;sell itself.&quot; Of course,  sophisticated marketers can easily recognize this perspective as a sign of a  strong product orientation and not a particularly viable strategy for long-term  success. It is also clear that different goals may lead to the same strategy,  i.e., development and marketing of a high quality theory product with a high  quality marketing plan. Moreover, scientists may have multiple goals that are  consistent. Perhaps it would be worthwhile to study scientists' goals, their  hierarchical relationships, and their impact on scientific progress. However,  the main point here is that accomplishing scientific objectives depends on the  quality of the marketing strategy and the effort exerted.             Summary       In the first part of this article we have demonstrated that basic  marketing concepts and principles can account for many aspects of scientific  activity. Thus far our arguments that science is marketing have been informal.  We have shown that many aspects of science involve social exchanges, and in  particular, the exchange of ideas in the form of theories. Therefore, as the  discipline most concerned with exchange processes, marketing provides a  relevant perspective for understanding science. In addition, we have shown how  certain marketing concepts are or could be used by scientists to develop  effective marketing strategies that could influence other scientists to adopt  their theories.      In the remainder of the article we develop our claim that science  is marketing along more formal lines. We attempt to show how current views on  the nature of science also lead to the conclusion that much of the activity of  science involves marketing processes. The key theoretical ideas used in our  arguments constitute a set of metatheoretical assumptions about the nature of  scientific knowledge and how that knowledge is achieved. Many of these ideas  are radically different from those that underlie the philosophical perspective  currently prominent in marketing and other social sciences.             Metatheoretical Assumptions about Science       Scholars have proposed a variety of philosophical perspectives  regarding science (see Brown 1977, Suppe 1977). These points of view are  characterized by major as well as subtle differences and by a profusion of  terminology (logical positivism, logical empiricism, instrumentalism, realism,  falsificationism, relativism, etc.). We attempt to sidestep much of the  resulting controversy and semantic confusion in the remainder of this article.  First, we briefly describe the reigning philosophical approach in marketing  which we call the Positivistic/Empiricist (P/E) perspective (see Anderson 1983  for a more detailed review). Then, we contrast this view with a newer, more  useful philosophy of science, which we call the Relativistic/Constructionist  approach (R/C). Our intent is to introduce these ideas at a broad, general  level and avoid becoming mired in technical jargon and subtle details. Thus our  coverage of these issues is necessarily an overview.             The  Positivistic/Empiricist Approach       The philosophy of science that presently dominates marketing is a  descendent of logical positivism, commonly called logical empiricism (cf.  Brodbeck 1982, Hunt 1983). (Suppe (1977) and Brown (1977) provide thorough  historical analyses of how these positions have evolved.) The term  &quot;positivism&quot; usually refers to a type of strict empiricism in which  only those knowledge claims that are based directly on experience (i.e.,  empirical observations) are considered important, useful, and/or scientifically  meaningful. Coupled with this strong emphasis on empirical data, positivism  relies heavily on formal symbolic logic as a tool of analysis. Thus,  positivists claim that through formal logical analysis of theories and by means  of unbiased observations, the truth of any (meaningful) proposition can be  determined absolutely.      Logical empiricism is a somewhat more moderate version of  positivism developed to avoid the induction problem-namely that no universal  proposition can be conclusively verified by any set of observations, no matter  how large. Thus logical empiricism tends to favor a view that although  scientific propositions cannot be conclusively verified, they can be  &quot;increasingly confirmed,&quot; again using careful observations (e.g., in  experiments) and the rules of formal logic. In this view, for instance,  theoretical terms derive their meanings through &quot;correspondence rules&quot;  that &quot;connect&quot; them to direct experience (empirical observations).  These observations give meaning to the theoretical terms. The logical  empiricist point of view dominates current marketing research in that much of  our research methodology and approach are based on these philosophical  assumptions.      Popper (1959) proposed a &quot;falsification&quot; strategy to  avoid the inductive problems of the confirmation approach of logical  empiricism. However, as interpreted by many philosophers and marketing  scholars, falsification is merely a somewhat more sophisticated brand of  logical empiricism (cf. Calder, Phillips. and Tybout 1981, 1982; Lynch 1982).  (However, other, less well-recognized aspects of Popper's thinking are fairly  consistent with the perspective we are advocating (see Brown 1977, Chapter 5).)  This approach to science, termed &quot;naive falsificationism&quot; by Likatos  (1970), requires that a researcher consider a theory as false if a key  deductively derived hypothesis is rejected by empirical observations. (It  should be noted that Laudan (1965) clearly demonstrates the impossibility of  falsification.)      In sum, the P/E approach that currently underlies research in  marketing emphasizes (a) the development of axiomatic theory through the use of  deductively-derived hypotheses which are manipulated via formal rules of  symbolic logic, and especially (b) objective empirical observations that give  meaning to the theoretical propositions and are used to rigorously test them,  perhaps even falsify them. Thus, many people consider the P/E approach to be  rational (in the formal logical sense).             The  Relativistic/Constructionist Approach       In the P/E perspective of science, certain factors are excluded  from consideration, including the effects of (a) social interaction and  influence among scientists, (b) the idiosyncratic beliefs and values of  individual scientists, and (c) scientists' subjective interpretations of  observational data. These factors are not a part of the unbiased observations  and formal symbolic logic of the P/E approach; thus they are usually rejected  from consideration as irrelevant for an understanding of scientific progress.  However, in terms of the R/C perspective advocated below, these factors are of  critical importance in understanding how scientific knowledge develops. (We  cast the differences between these approaches in simple dichotomous terms in  order to distinguish them and make our points more clearly. However, a variety  of finer, mom subtle distinctions can be drawn. See Brown (1917) for a review  of the issues involved in this controversy.)      This article is not the place to present a complete discussion and  defense of the R/C approach to science. Others have done so effectively (see  Collins and Cox 1976, Feyerabend 1975, Knorr-Cetina 1981, Kunn 1970, Munvar  1981). Instead, in the rest of the article we identify and briefly discuss some  key distinctions between the P/E view of science and the R/C perspective. A  summary of these distinctions is provided in Table 1.                           TABLE 1    Major Differences between Positivistic/Empiricist and   Relativistic/Constructionist Views of Science                Positivistic/Empiricist   Science          Relativistic/Constructionist Science                Science discovers the true nature of reality.          Science creates many realities.                Only the logic of justification is needed to   understand science.          The processes by which theories are created,   justified, and diffused throughout a research community are needed to understand   science.                Science can be understood without considering   cultural, social, political, and economic factoras.          Science is a social process and cannot be   understood without considering cultural, social, political, and economic   factors.                Science is objective.          Science is subjective.                Scientific knowledge is absolute and cumulative.          Scientific knowledge is relative to a particular   context and period of time in history.                Science is capable of discovering universal laws   that govern the external world.          Science creates ideas that are context-dependent,   i.e., relative to a frame of reference.                Science produces theories that come closer and   closer to absolute truth.          Truth is a subjective evaluation that cannot be   properly inferred outside of the context provided by the theory.                Science is rational since it follows formal rules   of logic,          Science is rational to the degree that it seeks to   improve individual and societal well being by following whatever means are   useful for doing so.                There are specific rules for doing science validly   (e.g.. falsification),          There are many ways of doing science validly that   are appropriate in different situations.                Scientists subject their theories to potential   falsification through rigorous empirical testing.          Scientists seek supportive, confirmatory evidence   in order to market their theories.                Measurement procedures do not influence what is   measured.          Nothing can be measured without changing it.                Data provide objective, independent benchmarks for   testing theories,          Data are created and interpreted by scientists in   terms of a variety of theories, and thus are theory laden.                           Reality  Is Relative       A key difference between the two approaches to science concerns  the assumed nature of reality and how scientists relate to reality through  their theories and observational evidence (see Hooker 1975). Researchers with a  PIE orientation usually take a realist point of view. Although there are  various types of realism, most P/E researchers appear to believe that an  external world exists (usually one world in one way), and that it is possible  to come closer to knowing the true nature of that world through empirical observations  obtained through rigorous methods and analyses. Theories, then, are treated as  general statements about the real world. The goal is to develop theories that  come increasingly closer to being true statements about reality. Alternatively,  researchers with an R/C orientation conceive of many possible realities, each  of which is relative to a specific context or frame of reference. According to  this view, scientists construct &quot;realities&quot; by developing a degree of  social agreement about the meanings of their theories and empirical  observations (e.g., Collins 1975, Collins and Cox 1976, Elkana 1978, Feyerabend  1975, Gilbert 1976, Munvar 1981).             Science  Is a Social Process       Science is an activity performed by interacting human beings, and  thus obviously is a social process: We believe these social interaction  processes are very important for understanding science. In fact, the exchanges  that take place during these social processes constitute a major reason for our  contention that science is marketing.      Until recently, few philosophers of science have considered the  social interaction and social influence processes involved in scientific  progress. P/E philosophers tend to ignore such social factors or even claim  that such processes are unimportant (or &quot;irrational&quot;) and, thus, not  worthy of study. Instead they continue to be concerned with rather formal  logical models for the justification or testing of theories. That is, P/E  philosophers have focused on the formal presumptions about how theories are verified,  corroborated, or falsified, and converted to scientific knowledge.      In contrast, philosophers with an R/C orientation have been  willing to consider the (less formal) social processes in science. For example,  Kuhn (1970) noted the importance of social influence in evaluating alternative  theories: &quot;The superiority of one theory to another is something that  cannot be proved in debate. Instead, I have insisted, each party must try, by  persuasion, to convert the other&quot; (p. 198, emphasis added). Mitroff (1974),  in his analysis of the Apollo moon scientists, found that certain scientists  are so highly committed to their theories that they resist all persuasive  attempts to change their beliefs and continually try to convert other  scientists to their point of view. Recently, sociologists of science have been  actively investigating how social interaction processes affect the development  of social consensus regarding a scientific method, a theory, or even the  appropriate interpretation of empirical evidence (e.g., Collins 1981, Latour  1980, Pinch 1981). Developing a high degree of social consensus among  scientists is a major objective of marketing strategies for scientific  theories.             Science  Is Subjective       The presumed objectivity of science is a key characteristic of the  P/E approach that currently dominates marketing and related social science  disciplines. However, this aura of objectivity has been steadily eroding for  years across all sciences, including physics (see Zukav 1979). All pretensions  to objectivity (in this narrow sense) disappear on adopting an R/C perspective  on science.      P/E approaches tend to treat scientists' perceptions or sense  impressions naively as providing objective, unbiased representations of the  real world. Thus, empirical observations (manifestations of scientists' sense  impressions) are treated as objective data that are independent of any theory.  In contrast, the R/C perspective recognizes that even so-called direct  perceptions are not objective but are influenced by a multitude of factors,  including relevant past experiences and training. For this reason different  scientists may examine the same data and perceive entirely different meanings  (Stent 1975).      Here we consider the process by which scientific meaning is  developed. There are two aspects of this process, one psychological and the  other sociological. No less a scientist than Einstein (1936) has noted the  psychological aspects quite clearly:      Out of the multitude of our sense experiences we take, mentally  and arbitrarily, certain repeatedly occurring complexes of sense impressions .  . . and we attribute to them a meaning-the meaning of the bodily object.  Considered logically this concept is not identical to the totality of sense  impressions referred to; but it is an arbitrary creation of the human (or  animal) mind . . .. The second step . . . we attribute to this concept of the  bodily object a significance, which is to a high degree independent of the  sense impression that originally gives rise to it. This is what we mean when we  attribute to the bodily object 'a real existence' (p. 60, emphasis added).      The sociological aspect refers to the social interaction and  persuasion processes used to generate a degree of social consensus regarding  the scientific meaning of an observation or a theory. Marketing strategies are  used to influence both the psychological (individual level) and social (group  level) aspects of the meaning development process.      Our point here is that all meanings-including the specific,  technical meanings that constitute much of scientific knowledge-are  subjectively determined. Moreover, an R/C approach to science explicitly  recognizes that meaning is never absolute. Meaning is always meaning in  context, i.e., relative to some frame of reference (Mischler 1979). In science,  theories are an important source of context. If the context changes (perhaps  because the theory is changed during a paradigm shift), so does the meaning of  the relevant empirical observations. P/E approaches tend to deny this  subjective aspect of science by claiming that the rules and procedures for  doing science produce objective, absolute meanings. The R/C perspective  recognizes the inherent subjectivity in science and accounts for it in a  relativistic, context-dependent manner.             Science  Is Rational       Contrary to the protests in the P/E literature (e.g., Suppe 1977),  the preceding discussion does not lead to the conclusion that science is  irrational. Individual scientists can reasonably be assumed to attempt to  achieve their objectives in a rational way. That is, scientists borrow or  create those theories that they believe can accomplish their noble, curiosity,  or self-serving goals. Their beliefs may be found on the basis of what the  &quot;hot topic&quot; is in a discipline, whether a particular theory fits well  with their values and predilections, or how easily a theory can be marketed,  among other factors,      Rationality in science does not require the use of formal rules of  symbolic logic. Nor must the objectives and standards for judging progress be  absolute and fixed. In fact, it is quite clear from the history of science that  standards and objectives vary across time and across research communities.  Similarly, scientific rationality does not require that research be conducted  under the guidelines of a single scientific method such as falsification.  Feyerabend (1975) argues that many major discoveries in science could not have  occurred by following &quot;the&quot; scientific method and persuasively argues  against a single approach to science. In fact, Feyerabend recommends that  &quot;anything goes&quot;-i.e., any methodology or theory, no matter how  unconventional, can contribute to scientific progress. (The problem, of course,  comes in marketing unconventional methods and theories to an unappreciative  audience. Many researchers may be committed to a PIE perspective and major  journals may reject Unusual approaches to developing knowledge. Generating  acceptance of new methods that challenge engrained beliefs and established  research procedures is often difficult. In fact, this problem may generate the  need for new channels (journals or books) to provide outlets for such radical  work.)             Theories  Are Not Universal       A theory has meaning only within its own context, i.e., within its  own set of metatheoretical assumptions (Hooker 1975, Mischler 1979). As these  presuppositions change, so does the meaning of the theory. Moreover, a  completely valid, causal explanation of a phenomenon (i.e., a true theory)  cannot be produced since all rival alternative hypotheses can never be eliminated  (i.e., falsified). In fact, scientists are seldom aware of all the existing  hypotheses that could be used to explain a phenomenon, and, of course,  scientists cannot know of hypotheses and explanations yet to be invented.      Much of the logic underlying the extensive use of experimentation,  representative sampling, and inferential statistics in marketing research is  based on the P/E goal of developing universal theories and laws. However, even  statistical inferences drawn by scientists who believe in statistical theory  are relative to the assumed populations of people, stimuli, measures, etc.,  being sampled. It is also clear from the history of science that no universal  laws or theories have ever been advanced that meet strict P/E requirements (see  Feyerabend 1975, Munvar 1981). In marketing, even simple strategic planning  models have been shown to be restricted to particular situations (see Day 1977,  Wensley 1981). Thus, the P/E view of science that pursues objectives, such as  universal laws, seems misguided. In contrast, the R/C perspective explicitly  recognizes the &quot;boundedness&quot; of theories and the relativistic meaning  of observations, and seeks to specify the limits of their generalizability. In  sum, theories are limited to (relative to) specific times and particular  contexts.             Usefulness  of Theories       Theories can be evaluated in terms of their truth con-tent or  their usefulness. P/E approaches usually focus on truth content. However, no  defensible method for establishing the truth of a theory has ever been advanced  (Peter 1983). Therefore, from an R/C perspective, usefulness seems to be a more  appropriate criterion for evaluating a theory. Usefulness is a pragmatic  criterion concerned with the difference it makes to follow the theory's  recommendations. Here the emphasis is on the performance, or potential  performance of a theory (Munvar 1981). Usefulness can be judged in terms of  how effectively a theory enables the user to &quot;get along&quot; in the world  or accomplish some specific task. For example, if application of a marketing  theory leads to an increase in long run profits for a firm, then it may be  inferred that the theory was a good one; that is, it was useful in that  situation and context, given that objective. Note that the usefulness criterion  of the R/C approach provides no direct evidence of the truth content of the  theory; in fact, truth content is basically irrelevant from an R/C perspective  (Olson 1982).      Theories can be useful in a variety of ways. For example, theories  may include new concepts that offer more interesting or precise descriptions of  phenomena than previously popular constructs. Descriptions of certain consumer  behaviors in terms of &quot;attributions&quot; or &quot;semantic  processing&quot; seem so much more precise than &quot;attitudes&quot; or  &quot;perceptions.&quot; In fact, within the context of current cognitive  theory, these are more precise terms. Theories can also be useful in a  heuristic sense for generating other theories or ideas (Gergen 1978).  Ultimately, though, a pragmatic humanist criterion seems critical, i.e., what  does the theory do to increase societal welfare? Humanistic cr1-teria are much  more easily integrated into science from an R/C than from a P/E perspective.             Data  Never Speak for Themselves       Many P/E philosophers and scientists seem to believe that data are  independent of the theories they are used to test. That is, empirical  observations are assumed to provide an objective benchmark against which to  test and compare theories. Yet, philosophers of science have repeatedly shown  that there is no pure observational language, i.e., all data are theory-laden  (see Feyerabend 1975, Kuhn 1970, Lakatos 1978, Popper 1959, among others). This  point is made clearer if we remember that data (empirical observations) are  constructed just as theories are. Data do not exist in the &quot;real  world&quot; waiting to be gathered. Rather, data are created through the  measurement operations used by scientists to produce them. Clearly, the  scientist selects the theory, hypotheses, research setting, test stimuli,  subjects, measures, and statistics to be used. In fact, the scientist controls  the entire production of research data (Peter, in press).      The point is that scientists control the process of generating  research data, and almost always have biases about what they want to find and  how the data are interpreted. If &quot;negative results&quot; are found that  are unpublishable, a new study nearly always can be conducted to produce  &quot;appropriate&quot; results. Although such attempts will not always be  successful in the short run, we suspect that long-term perseverance often  yields the desired results, especially if combined with an effective marketing  strategy to generate at least a minimum level of consensus as to the value of  the work. However, if, after a number of trials, a researcher still cannot  generate empirical support for a theory, the researcher rather than the theory  may warrant condemnation. Alternatively, it may be that the methods required to  provide the desired empirical observations and results are not yet available.             Recommendations       Our R/C view of science as the marketing of ideas conflicts  sharply with what Mitroff (1972) calls the &quot;fairytale description of  science&quot; (i.e., the P/E view) frequently advocated and apparently believed  by many marketing scholars. We view the P/E accounts of objective theory  testing and the reliance on strict methodological rules such as falsification  as stifling creative science rather than facilitating it. The following  recommendations are offered in the hope that the outdated P/E approach to science  can be replaced by more creative, insightful, and useful styles of inquiry  consistent with the R/C perspective.             Scientific  Training       It is clear that far more effort is exerted in training scientists  in methods of testing hypotheses rather than encouraging them to create  important, provocative, meaningful, or useful theories. The typical doctoral  program in marketing contains many courses intended to prepare students to test  hypotheses, yet embarrassingly little attention is given to how to create hypotheses  and evaluate their merits. In fact, creativity may be stifled in the rush to  ensure that students have the requisite methodological and statistical skills  to produce the empirical demonstrations demanded by the P/E approach to  science. While it seems unlikely that creativity can be taught directly, more  hospitable environments could facilitate such learning. Various scholars,  including Davis (1971), McGuire (1973), Webb (1961) and Zaltman, LeMasters, and  Heffring (1982), have suggested a number of ideas for generating interesting,  insightful, useful research questions.      In essence, creative insights are a function of the amount,  quality, and content of what the individual scientist thinks and does. (For  example. see Gruber's' (1981) fascinating account of Charles Darwin's  creativity.) At present, the major efforts in marketing are devoted to  designing research to test ideas borrowed from other disciplines, rather than  creating and developing theoretical ideas about marketing phenomena and  problems (Sheth 1982). Clearly, &quot;replications&quot; in a marketing context  of research ideas gleaned from other fields has some value. However, it is  unlikely that marketing will advance very rapidly or very far as long as we  depend on other scientists, uninterested in our field, to carry the major  responsibility for creating and developing the theories we use. We need to  adapt and further develop the theories we borrow.      In addition, rather than starting research with a borrowed theory  or construct, it may be more useful to begin with a marketing phenomenon or  problem in which we are interested, and then attempt to develop our own  theories about it. While insights from other fields may aid in investigating  the phenomenon or problem, we should guard against letting them dominate any  ideas we have on our own. Further, we should not constrain our search for  additional insights to traditional areas of borrowing, such as economics,  social and cognitive psychology, and statistics. Many disciplines such as  history, anthropology, sociology, and clinical psychology have useful ideas to  offer.             Values  in Science       We must stop deluding ourselves and others that as empirical  scientists, we are impartial to the outcomes of our research, that our research  is objective, and that we are dealing with established facts rather than  inferences of varying quality. Clearly, scientists are advocates for their  theories, hypotheses, and data. Usually &quot;positive findings&quot; must be  produced to persuade others and to successfully market scientific work. To  argue that all &quot;scientific&quot; research should be designed to falsify  specific hypotheses is misleading and dysfunctional for our progress. Empirical  research is certainly valuable. However, data should not be viewed as providing  an objective test of a theory's truth value. Empirical evidence may be more  appropriately viewed as demonstrating the usefulness of a theoretical idea in a  particular context.             Scientific  Behavior       It should be clear that studying science as a social activity can  produce new knowledge, not only about science but also about the behavior of  scientists as well. For example, Mitroff's (1974) classic study of the Apollo  moon scientists, Knorr-Cetina's (1981) investigation of laboratory physicists,  Latour and Woolgar's (1979) description of biology scientists at the Salk  Institute, and Zukav's (1979) insights into the conduct of research on quantum  mechanics provide detailed descriptions of the social nature of science. These  analyses clearly show that scientists are social beings with social needs, not  automatons following a program of formal logical analysis. In addition,  investigations of collaborative research practices (Over 1982), secretiveness  and competitiveness for priority of discovery by researchers (Gaston 1971),  referencing behavior (Gilbert 1977), and outright fudging of research results,  such as the case of Cyril Burt and J. B. Watson (see Samelson 1980), provide  insights about scientific progress and the social behavior of the scientists  involved. Finally, studying the marketing plans of successful scientists could  improve our knowledge of the effectiveness of various marketing strategies and  tactics in producing scientific progress. (For example, see Feyerabend's (1975)  analysis of the strategies followed by Galileo in marketing his radical views  on astronomy.)             Context-Specific  Meaning       We need to investigate meaning in context rather than strive to  produce universal laws and theories. Mischler (1979) and Morgan and Smircich  (1980) suggested some procedures for such research. In fields such as sociology  and organizational behavior, considerable work is currently being done on the  development of new methods of context-specific inquiry (e.g., Knorr-Cetina and  Mulkay 1983, Morgan 1983). At a minimum, consideration of these works points to  the need to more fully observe and report research details in current  approaches to research and to critically evaluate current research methods that  were designed for seeking universal generalizations. In general, less emphasis  on following normative rules of research conduct garnered from P/E accounts of  science may aid in the development of better methods and theories.             Summary  and Conclusions       We have shown that many aspects of scientific activity are  consistent with basic marketing concepts and processes. We have implied that  astute scientists could make good use of basic marketing principles to develop  effective strategies for promoting their theories, In addition, we have shown  that the &quot;science is marketing&quot; perspective is more consistent with  the &quot;new&quot; R/C philosophy of science than with the outdated P/E  orientation that currently dominates marketing research. We have also argued  that adopting an R/C approach in marketing could produce more creative and  useful theories.      While we believe that marketing provides a useful perspective for  analyzing science, other views of science are useful as well. For example,  science can also be analyzed as art and theater (Feyerabend 1968), rhetoric  (Gusfield 1976), communication (Edge 1979), and cognitive psychology (Tweney,  Doherty, and Mynatt 1981). Moreover, aspects of science are similar to  mysticism (Capra 1975) as well as more formally organized religion (Feyerabend  1968). In some situations, even the positivistic/empiricist perspective may offer  useful ideas about science. Future research on science might identify and  create new perspectives, combine and compare alternative perspectives, and  specify the contexts and situations under which one perspective may be more  useful than another.      Finally, it is reasonable to ask what we have learned about the  question, &quot;Is marketing a science?&quot; While we recognize that no  defensible criterion for distinguishing science from nonscience has ever been  found (Laudan 1982), we believe that the main task of science is to create  useful knowledge. To the degree that marketing has done so, then it can be  labeled a science. As marketing scientists we should be concerned to make our  discipline more effective in creating useful knowledge about our subject  matter. We believe that such improvements are best achieved by adopting the  relativistic/constructionist approach to science advocated here. Recognizing  the social processes of science, the context specificity of scientific  knowledge, and other features of the R/C program can give marketing scholars  the freedom and confidence to create new conceptual schemes and perspectives.  This is in contrast to following the outdated rules of the P/E approach that  focus only on testing theories we already have. A creative science of marketing  is more likely to flourish by taking a relativistic/constructionist approach.

This course will serve as an introduction to the diverse perspectives that are taught in the NYU Postdoctoral Program by exposing students to the key ideas and concepts, the historical development, and the clinical approach of each of the major orientations or schools. Ethical considerations relevant to psychoanalytic practice will be emphasized. ( Ethics   component of the course )    Writing Psychoanalytically (PDPSA.4553)  Instructor: Steven Knoblauch    This course is designed to be taken concomitant with any other course in the Postdoctoral Program or as an independent study project. It serves as an opportunity to write about a particular topic or question either emerging within another course taken at the same time as this course, or as an independent writing project. It is unique to the program as it offers six classes in which candidates are able to compare and contrast their writing over time and with each other.    Psychoanalytic Supervision (PDPSA.4543)  Instructor: Helen Gediman        This course reviews the present state of psychoanalytic thinking on the supervisory process with major emphases on the supervisory process in a climate of theoretical diversity and heterogeneity and the supervisory process as a triadic system with multiple interactions as the focus. Readings and clinical presentations by students are utilized to illustrate the main issues being studied.            THE HISTORY &amp; DEVELOPMENT OF PSYCHOANALYSIS FOCUSING ON SPECIFIC CONTRIBUTORS: Selected Topics (PDPSA.4580)    As in the humanities, and unlike some sciences, psychoanalysis must be studied historically. Whatever one\u2019s current point of view, a well-educated analyst must have a solid understanding of Freud\u2019s contributions and texts as well as those of other significant contributors. Often the contributions of seminal psychoanalytic writers must also be studied in conjunction with their school of thought. This course teaches students the theory and practice of psychoanalysis through a study of notable individuals\u2019 contributions, developmentally and historically, as well as by studying the historical development of specific schools of thought. In various semesters or in different sections this course will focus on one contributor or tradition.

This course encourages students to present their own clinical work in detail over time working with feedback from other students and with the guidance of faculty. Depending on the semester or section the focus may be on treatment from a particular theoretical slant or on specific aspects of the treatment.

One factor in individualizing treatment is to take into account diagnostic considerations and various dimensions of psychopathology. This course introduces students to current, sophisticated thinking about how psychoanalysis works with various styles of personality and forms of pathology. Each semester or section will focus on a different category or personality style taught from one or more theoretical perspectives.

This course introduces students to current theories of dreaming, empirical research on dreaming, and clinical work with dreams. Each semester or section will focus on a specific aspect of dreams, such as methodology for dream interpretation or comparative study of dream theories.           Clinical Seminar on Dreams  Instructor: Mark Blechner    Current Perspectives on Dreaming: Theory, Research and Practice  Instructor: James Fosshage   COMPARATIVE PSYCHOANALYSIS: Selected Topics (PDPSA.4584)    Contemporary psychoanalysis is diverse and pluralistic, some might even say fragmented into various schools and theories. This course examines psychoanalytic theories and clinical practices using a model of \u201ccomparative psychoanalysis.\u201d Theories and practices are examined historically, compared along the lines of theoretical and clinical issues, and compared for their implications in the treatment situation. Readings and course discussions add complexity and depth to the student\u2019s sense of the contributions and limitations of each model for clinical practice.

How do we understand the psychoanalytic method? What are the technical implications of diverse theories? What is the relationship between theory and technique and when can theory aid or interfere in treatment? Each semester or section will examine a specific theory and its application in depth and detail.

From this point of view, psychoanalysis itself can be critiqued as constructing and constraining such discourses. In addition, psychoanalysis is viewed as part of the larger mental health system, with all its social welfare and social control functions. But psychoanalysis can also function in service of social critique, as when it offers understandings of socio-economic-political structures that are concealed in the surface of ordinary discourses. These include the workings of power and privilege and how these are distributed along lines of race, social class, culture, gender, and sexual orientation. Each semester or section of this course will focus on various political, spiritual, and cultural issues.                Psychoanalysis and Politics  Instructor: Steven Botticelli  More Than Personal: Political and Spiritual Dimensions of the Therapeutic Relationship  Instructor: Andrew Samuels   Race, Racism and Psychoanalysis  Instructor: Marsha Levy-Warren  Psychoanalysis and Buddhism: Phenomenological, Spiritual, and Cultural Issues  Instructor: Sara Weber &amp; William Auerbach  Dissociation and Cultural Forms  Instructor: Elizabeth Hegeman  Foundations of Intersubjectivity: An Introduction to the Philosophy that Grounds Relational Thinking  Instructor: Jack Foehl Psychoanalysis &amp; Religious Narratives: The Christian Narrative  Instructor: Marie Hoffman  Psychoanalysis &amp; Cultural Studies  Instructors: Steven Botticelli &amp; Katie Gentile  Dissociation &amp; Cultural Forms  Instructor: Elizabeth Hegeman  Social Identities: Race, Class, Gender &amp; Sexuality  Instructor: Melanie Suchet &amp; Cleonie White  The Politics of Psychoanalysis &amp; the Psychoanalysis of Politics  Instructor: Nancy Hollander        GENDER &amp; SEXUALITY: Selected Topics (PDPSA.4587)       Historically, aspects of psychoanalysis were rooted in 19 th century cultural assumptions about sexuality and gender. Feminist critiques of those assumptions, both within the field and from psychoanalytic outsiders, have led to dramatic changes in psychoanalytic theory and practice. This course links the psychic and the social in the construction of gender and sexuality. Each semester or section will examine one aspect of this constellation in depth, focusing variously on gender, sexuality, feminism, and/or queer theory.                 Autogynephilia, Barebacking, Cisgenderism: Can We Talk (about Gender &amp; Sexuality)?  Instructor: Jack Drescher   Gender and Psychoanalysis: History, Critique, Queering &amp; Complicating (NB: instructor is in the process of updating the readings)  Instructor: Virginia Goldner  Sexuality in Relational Perspective  Instructor: TBA Advanced Seminar on Sexuality in Relational Perspective   Instructor: Muriel Dimen  The Power of Envy in Gender Development, Sexuality and Everyday Life  Instructor: Carolyn Ellman  Comparative Perspectives on Sexuality: Theoretical &amp; Clinical Perspectives  Instructor: Galit Atlas (Koch)       DEVELOPMENTAL &amp; LIFE SPAN ISSUES: Selected Topics (PDPSA.4588)       The genetic and epigenetic (developmental) points of view have long been important to psychoanalysis. Classical theory began with a focus on the development of sexuality and the psychosexual stages, but soon analysts were studying the development of the sense of reality and a variety of developmental lines. This course examines various developmental perspectives in psychoanalysis, sometimes by observing young children and at other times retrospectively through the reconstruction of earlier life experience in adults. Some semesters and sections focus on infant research, some on later developmental phases, some on the clinical implications of developmental theory, and some on very specific developmental factors such as early loss or the family context.               Developmental Perspectives in Psychoanalysis: Infancy through Latency  Instructor: Neal Vorus   Adolescence in Development &amp; Adult Treatment  Instructor: Marsha Levy-Warren   The Analytic Process &amp; the Process of Development: Emerging Developmental Perspectives &amp; the Actuality of Analytic Work  Instructor: Susan Warshaw Developmental Issues in the Analytic Setting  Instructor: Adrienne Harris Object Loss in Clinical Practice   Instructor: TBA The Power of Envy in Gender Development, Sexuality, and Everyday Life  Instructor: Carolyn Ellman   Coupling: An Interpersonal Perspective on Adult Development and Intimacy  Instructor: Mary-Joan Gerson   The Developmental Lens and Adult Analytic Work  Instructor: Katherine Oram   Anxiety, Envy, Shame &amp; the Developmental Process  Instructor: Christopher Bonovitz       INFANCY &amp; PSYCHOANALYSIS: Selected Topics (PDPSA.4589)       The past several decades have seen an explosion of research on infancy, and the findings of infancy research have had a significant impact on psychoanalytic theory and practice. Psychoanalytic theory has itself influenced infancy research and infancy research has influenced psychoanalysis. Second-by-second analysis of face-to-face interactions between parent and infant have led to monumental changes in how we understand bodily and affect regulation as well as the early origins of relatedness and patterns of communication that continue to operate through the lifetime. Each semester or section of this course will explore recent developments in infancy research focusing on methodological considerations, theoretical and/or clinical implications.

How can the literary   imagination reflect and transform geographic and cosmographic   technology? How can reading literary and scientific texts alongside one   another shape our understanding of the boundaries between humanistic and   scientific inquiry? This course will consider major renaissance epics   and romances as worldmaking documents. Text with include Dante's   Inferno, Ariosto's Orlando Gurioso, Spenser's Faerie Queene and Milton's   Paradis Lost. We will read these words in light of Renaissance thinking   about space and spatiality including selections from Plato, Ortelius,   Copernicus, and Kepler. Junior Theory Seminar: What do we mean by Subjectivity? Basterra      We like to  think of ourselves as free: freedom would seem to be a horizon toward we are  intimately oriented. We like to consider  ourselves autonomous subjects with initiative and the ability to act in the  world. But isn\u2019t subjectivity  constituted in relationship to what is other?    The subject of vision in painting, the one who sees, emerges in relation  to the object being seen; the voice speaking in a poem and calling itself \u2018I\u2019  becomes a subject in the act of addressing a \u2018you\u2019; the self-conscious subject  reflects on itself by taking itself for another; the ethical subject is chosen  and called. It is perhaps surprising,  however, to think of the very freedom which (we hope) defines our sameness as  something other. This seminar explores  the counterintuitive relationship of subjectivity to freedom, and of freedom to  action, establishing a conversation between philosophical texts by Kant, Hegel,  Deleuze, Nancy and Levinas, and a range of literary and artistic works.  Topics in 18th Century Literature: Comparative Melancholies Gadberry      Twentieth- and  twenty-first-century thinkers looked back to the seventeenth and eighteenth  centuries as they theorized the black dog dogging modernity: melancholy. Our  course will return to these earlier texts, putting early modern, Enlightenment,  and Romantic literatures in conversation with modern and post-modern  psychoanalytic, philosophical, and political-theoretical works. Our course will  be both formal and historical. We will ask how our primary texts understand  (and create) structures of melancholy and how these texts communicate the  losses we cannot avow. And we\u2019ll also examine how varying forms of melancholy  have shaped our subjectivities and societies as we study a history of  melancholy coinciding with and subtending modernity\u2019s origins \u2013 a history that  includes the emergence of the modern nation-state, of the colony, and of capital.      Our seventeenth- and  eighteenth-century texts will include: Shakespeare, Hamlet; Burton, The Anatomy  of Melancholy (selections); Defoe, Robinson Crusoe; Charles Brockden Brown,  Wieland; Claire de Durfort Duras, Ourika; Goethe, The Sorrows of Young Werther;  and poems by Coleridge, Blair, Young, Keats, and others. Among our modern  readings will be works by Freud, Lacan, Benjamin, Butler, Fanon, Brown, Klein,  Kristeva, and others.      Topics: Transnational America Garcia Beginning with Randolph Bourne's \"Trans-National America\" (1916), this course examines different transnational and globalized conceptions of \"America\" across literature and criticism from both the twentieth century and twenty-first century. We consider transnational American literatures not only for the different meanings they attach to \"America,\" but also for the divergent moments of literary, cultural and intellectual history they reveal. Much of the course is devoted to the interventions of critics such as Bourne, W.E.B. Du Bois, Alain Locke, whose writings we examine in terms of literary-theoretical resonances with works by Jean Toomer, Willa Cather, Henry James, Nella Larsen, Teju Cole and Joseph O'Neill, among others.  Readings in Comtemporary Literary Theory: Image Iampolski      The course is designed to introduce students to the  theoretical framework of modern thinking about images. Images mediate our  relations with the world and are responsible for the primordial elaboration of  meaning from the surrounding chaotic complexity. We will start with biological  evolution and the emergence of vision and the unparalleled variety of striking  appearances in living beings that emerged around the famous Cambrian explosion.  We will use the data provided by cognitive sciences to understand the  anthropological role of images, the use of images in cults and rituals. Special  attention will be paid to the emergence of art and to its modern developments  in photography and contemporary media. We will discuss the role of images in  the rise and transformations of modern subjectivity. The social role of images  in modern society will be surveyed. The readings will include among others many  influential thinkers and scholars such as Jakob von Uexk\u00fcll, Heidegger,  Merleau-Ponty, Kracauer, Benjamin, Foucault, Panofsky, Gombrich, Marion,  Didi-Huberman etc. Topics in 20th Century Literature: Literature &amp; the Figure of the Disappeared in Spain and the Southern Cone Matos-Martin     In the twentieth century, Spain  and many countries in Latin America have shared the common experience of  dictatorship. In this course, we will explore representations of the traumatic  dictatorial histories in Spain and the countries of the Southern Cone, focusing  primarily on the figure of the \u201cdesaparecido\u201d in Spanish Civil War and the  early years of the Franco regime, Argentina\u2019s \u201cdirty war\u201d and Pinochet\u2019s  dictatorship in Chile. Taking a comparative approach, we will study literary  and visual sources such as short stories, novels, poems, painting, fiction  films or documentaries, and we will examine topics such as the politics of  memory, fascism, political disappearance, war, resistance or violence. Some  authors and filmmakers whose works we might engage include Alberto M\u00e9ndez,  Luisa Valenzuela, Andr\u00e9s Wood, Marco Bechis, Guillermo del Toro, Agust\u00edn  Villaronga, Pablo Picasso, Pablo Neruda, Rafael Alberti, Jorge Sempr\u00fan,  Patricio Guzm\u00e1n, Juan Gelman, Roberto Bola\u00f1o and Gast\u00f3n Birab\u00e9n. Primary  materials will be paired with texts by leading cultural and political thinkers  working on questions of memory, fascism, terror and violence. Intro to Comp Lit: Classic Screw-Ups and Epic Fails: From Faust To Kathy Acker &amp; Dennis Cooper Ronell      The course aims to introduce some  thrilling aspects of reading and thinking in the void of achievement. We will  explore the way literature exemplarily treats and exposes snags, flaws,  addictive roller coaster itineraries, sexual confusion, rhetorical static,  material abuse and gender trouble, permanent identity crises, the intrusive  disruption of life\u2019s narrative, forms of destructive pleasure, failing health  and other disturbances that inflect the way we write and think and truck.  Staying close to the texts in question, we will locate philosophical  predicaments, cover-ups and inflations with which literature regularly  contends, if according to covert maneuvers. All the while learning how to  deconstruct, we will consider the way Stupidity insinuates itself into themes  of knowing, evades our cognitive scanners and becomes the uncanny double of mastery  or intelligence. Promised: By the end of the class, you will have been able to  comprehend this course description. Prepare to be reset! Topics in Film &amp; Literatue: Documents, Documentary, Fiction Vatulescu      What do we mean by document,  documentary, and fiction? How have these concepts and their relationships  changed through time? This course starts by considering the beginnings of  documentary in literature, film, and the visual arts, from the controversial  coining of the term in 1926. We will explore representative works from  foundational moments in the evolution of documentary\u2014the beginnings of the newsreel,  Soviet and Nazi propaganda, American depression era documentary books, the  cin\u00e9ma-v\u00e9rit\u00e9 movement, and the rise of autobiographical/personal documentary  films. How has the emergence of this new term and its development affected our  other key concepts\u2014document and fiction? What is the relationship between  documentary modes and particular media and technologies\u2014print, photography,  cinema, video, and digital? Other topics include the role of the artist,  indexicality and representation, literature as historical document, \u201cfiction in  the archives,\u201d false documents and forgery, collage, illustration, and other  uses of the document in twentieth century art. This semester\u2019s special topics  are 1) word/image relations and 2) the archive. Theoretical forays around and  into the archive will be complemented by hands-on research in the Tamiment  archive or in an archive of your choice.    Senior Seminar in Comparative Literature: Honors Thesis Vatulescu This seminar, limited to senior Comparative Literature majors engaged in writing a senior honors thesis, is designed to be a writing workshop. Students will articulate and research a thesis topic, identify an appropriate critical approach and methodology, and write at least one chapter of their thesis. Periodical writing installments give the students the opportunity to receive feed-back from their peers and instructor as well as to learn to critique others' work-in-progress. Permission of the DUGS is required to enroll in the course. Students must also have a 3.65 or better GPA, both overall and in the major.
