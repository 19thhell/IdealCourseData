The program is dedicated to training future leaders, endowing them with the skills and experience to advance reconciliation and coexistence for future generations.   The academic objective of Paths to Peace is to focus on the historical, political, cultural, and religious relationships between Israelis and Palestinians. All students in the program will be required to take two mandatory courses, together with NYU students, one on Israel and one on Palestine. They will also participate in two weekly workshops to be held on two separate days and to be conducted by experienced Palestinian and Israeli facilitators. Workshop participants will engage in an in-depth process of exploration, observation and analysis of the conflict and will have the opportunity to gain important insights into their identities as well as the dynamics of groups in conflict.   Students will be allowed to select up to two additional courses based on their own academic interests. These courses should be selected from the University's undergraduate college of Arts and Science or American Language Institute (if further English language training is required based on your level at the start of the program).   Program participants will attend off-campus excursions, such as visits to the UN Headquarters, the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture in Harlem, and a weekend in Washington, DC. Each student is expected and required to participate fully in the program and to attend all classes and activities comprising the program. In the event that the University determines, in its sole discretion, that a student has failed to meet the required standard of participation, the student will be subject to immediate dismissal from the program and will be required to return to his/her country of origin.

The program is dedicated to training future leaders, endowing them with the skills and experience to advance reconciliation and coexistence for future generations.   The academic objective of Paths to Peace is to focus on the historical, political, cultural, and religious relationships between Israelis and Palestinians. All students in the program will be required to take two mandatory courses, together with NYU students, one on Israel and one on Palestine. They will also participate in two weekly workshops to be held on two separate days and to be conducted by experienced Palestinian and Israeli facilitators. Workshop participants will engage in an in-depth process of exploration, observation and analysis of the conflict and will have the opportunity to gain important insights into their identities as well as the dynamics of groups in conflict.   Students will be allowed to select up to two additional courses based on their own academic interests. These courses should be selected from the University's undergraduate college of Arts and Science or American Language Institute (if further English language training is required based on your level at the start of the program).   Program participants will attend off-campus excursions, such as visits to the UN Headquarters, the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture in Harlem, and a weekend in Washington, DC. Each student is expected and required to participate fully in the program and to attend all classes and activities comprising the program. In the event that the University determines, in its sole discretion, that a student has failed to meet the required standard of participation, the student will be subject to immediate dismissal from the program and will be required to return to his/her country of origin.

In 1881 Welch was appointed Professor of Pathologic Anatomy and General Pathology, the first position of its kind in the country. Around the same time, a laboratory, devoted specifically to the study of the \"pathology of many diseases,\" was founded through a gift from Andrew Carnegie at Bellevue Hospital Medical College. With its stated research focus, this laboratory became the first in the United States for teaching and investigation in pathology.
