Investigates two governing principles of American society: the fact that it is a market society and the fact that it is a democracy. Examines how the fact of its being a capitalist democracy affects the distribution of goods, rights, and powers.

Studies the premise that war is much more than a means to an end (a rational, if very brutal, activity intended to serve the interests of one group by destroying those who oppose that group). Mounds of evidence suggest that war exercises a powerful fascination that has its greatest impact on participants but is by no means limited to them. War, in short, is a complex web of affiliations and emotions. This course seeks to place war in the larger map of social conflict, to examine both the persistence of warfare and its historical transformations, and to interpret the cultures of war that have grown around its fatal attraction.

The goal is to see how each particular film originated at distinct moments both in the city\u2019s history as well as in the history of filmmaking. In so doing, the course combines the perspectives of both urban studies and film studies, placing films within their cultural, political, and artistic content.    Landscapes of Consumption   SCA-UA 625 Offered every year. 4 points.   Consumption of objects, images, and places is central to the culture and economy of metropolitan life. The class explores how the relationship between consumption and cities has developed by examining three key moments: the late 19th century and the invention of urban commodity spectacles, post-war America and the rise of suburban consumer spaces, and contemporary America and the selling of the commodity city. The class addresses three questions: Why do we want things? How does landscape organize our consumer desires? How does place become an object of consumption? We begin with an examination of classic theoretical works that probe the relationships between people, things, and cities. We then embed these in discussions of changing forms and practices of consumption and urbanism. The empirical cases we examine range from the development of the department store, to the fashioning of the commodity city, to the work of shopping, and to the emergence of a thriving urban debt industry.    Urban Environmentalism   SCA-UA 631 Offered every other year. 4 points.   Explores environmental issues in urban centers, their causes and impacts, and the rise of a movement that considers the \u201cenvironment\u201d not just as the term we use to describe the natural world from which most urban residents feel dissociated, but rather as the array of places where we live, work and play. Considers the relationship between society and public policy in the context of environmentalism. Introduces students to public policy analysis, with a focus on policy implementation and decision-making in New York City. Examines the powers of the NYC Council and explains the role of agencies, the private sector, and interest groups as critical parts of a bureaucracy through which environmental issues are shaped, managed and negotiated. Through a variety of case studies, increases students' understanding of the political, legal, economic and technical and scientific constraints of the policy decision-making process and explores the path towards managing, using and protecting environmental resources in urban centers. Climate Change and Environmental Justice SCA-UA 632 Offered every other year. 4 points. This course will introduce students to the basic approaches to climate change, through readings from climatologists, economists, anthropologists, geographers, cultural analysts, and activists of various stripes. Consideration will be given to the \u201cdebate\u201d about climate change that has been generated by deniers and advocates for the fossil fuel industries. The context for discussing the natural and social impact of global warming will be further defined by examining the principles of climate justice. Modeled on the American-derived principles of environmental justice in the 1990s, the climate justice movement poses a legal and humanitarian challenge to champions of \u201cnatural capitalism\u201d who place their faith in market-driven solutions. Students will look at how populations are unevenly affected by climate change, and how this imbalance is being addressed by a range of advocates of decarbonization.
