The laser micromachined surface of the Laser-Lok line of implants, produced by BioHorizons Inc., is one of these projects, and additional surfaces are under development. These surfaces are also being applied to other transcutaneous implants that will be used for support of bone conduction hearing aids and prosthetics used for amputees. Dr. Ricci is also working on various types of bone graft substitutes including three-dimensionally printed scaffolds, consisting of permanent and resorbable biomaterials, for replacement and regeneration of craniofacial bone and soft tissue structures. He is also incorporating bioactive molecules in these scaffolds. Dr. Ricci is also actively researching new methodologies for analysis and imaging of bone and soft tissue structure, and the interface between tissues and biomaterials.
