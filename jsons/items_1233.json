A decade and a half after the ending of      political divisions between Eastern and Western Europe, scholars      of Early Modern drama have still not advanced very far in the      serious work of representing the full picture of how early modern      theater--plays, playwrights, players, theatergrams, genres and      theories--travelled and reshaped the theatrical culture of Europe      into a complex transcultural form. Nor have scholars developed      sufficient theoretical and historical frameworks to discuss the      differing kinds of influences, intertextualities, intercultural      dialogues and transcultural performance practices created by      the international character of early modern drama. Our conference      aims to undertake both these tasks.       We welcome papers from scholars in comparative literature as      well as from scholars in specific language traditions, for we      assume that true interdisciplinary work will emerge best from      collaboration among scholars who are deeply rooted in national      literary traditions. All papers, however, should address the      questions of the conference and consider how plays and players      crossed borders, why and with what effects, whether aesthetic,      dramatic, political or social. Papers may take up theoretical      topics of relevance or consider such diverse subjects as translation,      the role of audiences, the symbolic and real role of geography,      the significance of utopian or aesthetic spaces in differing      contexts, historical phenomenology, the authority of performance,      or the links between drama and ideology.       As a research collaborative especially interested in performance      practices, we also welcome papers and presentations from theatre      professionals, dramaturgs and scholars on the performance of      early modern plays, including contemporary (20th-21st century)      stagings of those plays; or on early modern performance of scripted      or unscripted drama.       We will welcome papers on the performance in Eastern Europe      of early modern drama, including the work of comic performers      like traveling commedia troupes in the 16th-17th centuries, but      also the reception and interpretation of canonical dramatic figures      like Shakespeare, Molire, or Lope. In addition, papers on the      influence of Eastern European theatre on Western theatrical traditions      both in the early modern period, and in the present, with a focus      on the work of modern directors and actors whose interpretations      of early modern plays have helped shaped the modernist and postmodern      theatre, will form a relevant part of our inquiry.
