Al Tamimi, AlHanouf   AlHanouf was born and raised in Kuwait City, Kuwait. As a resident in the Middle East coming from a family of well-known public figures, she was exposed to various forms of media and censorship, which then influenced her to pursue a degree in communications and media. During the summer of 2014, she graduated with a B.A. in Mass Communication and Media and a minor in Social and Behavioral Sciences with a concentration in Anthropology, as she wanted to focus on media and its influence on different cultures and societies worldwide. While at the American University in Kuwait, she had various opportunities whereby she immersed herself into the world of mass communications and media from working at a popular local brand and handling their public relations, social media, and online website to handling the stay of Steve Wozniak when he was in Kuwait to talk to young entrepreneurs. Opportunities as such helped prepare her mentally to what she will be expecting in the future in terms of her career. It also opened her eyes to the role of media within society, the rapid growth of social media, how technology affects media, and how media can alter the minds of many when it comes to politics and social movements.    AlHanouf plans to pursue her MA in MCC with an interest in human rights, citizenship, political communication and media and the idea of cross-cultural communication worldwide. This will ultimately allow her to create cross-cultural and political awareness in her society, and allow for an open door to new possibilities and ways of thinking in relation to communications and media back home. She plans to pursue a number of classes to further her knowledge in the field of Media, Culture and Communication. AlHanouf plans to follow an academic career path with a PhD program in the future.          Gilberg, Daniel   Danny graduated Vassar College in 2010 with a degree in history.

There, he worked as a reading and math tutor for two different first grade classrooms, and also organized after school activities. Since starting the MCC program, Danny has interned at various organizations in New York, including CBS News and the Clinton Foundation.    Danny&rsquo;s coursework and research focuses primarily on the intersection of pop culture and American politics. His research projects have included the banning of books in public schools and the historical roots of the white savior complex in film. His Master's Thesis explores the television series Survivor and theories of politics and democracies that are embedded in the show's format. The project examines various domestic policies that have been proposed and/or enacted in the past decade and how it is reflected in the contestants' strategic game play.          Goldfond, Joshua   Focusing on Political &amp; Persuasion and Interaction &amp; Social Processes. Joshua graduated summa cum laude from Rutgers College, with a focus on English, History, and Film. He has spent the last decade working in entertainment media while pursuing a number of creative projects, including the production of several short films, the sale of a feature-length script, and the publication of a fantasy/satire novel called \"The Hunting of the Bubblenuff&rdquo;, which was well received by Kirkus Reviews. He currently runs an Arts &amp; Culture website called \"The Oculus Online,\" which features a variety of interviews and essays.    Josh wishes to investigate the concept of public manipulation and its emerging relationship with social media and corporate communications. It is clear that the technology of our age allows information to spread over distances and across cultures like never before. But will we find an ideological common ground as all peoples are exposed to all ideas? Or, will we become more Balkanized as we immerse ourselves in the culture, politics, and scientific interpretations of our preferred realities? In either case, what are the styles and methodologies of communication that will remain effective, rising above the noise and breaching the walls? Are there any sophisticated universal concepts left, or will the ammunition of tomorrow's messaging wars be LOL Cats? If so, which ones? He is also interested in \"greenwashing,\" human rights violations, the rising gap between rich and poor, and similar such things that go bump in the night.
