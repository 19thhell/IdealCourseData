Two groups strive to deliver high-quality solutions and guidance for Web Services, Mobile and Social Media: the Office of Web Communications (WebComm) and Information Technology Services ' eServices Group (ITS).   Acting as one unit to serve the university's non-academic needs, these two groups have formed the Digital Communications Group (DigiComm) to collaborate with university offices and provide tools to develop and maintain digital outlets while ensuring that the university\u2019s visual identity standards and best practices are met.
