Instructors ground students in the various forms of cultural contact, diffusion, and resistance by which artistic practices have circulated across cultures and compare the idea and influence of the arts in widely disparate traditions. Further, they educate students in the methods of close reading both literary and visual texts, the practice of interdisciplinary modes of analysis, and, in CF III, the integration of the critical perspectives of contemporary scholars into their own understanding. Cultural Foundations I CF I covers the period from the rise of the first cities to the roughly coincident dissolutions of the Gupta, Han, and Western Roman empires in the 3rd-6th centuries CE. Conceptions of the divine, the heroic, power and disenfranchisement, beauty, and love are examined within the context of the art and literature of East and South Asia, the Mediterranean world, and contiguous regions (such as Germania, Nubia, and Mesopotamia). Instructors prepare the way for Cultural Foundations II by exploring the modes by which cultural transmission occurred across these regions prior to the rise of Islam. Cultural Foundations II CF II examines the arts produced within diverse cultural traditions across the globe from the rise of Islam at the beginning of the 7th century to the global empire building of the late 17th/early 18th centuries. The course explores the distinctive conventions and traditions of different media, and the development of cultural traditions from their ancient foundations to the early modern period through successive influences and assimilations, both local and external. Diverse cultural traditions are also considered in relation to one another: by direct comparison of works even in the absence of historical cultural contact; by consideration of mutual interactions, exchanges and contestations; by the assertion of cultural dominance; and by resistance to such assertions. Cultural Foundations III CF III explores the arts from the late 17th/early 18th centuries to the post-World War II era, examining how they define and reflect both local cultural views and rapidly shifting global understandings of the world. The course considers how the diverse conceptions and conditions of modernity both shaped and were shaped by the arts around the world. Many of the issues pertinent to the course -- industrialization/urbanization; the outcomes of cross-cultural contact; colonialism, decolonization, conflicts of political ideology, and liberation struggles; fundamental redefinitions of mind, language, gender, and sexual identity -- have had very different effects in various parts of the world; instructors encourage students to explore what it means to study the arts from global perspectives and what \"globalization\" itself has meant and means in the context of the arts.
