Ironically if one follows Jean-Paul Sartre's plan of action and becomes a good existentialist, one is condemned to anguish, abandonment and despair. In 1948, Sartre published his treatise Existentialism and Humanism (London: Methuen & Co.) where he explains why man is in anguish: \"When a man commits himself to anything, fully realising that he is not only choosing what he will be, but is thereby at the same time a legislator deciding for the whole of mankind--in such a moment a man cannot escape from the sense of complete and profound responsibility.\"(126) In other words, every time you do something, ask yourself, what would happen if everyone did it, like cheating on taxes, stealing ice cream, avoiding jury duty to the more dramatic crimes of murder, rape and arson. This is the anguish of responsibility and commitment, an anguish existentialists must feel if they are to be humanists and if they aren't humanists, they will certainly create a hell on earth.    Since man has been abandoned by god, man becomes the future of man, condemned to be free, according to Sartre. \"Everything is indeed permitted if God does not exist, and man is in consequence forlorn, for he cannot find anything to depend upon either within or without himself. He discovers forthwith that he is without excuse. For if indeed existence precedes essence, one will never be able to explain one's action by reference to a given and specific human nature; in other words, there is no determinism-- man is free, man is freedom. Nor, on the other hand, if God does not exist, are we provided with any values or commands that could legitimise our behavior. Thus we have neither behind us, nor before us in a luminous realm of values, any means of justification or excuse. We are left alone, without excuse. That is what I mean when I say that man is condemned to be free. Condemned, because he did not create himself, yet is nevertheless at liberty, and from the moment that he is thrown into this world he is responsible for everything he does. \"(128)     With abandonment comes despair because we are limited to a reliance upon that which is within our wills. Our actions are limited by our imperfections, our mortality, our position in time and space, which is another reason we must rely on others, \"comrades-in-arms\" and why existentialism must become humanism, according to Sartre. But this means that our potential, our hopes, fears, ambitions, desires are nothing:\"...a man is no other than a series of undertakings, that he is the sum, the organisation, the set of relations that constitute these undertakings.\"(135)   Contrast Sartre's philosophy with that of R.F.Laird. In the Book of Willie, Chapter 31, the prophet Harry gives advice to baby boomers caught in the mindless deception of narcissism:  3 Thinking leads to fear and nameless dreads and images of doom that will inevitably come true.  4 Remember that there are no consequences,  5 Because you have no responsibilites,  6 And whatever happens,  7 It's not your fault.  8 Now I can see that you are all nodding,  9 And that you are beginning to understand the rightness and wisdom of my way,  10 But you are also wondering, How is it that I can avoid thinking?  11 How should I make decisions?  12 What may I rely on for guidance in avoiding thought in my life?  13 And, again, I can tell you that the answer is a simple one,  14 Tailor-made for your simple minds.  15 You shall be guided by the great Trinity of Harry,  16 Which encompasses all things of importance to you,  17 And to the conduct of your life.  18 These are the beacons of the way:  19 Desire,  20 Certainty,  21 And Blame.  22 These three beacons illuminate all my teachings and advice.    While Sartre demands that the existentialist become responsible for his actions, the messiah Harry entices man to blame others for his misfortune; Harry's motto is GO FOR IT, no matter what the consequences, while Sartre wants man to be aware not only of the consequences of his actions to himself but all humanity; Sartre's world is uncertain but Harry assures his followers certainty if they avoid thinking. By the way, God was also upset when Eve and Adam ate the tree of knowledge.    Sartre eventually died and was turned to dust, but wrote so many books that his thoughts are immortalized by humanists, for a while at least. Perhaps others will pursue the existential engagement of despair, anguish and abandonment instead of the hell of relying on others' opinions, religion, determinism and other essentialist doctrines.

Major Themes     Because of the diversity of positions associated with existentialism, the term is impossible to define precisely. Certain themes common to virtually all existentialist writers can, however, be identified. The term itself suggests one major theme: the stress on concrete individual existence and, consequently, on subjectivity, individual freedom, and choice.    Moral Individualism     Most philosophers since Plato have held that the highest ethical good is the same for everyone; insofar as one approaches moral perfection, one resembles other morally perfect individuals. The 19th-century Danish philosopher S&oslash;ren Kierkegaard, who was the first writer to call himself existential, reacted against this tradition by insisting that the highest good for the individual is to find his or her own unique vocation. As he wrote in his journal, \"I must find a truth that is true for me . . . the idea for which I can live or die.\" Other existentialist writers have echoed Kierkegaard's belief that one must choose one's own way without the aid of universal, objective standards. Against the traditional view that moral choice involves an objective judgment of right and wrong, existentialists have argued that no objective, rational basis can be found for moral decisions. The 19th-century German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche further contended that the individual must decide which situations are to count as moral situations.    Subjectivity     All existentialists have followed Kierkegaard in stressing the importance of passionate individual action in deciding questions of both morality and truth. They have insisted, accordingly, that personal experience and acting on one's own convictions are essential in arriving at the truth. Thus, the understanding of a situation by someone involved in that situation is superior to that of a detached, objective observer. This emphasis on the perspective of the individual agent has also made existentialists suspicious of systematic reasoning. Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, and other existentialist writers have been deliberately unsystematic in the exposition of their philosophies, preferring to express themselves in aphorisms, dialogues, parables, and other literary forms. Despite their antirationalist position, however, most existentialists cannot be said to be irrationalists in the sense of denying all validity to rational thought. They have held that rational clarity is desirable wherever possible, but that the most important questions in life are not accessible to reason or science. Furthermore, they have argued that even science is not as rational as is commonly supposed. Nietzsche, for instance, asserted that the scientific assumption of an orderly universe is for the most part a useful fiction.    Choice and Commitment     Perhaps the most prominent theme in existentialist writing is that of choice. Humanity's primary distinction, in the view of most existentialists, is the freedom to choose. Existentialists have held that human beings do not have a fixed nature, or essence, as other animals and plants do; each human being makes choices that create his or her own nature. In the formulation of the 20th-century French philosopher Jean Paul Sartre, existence precedes essence. Choice is therefore central to human existence, and it is inescapable; even the refusal to choose is a choice. Freedom of choice entails commitment and responsibility. Because individuals are free to choose their own path, existentialists have argued, they must accept the risk and responsibility of following their commitment wherever it leads.    Dread and Anxiety     Kierkegaard held that it is spiritually crucial to recognize that one experiences not only a fear of specific objects but also a feeling of general apprehension, which he called dread. He interpreted it as God's way of calling each individual to make a commitment to a personally valid way of life. The word anxiety (German Angst) has a similarly crucial role in the work of the 20th-century German philosopher Martin Heidegger; anxiety leads to the individual's confrontation with nothingness and with the impossibility of finding ultimate justification for the choices he or she must make. In the philosophy of Sartre, the word nausea is used for the individual's recognition of the pure contingency of the universe, and the word anguish is used for the recognition of the total freedom of choice that confronts the individual at every moment.    History     Existentialism as a distinct philosophical and literary movement belongs to the 19th and 20th centuries, but elements of existentialism can be found in the thought (and life) of Socrates, in the Bible, and in the work of many premodern philosophers and writers.    Pascal     The first to anticipate the major concerns of modern existentialism was the 17th-century French philosopher Blaise Pascal. Pascal rejected the rigorous rationalism of his contemporary Ren&eacute; Descartes, asserting, in his Pens&eacute;es (1670), that a systematic philosophy that presumes to explain God and humanity is a form of pride. Like later existentialist writers, he saw human life in terms of paradoxes: The human self, which combines mind and body, is itself a paradox and contradiction.   Kierkegaard     Kierkegaard, generally regarded as the founder of modern existentialism, reacted against the systematic absolute idealism of the 19th-century German philosopher G. W. F. Hegel, who claimed to have worked out a total rational understanding of humanity and history. Kierkegaard, on the contrary, stressed the ambiguity and absurdity of the human situation. The individual's response to this situation must be to live a totally committed life, and this commitment can only be understood by the individual who has made it. The individual therefore must always be prepared to defy the norms of society for the sake of the higher authority of a personally valid way of life. Kierkegaard ultimately advocated a \"leap of faith\" into a Christian way of life, which, although incomprehensible and full of risk, was the only commitment he believed could save the individual from despair.    Nietzsche     Nietzsche, who was not acquainted with the work of Kierkegaard, influenced subsequent existentialist thought through his criticism of traditional metaphysical and moral assumptions and through his espousal of tragic pessimism and the life-affirming individual will that opposes itself to the moral conformity of the majority. In contrast to Kierkegaard, whose attack on conventional morality led him to advocate a radically individualistic Christianity, Nietzsche proclaimed the \"death of God\" and went on to reject the entire Judeo-Christian moral tradition in favor of a heroic pagan ideal.    Heidegger     Heidegger, like Pascal and Kierkegaard, reacted against an attempt to put philosophy on a conclusive rationalistic basis--in this case the phenomenology of the 20th-century German philosopher Edmund Husserl. Heidegger argued that humanity finds itself in an incomprehensible, indifferent world. Human beings can never hope to understand why they are here; instead, each individual must choose a goal and follow it with passionate conviction, aware of the certainty of death and the ultimate meaninglessness of one's life. Heidegger contributed to existentialist thought an original emphasis on being and ontology as well as on language.    Sartre     Sartre first gave the term existentialism general currency by using it for his own philosophy and by becoming the leading figure of a distinct movement in France that became internationally influential after World War II. Sartre's philosophy is explicitly atheistic and pessimistic; he declared that human beings require a rational basis for their lives but are unable to achieve one, and thus human life is a \"futile passion.\" Sartre nevertheless insisted that his existentialism is a form of humanism, and he strongly emphasized human freedom, choice, and responsibility. He eventually tried to reconcile these existentialist concepts with a Marxist analysis of society and history.    Existentialism and Theology     Although existentialist thought encompasses the uncompromising atheism of Nietzsche and Sartre and the agnosticism of Heidegger, its origin in the intensely religious philosophies of Pascal and Kierkegaard foreshadowed its profound influence on 20th-century theology. The 20th-century German philosopher Karl Jaspers, although he rejected explicit religious doctrines, influenced contemporary theology through his preoccupation with transcendence and the limits of human experience. The German Protestant theologians Paul Tillich and Rudolf Bultmann, the French Roman Catholic theologian Gabriel Marcel, the Russian Orthodox philosopher Nikolay Berdyayev, and the German Jewish philosopher Martin Buber inherited many of Kierkegaard's concerns, especially that a personal sense of authenticity and commitment is essential to religious faith.    Existentialism and Literature     A number of existentialist philosophers used literary forms to convey their thought, and existentialism has been as vital and as extensive a movement in literature as in philosophy. The 19th-century Russian novelist Fyodor Dostoyevsky is probably the greatest existentialist literary figure. In Notes from the Underground (1864), the alienated antihero rages against the optimistic assumptions of rationalist humanism. The view of human nature that emerges in this and other novels of Dostoyevsky is that it is unpredictable and perversely self-destructive; only Christian love can save humanity from itself, but such love cannot be understood philosophically. As the character Alyosha says in The Brothers Karamazov (1879-80), \"We must love life more than the meaning of it.\"    In the 20th century, the novels of the Austrian Jewish writer Franz Kafka, such as The Trial (1925; trans. 1937) and The Castle (1926; trans. 1930), present isolated men confronting vast, elusive, menacing bureaucracies; Kafka's themes of anxiety, guilt, and solitude reflect the influence of Kierkegaard, Dostoyevsky, and Nietzsche. The influence of Nietzsche is also discernible in the novels of the French writers Andr&eacute; Malraux and in the plays of Sartre. The work of the French writer Albert Camus is usually associated with existentialism because of the prominence in it of such themes as the apparent absurdity and futility of life, the indifference of the universe, and the necessity of engagement in a just cause. Existentialist themes are also reflected in the theater of the absurd, notably in the plays of Samuel Beckett and Eug&egrave;ne Ionesco. In the United States, the influence of existentialism on literature has been more indirect and diffuse, but traces of Kierkegaard's thought can be found in the novels of Walker Percy and John Updike, and various existentialist themes are apparent in the work of such diverse writers as Norman Mailer, John Barth, and Arthur Miller.               In what sense is the individual responsible for earning a meaning for being alive?"}]},

Existentialist themes are also reflected in the theater of the absurd, notably in the plays of Samuel Beckett and Eug&egrave;ne Ionesco. In the United States, the influence of existentialism on literature has been more indirect and diffuse, but traces of Kierkegaard's thought can be found in the novels of Walker Percy and John Updike, and various existentialist themes are apparent in the work of such diverse writers as Norman Mailer, John Barth, and Arthur Miller.

What, if anything, is  the meaning of life? Then, after a crash-course in ethical theory, we&rsquo;ll talk  about the morality of abortion and the morality of war. We&rsquo;ll then return to  a few more theoretical questions: why is death bad for the person who dies? Is it a  bad thing to have never lived at all? (If so, bad for whom?) Would it be better for  us if we were immortal? What is the appropriate attitude we should have towards  death? We&rsquo;ll end by considering another practical issue&mdash;suicide. A few  of the questions we&rsquo;ll address here: is it ever rational to commit suicide?  Is it ever moral to do so? When, if ever, is euthanasia morally permitted? No  background in philosophy required.      Group I: History of Philosophy      V83.0021-001   History of Modern Philosophy   T/TH 12:30-1:45   Elliot Paul         This course is an introduction to the some of the most influential European  philosophers of the 17 th and 18 th centuries: Descartes,  Locke, Leibniz, Berkeley, Hume, Reid, and Kant. We will consider and critically  examine the responses these thinkers gave to various questions in metaphysics and  epistemology, including the following: What is the relationship between reality and  our perception of reality? What is the nature of the mind and how is it related to  the body? What is the nature of physical reality? Which of our beliefs, if any, do  we have good reason to maintain in the face of radical skepticism?

We will read Kierkegaard&rsquo;s The Sickness  unto Death , excerpts from Husserl&rsquo;s Cartesian Meditations , and  substantial portions of Heidegger&rsquo;s Being and Time , Sartre&rsquo;s   Being and Nothingness , and Merleau-Ponty&rsquo;s Phenomenology of  Perception .

Religion and Morality in Nietzsche      The course will explore Nietzsche&rsquo;s claims about the way in which religion shapes our moral beliefs. We will ask which elements of our moral beliefs, on Nietzsche&rsquo;s view, we must give up in the absence of religion. Nietzsche tells us, for example, that Christianity is &lsquo;a system, a carefully considered, integrated view of things&rsquo; and that Christian morality therefore &lsquo;stands or falls with belief in God.&rsquo; We will interrogate what he means by this and similar claims through a reading of texts such as Beyond Good and Evil , On the Genealogy of Morality , The AntiChrist , and Twilight of the Idols .         V83.0101-002   Topics in History of Philosophy   MW 3:30-4:45   Thomas Nagel       Prerequisite:  Two courses in Philosophy, including either V83.0076 or V83.0078.    The topic of the course will be the moral philosophy of Hume and Kant.      Group II: Ethics, Value, and Society      V83.0040   Ethics   MW 11-12:15   Samuel Scheffler         An introduction to the philosophical study of morality. Topics to be considered  will include: traditional vs. consequentialist moral outlooks; contractualism; the  nature of moral motivation; the rationality of morality; the objectivity or  subjectivity of ethics; moral relativism; the explanatory role of morality; the  compatibility of morality with a purely naturalistic understanding of human beings.  Readings will be drawn from a variety of classical and contemporary sources.

Are we describing some aspect of an evaluative realm that exists independently of  what humans think and do? If so, how do we gain access to this realm? (Do we need  moral antennae or ethical telescopes?) And what is the relation between truths in  this realm and those in the ordinary world of mental and physical entities? If we  are not talking about independent ethical facts when we call something wrong or  bad, what are we doing? Are we saying anything meaningful at all, or are we merely  giving vent to our emotions?

When and why are citizens morally obligated to follow  these laws? This course will examine these questions through a  combination of historical and contemporary readings.

Even as compared to what he  or she can do, almost all well-to-do people do little, or nothing, over the  course of their lifetime, to prevent the early deaths and great suffering of  people in the poorest parts of the world. Is it wrong for a well-to-do person  to behave like this - perhaps about as horribly wrong as committing negligent  homicide, as with fatal drunken driving? The course will center on this question,  though it will also involve us in many other moral questions. In about equal  measure, this will be a course in both normative ethics and in applied ethics.  (By contrast, little will be said about metaethics and, most likely, not much  about political philosophy, either.)      Group III: Metaphysics, Epistemology, Mind, Language, and Logic    V83.0070-001   Logic   MW 12:30-1:45   Seunghyun Song         Introduces the techniques,  results, and philosophical import of 20th century formal logic. Principal  concepts include those of interpretation, validity, implication, derivation,  soundness and completeness. This course satisfies the logic requirement for NYU  Philosophy majors.      V83.0070-002   Logic   T/TH 2-3:15   David Barnett         This  course introduces the techniques, results, and philosophical import of 20th  century formal logic. Principal concepts include those of sentence, set,  interpretation, validity, consistency, consequence, tautology, derivation, and  completeness. More advanced topics will be covered if time permits. This course  satisfies the logic requirement for NYU Philosophy majors.      V83.0070-002   V83.0074    Modal Logic   TR 11-12:15   Ted Sider      In introductory logic you learn the basics of  standard propositional and predicate logic. In this course we&rsquo;ll begin by  taking a deeper look at standard logic. We&rsquo;ll then discuss modal  logic&mdash;the logic of possibility and necessity&mdash;and counterfactual  conditionals. Our main approach will be that of possible-worlds semantics.        V83.0074-002 Tuesday 12:30-1:45     V83.0074-003 Tuesday 2:00-3:15         V83.0076   Belief, Truth and Knowledge   MW 12:30-1:45   Imogen Dickie         The first part of the course  will be a general introduction to the theory of knowledge. We will look at the  answers to the question \u00d4What is knowledge?&rsquo; that philosophers have developed  in the attempt to provide a satisfactory response to sceptics, who think that  we don&rsquo;t know anything. The second part of the course will use tools acquired  in the first part to discuss the following topics: knowledge based on  perception; knowledge based on memory; our knowledge of our own minds; the  problem of what we can know about what happens in the minds of other people.      V83.0078   Metaphysics   T/TH 9:30-10:45   Jon Simon         What is there, really? In this course we will  investigate the fundamental nature of reality. Why is there Something rather  than Nothing? What is Time? What is Space? What is Matter? What is  Consciousness? What is Perception? What is Value? What is a Person? What is  Freedom? What is a Law of Nature? What is it for something to be Fundamental?  Through addressing these questions we will also address the methodological  question: to what extent should physics (and the hard sciences generally)  inform metaphysics, and to what extent can metaphysics inform physics.      V83.0085   Philosophy of Language   T/TH 3:30-4:45   Crispin Wright         This course will concentrate on a small number of  central questions in recent and contemporary philosophy of  language. Familiarity with elementary formal logic will be helpful.  Topics to be covered include skepticism about meaning, with special reference  to writings of Quine, Kripke and Putnam; the nature of knowledge of a language,  with special reference to the work of Davidson and Dummett; and the competing  paradigms of singular reference deriving from Frege and from Kripke. Grades  will be awarded on the basis of two mid-term papers, and a take-home final  exam.
