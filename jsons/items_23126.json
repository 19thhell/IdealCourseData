Public readings are performed each weekend with a discussion following each Sunday matinee. Our work honors the history of the Provincetown Playhouse where the early plays of Eugene O&rsquo;Neill, Susan Glaspell, and Edna St. Vincent Millay were first presented. However, this series changes focus by devoting its efforts to development of new works for children, youth and family audiences written by both NYU students and noted authors in New York City, the US, and abroad. Keeping with the goals of the Program in Educational Theatre, our series offers both students and theatre professionals the opportunity to test new ideas and methods within the field of TYA (Theatre for Young Audiences).    In conjunction with the series, the Program in Educational Theatre runs a graduate course, Theatre Practices : Problems in Play Production, the Development of New Plays, which studies theories and methods of play development utilizing the series as a laboratory. Students in the class both observe rehearsals and interact with the playwrights, directors, and dramaturgs over the course of the series.    2015 Season    New Plays for Young Audiences will present rehearsed readings of three new plays for young audiences June 6 &ndash; 21 at the Provincetown Playhouse. An audience discussion with the playwright and director will follow the Sunday readings. All tickets are free.    Mario and the Comet that Stopped the World Book and Lyrics by Gabriel Jason Dean, Music by David Dabbon. The Venedicci Comet is headed straight toward Earth. Apocalyptics predict that it will strike, causing total annihilation; while most scientists speculate it will be a near-miss and Earthlings will behold history&rsquo;s most awe-inspiring celestial event. Either way, Mario is prepared. With a chorus of rubber ducks and soaring songs about the theory of relativity, Mario and the Comet that Stopped the World is a musical adventure-comedy about how loss can be like an earth-shattering comet; but when faced together as a family, it can become a thing of beauty&mdash; a celebration of life and love. Readings are on Saturday, June 6, TBD, and Sunday, June 7, at 3:00 p.m. Courtney Sale directs. For ages 8 and up.    Gabriel Jason Dean &rsquo;s plays have been produced or developed at New York Theatre Workshop, McCarter, The Flea, Oregon Shakespeare, Kennedy Center, Dallas Children&rsquo;s Theatre, and others.

Her mom is worried, her older sister is frustrated and her friends think she is weird. Unbeknownst to them all, Nadine finds her voice in the imaginary world of her coloring book, where her father is alive and she is happy once again. Ultimately, not everything is as it seems and Nadine must decide if she will accept the truth or stay in her coloring book world forever.

In the end, Forever discovers the importance of family, friends, and place. Readings are on Saturday, June 20, TBD, and Sunday, June 21, at 3:00 p.m. Laurie Woolery directs. For ages 9 and up.

Public readings are performed each weekend with a discussion following each Sunday matinee. Our work honors the history of the Provincetown Playhouse where the early plays of Eugene O&rsquo;Neill, Susan Glaspell, and Edna St. Vincent Millay were first presented. However, this series changes focus by devoting its efforts to development of new works for children, youth and family audiences written by both NYU students and noted authors in New York City, the US, and abroad. Keeping with the goals of the Program in Educational Theatre, our series offers both students and theatre professionals the opportunity to test new ideas and methods within the field of TYA (Theatre for Young Audiences).    In conjunction with the series, the Program in Educational Theatre runs a graduate course, Theatre Practices : Problems in Play Production, the Development of New Plays, which studies theories and methods of play development utilizing the series as a laboratory. Students in the class both observe rehearsals and interact with the playwrights, directors, and dramaturgs over the course of the series.    2015 Season    New Plays for Young Audiences will present rehearsed readings of three new plays for young audiences June 6 &ndash; 21 at the Provincetown Playhouse. An audience discussion with the playwright and director will follow the Sunday readings. All tickets are free.    Mario and the Comet that Stopped the World Book and Lyrics by Gabriel Jason Dean, Music by David Dabbon. The Venedicci Comet is headed straight toward Earth. Apocalyptics predict that it will strike, causing total annihilation; while most scientists speculate it will be a near-miss and Earthlings will behold history&rsquo;s most awe-inspiring celestial event. Either way, Mario is prepared. With a chorus of rubber ducks and soaring songs about the theory of relativity, Mario and the Comet that Stopped the World is a musical adventure-comedy about how loss can be like an earth-shattering comet; but when faced together as a family, it can become a thing of beauty&mdash; a celebration of life and love. Readings are on Saturday, June 6, TBD, and Sunday, June 7, at 3:00 p.m. Courtney Sale directs. For ages 8 and up.    Gabriel Jason Dean &rsquo;s plays have been produced or developed at New York Theatre Workshop, McCarter, The Flea, Oregon Shakespeare, Kennedy Center, Dallas Children&rsquo;s Theatre, and others.

Taking into account the cultural and economic impact of the visual arts, nationally and internationally, as well as the challenges facing the arts today, the program prepares students to become leaders in a broad range of arts organizations. The Visual Arts Administration MA program addresses the whole art ecology, including the cultural environment in which art and arts organizations operate; the role of the artist in society; how artwork is documented, presented and interpreted; the structure and management of organizations that display artwork &ndash; both non-profit and for-profit; and the role of art theorists, critics, curators, and collectors. The program curriculum also considers how education in arts organizations expands knowledge and builds audiences, the increasing role of art in urban development and public spaces, and new approaches and tools for encouraging access and participation. A strong emphasis is placed on acquiring the theoretical and practical tools for fundraising, financial management, marketing and knowledge of new media and technology in the visual arts. While the program is primarily oriented toward the non-profit segment of the field, it also offers a strong for-profit concentration. Emphasis is placed on collaboration across the visual arts administration field. The program takes advantage of its position in New York City to utilize the variety of arts organizations and professionals available through case studies, focus groups, site visits and examples of theory applied to practice. Using the program's extensive internship and alumni networks allows students access to a wide range of individuals and organizations in the field and increases the depth of their understanding of the complexities of this challenging area. Since its beginnings, the program has taken an extensive and integrated international outlook. The curriculum fosters a global perspective within course readings and discussions, and through several study abroad options. In London, for example, students analyze the exhibition and display of art in material culture through a dynamic curriculum that blends classroom sessions and site visits. In the Netherlands and Berlin, Performing Arts Administration and Visual Arts Administration students compare and contrast the management of cultural institutions in the U.S. and Europe, with an emphasis on cultural policy, cultural diplomacy, funding mechanisms, globalism and mobility, and cultural identity and diversity.    Student Learning Outcomes    Upon completion of our program, our students will:       Demonstrate an understanding of the creative process, how art and artists function in society    Analyze the economic, political and social environment in which artists and arts organizations operate, including legal, ethical and policy issues    Identify and evaluate how artwork is interpreted, presented, documented and archived    Critique and compare the structure, operations and management of organizations that present or produce artwork on various scales    Outline strategies for marketing, audience development, outreach and community development in the arts    Acquire business skills in accounting, finance, organizational theory and management as well as arts-related media and technology    Develop an expansive and inclusive world view of the field that values different global perspectives, identities, concerns and goals       For More Information    Grad Info Night Wednesday, October 29 6-8 pm 34 Stuyvesant Street Please RSVP .
