Reynolds Foundation                                                     The mission of the Catherine B. Reynolds Foundation is to help educate young people, to inspire them to believe in      their power to make a difference as individuals, and to motivate them to reach their greatest potential as      citizens and productive members of society.                  Catherine B. Reynolds brings to the world of philanthropy the same energy and entrepreneurial spirit that ensured      her success in the realm of commerce. As the leader of two businesses, Mrs. Reynolds created a new and affordable      way for Americans to finance a college education. A bold, innovative thinker, she developed a privately-funded      alternative to government student loan programs. Through her vision and perseverance, hundreds of thousands of      Americans have been able to attend the college of their choice. In only one decade, this creative approach to      private educational financing revolutionized student lending and spawned a multibillion-dollar industry of 65      lenders offering more than 200 financial products.                  Presently, Mrs. Reynolds devotes her time and abilities primarily to philanthropic pursuits as the creator and      chairman of one of the largest foundations in the nation.
