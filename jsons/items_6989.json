FALL 2012 MAP-UA 722 Expressive Culture: Architecture in New York Field Study Prof. Broderick (Art History) syllabus New York's rich architectural heritage offers a unique opportunity for firsthand consideration of the concepts and styles of modern urban architecture, as well as its social, financial, and cultural contexts. Meets once a week for an extended period combining on-campus lectures with group excursions to prominent buildings. Attention is given both to individual buildings as examples of 19th- and 20th-century architecture and to phenomena such as the development of the skyscraper and the adaptation of older buildings to new uses.    FALL 2012 MAP-UA 730 Expressive Culture: Sounds Prof. Samuels (Music) Our lives pulsate with patterns of sounds that we call music. We encounter these sounds in our homes, cars, stores, and exercise salons; they accompany us to the grocery store, the dentist's office, and the movies; yet we rarely think consciously about what they mean. Through a series of specific case studies we investigate the function and significance of music and the musician in human life. We raise basic questions about how music has been created, produced, perceived, and evaluated at diverse historical moments, in a variety of geographical locations, and among different cultural groups. Through aural explorations and discussion of how these vivid worlds \"sound\" in time and space, we assess the value of music in human experience.    FALL 2012 MAP-UA 730 Expressive Culture: Sounds  Prof. Ninoshvili (Music) syllabus Language and music are complementary modes of socio-cultural expression and communication with a nexus in the human voice. Ethnomusicologists have posited four key themes in the study of their intersection: music as language, music about language, language about music, and sung vocalization (music in language and language in music). We explore a broad spectrum of practices and ideas pertaining to the intersections of language, music, and the voice historically and across cultures. Specific cases include the relationship of vocal style, timbre, inflection, and lyric choice to place, identity, and musical genre; sung language in ritual and ecstatic religious experience; speech surrogates (for example, \"talking\" drums and whistle speech), jazz scat, \"vocables,\" and other phenomena which blur the speech-song divide; and the techniques, aesthetics, and ethics of the technologically mediated sung voice.     FALL 2012 MAP-UA 740 Expressive Culture: Performance Prof. Meineck (Classics/Aquila Theatre Company) syllabus Why do we still go to the theatre to watch plays? What is it about drama that can often seem to express so much about the tensions and stresses found in a given culture? Why does classical drama in particular continue to be performed and speak to so many different audiences? What is a classical play and how do theater artists interpret them for contemporary spectators, and why have so many works of drama been used to reflect the social, political, and economic situations of peoples all over the world? We explore the cultural significance of classical theater and how and why it continues to be performed today. We examine theater from four distinct period--ancient Athens, Elizabethan London, early modern Europe, and contemporary America--focusing on plays that are still regularly performed on contemporary stages. Students also take part in readings, exercises, and demonstrations, but they do not need to have any acting or performance ability.    FALL 2012 MAP-UA 750 Expressive Culture: Film Prof. Guerrero (Cinema Studies) syllabus A range of films made by, for, and about black Americans in popular commercial cinema covering a range of black-focused films and film making practices over the past one hundred years, from the crude racial provocations of Birth of a Nation (1915), to an 'entertaining blackness' expressed in such films as Cabin in the Sky (1943), Blaxploitation's brilliant industry intervention and moment, the challenge of independent black narratives like Killer of Sheep (1977) and Bless Their Little Hearts (1984), \u2018crossover\u2019 commercially ambitious films like Soul Food (1997) or Paid in Full (1997), and on to viewing break through masterworks like Do the Right Thing (1989).   SPRING 2013 MAP-UA 711 Expressive Culture: The Graphic Novel Prof. Borenstein (Russian and Slavic Studies)  syllabus Examines the interplay between words and images in the graphic novel, a hybrid medium with a system of communication reminiscent of prose fiction, animation, and film. What is the connection between text and art? How are internal psychology, time, and action conveyed in a static series of words and pictures? What can the graphic novel convey that other media cannot? Authors include Alan Moore, Art Spiegelman, Peter Milligan, Charles Burns, Carla Speed McNeil.     SPRING 2013 MAP-UA 720 Expressive Culture: Images Prof. Silver (Art History) Avant-Garde New York, from the Armory Show to Andy Warhol. New York became the center of avant-garde art-making in the period just after the Second World War, although the city had been preparing for its modernist ascendancy since the early years of the 20th century. We focus on art and its makers--native New Yorkers and out-of-towners, Americans and foreign-born practitioners--who helped shape and refine New York\u2019s extraordinarily rich avant-garde \u201ctradition.\u201d Painters, sculptors, photographers, architects, graphic artists, and set designers will be studied, including Alfred Stieglitz, Raymond Hood, Charles Demuth, Paul Manship, Piet Mondrian, Joseph Cornell, Helen Levitt, Isamu Noguchi, Jackson Pollock, Louise Nevelson, Robert Rauschenberg, Jasper Johns, Philip Johnson, and Andy Warhol, as will the context in which their work came into being and flourished--museums, galleries, art schools, patrons, artist neighborhoods, professional organizations, ad hoc associations, and artist \u201changouts.\u201d Topics include: the Stieglitz Circle and 291; The Armory Show (1913); the Paris/New York connection; the founding of the Museum of Modern Art; Marcel Duchamp and New York Dada; the art of the Harlem Renaissance; Frank O\u2019Hara--poet, critic, curator; Street Photography; the birth of Abstract Expressionism; Avant-gardism in Washington Square--Judson Dance Theater; From Madison Avenue to 57th Street--Pop Art Emerges. Includes class excursions to museums, galleries, and other New York art sites. SPRING 2013 MAP-UA 721 Expressive Culture: Painting and Sculpture in New York Field Study Prof. Broderick (Art History) New York's public art collections contain important examples of painting and sculpture from almost every phase of the past, as well as some of the world's foremost works of contemporary art. Meets once a week for an extended period combining on-campus lectures with group excursions to the museums or other locations where these works are exhibited.

SPRING 2013 MAP-UA 750 Expressive Cultures: Film  Prof. Polan (Cinema Studies)  syllabus Hollywood, 1967: American film was at a crossroads, mired in confusion about the best direction to pursue to resonate with the populace: stylistic conventionality or bold experimentation?, classical story-telling or modernist deconstruction of fundamental narrative?, escapism and light diversion or liberal agenda (or even more radical confrontation)? Extending the focus on that vexed but also culturally rich and diverse year, we explore American society and its culture through cinema (with a side look at some other cultural forms--1967 is, for instance, also the year of that key rock album, The Beatles\u2019 Sgt. Pepper\u2019s Lonely Heart\u2019s Club Band), pinpointing basic conventions of narrative film-making (and narrative stylistics) and how conventions undergo pressure in moments of social upheaval.        SPRING 2013 MAP-UA 761 Expressive Cultures: La Belle \u00c9 poque  Prof. Ertman (Sociology)   syllabus   La Belle \u00c9poque , that period in the life of France\u2019s pre-World War I Third Republic (1871-1914) associated with extraordinary artistic achievement, not only saw Paris emerge as the undisputed Western capital of painting and sculpture, it also was the most important production site for new works of musical theater and, arguably, literature as well. It was during these decades that Impressionism launched its assault on the academic establishment, only itself to be superseded by an ever-changing avant-garde associated first with the nabis, then with fauvism and cubism; that the operas of Bizet, Saint-Sa\u00ebns and Massenet and the plays of Sardou and Rostand filled the world\u2019s theaters; and that the novels of Zola and stories of Maupassant were translated into dozens of languages. Finally, this was the society that gave birth to one of the greatest literary works of all time, Marcel Proust\u2019s Remembrances of Things Past, the first volume of which appeared just as the First World War was about to bring the Belle \u00c9poque to a violent end. Sources include reproductions of paintings, recordings of chamber music, opera and m\u00e9lodies, and several of the most significant novels of the period.         top of page          Courses           Quantitative Reasoning           Natural Science I           Natural Science II           Texts and Ideas           Cultures and Contexts           Societies and the Social Sciences           Expressive Culture           Study Away                       Contact Us | &copy; New York University , Arts and Science"}]},

The M.A. and Ph.D. programs offer a broad-based intellectual, critical, and aesthetic foundation along with opportunities for frequent collaboration among scholars, actors, directors, playwrights, designers, and performance and new media artists -- in the classroom and in production. Graduate students may serve as dramaturgs and literary-historical resource people on M.F.A. creative projects. New York University, Tisch School of the Arts, Department of Performance Studies http://www.nyu.edu/tisch/performance/ The Department of Performance Studies offers the first MA/Ph.D. program in the world to focus on performance as the object of analysis. Using performance as an organizing concept, we study a broad spectrum of performances from postmodern dance and Hip Hop to political rallies, Butoh, and vaudeville. Although we are primarily an academic program, students can integrate theory and practice in such workshops and courses as performance composition, performance writing, dramaturgy, theories of directing, and performance and technology. Northwestern University, School of Communication, Performance Studies http://www.communication.northwestern.edu/performancestudies/ Performance Studies has at its center the written and spoken word, gesture and image, text and body, performance and analysis. Historically grounded in the oral interpretation of poetry and fiction, Performance Studies as an evolving practice seeks to engage performance at every front, to open and broaden the definition of performance and the texts that prompt them, to explore performance practices and test the ground on which they rest. Roehampton Univeristy of Surrey, UK, Performance Studies http://www.roehampton.ac.uk/pg/ps/ The MA/MRes Performance Studies programmes have an identity and profile distinct from existing provision in the field. Their particular research and critical agendas stage a timely intervention in the international direction of the discipline. The perspectives they mobilise, and their engagement with questions of performance and space, ethics, cultural politics and critical practices, provide a unique and stimulating programme of study for the student who wishes to address the discipline at its cutting edge. The Scarborough School of Arts, UK, Performance Studies http://www.scar.hull.ac.uk/arts/performance/perf_studies.htm The program is practical as well as theoretical, encouraging engagement in issues pertinent to the complex and changing world in which you live. Importance is given to making art as a reaction to and communication in culture through processes of collaboration alongside evolving independent practice. A core series of Performance Studies modules establishes the theoretical and practical connections that address 21st century performance as a cultural phenomenon and ensure educational coherence. The core provides introduction and practise in the activities, theories and politics of performance including the skills of collaboration in art making processes. University of California, Berkeley, Department of Theatre, Dance and Performance Studies http://ls.berkeley.edu/dept/theater/ The program is an unusually flexible one, designed to prepare students for advanced research in the field of theater and performance studies. The program at Berkeley draws its strengths from a Graduate Group of faculty in disciplines ranging across a host of fields and departments; we encourage students to take the initiative in developing a program of coursework that will lead both to a solid command of a given field and to the kind of interdisciplinary research characteristic of the strongest work in theater and performance studies today. University of Mainz, Germany, PhD Program in Performance and Media Studies http://www.performedia.uni-mainz.de The University of Mainz, together with the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD) and the German Research Association (DFG), has launched an international doctoral program in Performance and Media Studies (Theater, Film and Television). The program is designed to support interdisciplinary doctoral research at an internationally competitive level in the fields of theatre, drama, performance, film, television and the new media. The program offers a unique combination of intensive individual supervision by the local program-faculty and an internationally oriented and interdisciplinary course-program within a network of seven international partner-institutions. University of Maryland, Ph. D. in Theater and Performance Studies http://www.theatre.umd.edu/Graduate/PhD.htm The Ph.D is an interdisciplinary degree that prepares teachers and scholars of theatre and performance studies. The program offers students two interrelated areas of concentration: 1) history & theory of theatre and drama 2) theatre and performance studies. Area studies in the history and theory of drama and theatre focus primarily on developments in Western theatre practice and dramatic literature. Area studies in theatre and performance studies focus on a broad spectrum of international and American performance traditions as seen through a flexible framework of interdisciplinary methodologies. Although points of intersection are inevitable between traditional study of theatre and drama and the evolving field of performance studies, the latter is distinguished by its broadly conceived definitions of performance. University of Sydney, the School of Society, Culture and Performance http://www.arts.usyd.edu.au/departs/perform/ University of Wales, Aberystwyth, Department of Theatre, Film and Television Studies, in conjunction with the Center for Performance Research http://www.aber.ac.uk/publications/ug/tfts/performance-modules.html The program is organized by three individual modules: Principles of Performance 1, 2, and Performance in Context. The module is comprised of 10 one-and-a-half hour lectures and two one-and-a-half hour seminars related to your assessment assignments. The object of the module is to provide working definitions of the phenomenon of performance, provide an introduction to the field of performance theory, to examine approaches to the analysis of performative behaviours and non-textual genres of performance and to encourage practical initiatives in the area of conceiving performance. top Institutes, Centers, Professional Associations Center for Performance Research, University of Wales, Aberystwyth http://www.thecpr.org.uk/ Established in 1988, by Richard Gough and Judie Christie, the Centre for Performance Research is a theatre organization based in Wales and working internationally. It produces: innovative performance work; arranges workshops, conferences, lectures and master classes; collaborates and exchanges with theatre companies of international significance; publishes and distributes theatre books and runs a multi-cultural performance resource centre that encourages international exchange. The Center publishes the journal Performance Research. Hemispheric Institute for Performance and Politics, New York University http://www.hemi.nyu.edu/ Hemispheric Institute draws on the emerging discipline of Performance Studies to foster intellectual and artistic relationships across boundaries of geography, institutions, languages, and academic disciplines. Studying performance in its myriad manifestations (as act, as masquerade, as intervention), scholars, activists and artists can analyze the ways in which performance is used to communicate social or religious values, to elicit identification, or to forge a sense of community. But politics itself also provides a rich arena for performance analysis: electoral politics, populism, protest movements, military parades, and mass rallies are just a few of the spectacles that can be best analyzed using a performative lens. The Institute thus explores the ways in which performance and politics are mutually formative: performance as a practice of politics, politics as a mode of performance. International Directory of Performing Arts collections and Institutions http://www.theatrelibrary.org/sibmas/idpac/ Performance Studies Focus Group http://www.ihc.ucsb.edu/research/rfgs/performance.html PSi Performance Studies International http://www.psi-web.org/ PSi PERFORMANCE STUDIES international is a professional association founded in 1997 to promote communication and exchange among scholars and practitioners working in the field of performance studies.

Through a series of specific case studies we investigate the function and significance of music and the musician in human life. We raise basic questions about how music has been created, produced, perceived, and evaluated at diverse historical moments, in a variety of geographical locations, and among different cultural groups.

Specific cases include the relationship of vocal style, timbre, inflection, and lyric choice to place, identity, and musical genre; sung language in ritual and ecstatic religious experience; speech surrogates (for example, \"talking\" drums and whistle speech), jazz scat, \"vocables,\" and other phenomena which blur the speech-song divide; and the techniques, aesthetics, and ethics of the technologically mediated sung voice.     FALL 2012 MAP-UA 740 Expressive Culture: Performance Prof. Meineck (Classics/Aquila Theatre Company) syllabus Why do we still go to the theatre to watch plays? What is it about drama that can often seem to express so much about the tensions and stresses found in a given culture? Why does classical drama in particular continue to be performed and speak to so many different audiences? What is a classical play and how do theater artists interpret them for contemporary spectators, and why have so many works of drama been used to reflect the social, political, and economic situations of peoples all over the world? We explore the cultural significance of classical theater and how and why it continues to be performed today. We examine theater from four distinct period--ancient Athens, Elizabethan London, early modern Europe, and contemporary America--focusing on plays that are still regularly performed on contemporary stages. Students also take part in readings, exercises, and demonstrations, but they do not need to have any acting or performance ability.    FALL 2012 MAP-UA 750 Expressive Culture: Film Prof. Guerrero (Cinema Studies) syllabus A range of films made by, for, and about black Americans in popular commercial cinema covering a range of black-focused films and film making practices over the past one hundred years, from the crude racial provocations of Birth of a Nation (1915), to an 'entertaining blackness' expressed in such films as Cabin in the Sky (1943), Blaxploitation's brilliant industry intervention and moment, the challenge of independent black narratives like Killer of Sheep (1977) and Bless Their Little Hearts (1984), \u2018crossover\u2019 commercially ambitious films like Soul Food (1997) or Paid in Full (1997), and on to viewing break through masterworks like Do the Right Thing (1989).   SPRING 2013 MAP-UA 711 Expressive Culture: The Graphic Novel Prof. Borenstein (Russian and Slavic Studies)  syllabus Examines the interplay between words and images in the graphic novel, a hybrid medium with a system of communication reminiscent of prose fiction, animation, and film. What is the connection between text and art? How are internal psychology, time, and action conveyed in a static series of words and pictures? What can the graphic novel convey that other media cannot? Authors include Alan Moore, Art Spiegelman, Peter Milligan, Charles Burns, Carla Speed McNeil.     SPRING 2013 MAP-UA 720 Expressive Culture: Images Prof. Silver (Art History) Avant-Garde New York, from the Armory Show to Andy Warhol. New York became the center of avant-garde art-making in the period just after the Second World War, although the city had been preparing for its modernist ascendancy since the early years of the 20th century. We focus on art and its makers--native New Yorkers and out-of-towners, Americans and foreign-born practitioners--who helped shape and refine New York\u2019s extraordinarily rich avant-garde \u201ctradition.\u201d Painters, sculptors, photographers, architects, graphic artists, and set designers will be studied, including Alfred Stieglitz, Raymond Hood, Charles Demuth, Paul Manship, Piet Mondrian, Joseph Cornell, Helen Levitt, Isamu Noguchi, Jackson Pollock, Louise Nevelson, Robert Rauschenberg, Jasper Johns, Philip Johnson, and Andy Warhol, as will the context in which their work came into being and flourished--museums, galleries, art schools, patrons, artist neighborhoods, professional organizations, ad hoc associations, and artist \u201changouts.\u201d Topics include: the Stieglitz Circle and 291; The Armory Show (1913); the Paris/New York connection; the founding of the Museum of Modern Art; Marcel Duchamp and New York Dada; the art of the Harlem Renaissance; Frank O\u2019Hara--poet, critic, curator; Street Photography; the birth of Abstract Expressionism; Avant-gardism in Washington Square--Judson Dance Theater; From Madison Avenue to 57th Street--Pop Art Emerges. Includes class excursions to museums, galleries, and other New York art sites. SPRING 2013 MAP-UA 721 Expressive Culture: Painting and Sculpture in New York Field Study Prof. Broderick (Art History) New York's public art collections contain important examples of painting and sculpture from almost every phase of the past, as well as some of the world's foremost works of contemporary art. Meets once a week for an extended period combining on-campus lectures with group excursions to the museums or other locations where these works are exhibited.  SPRING 2013 MAP-UA 730 Expressive Cultures: Sounds   Prof. Ninoshvili (Music)    syllabus *  Language and music are complementary modes of socio-cultural expression and communication with a nexus in the human voice. Ethnomusicologists have posited four key themes in the study of their intersection: music as language, music about language, language about music, and sung vocalization (music in language and language in music). We explore a broad spectrum of practices and ideas pertaining to the intersections of language, music, and the voice historically and across cultures. Specific cases include the relationship of vocal style, timbre, inflection, and lyric choice to place, identity, and musical genre; sung language in ritual and ecstatic religious experience; speech surrogates (for example, \"talking\" drums and whistle speech), jazz scat, \"vocables,\" and other phenomena which blur the speech-song divide; and the techniques, aesthetics, and ethics of the technologically mediated sung voice.   SPRING 2013 MAP-UA 750 Expressive Cultures: Film  Prof. Polan (Cinema Studies)  syllabus Hollywood, 1967: American film was at a crossroads, mired in confusion about the best direction to pursue to resonate with the populace: stylistic conventionality or bold experimentation?, classical story-telling or modernist deconstruction of fundamental narrative?, escapism and light diversion or liberal agenda (or even more radical confrontation)? Extending the focus on that vexed but also culturally rich and diverse year, we explore American society and its culture through cinema (with a side look at some other cultural forms--1967 is, for instance, also the year of that key rock album, The Beatles\u2019 Sgt. Pepper\u2019s Lonely Heart\u2019s Club Band), pinpointing basic conventions of narrative film-making (and narrative stylistics) and how conventions undergo pressure in moments of social upheaval.        SPRING 2013 MAP-UA 761 Expressive Cultures: La Belle \u00c9 poque  Prof. Ertman (Sociology)   syllabus   La Belle \u00c9poque , that period in the life of France\u2019s pre-World War I Third Republic (1871-1914) associated with extraordinary artistic achievement, not only saw Paris emerge as the undisputed Western capital of painting and sculpture, it also was the most important production site for new works of musical theater and, arguably, literature as well. It was during these decades that Impressionism launched its assault on the academic establishment, only itself to be superseded by an ever-changing avant-garde associated first with the nabis, then with fauvism and cubism; that the operas of Bizet, Saint-Sa\u00ebns and Massenet and the plays of Sardou and Rostand filled the world\u2019s theaters; and that the novels of Zola and stories of Maupassant were translated into dozens of languages. Finally, this was the society that gave birth to one of the greatest literary works of all time, Marcel Proust\u2019s Remembrances of Things Past, the first volume of which appeared just as the First World War was about to bring the Belle \u00c9poque to a violent end. Sources include reproductions of paintings, recordings of chamber music, opera and m\u00e9lodies, and several of the most significant novels of the period.         top of page          Courses           Quantitative Reasoning           Natural Science I           Natural Science II           Texts and Ideas           Cultures and Contexts           Societies and the Social Sciences           Expressive Culture           Study Away                       Contact Us | &copy; New York University , Arts and Science"}, {"content": "Performance Studies: Tisch School of the Arts at NYU                           Skip to content        Performance Studies About the Program Admissions BA Program MA Program PhD Program Course Offerings Admin &amp; Faculty Students Alumni PS Spotlights  News &amp; Events Projects &amp; Publications Blog Facebook  home &gt; Performance Studies        Academia - Performance Studies  Academic Programs Institutes, Centers, Professional Associations  top Academic Programs Brown University, Theatre and Performance Studies http://www.brown.edu/Departments/Theatre_Speech_Dance/Graduate_S... The M.A. and Ph.D. programs offer a broad-based intellectual, critical, and aesthetic foundation along with opportunities for frequent collaboration among scholars, actors, directors, playwrights, designers, and performance and new media artists -- in the classroom and in production. Graduate students may serve as dramaturgs and literary-historical resource people on M.F.A. creative projects. New York University, Tisch School of the Arts, Department of Performance Studies http://www.nyu.edu/tisch/performance/ The Department of Performance Studies offers the first MA/Ph.D. program in the world to focus on performance as the object of analysis. Using performance as an organizing concept, we study a broad spectrum of performances from postmodern dance and Hip Hop to political rallies, Butoh, and vaudeville. Although we are primarily an academic program, students can integrate theory and practice in such workshops and courses as performance composition, performance writing, dramaturgy, theories of directing, and performance and technology. Northwestern University, School of Communication, Performance Studies http://www.communication.northwestern.edu/performancestudies/ Performance Studies has at its center the written and spoken word, gesture and image, text and body, performance and analysis. Historically grounded in the oral interpretation of poetry and fiction, Performance Studies as an evolving practice seeks to engage performance at every front, to open and broaden the definition of performance and the texts that prompt them, to explore performance practices and test the ground on which they rest. Roehampton Univeristy of Surrey, UK, Performance Studies http://www.roehampton.ac.uk/pg/ps/ The MA/MRes Performance Studies programmes have an identity and profile distinct from existing provision in the field. Their particular research and critical agendas stage a timely intervention in the international direction of the discipline. The perspectives they mobilise, and their engagement with questions of performance and space, ethics, cultural politics and critical practices, provide a unique and stimulating programme of study for the student who wishes to address the discipline at its cutting edge. The Scarborough School of Arts, UK, Performance Studies http://www.scar.hull.ac.uk/arts/performance/perf_studies.htm The program is practical as well as theoretical, encouraging engagement in issues pertinent to the complex and changing world in which you live. Importance is given to making art as a reaction to and communication in culture through processes of collaboration alongside evolving independent practice. A core series of Performance Studies modules establishes the theoretical and practical connections that address 21st century performance as a cultural phenomenon and ensure educational coherence. The core provides introduction and practise in the activities, theories and politics of performance including the skills of collaboration in art making processes. University of California, Berkeley, Department of Theatre, Dance and Performance Studies http://ls.berkeley.edu/dept/theater/ The program is an unusually flexible one, designed to prepare students for advanced research in the field of theater and performance studies. The program at Berkeley draws its strengths from a Graduate Group of faculty in disciplines ranging across a host of fields and departments; we encourage students to take the initiative in developing a program of coursework that will lead both to a solid command of a given field and to the kind of interdisciplinary research characteristic of the strongest work in theater and performance studies today. University of Mainz, Germany, PhD Program in Performance and Media Studies http://www.performedia.uni-mainz.de The University of Mainz, together with the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD) and the German Research Association (DFG), has launched an international doctoral program in Performance and Media Studies (Theater, Film and Television). The program is designed to support interdisciplinary doctoral research at an internationally competitive level in the fields of theatre, drama, performance, film, television and the new media. The program offers a unique combination of intensive individual supervision by the local program-faculty and an internationally oriented and interdisciplinary course-program within a network of seven international partner-institutions. University of Maryland, Ph. D. in Theater and Performance Studies http://www.theatre.umd.edu/Graduate/PhD.htm The Ph.D is an interdisciplinary degree that prepares teachers and scholars of theatre and performance studies. The program offers students two interrelated areas of concentration: 1) history & theory of theatre and drama 2) theatre and performance studies. Area studies in the history and theory of drama and theatre focus primarily on developments in Western theatre practice and dramatic literature. Area studies in theatre and performance studies focus on a broad spectrum of international and American performance traditions as seen through a flexible framework of interdisciplinary methodologies. Although points of intersection are inevitable between traditional study of theatre and drama and the evolving field of performance studies, the latter is distinguished by its broadly conceived definitions of performance. University of Sydney, the School of Society, Culture and Performance http://www.arts.usyd.edu.au/departs/perform/ University of Wales, Aberystwyth, Department of Theatre, Film and Television Studies, in conjunction with the Center for Performance Research http://www.aber.ac.uk/publications/ug/tfts/performance-modules.html The program is organized by three individual modules: Principles of Performance 1, 2, and Performance in Context. The module is comprised of 10 one-and-a-half hour lectures and two one-and-a-half hour seminars related to your assessment assignments. The object of the module is to provide working definitions of the phenomenon of performance, provide an introduction to the field of performance theory, to examine approaches to the analysis of performative behaviours and non-textual genres of performance and to encourage practical initiatives in the area of conceiving performance. top Institutes, Centers, Professional Associations Center for Performance Research, University of Wales, Aberystwyth http://www.thecpr.org.uk/ Established in 1988, by Richard Gough and Judie Christie, the Centre for Performance Research is a theatre organization based in Wales and working internationally. It produces: innovative performance work; arranges workshops, conferences, lectures and master classes; collaborates and exchanges with theatre companies of international significance; publishes and distributes theatre books and runs a multi-cultural performance resource centre that encourages international exchange. The Center publishes the journal Performance Research. Hemispheric Institute for Performance and Politics, New York University http://www.hemi.nyu.edu/ Hemispheric Institute draws on the emerging discipline of Performance Studies to foster intellectual and artistic relationships across boundaries of geography, institutions, languages, and academic disciplines. Studying performance in its myriad manifestations (as act, as masquerade, as intervention), scholars, activists and artists can analyze the ways in which performance is used to communicate social or religious values, to elicit identification, or to forge a sense of community. But politics itself also provides a rich arena for performance analysis: electoral politics, populism, protest movements, military parades, and mass rallies are just a few of the spectacles that can be best analyzed using a performative lens. The Institute thus explores the ways in which performance and politics are mutually formative: performance as a practice of politics, politics as a mode of performance.

We will consider the conceptualization       and design of research projects in the context of theoretical and ethical       issues and in relation to particular research methods and writing strategies.       You will develop practical skills related to archival and library research,       ethnographic approaches, including participant observation and interviewing,       documentation and analysis of live performance, and analysis of documents       of various kinds, including visual material. Readings will address the       history of ideas, practices, and images of objectivity, as well as of       reflexive and interpretive approaches, relationships between science and       art, and research perspectives arising from minoritarian and postcolonial       experiences. You are encouraged to bring projects to the course, especially       ones that might develop into dissertations.              Work for the course will include weekly readings, written responses to       the readings that are to be posted to the electronic forum, and exercises.       At the end of the semester, you will submit a portfolio of all your work,       together with a letter reflecting on the work your did, your goals, what       you feel you accomplished, and what you want to continue to work on.

Reflecting on the readings, position yourself in relation to your research.      First,       write a brief statement that explains your relationship to your research       subject and the implications of this relationship for the research       you will do. Define your &#147;position,&#148; account for it, and       identify the possibilities and constraints of your positionality.       Explains how you are approaching the question of positionality,      that is, treat the issue &#147;metamethodologically.&#148;            2. Reflect       on the challenges and possibilities of &#147;description&#148; as       Visweswaran and Katz outline them. Show how you will convert your       why questions into how questions. Why does Katz propose that research       focus on how questions? What is the path that he traces for getting       from description to explanation? In what ways might the approaches       of Visweswaran and Katz be useful for your project ?             Recommended             Abu-Lughod, L. 2000. Locating ethnography .

Finding a person to interview and      making contact with that person is part of the research process. Use      networks and, in the case of strangers, have a contact person make the      introduction.        2. Schedule      the interview, arrange permission to audio or videotape the interview,      and secure an audio recorder or video camera. Be sensitive to the possibility      that recording may discourage the person from being interviewed. As a      courtesy, consider offering to give the individual a copy of the the recording.                3. Based on the readings-- and reflecting on them --state the goals      of the interview. What do you hope to elicit in the interview and to what      end?           4. Develop a checklist for the interview. Of the approaches offered in      the readings, which will you use and why?           Recommended           Arksey, Hilary, and Peter Knight, eds. 1999.

Identify a setting and/or event that you will observe between now and 11/11. Make a checklist of what you will want to pay attention to.      2.  In light of that choice (and in relation to your dissertation project), w hich options in Writing Ethnographic Fieldnotes do you anticipate might work best for you and why? Consider notetaking, writing up notes, coding (give examples related either to your research project or to the observation exercise that you will do by 11/11), and writing the final account, whether or not it is an ethnography .

Take notes and write them up along the lines proposed by Emerson.      3.      Reflect on your actual process of taking fieldnotes (jottings) and of writing them up.

Pay special attention       to the various ways that she articulates (as a stated goal and in       the actual analysis) the relationship between a microanalysis       of music, its production, performance, and experience, on the one       hand, and a macroanalysis of the industry and larger political       contexts and struggles on the other. How, precisely, does she move       between these levels of attention and analysis?              2.

Reading guidelines and assignment             While visual culture encompasses more than images and images encompass more than photography, we are focusing on photography because of all the visual sources you are likely use photography is chief among them. But there are other compelling reasons as well, not least of which the ontology of photography and its evidentiary status.                 The readings for this week run the gamut from the most practical (the photograph as an historical artifact and historical source) to the most philosophical (a range of approaches to the ontology and phenomenology of photography) and address modes of attention and a range of aesthetic, social, scientific, and political practices, historical and contemporary. These authors also attend to a wide range of photographic genres, including studio portraits, family snapshots, mug shots, &ldquo;documentary&rdquo; or &ldquo;scientific&rdquo; photographs, and dance photography as an art form in its own right. Finally, there is the distinction between photographs that you find, with or without any information about them, and those that you will make&mdash;and in both cases how you will understand what they are, how to analyze them, and what to do with them. There are also the photographs that you may encourage your subjects to make and there is photo elicitation.              (1) How do these authors address the question of evidence with respect to photography?            (2) Identify specific methods and methodological issues in the readings. How might they be relevant to your work?            (3) Illustrate your response by analyzing one of Greenfield's dance images and a second image, either an image related to your project or one from your own family. Please bring the image to class. If you can insert the image into your blog, please do so. If not (and if you can email the image to me), I will insert it for you.
