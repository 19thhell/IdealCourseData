Check out the online preview, available on the housing portal .     Phase 2: Room Selection is the process by which students are given the opportunity to select a room online from the available housing inventory. Selection times are determined randomly within priority groups. Students submitting names together (for room, suite or hall placement) will have individual priorities averaged to create one group priority.   The Phase 2 Room Selection will take place between March 30, 2015 and April 3, 2015.   Due to the high demand for NYU Housing, not all students may be able to select a space during the Phase 2: Room Selection. The Office of Residential Life and Housing Services will administratively assign students who are unable to select their room over the summer. In this situation, students are still committed to the full terms of the housing license as outlined in the key components of the process . Students should re-review the 2015-2016 proposed housing rates prior to the start of Phase 2.     The Room Selection step can only be accessed through the housing application portal on your NYUHome account. There you will find the &quot;Housing Forms Log-In&quot; channel on the NYU Life page. Click on the &quot;Student Housing and Meal Plan Forms&quot; link and follow the University login prompts to access the application portal. Once in the portal, you may access the housing re-application by clicking the &quot;Application&quot; link in the grey navigation bar. You will want to select the &quot;Academic Year 2015-2016&quot; application. Once in the application, you will be able to readily access Phase 2.         RESIDENCE HALL AVAILABILITY   (Hall availability is subject to change.)

Please make note the special interest programs in the following buildings.     Broome Street will house the Residential College program.   Seventh Street will house the Green House program.   West 13th Street will house the Senior House Program            SELECTION TIME NOTIFICATION   Room Selection times are determined by a randomized sorting within priority categories. Students who have registered in a group will have individual priorities averaged to create one group priority.   Students will be notified by 5pm on March 27, 2015 (date subject to change) via their NYUHome account of the specific date and time that they will be able to access the Room Selection step, view the available inventory, and select a room. Students will be able to access the Room Selection step through the Housing Forms Channel at NYUHome .   While students are not required to choose an assignment at their selection time, other students will continue to be rolled into the selection pool, making it likely that there will be fewer spaces as the process continues. The process will be open through 5:00pm EST on April 3, 2015, as space permits, for students to make a room selection for next year.       SELECTION TIMES     The selection times are randomly generated based on students\u2019 individual priority or averaged group priority (if a student has registered with a group in Phase 1).   Students participating in Explorations programs, the Green House, the International House, the Senior House, or the Residential College will only be able to select within the program to which they were accepted.   Students participating in the Residential College will begin selecting on Monday, March 30, 2015 (date subject to change) .   The general student room selection process (including Explorations programs, the Green House, the International House, and the Senior House) will begin on Tuesday, March 31, 2015 (date subject to change) .   Once selection times are determined, timetables will be provided to give students a better idea about where their selection time falls within the overall process.

When you access the Phase 2 step, you will be able to browse through the available inventory and select a room. Once your room has been confirmed, it cannot be changed. Be sure to make your selection carefully. Students can access the Phase 2: Room Selection step in the Academic Year 2015-2016 application via the Housing Forms channel at NYUHome .     SELECTING AS A GROUP   All individuals within a group can log in and select independently OR allow the Group Leader to select for them. Only the Group Leader can select for other group members. The Group Leader may only select spaces for group members within the same suite or floor.   As space becomes limited, groups may be forced to split apart. If possible, all group members are encouraged to be together to assist the Group Leader with selection decisions. It is critical that group members discuss options and alternatives. Once an assignment is confirmed, it cannot be changed.   If the Group Leader does not assign all members of the group, the unassigned members are responsible for individually assigning themselves anytime after their group selection time but prior to April 3, 2015. Students can access the Academic Year 2015-2016 application via the Housing Forms channel at NYUHome .     CONSOLIDATION POLICY   In an effort to create more housing options for incoming and existing residents, ensure equity, and maximize use of available space, the University will actively seek to consolidate vacancies within the University Housing system. Students that are assigned to partially vacant rooms may be reassigned. This means that the hall, room, and/or roommates you select now may be changed if necessary for consolidation purposes. Consolidation may occur prior to check-in or during the academic year and students may be reassigned to other rooms, floors, or residence halls where necessary.       POST SELECTION ROOM CHANGE PROCESS   Students who are dissatisfied with their room selection may submit a Post Selection Room Change Request. Students must select a space in Phase 2 in order to be considered in the Post Selection Room Change process. The online room change form will be available on March 30, 2015 through May 15, 2015.                          Important Updates   Room selection for 2015-2016 is now closed.

Check out the online preview, available on the housing portal .     Phase 2: Room Selection is the process by which students are given the opportunity to select a room online from the available housing inventory. Selection times are determined randomly within priority groups. Students submitting names together (for room, suite or hall placement) will have individual priorities averaged to create one group priority.   The Phase 2 Room Selection will take place between March 30, 2015 and April 3, 2015.   Due to the high demand for NYU Housing, not all students may be able to select a space during the Phase 2: Room Selection. The Office of Residential Life and Housing Services will administratively assign students who are unable to select their room over the summer. In this situation, students are still committed to the full terms of the housing license as outlined in the key components of the process . Students should re-review the 2015-2016 proposed housing rates prior to the start of Phase 2.     The Room Selection step can only be accessed through the housing application portal on your NYUHome account. There you will find the &quot;Housing Forms Log-In&quot; channel on the NYU Life page. Click on the &quot;Student Housing and Meal Plan Forms&quot; link and follow the University login prompts to access the application portal. Once in the portal, you may access the housing re-application by clicking the &quot;Application&quot; link in the grey navigation bar. You will want to select the &quot;Academic Year 2015-2016&quot; application. Once in the application, you will be able to readily access Phase 2.         RESIDENCE HALL AVAILABILITY   (Hall availability is subject to change.)        Brooklyn Halls   Clark Hall  Othmer Hall (limited availability)      Manhattan Halls   Alumni Hall  Broome Street Coral Tower  Carlyle Court (towers 2 &amp; 3) Gramercy Green Greenwich Hall  Lafayette Street Palladium Hall Second Street  Seventh Street West 13th Street University Hall (limited availability)  Fall Only:     Affina Manhattan Carlyle (tower 1)       Most buildings will have a number of spaces withheld from general room selection for pre-designated Explorations and Special Interest Programs.   Please make note the special interest programs in the following buildings.     Broome Street will house the Residential College program.   Seventh Street will house the Green House program.   West 13th Street will house the Senior House Program            SELECTION TIME NOTIFICATION   Room Selection times are determined by a randomized sorting within priority categories. Students who have registered in a group will have individual priorities averaged to create one group priority.   Students will be notified by 5pm on March 27, 2015 (date subject to change) via their NYUHome account of the specific date and time that they will be able to access the Room Selection step, view the available inventory, and select a room. Students will be able to access the Room Selection step through the Housing Forms Channel at NYUHome .   While students are not required to choose an assignment at their selection time, other students will continue to be rolled into the selection pool, making it likely that there will be fewer spaces as the process continues. The process will be open through 5:00pm EST on April 3, 2015, as space permits, for students to make a room selection for next year.       SELECTION TIMES     The selection times are randomly generated based on students\u2019 individual priority or averaged group priority (if a student has registered with a group in Phase 1).   Students participating in Explorations programs, the Green House, the International House, the Senior House, or the Residential College will only be able to select within the program to which they were accepted.   Students participating in the Residential College will begin selecting on Monday, March 30, 2015 (date subject to change) .   The general student room selection process (including Explorations programs, the Green House, the International House, and the Senior House) will begin on Tuesday, March 31, 2015 (date subject to change) .   Once selection times are determined, timetables will be provided to give students a better idea about where their selection time falls within the overall process.

When you access the Phase 2 step, you will be able to browse through the available inventory and select a room. Once your room has been confirmed, it cannot be changed. Be sure to make your selection carefully. Students can access the Phase 2: Room Selection step in the Academic Year 2015-2016 application via the Housing Forms channel at NYUHome .     SELECTING AS A GROUP   All individuals within a group can log in and select independently OR allow the Group Leader to select for them. Only the Group Leader can select for other group members. The Group Leader may only select spaces for group members within the same suite or floor.   As space becomes limited, groups may be forced to split apart. If possible, all group members are encouraged to be together to assist the Group Leader with selection decisions. It is critical that group members discuss options and alternatives. Once an assignment is confirmed, it cannot be changed.   If the Group Leader does not assign all members of the group, the unassigned members are responsible for individually assigning themselves anytime after their group selection time but prior to April 3, 2015. Students can access the Academic Year 2015-2016 application via the Housing Forms channel at NYUHome .     CONSOLIDATION POLICY   In an effort to create more housing options for incoming and existing residents, ensure equity, and maximize use of available space, the University will actively seek to consolidate vacancies within the University Housing system. Students that are assigned to partially vacant rooms may be reassigned. This means that the hall, room, and/or roommates you select now may be changed if necessary for consolidation purposes. Consolidation may occur prior to check-in or during the academic year and students may be reassigned to other rooms, floors, or residence halls where necessary.       POST SELECTION ROOM CHANGE PROCESS   Students who are dissatisfied with their room selection may submit a Post Selection Room Change Request. Students must select a space in Phase 2 in order to be considered in the Post Selection Room Change process. The online room change form will be available on March 30, 2015 through May 15, 2015.                          Important Updates   Room selection for 2015-2016 is now closed.
