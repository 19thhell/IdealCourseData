From leading international centers for research and education, to one of the most technologically advanced lecture halls and screening facilities in New York City, the varied institutes and centers at NYU serve as critical points of convergence for the University experience.   Throughout the year, many of them offer lectures and seminars that are open to the entire University community allowing for enrichment in many different subjects.

For this work, we use approaches that span systems biology, comparative functional genomics & bioinformatic analysis focusing on model organisms and phylogenetically related species. The research involves the combined skills of genomicists, bioinformaticians, systematists, and evolutionary biologists all working together.

We develop design patterns for effective educational games that industry partners can draw on to assure high quality when designing their own games for learning. Our current focus is on games that teach science, technology, engineering and mathematics to middle school students.
