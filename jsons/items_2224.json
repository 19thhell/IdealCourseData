Bio:   My primary research interests are in the intellectual and social history of the medieval Islamic world as known to us through the medium of Arabic texts. I began my scholarly career as a student of Islamic philosophy, and my first book was a study of a tenth-century work on the soul that represented one form of adaptation of the Greek Neoplatonic heritage to Islamic religious commitments. While I have maintained an ongoing interest in Arabic and Islamic Neoplatonism, a research position I obtained while completing my dissertation opened my eyes to the world of medieval Arabic literature, and in particular Arabic rhetorical prose, which in turn sparked my ongoing fascination with the interactions between different discourses (philosophical and literary, but also theological, legal, and historical). Investigation into the relationships among the various groups that produced the texts I was reading inevitably took me further into the area of social history, and I then began to explore aspects of medieval conceptions of gender and sexuality, a topic that has proved particularly rich for looking at how different genres of writing deal with a single topic of fundamental human concern. After publishing a series of articles on effeminacy and homosexuality, I am now working to complete a monograph on homosexuality in medieval Islamic cultures as treated in literary, legal, medical, philosophical, and mystical texts.     Since my arrival at NYU in 1993, I have been happy to have the opportunity to indulge my rather broad interests by offering a variety of courses to both undergraduates and graduate students. My undergraduate courses are mostly organized around rather general, but important, topics such as education, religious tolerance and intolerance, religion and government, and, of course, gender and sexuality. In graduate seminars I aim to train students in the critical reading of Arabic texts while at the same time introducing them to contemporary scholarship based on those texts, and have offered courses on such topics as Islamic theology, philosophy, ethics and advice literature, and, again, gender and sexuality.

Bio:   My primary research interests are in the intellectual and social history of the medieval Islamic world as known to us through the medium of Arabic texts. I began my scholarly career as a student of Islamic philosophy, and my first book was a study of a tenth-century work on the soul that represented one form of adaptation of the Greek Neoplatonic heritage to Islamic religious commitments. While I have maintained an ongoing interest in Arabic and Islamic Neoplatonism, a research position I obtained while completing my dissertation opened my eyes to the world of medieval Arabic literature, and in particular Arabic rhetorical prose, which in turn sparked my ongoing fascination with the interactions between different discourses (philosophical and literary, but also theological, legal, and historical). Investigation into the relationships among the various groups that produced the texts I was reading inevitably took me further into the area of social history, and I then began to explore aspects of medieval conceptions of gender and sexuality, a topic that has proved particularly rich for looking at how different genres of writing deal with a single topic of fundamental human concern. After publishing a series of articles on effeminacy and homosexuality, I am now working to complete a monograph on homosexuality in medieval Islamic cultures as treated in literary, legal, medical, philosophical, and mystical texts.     Since my arrival at NYU in 1993, I have been happy to have the opportunity to indulge my rather broad interests by offering a variety of courses to both undergraduates and graduate students. My undergraduate courses are mostly organized around rather general, but important, topics such as education, religious tolerance and intolerance, religion and government, and, of course, gender and sexuality. In graduate seminars I aim to train students in the critical reading of Arabic texts while at the same time introducing them to contemporary scholarship based on those texts, and have offered courses on such topics as Islamic theology, philosophy, ethics and advice literature, and, again, gender and sexuality.
