The JIAAA \u2019s main focus is on the pre-Islamic and early Islamic art and archaeology of Inner Asia, as well as its languages, religions and history. Volume 1 was launched in 2006, replacing the Newsletter of the Circle of Inner Asian Art (CIAA), established in 1995 at the School of Oriental and African Studies of the University of London; contents of the Newsletters (Issues 1-20, 1995-2005) will appear on the JIAAA site.       Volume 1 (2006) was dedicated to the Iranist, Prof. A. D. H. Bivar on the occasion of his 80 th birthday, with its articles mainly dealing with the Indo-Iranian world. Volume 2 (2007) celebrated the 70 th birthday of Prof. Roderick Whitfield and focused on themes concerning the\u00a0Eastern part of the Silk Road and its links to China. Volume 3 (2008) presented a collection of papers on the history, archaeology and culture of the Kingdom of Khotan, prior to 1,000 CE. These three volumes also included articles on other topics. A range of topics and areas characterized volume 4 (2009), from Choresmian painting to Sogdian archaeology and early Buddhist cave-decoration in northern China.

The JIAAA \u2019s main focus is on the pre-Islamic and early Islamic art and archaeology of Inner Asia, as well as its languages, religions and history. Volume 1 was launched in 2006, replacing the Newsletter of the Circle of Inner Asian Art (CIAA), established in 1995 at the School of Oriental and African Studies of the University of London; contents of the Newsletters (Issues 1-20, 1995-2005) will appear on the JIAAA site.       Volume 1 (2006) was dedicated to the Iranist, Prof. A. D. H. Bivar on the occasion of his 80 th birthday, with its articles mainly dealing with the Indo-Iranian world. Volume 2 (2007) celebrated the 70 th birthday of Prof. Roderick Whitfield and focused on themes concerning the\u00a0Eastern part of the Silk Road and its links to China. Volume 3 (2008) presented a collection of papers on the history, archaeology and culture of the Kingdom of Khotan, prior to 1,000 CE. These three volumes also included articles on other topics. A range of topics and areas characterized volume 4 (2009), from Choresmian painting to Sogdian archaeology and early Buddhist cave-decoration in northern China.

Admission to the ISAW Lecture Hall closes 10 minutes after the scheduled start time.    Established by nomadic groups, empires in the steppes of Inner Asia have lain outside the realms of critical and comparative academic discussions of complex polities. Furthermore, comparative archaeological debates on urban settings and early cities have more or less neglected the constructed centers of nomadic empires. Much of the relegation of nomadic polities may lie in the treatment by early historians of nomadic groups as \"barbarians,\" as \"non-civilized\" peoples, an opinion that has been, until recently, widely accepted by the general public. In his lecture, ISAW Visiting Research Scholar Jan Bemmann will aim to liberate the nomadic steppe empires from old hackneyed cliches. He will present the results of his ongoing research, focusing on a comparative analysis of the archaeological evidence of the Turko-Mongol empires in Mongolia.    --Reception to follow Jan Bemmann is Professor and Head of the Department of Prehistory and Early Historical Archaeology at the University of Bonn. He received his PhD at the University of Kiel and finished his habilitation at the University of Jena. His research interests include the Roman Iron Age and Early Medieval Central and Northern Europe, weaponry, the history of archaeology, and the archaeology of the Crimean Peninsula during the Roman and Early Medieval periods. Since 2005 he has been director of the Mongolian-German-Karakorum Expedition and has devoted his work to achieving a better understanding of the archaeology of Mongolia. His research in Mongolia has focused on the Orkhon Valley, the cradle and center of several steppe empires, but also covers the Bronze and Iron Ages. He has edited several books on the archaeology of Mongolia and was curator of the exhibition \u201cWarriors of the Steppes \u2013 Nomads on horseback in Mongolia 7-14 th century AD.\u201d There will be a reception folowing the event.
