GIPH is invested in producing research of the highest caliber and houses a global public health research center, serving as a University-wide resource for large scale, multi-school, multi-disciplinary and multi-site research projects. GIPH research draws from faculty expertise on multiple topics in multiple geographic settings; coordinates administrative support; works collaboratively with community partners and constituents; and takes a comprehensive approach to research problems, incorporating complimentary perspectives and approaches from across disciplines.            Research Profile: NYU/Ghana Health Partnership                                   New York University and its affiliated public hospital, Bellevue Hospital Center , and the University of Ghana and its affiliated public hospital, the Korle Bu Teaching Hospital , have developed a multi-disciplinary collaboration for health professional development that will result in sustained and significant improvements in health and health care in Ghana and the United States. More recently, this NYU/Ghana Health partnership has expanded to include the new University of Health &amp; Allied Sciences (Volta) as well as the Ministry of Health and the Ghana Health Service.

Program and processes can include but are not limited to: intervention, screening, training, data analysis etc. for a targeted population, or convening of scientific meeting(s) on a key topic that results in a defined deliverable such as a larger grant submission, white paper, methodological advancement or other scholarly product.   A collaborative approach to the process is integral. The assumption is that the research cannot be implemented without participation by both the principal investigator (PI) researcher and GNU partner(s). Each proposal must include a letter from the GNU site\u2019s signatory authority outlining its participation and an agreement that the PI controls the data and dissemination.   Criteria for evaluation  \u2022 The extent to which the proposed work is clearly focused on one of the seven global public health priority areas listed above  \u2022 The extent to which the results will contribute to advancing global collaborations and partnerships in NYU\u2019s GNU network  \u2022 Agreement by the proposed GNU partner to participate in the work being proposed (letter of support and collaboration from the GNU site must be included)  \u2022 Clear delineation of the role of the PI and GNU partner(s) in conducting the work  \u2022 Significance and potential for advancing the field of study and enhancing the translation of theory to practice  \u2022 Innovation in approach, methods and concept  \u2022 Well-specified research problem  \u2022 Feasibility of the conceptual framework, plan and methodology  \u2022 Experience and potential of the project investigator to conduct the proposed research  \u2022 Dissemination plans   Eligibility and Restrictions  \u2022 All GIPH faculty (full, joint, clinical, affiliated, associated) members and GIPH Affinity Group Members are eligible to apply  \u2022 Applications must include a partnership with one of the NYU GNU partner sites  \u2022 Investigators may not have received GIPH Global Challenge funding in the past 2 years  \u2022 If funded the GNU site(s) may receive funds directly from the Award in accordance with New York University\u2019s Controllers Division Business Expenses Policy 1.3.  \u2022 Money cannot be used for faculty salaries  \u2022 Awards may not exceed 12 months without prior approval   Budget Guidance and Restrictions:  \u2022 GIPH intends to fund an estimate of 1-2 awards within each affinity group, corresponding to a total of $30,000 for each group.  \u2022 All necessary costs must be listed in the budget template provided. Funds may not support faculty effort. Although not limited to, costs may include: IRB costs, research supplies, travel, hourly student time, participant payments, consultant costs, meeting costs, and honorariums.  Please note that if there are human subjects included in the proposal, we cannot award funding until NYU has granted human subject approval. GIPH Grants Manager must receive a copy of the UCAIHS approval before the release of funds. Information about Human Subjects can be seen at http://www.nyu.edu/ucaihs.   REPORTING:  All investigators must provide a one-page progress report to the GIPH Office of Research within 60 days after the completion of the funding cycle. We may ask recipients of Awards to present findings at a GIPH research forum.

disease. These factors have complex co-determinants in human genetic susceptibility and environmental conditions, ranging potentially from the built environment to the human microbial milieu (microbiome). The mission of the NYU Abu Dhabi Public Health Research Center (PHRC) is to improve the health of the population in Abu Dhabi through research.                               Goals   The principal goals of the PHRC are:     To identify environmental and genetic determinants of health and of premature death, disease and disability in Abu Dhabi.   To develop and test novel public health interventions to promote wellness and reduce premature death, disease and disability in Abu Dhabi.   To create a world-class public health research center in Abu Dhabi and develop a cadre of highly skilled public health scientists and practitioners.                                 Centers     The PHRC proposes a research program to address critical topics for Abu Dhabi in public health science through the development of specific centers:   Diabetes Research Center     In addition to cardiovascular disease, which is the leading cause of death in the UAE, obesity and diabetes in Abu Dhabi are emerging as major public health problems. More than half of the population display central obesity and more than 40% have either prediabetes or diabetes. Without intervention, the overall prevalence rate of diabetes is projected to reach 30% by 2014.     Read More about the Diabetes Research Center       Obesity and Genetic Susceptibility to Diabetes Research Center     Since more than 40% of the relatively young population of Abu Dhabi Nationals has diabetes or pre-diabetes, this center will identify and validate genetic factors that predispose to diabetes in obese individuals.   Human Oral Microbiome Research Center   Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in the UAE; this center seeks to identify and understand the functional role oral bacteria (e.g. periodontal disease) have in its association with cardiovascular disease.   Smoking Cessation Research Center   In order to decrease the prevalence of tobacco use, a program of identification and intervention in smoking behavior, tailored to the specific needs of the Abu Dhabi population, will be created.

While cohort studies have made tremendous contributions to scientific knowledge of the epidemiology and determinants of diabetes, cardiovascular disease and cancer, none have been done in Arab populations.
