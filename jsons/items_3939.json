The politics that art makes. This is an opportunity for artists and those working in the intellectual and institutional domains of art to enhance and elaborate the value and significance of their creative endeavors through intensive study, reflection, and engagement with the university and the world. Based at Tisch, the program combines a dedicated core faculty with access to faculty and courses from five different schools at New York University.    Students who undertake this advanced course of study will gain a broad understanding of the issues and the skills required to make their ideas work in practice. They will be well placed to assume a leadership role in creating new institutional venues and public forums for creative work with their publics and for deepening an understanding of how art enriches social life. Students will be encouraged to become advocates for the arts from within the arts. The program will provide a deep grasp of what makes art necessary\u2014both aesthetically and socially\u2014and what constrains its expression and development. They will complicate received notions of access to the arts and the artist\u2019s social responsibility.    New York University is already renowned for producing precisely this kind of independent creative intelligence oriented toward making a mark in the world. Drawing on a diverse faculty across School and departmental lines, a dedicated core faculty, and special visiting faculty, the program avails itself of rich resources and its location in a global cultural center. Students will learn to blend esthetic and social innovation in close connection with various art worlds. They will be able to work collaboratively across disciplinary lines with a robust integration of creative talent and critical acumen. The goal of the program is to train unique arts activists\u2014capable of activating critical and creative dialogue between art and world and committed to reshaping how art is produced, perceived, and received.    \u2026the relation between art and society and the role of the artist in civic life.    The M.A. in Arts Politics Program provides a critical and analytic setting in which artists and others with a social commitment to the arts can develop the means for an appraisal of the political implications and social significance of their work. The program combines an administrative home within the Tisch School of the Arts with partnerships across other NYU schools to offer a spectrum of interdisciplinary courses. The curriculum examines, in an activist key, the relation between art and society and the role of the artist in civic life. Art is treated as providing a particular lens through which the social world can be understood and as a medium of cultural intervention in political processes.    The M.A. program combines core courses with relevant electives drawn from across the University. Students attend classes with those who have related arts interests in other University areas and come together to critically reflect on the discourses and practical strategies that issue from the ability of art to intervene in and transform the social world. Arts politics considers art as both a way of knowing and a kind of action, as an invitation to claim artistic citizenship and a means to democratize the public sphere.    Arts politics attends to both formal and informal political processes that bear on the production, dissemination, and reception of the arts. It integrates approaches from the humanities, social sciences, and the arts themselves. It studies governmental and policy processes and the institutional ecology and political economy of the arts. It employs perspectives that understand how to decode cultural meanings, how social movements are formed, and how to read the aesthetic dimension of contemporary politics. Through official patronage and censorship, celebration and loathing, affirmation and critique of prevailing values, art has long been imbricated and implicated in the political. Yet arts politics is never fixed; its historical and cross-cultural variations help us understand what possibilities exist for civically engaged artists working in the present.    In the United States, cultural policy is typically seen as being weakly developed, and the skills artists use to get their work into the world often frequently rest on tacit knowledge. Art is rarely bestowed with official status or sanction, which can make its social or political impact all the more challenging to discern. Given the often-subtle ways in which art interacts with and acts upon the social world, the political value and efficacy of art can be difficult to assess. Alternately, when art itself is grasped epistemologically, as a way of knowing the world, a distinctive array of art\u2019s social effects becomes legible.    Curriculum    The M.A. is an intensive one year (two semester) program in which students take 18 credits per semester. The curriculum requires four specific courses for this program. They are \u201cIssues in Arts Politics,\u201d \u201cSeminar in Arts Activism,\u201d \u201cGraduate Colloquium,\u201d and \u201cGraduate Fieldwork.\u201d Students also enroll in at least two electives offered through the Department of Art and Public Policy during the course of the academic year. In addition, students must take up to 16 points of electives drawn from a University-wide list of linked course offerings, including advanced course work in art and public policy. Enrollment in the program will remain small, so that there is room in the core courses for students from other programs at the University. Program electives are courses from around the University that are already on the books, and the respective departments have already agreed to admit arts politics students (subject to permission of the individual instructor).    Issues in Arts Politics    This seminar aims to give students both a conceptual and practical grounding in the range of issues and approaches by which arts politics can be understood. The course will be framed by the following considerations: What are the institutional, discursive, and ideological contexts that shape the objects, images, sounds or texts we call \u201cart?\u201d What are the links between cultural spaces-- the museum, the movie-theater, the gallery, the music/dance hall, the bookstore, the fashion runway, the public street, television, cyber space-- and the larger realm of politics? And how do these relationships impact, implicitly or explicitly, the ways we create, curate, or study the arts? How do consumers play an active role in the reception of cultural products? What is the relation between formally promulgated cultural policy and the tacit knowledge that artists call upon to get their work into the world? What dimensions of the broader cultural terrain are made legible through artistic practice? What are the means through which art intervenes in the political arena? \u201cArt\u201d will be studied as a site of contested representations and visions, emb edded in power formations-- themselves shaped by specific historical moments and geographical locations. Given contemporary global technologies, cultural practices will also be studied within the transnational \u201ctravel\u201d of ideas and people. Such germane issues as the legal and constitutional dimensions of censorship, the social formation of taste, the consumption of stars, the bio-politics of the body, transnational copyrights law-- will all pass through an intersectional analyses of gender, race, class, sexuality, ethnicity, religion, and nation, incorporating the insights of such areas of inquiry as multiculturalism, feminism, postcolonialism, and queer studies. The first half of the course is explores certain key conceptual issues and the second half examines practical applications. Specific examples are provided through student presentations.    Seminar in Arts Activism    This seminar will focus on developing our work, theory, and art into a realized production. Each student will start with presenting his or her ideas and goals of creating a public project. This may take the form of public art, exhibition, performance, narrative but bringing it to a goal of actualizing the work out of the school student world. But the class is more than just bringing the art into the public light. We will scrutinize and examine intent and where to bring a production. Media, reviews, current events, intent, audience, controversy, economics, politics and other issues and challenges that is vital to a successful professional life. These connections and awareness of the outside world out of school will be a reality check of all the responsibilities of participating in culture. The class is interested in original and dynamic thought, provoking associative thinking and awareness. The class is designed to transform and consider challenging your process and opinion. You are encouraged to bring awareness of different approaches to create new and borrowed strategies in cultural activism. The class is considered process oriented and the professor is encouraging conceptual principles. Process is encouraging original thought over guaranteed knowns.

The curriculum examines, in an activist key, the relation between art and society and the role of the artist in civic life. Art is treated as providing a particular lens through which the social world can be understood and as a medium of cultural intervention in political processes.    The M.A. program combines core courses with relevant electives drawn from across the University. Students attend classes with those who have related arts interests in other University areas and come together to critically reflect on the discourses and practical strategies that issue from the ability of art to intervene in and transform the social world. Arts politics considers art as both a way of knowing and a kind of action, as an invitation to claim artistic citizenship and a means to democratize the public sphere.    Arts politics attends to both formal and informal political processes that bear on the production, dissemination, and reception of the arts. It integrates approaches from the humanities, social sciences, and the arts themselves. It studies governmental and policy processes and the institutional ecology and political economy of the arts. It employs perspectives that understand how to decode cultural meanings, how social movements are formed, and how to read the aesthetic dimension of contemporary politics. Through official patronage and censorship, celebration and loathing, affirmation and critique of prevailing values, art has long been imbricated and implicated in the political. Yet arts politics is never fixed; its historical and cross-cultural variations help us understand what possibilities exist for civically engaged artists working in the present.    In the United States, cultural policy is typically seen as being weakly developed, and the skills artists use to get their work into the world often frequently rest on tacit knowledge. Art is rarely bestowed with official status or sanction, which can make its social or political impact all the more challenging to discern. Given the often-subtle ways in which art interacts with and acts upon the social world, the political value and efficacy of art can be difficult to assess. Alternately, when art itself is grasped epistemologically, as a way of knowing the world, a distinctive array of art\u2019s social effects becomes legible.    Curriculum    The M.A. is an intensive one year (two semester) program in which students take 18 credits per semester. The curriculum requires four specific courses for this program. They are \u201cIssues in Arts Politics,\u201d \u201cSeminar in Arts Activism,\u201d \u201cGraduate Colloquium,\u201d and \u201cGraduate Fieldwork.\u201d Students also enroll in at least two electives offered through the Department of Art and Public Policy during the course of the academic year. In addition, students must take up to 16 points of electives drawn from a University-wide list of linked course offerings, including advanced course work in art and public policy. Enrollment in the program will remain small, so that there is room in the core courses for students from other programs at the University. Program electives are courses from around the University that are already on the books, and the respective departments have already agreed to admit arts politics students (subject to permission of the individual instructor).    Issues in Arts Politics    This seminar aims to give students both a conceptual and practical grounding in the range of issues and approaches by which arts politics can be understood. The course will be framed by the following considerations: What are the institutional, discursive, and ideological contexts that shape the objects, images, sounds or texts we call \u201cart?\u201d What are the links between cultural spaces-- the museum, the movie-theater, the gallery, the music/dance hall, the bookstore, the fashion runway, the public street, television, cyber space-- and the larger realm of politics? And how do these relationships impact, implicitly or explicitly, the ways we create, curate, or study the arts? How do consumers play an active role in the reception of cultural products? What is the relation between formally promulgated cultural policy and the tacit knowledge that artists call upon to get their work into the world? What dimensions of the broader cultural terrain are made legible through artistic practice? What are the means through which art intervenes in the political arena? \u201cArt\u201d will be studied as a site of contested representations and visions, emb edded in power formations-- themselves shaped by specific historical moments and geographical locations. Given contemporary global technologies, cultural practices will also be studied within the transnational \u201ctravel\u201d of ideas and people. Such germane issues as the legal and constitutional dimensions of censorship, the social formation of taste, the consumption of stars, the bio-politics of the body, transnational copyrights law-- will all pass through an intersectional analyses of gender, race, class, sexuality, ethnicity, religion, and nation, incorporating the insights of such areas of inquiry as multiculturalism, feminism, postcolonialism, and queer studies. The first half of the course is explores certain key conceptual issues and the second half examines practical applications. Specific examples are provided through student presentations.    Seminar in Arts Activism    This seminar will focus on developing our work, theory, and art into a realized production. Each student will start with presenting his or her ideas and goals of creating a public project. This may take the form of public art, exhibition, performance, narrative but bringing it to a goal of actualizing the work out of the school student world. But the class is more than just bringing the art into the public light. We will scrutinize and examine intent and where to bring a production. Media, reviews, current events, intent, audience, controversy, economics, politics and other issues and challenges that is vital to a successful professional life. These connections and awareness of the outside world out of school will be a reality check of all the responsibilities of participating in culture. The class is interested in original and dynamic thought, provoking associative thinking and awareness. The class is designed to transform and consider challenging your process and opinion. You are encouraged to bring awareness of different approaches to create new and borrowed strategies in cultural activism. The class is considered process oriented and the professor is encouraging conceptual principles. Process is encouraging original thought over guaranteed knowns.

Academic Programs    NYU Steinhardt&rsquo;s Department of Music and Performing Arts Professions was established in 1925. In 1968, the Department merged with the New York College of Music. Since that time, Steinhardt Music and Performing Arts Professions has functioned as NYU's \"school\" of music and developed into a major research and practice center in music technology, music business, music composition, film scoring, music performance practices, performing arts therapies, and the performing arts-in-education (music, dance, and drama). Today, 1,600 students majoring in these renowned music and performing arts programs are guided by 400 faculty. Our degree programs&mdash;baccalaureate through doctorate&mdash;are marked by an integration of performance, research, technology, and practice. Further, the programs are integrated with one another in ways that bring performance majors and composers together with choreographers, directors, actors, dancers, educators, librettists, and filmmakers in collaborative projects often reviewed by the New York media. Faculty sit on leading journal editorial boards, perform in the most prestigious concert venues in the world, and publish some of the most significant performing arts research on the scene today. Housed in new and growing facilities including advanced studios in music technology and rehearsal, practice, and concert spaces for our orchestra and performance programs, our Department and the Steinhardt School offer an unparalleled environment for artistic, professional, and scholarly challenge and growth.    Successful Careers    Our Department provides conservatory-level training in a leading research university located in the heart of New York City. We provide in-depth, specialized training in each of our programs, while providing links between them that lead to new insights, discoveries, and opportunities. We encourage students to take courses and to interact with faculty across traditional programmatic and Steinhardt School lines. In addition to these multiple university synergies, our campus is surrounded by and blends into the world&rsquo;s capital and center of the performing arts, New York City. This location enables us to draw upon the greatest artists in the world and allows our students to build networks and take advantage of abundant professional opportunities. We broaden music students' education with the option to study abroad at the NYU campus in Prague , which offers a full music curriculum.    Alumni have moved on to major performing careers and have secured coveted professional positions in the music industry as well as faculty and administrative positions in colleges, conservatories, and universities throughout the world. Prominent graduates include jazz great Wayne Shorter, music theatre composer Cy Coleman, lyricist Betty Comden, film composer Elmer Bernstein, conductor and composer Tania Leon, music technologist Enoch Light, and Oscar and Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright and film writer John Patrick Shanley.    Training    Steinhardt Music and Performing Arts faculty come from rich and varied backgrounds in performance, research, therapy, and business. Our faculty are acclaimed and active scholars, performers, directors, and music business entrepreneurs and executives, and their extensive professional connections create abundant networking possibilities for our students. Further, these faculty open up opportunities for our students to complete internships with leading music industry companies in New York City, the world's heartbeat of the performing arts professions. In addition, at any given time, our current students have roles on Broadway and most Broadway musicals cast NYU alumni. Our Jazz Big Band is the only college jazz band to be regularly invited to perform in and \"sell out\" at the legendary Greenwich Village Blue Note as well as midtown's Birdland, and many of our other student ensembles perform at esteemed jazz venues such as the Village Vanguard.    Thus, at graduation, our students have already trained with the major active artists in the industry who will be selecting casts for Broadway shows, instrumentalists for major orchestras, ensembles and jazz bands, recording engineers, producers, and young executives for record companies, and so on. Every one of our academic programs balance the very best training and study with guidance for professional success after graduation.    Learning Outcomes    Upon conclusion of the program, students will be able to:    1.) Integrate music history, music theory, aural comprehension, and keyboard harmony and improvisation into their specialized field of study.    2.) Use effective written and oral communication skills to analyze, synthesize and disseminate information.    3.) Demonstrate readiness to enter the field as a professional as defined by their specific program.
