The program is ideal for the student interested in science and engineering who is also eager for a liberal arts experience before entering an undergraduate engineering environment. Upon completion of this five-year program, students receive the Bachelor of Science degree from the College of Arts and Science at New York University and the Bachelor of Science degree from the Polytechnic Institute of NYU. Students with this combination of degrees are likely to find excellent employment opportunities. The available dual-degree combination are as follows: \u2022 B.S. in biology/B.S. in chemical and biomolecular engineering \u2022 B.S. in chemistry/B.S. in chemical and biomolecular engineering \u2022 B.S. in computer science/B.S. in computer engineering \u2022 B.S. in computer science/B.S. in electrical engineering \u2022 B.S. in mathematics/B.S. in civil engineering \u2022 B.S. in mathematics/B.S. in computer engineering \u2022 B.S. in mathematics/B.S. in electrical engineering \u2022 B.S. in mathematics/B.S. in mechanical engineering \u2022 B.S. in physics/B.S. in civil engineering \u2022 B.S. in physics/B.S. in computer engineering \u2022 B.S. in physics/B.S. in electrical engineering \u2022 B.S. in physics/B.S. in mechanical engineering Students in the program complete all of the Morse Academic Plan (MAP) requirements, with the exception of the foreign language requirement, from which they are excused. (Their required math and science courses automatically satisfy the MAP\u2019s Foundations of Scientific Inquiry requirements.) There is usually some flexibility concerning the semester in which a given course can be taken, and students with Advanced Placement credit can typically lighten some of their semester course loads and/or have room for more electives. Detailed programs of study for each of the curricula are available from Tyrell Davis, the adviser for all students in the various programs. He may be contacted at the College Advising Center, Silver Center, 100 Washington Square East, Room 905; 212-998-8130. Application materials for this dual-degree program may be requested from New York University, Office of Undergraduate Admissions, 665 Broadway, 11th Floor, New York, NY 10012-2339. REQUIREMENTS The dual-degree program is designed to meet the educational and career interests of students with strong qualifications, as evidenced by their GPA in high school and by their performance in mathematics and science. Students who rank near the top of their class and who have done well on standardized tests, particularly in mathematics, are especially well suited.  Students should have completed a rigorous college preparation program, including mathematics (through trigonometry), chemistry, and physics and exhibited substantial extracurricular activity and leadership. Students are usually admitted to the program as freshmen and must be prepared to begin with Calculus I (V63.0121) in the first semester of college. Given the highly structured curricula, transfer into the program after the first year is very difficult. Students must maintain satisfactory performance and must complete the required courses in a timely fashion in order to remain in the program. Their records are reviewed yearly by a faculty committee. THE PROGRAM Students accepted into the program spend their first three years of study in the College of Arts and Science at New York University. In the first year at the College, the different curricula call for many of the same courses. This gives students time to consult with faculty at both schools before committing themselves to a particular science/engineering major.                                      During Freshman Orientation, if they have not already done so, students select a major area for their study at New York University from the disciplines of biology, chemistry, computer science, mathematics, and physics. In their first year, students will have the opportunity to change this major and to reflect on their choice of an engineering major. In the spring of the third year, an orientation program helps students prepare for the transition to Poly in the fourth year. In the first three years of the program, students satisfy their MAP requirements and also take some of the Poly courses required for their choice of engineering major. Students may elect to withdraw from the dual-degree program in engineering and complete only the College of Arts and Science general and major requirements at New York University. The final two years of study are undertaken at the Polytechnic Institute of NYU in downtown Brooklyn, across the East River and a short subway ride from New York University\u2019s Greenwich Village campus.                      At Poly, students complete the remaining technical courses required for their engineering major. Programs in engineering available to students in the NYU-Poly dual-degree program include chemical and biolmolecular engineering, civil engineering, computer engineering, electrical engineering, and mechanical engineering.
