The increase in international art transactions has incubated a booming market for stolen and fraudulent art, and major U.S. arts institutions still grapple with repatriation of stolen or looted objects in their collections. Co-organized by Jane C.H. Jacob , art historian and provenance research expert, Jacob Fine Art, Inc., Chris Marinello, director and founder, Art Recovery Group, and Alice Farren-Bradley, Museum Security Network, the symposium brings together experts from major museums and auction houses, the NYU School of Law, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, and the President\u2019s Cultural Property Advisory Committee, as well as independent scholars and authors, art crime victims, art crime attorneys, forensic scientists, and other major players working to address art crime worldwide.   Join us and learn about the legal, forensic, governmental, and political strategies being employed to address the enormity of this global phenomenon. Topics include the history of fakes and forgeries, insurance fraud, art theft and art scams, scientific and forensic approaches, provenance research, cultural repatriation, issues facing auction houses and purchasers, and current case studies.         CLE units and financial aid are available for those who qualify. Attorneys attending the symposium can earn 8 CLEs in Professional Practice: 3.5 CLEs (June 4), 2.5 CLEs (June 5), and 2.0 CLEs (June 6). CLEs are transitional.

Students in the College of Arts and Science (CAS) need to fulfill 4 semesters of language as part of their College Core Curriculum (CORE). They can also fulfill their requirement with several placement exams. In-person placement exams in Spanish and Portuguese will be available for CAS students during the summer and throughout the Fall and Spring semesters: http://cas.nyu.edu/page/ug.placementexams    Portuguese         Spanish speakers with no formal training of Portuguese can  register directly for PORT UA 11 Portuguese for Spanish  Speakers.      Other students with no training in Portuguese can  register for PORT UA 1 Elementary Portuguese I or PORT UA 10  Intensive Elementary Portuguese.      Students with previous formal training and/or familiarity in Portuguese must  go to the College of Arts and Science\u2019s language exam website and take the  online exam, picking Portuguese among the choices: http://www.nyu.edu/cas/flpexam/ . Students will  receive a score placing them in a certain level and must register for that  level.      Students who score above the cutoff can take a written  in-person exam for exemption from the CORE requirement. They must sign up in  advance for the exemption exam. Information on dates and signing up can be  found at http://cas.nyu.edu/page/placementexams .  If they wish to continue their study of the language at NYU they must consult  directly with the Director of the Language Program spanish.dlp@nyu.edu .            Spanish    Students with no previous study of Spanish enroll in SPAN-UA 1 Spanish for Beginners I. Students with 1 year of High School Spanish may enroll in SPAN-UA 1 Spanish for Beginners I or take a placement test to determine placement. All other students must show proof of placement through the SAT II Placement Test (taken either before entering NYU or offered by CAS), the IB exam or the AP Test. If a student does not have any form of placement test available and has taken Spanish before, he/she needs to take the WebCAPE online placement exam (link provided at the end of this page). Students who have not taken a placement test and have taken Spanish before will not be allowed to stay in a course. There are no exceptions to this rule. Students with college Spanish from institutions other than NYU also need to take a placement test. Spanish Speakers : If you are a Spanish (heritage) speaker, you must a take a test in the department (not the online placement exam) for appropriate placement into SPAN-UA 11 (Spanish for Spanish Speakers) or SPAN-UA 111 (Advanced Spanish for Spanish Speakers). Completion of either of these courses will fulfill the language requirement for heritage speakers. Please call 212-998-8770 for more information, or write the Director of the Language Program spanish.dlp@nyu.edu , or the Coordinator of the Heritage Speakers course for further instructions.  I.

The same is true if they have taken university level Spanish not from an NYU-site. Please note that this exam may not be used to fulfill the CORE requirement; it is only used for placement purposes. The WebCAPE online placement exam in Spanish consists of a series of multiple-choice format questions on vocabulary, grammar and reading comprehension. Since it is an adaptive test, the length varies from one individual to another, with an average time of 20 minutes. At the exam welcome screen students must provide their name, last name, NYU email and N number. The score and placement recommendation will be notified to the student and to the Department of Spanish and Portuguese immediately upon completion of the exam. Students must print their scores and bring them to class on the first week of classes.    Please be aware that the exam must represent each student\u2019s own work. Students are bound by New York University\u2019s College of Arts and Science Code of Academic Integrity ( http://cas.nyu.edu/page/academicintegrity ), and must abstain from activities constitutive of fraud. To take the NYU online placement exam please go to:  http://webcape.byuhtrsc.org/?acct=nyu [Password: nyulanguage ]. Please be aware that students cannot take this placement test more than once every year and a half (18 months) without the permission of the Director of the Language Program.

The increase in international art transactions has incubated a booming market for stolen and fraudulent art, and major U.S. arts institutions still grapple with repatriation of stolen or looted objects in their collections. Co-organized by Jane C.H. Jacob , art historian and provenance research expert, Jacob Fine Art, Inc., Chris Marinello, director and founder, Art Recovery Group, and Alice Farren-Bradley, Museum Security Network, the symposium brings together experts from major museums and auction houses, the NYU School of Law, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, and the President\u2019s Cultural Property Advisory Committee, as well as independent scholars and authors, art crime victims, art crime attorneys, forensic scientists, and other major players working to address art crime worldwide.   Join us and learn about the legal, forensic, governmental, and political strategies being employed to address the enormity of this global phenomenon. Topics include the history of fakes and forgeries, insurance fraud, art theft and art scams, scientific and forensic approaches, provenance research, cultural repatriation, issues facing auction houses and purchasers, and current case studies.         CLE units and financial aid are available for those who qualify. Attorneys attending the symposium can earn 8 CLEs in Professional Practice: 3.5 CLEs (June 4), 2.5 CLEs (June 5), and 2.0 CLEs (June 6). CLEs are transitional.

IB Score          PLACES STUDENT IN                  IB6 or IB7            Scores of 6 or 7 on the International Baccalaureate Higher Level examination are accepted as evidence of intermediate-level accomplishment and exemption from the language requirement.                    IB5 and under              Needs to take placement test or show proof of SAT II or AP Spanish score.                    IV. WebCAPE Online Exam    Students who do not have an SAT II, an AP or an IB placement exam, can take the WebCAPE online exam (see link below) before they can register into a language class. The same is true if they have taken university level Spanish not from an NYU-site. Please note that this exam may not be used to fulfill the CORE requirement; it is only used for placement purposes. The WebCAPE online placement exam in Spanish consists of a series of multiple-choice format questions on vocabulary, grammar and reading comprehension. Since it is an adaptive test, the length varies from one individual to another, with an average time of 20 minutes. At the exam welcome screen students must provide their name, last name, NYU email and N number. The score and placement recommendation will be notified to the student and to the Department of Spanish and Portuguese immediately upon completion of the exam. Students must print their scores and bring them to class on the first week of classes.    Please be aware that the exam must represent each student\u2019s own work. Students are bound by New York University\u2019s College of Arts and Science Code of Academic Integrity ( http://cas.nyu.edu/page/academicintegrity ), and must abstain from activities constitutive of fraud. To take the NYU online placement exam please go to:  http://webcape.byuhtrsc.org/?acct=nyu [Password: nyulanguage ]. Please be aware that students cannot take this placement test more than once every year and a half (18 months) without the permission of the Director of the Language Program. Call 212-998-8770 or send an email spanish.dlp@nyu.edu for an appointment. Placement test results are valid for 18 months maximum. For incoming freshmen, if the SAT II Spanish exam or AP exams were taken in junior year of high school, students are advised to take the NYU placement exam for a more recent assessment.

For placement in advanced courses, consult with Spanish Department, 212-998-8770.       Placement test results are not simple recommendations. Students must  register for the course they have placed into.       Students registered in the wrong course will be dropped from  that class and placed into the appropriate one.      Only a Course Coordinator or the  Director of the Language Program can override a placement test score. Placement  test results are valid for 18 months maximum.

culture, and aesthetic expression. Studying language makes one aware of other conceptual and cultural worlds and enables one to reach more effectively into those worlds and bridge cultures. NYU Abu Dhabi language courses are structured to increase competency at every level in speaking, writing, reading, and listening skills. Every language course introduces cultural material that highlights the connectedness of language, culture, and thought.   Many of our students are multilingual; English is a second, if not a third language. All graduate from NYUAD with a mastery of English. Our program emphasizes sophistication not just in writing, but in all aspects of communication. We recognize the close connection between culture and language: the cultural background of students influences their style of expression and class participation, and we work with them to thrive in the interactive approach to learning at NYUAD. The foundation course is Analysis and Expression, which develops critical thinking in tandem with written and verbal expression. Students seeking further support, whether to refine their writing skills, enhance their verbal fluency, or improve their articulation and accent, will find it at the Academic Resource Center, where instructors are trained in English as a second language. Periodic language assessments monitor the progress of students to assure they are on track to reach the goal of advanced proficiency in English.   Students are strongly encouraged to study a language other than English while at NYUAD. Language study opens a window into other cultures and ways of conceiving the world. Students who choose to acquire a new language or to pursue advanced study of a language with which they are already familiar, are better poised to realize their potential as 21st-century global citizens. Languages offered at NYUAD through regular coursework are Arabic and Chinese. Students are strongly encouraged to study Arabic, which is the first language of Abu Dhabi. Classroom learning is enhanced by opportunities to apply language skills in the community and to travel to other Arabic-speaking countries in the region. Students of Chinese are strongly encouraged to spend at least a semester at NYU's program in Shanghai and to attend NYU's summer Chinese language program in Beijing .     Students who wish to advance their proficiency in languages other than Arabic and Chinese may take advantage of the immersive language instruction offered at NYU's global sites in Accra, Berlin, Buenos Aires, Madrid, Paris, Tel Aviv, and Prague.

These courses are designed to help those students master formal Arabic language skills and empower them, as citizens, to become more engaged in their society, culture, and heritage. The series achieves this goal by reactivating the students&rsquo; acquired but dormant knowledge of their native tongue even as it provides new accessible and relevant instruction in the language. In ALH 1 the student will perfect their knowledge of the Arabic writing/reading system; will learn how to produce accurate and coherent sentences in Arabic; and will utilize a variety of audio-visual material to begin to re-discover, debate, and express some of the key characteristics of Arab culture and identity.

Building on the students&#39; prior knowledge of Modern Standard Arabic, this course introduces the students to the unique aspects that make the Emirati dialect so lively and distinctive. From the heart of the ancient oasis of Al Ain where the course is taught, the course also serves as a gateway to accessing intimate aspects of life, culture, and heritage of the Gulf region. Using a bilingual textbook specifically designed by the course instructors to teach Emirati Arabic in formal and informal settings, students learn and experience the target dialect through direct instruction as well as through exploration of Emirati cultural life in folklore, song, film, art, and literature.    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

These courses are designed to help those students master formal Arabic language skills and empower them, as citizens, to become more engaged in their society, culture, and heritage. The series achieves this goal by reactivating the students&rsquo; acquired but dormant knowledge of their native tongue even as it provides new accessible and relevant instruction in the language. In ALH 2 the student will work to perfect their command of Arabic syntax; will learn to produce longer argumentative pieces; will begin to access, assess and taste some of Arabic&rsquo;s key modern literary and cultural products and will continue to debate, and explore various aspects of Arabic culture.

The course includes fourteen modules, twelve already set, and two final modules to be worked out over the semester by two student teams. The modules center on key texts in categories, like language, place, family, and customs, which inform and shape modern Arab identities, civilization(s), and consciousness.

This course is designed especially for those beginners who have no previous background in Chinese but would like to learn the language more intensively and more quickly. Unlike the regular Elementary Chinese I course which will teach ten chapters during one semester, this course will cover twenty chapters during the semester. The training that students get will be equal to one academic year of training, and after completing this course, students will be eligible to skip Elementary Chinese II and take Intermediate Chinese I directly.    The course will begin with introducing Pinyin, the phonetic system of Mandarin Chinese. After that, it will introduce radicals, some basic vocabulary, sentence structures, and grammar points. By the end of the semester, students are expected to be able to read Chinese characters with correct tones; write characters in correct stroke order; compose short essays by using the vocabulary and grammar they have learned; understand by listening conversations about some easy topics; and handle certain informal topics that require an exchange of basic information related to study and leisure activities.

WRIT-AD 111X Analysis and Expression: Contemporary Debates about Islam                                                        Scarcely a day goes by without some controversy or critical comment about &lsquo;Islam&rsquo; -- Muslims -- and its role and significance in the 21st century. Yet trying to make sense of the sheer volume of information and diversity of opinions about what constitutes &lsquo;Islam&rsquo;, who speaks for it, what it represents for the modern era, and how it relates to the non-Muslim world can&mdash;to the unsuspecting observer&mdash;seem an almost impossible task. To complicate matters further, what tends to pass as &lsquo;informed&rsquo; commentary on &lsquo;Islam&rsquo; often turns out to be colored by competing agendas, experiences, and narratives within and beyond the realms of &lsquo;Islam&rsquo;. With these challenges in mind, this course will revisit some of the key debates about the culture, society, and institutions of Islam, and invite students to form and defend their opinions on a range of controversial issues.    A significant feature of the course will be the focus on in-class writing as well as discussions and debate about written and audio-visual media. Over the duration of the semester, students will complete four major assignments: three persuasive essays, all with an extensive drafting process, and a final oral presentation on the subject matter of Essay 3.

WRIT-AD 130 Analysis and Expression II: Ideas of the Tragic                                             A man pokes his eyes out upon realizing he has killed his father and slept with his mother. A king returning from war finds his adulterous wife in a murdering mood, and before long he is dead. A wife betrayed by her philandering husband slaughters her two children as revenge. Tragedies portray human actions and emotions at their most extreme. What have these performances of suffering offered audiences for millennia? What social function does tragedy have? What cultural anxieties are revealed or exorcised by these spectacular representations of acute passion, rage, and pain? We begin by examining Aeschylus&rsquo;s Agamemnon and Shakespeare&rsquo;s Hamlet in a philosophical context by engaging Aristotle&rsquo;s, Hegel&rsquo;s, and George Steiner&rsquo;s philosophies of tragedy. We next explore what modern tragedy might look like through an analysis of Nuri Bilge Ceylan&rsquo;s award-winning Once Upon a Time in Anatolia, a meditation on loss, sin, and inheritance. For the research paper, students select a contemporary cultural artifact and make an argument about how it represents tragedy in the post 9/11 world. Possible topics range from online communities of mourning or the debate over how to commemorate the attacks and their consequences to the continuing influence of classical tragedy on contemporary culture in The Wire or Lars von Trier&rsquo;s Melancholia.

With the recent rise of ISIS, the emergence of the Arab Spring, and the never-ending conflict in Israel-Palestine there is every reason to believe that worldwide attention on Islam, Arabs and Muslims is likely to continue unabated. Building on &lsquo;Contemporary Debates about Islam&rsquo; this course will continue to visit some of the controversial social, political, and cultural topics of the day with particular focus on the Middle East.

WRIT-AD 210 Advanced Analysis and Expression                                             This course builds upon the skills from Analysis and Expression and the Writing-Intensive Core courses to prepare students for advanced writing across the curriculum. The course calls upon students to be creative, critical, and curious, as they rigorously practice their written and spoken expression. Students engage with a variety of texts and research topics to gain greater self-awareness and confidence with their writing. Each major assignment is the result of a progression of exercises with an emphasis on drafting and revision strategies. Students work collaboratively, offering constructive critique through class discussion, peer workshops, and one-on-one conferences.   Please note: students who have not achieved a pass in the Writing Placement exam, or a pass of 'B' or better in WRIT-AD 110 or WRIT-AD 111X will be dropped from this class prior to the start of the Add/Drop period.
