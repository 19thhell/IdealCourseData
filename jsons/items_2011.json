Auditors are welcome to attend the class in part or in whole, and are kindly requested to contact the instructor in advance, as are students from other departments, schools, and universities.      Course contents:    Expressions like John and Mary or the water in my cup intuitively involve reference to collections of individuals or substances. The parthood relation between these collections and their components is not modeled in standard formal semantics of natural language, but it takes central stage in what is known as algebraic or mereological semantics. This course provides a gentle introduction into the mathematical framework of classical extensional mereology, and is designed to help students understand important issues in the following problem domains: plural, mass reference, measurement, aspect, and distributivity. In particular, the course will show how mereology sheds light on cross-categorial similarities between oppositions that pervade these domains, such as the count-mass, singular-plural, telic-atelic, and collective-distributive opposition. Students will encounter issues involving natural language metaphysics and philosophy of language, and how these issues interact with semantic theory depending on how they are resolved.   This course will introduce students to mereology and give them a starting point from which to explore its linguistic applications. The main foundational issues, relevant data, and choice points will be introduced in an accessible format. The content of this course will help students understand important issues in a number of problem domains which are active areas of research, including plurals, mass terms, aspect, distributivity, and measurement.   Much of the important seminal work in the area has been done in the 1980s and 1990s (e.g. Link, Krifka, Landman). More recently, significant new applications have cropped up, ranging from the influence of verbal semantics on cumulativity (e.g. Kratzer 2007) to the grammar of measurement (Schwarzschild 2006) to dependent plurals (e.g. Zweig 2009). The mereological perspective has kept opening up important new avenues for research across the decades (Kratzer 2007, Williams 2009). It has proven particularly useful in drawing out cross-categorial generalizations. Examples include recent work on pluractionality in Kaqchikel and its relation to group nouns (Henderson 2012), and my own work on a unified theory of distributivity, aspect and measurement (Champollion 2010). The mereological approach also provides a useful backdrop against which recent degree-semantic approaches to aspectual composition (Pi\u00f1\u00f3n 2007, Kennedy 2012) and aspectual coercion (Deo and Pi\u00f1ango 2011) can be evaluated.    Course materials:        The lecture notes of this course are available here . This course will be based in part on my recent and current research, in particular Champollion (2010), a summary of which is available here (PDF) . For the complete manuscript, please contact me ( homepage ).       Requirements:    Students have two options. Option (1): write and present one 10-15 page paper, one 2-page abstract of that paper, and three short reviews of abstracts of their fellow students. Submission of these abstracts to a semantics conference is encouraged. Abstracts will be due Nov 24 and reviews on Dec 1. In the last class session on December 9, students will have the opportunity to present the papers or preliminary work towards them. The papers will be due on December 16, and students who submit on time will receive feedback on them by December 23. Option (2): students may work on a take-home exam, which will be released within the first week of the class, and which will be due on December 16. This exam may require self-study and go beyond the contents discussed in the class. Students who choose Option (2) are not required to write abstracts, but they are still required to review their fellow students' abstracts.    Students will be graded on a percentage scale that will be converted to a grade according to the scale below. Late submissions will be accepted but will result in 1 negative percentage point per week.

Some of these connections are not mentioned or not clearly brought out in the seminal literature. The following narrative describes the first four units of the course, which tentatively correspond to one week each. The remainder will be subject to change, in part based on the participants' interests. See also the preliminary syllabus below.      Unit 1: Mereology and Set Theory   After an overview of the content to be covered, the course starts by presenting the conceptual notions of parthood and sum that underlie mereology, followed by a gentle introduction to the axioms of classical extensional mereology. The models for this system are isomorphic to complete boolean algebras with the bottom elements removed, such as the powerset of a given set with the empty set removed. This means that there is a close correspondence between mereology and set theory. This unit exploits this connection to draw on students&rsquo; knowledge concerning the familiar concepts of subsethood and union in order to strengthen their intuitions concerning the new relations of parthood and sum.   Unit 2: Nouns and Measurement   The new concepts from the previous unit are applied to the singular-plural distinction. Following Link 1983, we define the algebraic closure (star operator) in terms of mereological sum. Different theories of the meaning of the plural are empirically motivated, and formalized using algebraic closure. Zweig 2009&rsquo;s theory of dependent plurals is briefly introduced as an example of a recent linguistic application. The notions cumulative, divisive, quantized reference (e.g. Krifka 1998) are motivated. This leads to a discussion of the count-mass distinction. Finally, measure nouns are discussed and the associated concepts degree and measure function are motivated.   Unit 3: Measurement and Verbs   The unit starts by considering constructions in which measure nouns are used, with a focus on pseudopartitives. The constraints on these consructions lead to the relevant notion monotonic/extensive measure function (Krifka 1998, Schwarzschild 2006). We then zoom in on the two measure functions temporal trace and spatial trace and on their uses in the semantics of for\u00ad- adverbials and in\u00ad -adverbials. This leads to a discussion of lexical aspect, with special attention to the parallel between the telic/atelic opposition and the count/mass opposition. The parallel between the two oppositions is formalized via the concepts of cumulative, divisive, and quantized reference discussed in the previous unit. To carry out this formalization, Neo-Davidsonian event semantics is briefly introduced. This naturally leads into the topic of thematic roles, which are related to measure functions and trace functions. The unit ends with a discussion of the notions homomorphism and incremental theme and their relevance to lexical aspect.   Unit 4: Verbs and Distributivity   The phemonenon of aspectual composition (e.g. Krifka 1998) is used to motivate a compositional approach to lexical aspect. This is compared with other approaches. The collective-distributive opposition is introduced and linked with the related telic-atelic, singular-plural, and count-mass oppositions via cumulative and divisive reference. Two approaches to the modeling of distributive predicates are contrasted with each other: the meaning postulate approach, and the compositional (D operator) approach (e.g. Link 1998). The unit ends by drawing out the parallel between the compositional approach to aspect and the compositional approach to distributivity.
