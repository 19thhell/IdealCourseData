The program offers a comprehensive course of study in the modern language. The first three years of instruction (Elementary I and II, Intermediate I and II, and Advanced I and II) focus on mastery of the four skills. Elementary Japanese I is for those who have never studied Japanese before. By the end of Advanced Japanese II (the third year), students should have a solid language foundation enabling them to explore and understand authentic materials such as literature, films, etc. In addition to these core language courses, we offer elective post-advanced courses. For those students who have completed Intermediate I, courses with specific language emphasis are also available (please refer to course descriptions). The language curriculum provides a foundation for students who hope to pursue graduate study or careers involving Japanese language.
