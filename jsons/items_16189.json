It is dedicated to the role of America in the world with an emphasis on processes of transnational exchange in U.S.-European relations in the twentieth century, and more particularly in the period of the Cold War. Klimke analyzes the multi-faceted impact \u201cAmerican\u201d ideas and cultural practices have had once adopted in different sociopolitical settings, and the ways in which U.S. history has become intertwined with other countries\u2019 politics and societies. The increasingly global cultural, political, and military presence of the United States, especially after World War II, as well as the country\u2019s complex entanglement with the forces of globalization, are at the center of his scholarly interests. A special focus of his research is transnational protest movements, processes of cultural transfer, and global networks of dissent, e.g. with respect to 1960/70s protest movements, the African American freedom struggle in the 20th century, or the grassroots activism of the 1980s.

It is dedicated to the role of America in the world with an emphasis on processes of transnational exchange in U.S.-European relations in the twentieth century, and more particularly in the period of the Cold War. Klimke analyzes the multi-faceted impact \u201cAmerican\u201d ideas and cultural practices have had once adopted in different sociopolitical settings, and the ways in which U.S. history has become intertwined with other countries\u2019 politics and societies. The increasingly global cultural, political, and military presence of the United States, especially after World War II, as well as the country\u2019s complex entanglement with the forces of globalization, are at the center of his scholarly interests. A special focus of his research is transnational protest movements, processes of cultural transfer, and global networks of dissent, e.g. with respect to 1960/70s protest movements, the African American freedom struggle in the 20th century, or the grassroots activism of the 1980s.   Bio   Martin Klimke studied at the University of Goettingen, Amherst College, and the University of Heidelberg.

research explores the intersections of political and cultural, diplomatic, and transnational history. It is dedicated to the role of America in the world with an emphasis on processes of transnational exchange in US-European relations in the 20th century, and more particularly in the period of the Cold War. Klimke analyzes the multifaceted impact \u201cAmerican\u201d ideas and cultural practices have had once adopted in different sociopolitical settings, and the ways in which US history has become intertwined with other countries\u2019 politics and societies.    The increasingly global cultural, political, and military presence of the United States, especially after World War II, as well as the country\u2019s complex entanglement with the forces of globalization, are at the center of his scholarly interests. A special focus of his research is transnational protest movements, processes of cultural transfer, and global networks of dissent, e.g., with respect to 1960/70s protest movements, the African American freedom struggle in the 20th century, or the grassroots activism of the 1980s.   Martin Klimke studied at the University of Goettingen, Amherst College, and the University of Heidelberg. Before joining NYU Abu Dhabi, he taught at the University of Heidelberg, Georgetown University, Rutgers University, and Meiji University, Tokyo.   He is also an associated researcher at the Heidelberg Center for American Studies (HCA) at the University of Heidelberg and in Transatlantic Cultural History (TCH) at the University of Augsburg, Germany.
