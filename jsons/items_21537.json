In the 1950s, &ldquo;Tanny,&rdquo; an elegant Paris-born American, was muse to the great New York City Ballet (NYCB) choreographer, George Balanchine, who&#39;d become her husband, and also to choreographer Jerome Robbins, who remained her friend. But in 1956, at age 27 in the middle of a NYCB European tour, Tanny&#39;s muscles felt stiff. She was struck down by Polio, never to walk or dance again. In eerie, foreshadowing, Balanchine had once cast her as a Polio victim in an early ballet in which he danced the role of Polio.                                     6:30 pm - 8:00 pm                            Reception and Art Exhibit:        &ldquo;Polio-Confronting an Epidemic&rdquo;        The Medical Science Building Gallery, located adjacent to the Ehrman Library                             Friday, October 24, 2014                                 7:30 am - 8:00 am                            Light breakfast and registration                                     8:00 am- 8:15 am                            Dean&#39;s Welcome         Robert I.
