The physicians of NYU Urology Associates are highly experienced in treating women and men with this condition, which encompasses overactive bladder, incontinence, obstructions of the urinary tract, and urination difficulties due to neurological conditions or spinal cord injury.     An accurate assessment of the underlying causes of bladder dysfunction is key to alleviating its symptoms. We offer state-of-the-art diagnostic tests, including on-site video urodynamic evaluation.

The physicians of NYU Urology Associates are highly experienced in treating women and men with this condition, which encompasses overactive bladder, incontinence, obstructions of the urinary tract, and urination difficulties due to neurological conditions or spinal cord injury.     An accurate assessment of the underlying causes of bladder dysfunction is key to alleviating its symptoms. We offer state-of-the-art diagnostic tests, including on-site video urodynamic evaluation. All video urodynamic studies are performed and interpreted by a urologist rather than a technician, increasing the accuracy of the testing and making for a more valuable study.     Once a diagnosis has been established, we will work to find a treatment plan that fits your needs and personal situation. We offer a wide range of surgical and non-surgical options, including specialized treatments for patients with neurological problems or who are not ambulatory. Our goal is not only to improve patients\u2019 bladder function, but also to offer as much independence as possible and ultimately improve their quality of life.

It may be caused by inappropriate muscular activity in the muscles of the bladder wall, the muscles that control the starting or stoppage of the flow of urine out of the body (sphincters), or the muscles of the pelvic floor. Neurological impairment and certain medications can also contribute to bladder dysfunction.       Symptoms     Symptoms can include      Sudden, strong urges to urinate during the day or night      The need to urinate often      Incontinence      Difficulty during urination      Decreased force of urine stream      Incomplete bladder emptying      Recurrent urinary tract infections      Diagnosis     Your doctor will ask about your medical history and will also perform a physical exam. Other diagnostic tests may include      Standard female urological evaluation, including pelvic exam (if you are a woman)      Rectal exam (if you are a man)      Neurourological exam      Urine test      Blood test      Pelvic floor electromyography (electrical measurement of muscle activity)      Video urodynamics      Fluoroscopic imaging of the urinary tract      Ultrasound or computerized tomography of the upper urinary tract       Treatment     Your doctor may prescribe one or more of the following:      Behavioral modification (including exercises , timed bladder emptying, bladder training and biofeedback)      Oral medication      Electrical stimulation and neuromodulation      Injection therapy (including Botox)      Surgical treatment (including artificial urinary sphincters and male and female slings)      Psychotherapy          Make an appointment with an NYU urologist who treats bladder dysfunction       Dr. Victor Nitti \u00a0 - (646-825-6324)       Dr. Christopher Kelly - (646-825-6322)       Dr. Nirit Rosenblum - (646-825-6311)       Dr. Benjamin Brucker - (646-754-2404)       Request an appointment by e-mail     Disclaimer     Please be aware that this information is provided to supplement the care provided by your physician.

The physicians of NYU Urology Associates are highly experienced in treating women and men with this condition, which encompasses overactive bladder, incontinence, obstructions of the urinary tract, and urination difficulties due to neurological conditions or spinal cord injury.     An accurate assessment of the underlying causes of bladder dysfunction is key to alleviating its symptoms. We offer state-of-the-art diagnostic tests, including on-site video urodynamic evaluation. All video urodynamic studies are performed and interpreted by a urologist rather than a technician, increasing the accuracy of the testing and making for a more valuable study.     Once a diagnosis has been established, we will work to find a treatment plan that fits your needs and personal situation. We offer a wide range of surgical and non-surgical options, including specialized treatments for patients with neurological problems or who are not ambulatory. Our goal is not only to improve patients\u2019 bladder function, but also to offer as much independence as possible and ultimately improve their quality of life.

It may be caused by inappropriate muscular activity in the muscles of the bladder wall, the muscles that control the starting or stoppage of the flow of urine out of the body (sphincters), or the muscles of the pelvic floor. Neurological impairment and certain medications can also contribute to bladder dysfunction.       Symptoms     Symptoms can include      Sudden, strong urges to urinate during the day or night      The need to urinate often      Incontinence      Difficulty during urination      Decreased force of urine stream      Incomplete bladder emptying      Recurrent urinary tract infections      Diagnosis     Your doctor will ask about your medical history and will also perform a physical exam. Other diagnostic tests may include      Standard female urological evaluation, including pelvic exam (if you are a woman)      Rectal exam (if you are a man)      Neurourological exam      Urine test      Blood test      Pelvic floor electromyography (electrical measurement of muscle activity)      Video urodynamics      Fluoroscopic imaging of the urinary tract      Ultrasound or computerized tomography of the upper urinary tract       Treatment     Your doctor may prescribe one or more of the following:      Behavioral modification (including exercises , timed bladder emptying, bladder training and biofeedback)      Oral medication      Electrical stimulation and neuromodulation      Injection therapy (including Botox)      Surgical treatment (including artificial urinary sphincters and male and female slings)      Psychotherapy          Make an appointment with an NYU urologist who treats bladder dysfunction       Dr. Victor Nitti \u00a0 - (646-825-6324)       Dr. Christopher Kelly - (646-825-6322)       Dr. Nirit Rosenblum - (646-825-6311)       Dr. Benjamin Brucker - (646-754-2404)       Request an appointment by e-mail     Disclaimer     Please be aware that this information is provided to supplement the care provided by your physician.
