Over the course of the two-day conference, students and mid-career professionals alike took part in presentations and workshops presented by some of the most powerful women in the cyber security industry. With the gender gap in the cyber security field at such a significant margin, companies are more eager to seek out women interested in joining this growing industry.   The atmosphere at the symposium was rollicking at times, edge-of-your-seat thrilling at others, and&mdash;because every CISO and industry pro who participated was deeply invested in providing guidance and mentorship to the attendees--always warmly supportive.   The rollicking came courtesy of Shyama Rose, the VP of Information Security at entertainment behemoth Live Nation, who strode the stage looking just as rock-and-roll as any recording artist her company has ever worked with. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re women and you&rsquo;re awesome, so own it,&rdquo; she exhorted the audience, explaining that female cyber security experts should never apologize for their gender or feel intimidated by their male counterparts. &ldquo;Besides,&rdquo; she asserted, &ldquo;I guarantee that you will be the life of every party when you tell people you hack for a living, because, really, how cool is that?&rdquo;   The edge-of-your-seat thrills came when one of Saturday&rsquo;s most highly anticipated speakers, speacial agent with the U.S. Secret Service, took to the stage to talk about her work. She explained that teams of agents are always monitoring social media sites like Twitter and Facebook&mdash;an absolute necessity since more than half of the threats made against the President are now made online. Agents are also consistently watching the so-called Dark Web&mdash;home to black markets that deal in illegal drugs, stolen credit cards, unlawful pornography, and other such items. Criminals get careless, she asserted, dropping digital clues that eventually lead to their arrest.   Lest you think that agents assigned to cyber security details remain cooped up at their desks all day, the agent explained that they are often out in the field, securing electronic evidence at crime scenes and traveling in advance to venues that will be hosting their high-level protectees. &ldquo;Buildings have integrated systems now,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Elevators, HVAC systems, fire sprinklers are all networked together, and we have to be ready to act if anything goes wrong.&rdquo;   The global impact and glaring need for cyber security is huge. Candace Worley, McAfee&rsquo;s Senior Vice President and General Manager of Endpoint Security, expressed the growing need for cyber security professionals by defining what it protects against. &ldquo;A cybercrime is a crime in which a computer is the subject of a crime,&rdquo; Worley said. &ldquo;Cyber security is the profession to thwart cybercrime.&rdquo;   This is a new era of computing. The term, &ldquo;The internet of things,&rdquo; was used several times throughout the conference by speakers to convey the point that number devices which can connect to the internet is exponentially growing. The threat of cybercrime is very real and substantial.   &ldquo;[Hacking] is essentially a job,&rdquo; says Worley. &ldquo;The global economy lost $445 billion in 2013 which resulted in the loss of over 200,000 jobs due to the effects of cybercrime.&rdquo;   Kristen Hayduk, information security consultant for PricewaterhouseCoopers, expanded on the theme: &ldquo;[Cyber security] is no longer just an IT challenge, it&rsquo;s a business imperative. Forty-nine percent of CEOs today are concerned with cyber security attacks on their companies.&rdquo;   The overall impact of cybercrime is undeniable; however, the high-demand workforce in the field of cyber security remains predominantly male. While this is an extreme gender gap, there are few limitations that prevent professionals from entering this industry, none of which are specific to women. To the contrary, Worley told the audience that women are paid significantly more in the cyber security field than their female counterparts in other industries. Women make more in the cyber security industry relative to other industries and the pay gap between men and women in cyber security is much smaller than it is in other industries.   Joanne Martin, Cyber Information Security Officer for IBM, gave the closing keynote to the two-day conference and in it she presented critical career advice such as having both a mentor and a sponsor (who advocates on your behalf with others) to guide you through your goals in the workplace.   &ldquo;It&rsquo;s important to know what you want. Assuming things are safe is the worst thing you can do. The best thing we can do is develop a prepared mind,&rdquo; Martin said. &ldquo;In the workplace we need to know ourselves, know what we want, and how to get there through mentors.&rdquo;   Work in the cyber security industry is rewarding and attendees throughout the symposium were able to hear the stories successful professionals and live the experiences through workshops that included real-world security issues. Women speakers from Yahoo, Etsy, Facebook, Google and other companies all gave presentations on the different aspects of the cyber security field and its vast impact. Attendees participated on their computers during the workshops, learning new skills and techniques used in the industry.   A graduate student studying computer science, Mansi Patel, exclaimed, &ldquo;We were able to learn about the type of work performed in the industry&mdash;it&rsquo;s been interesting to learn about the network expanding and how we are socially connected.&rdquo;   The reasons to join this fast-paced industry are numerous and include helping to keep people safe&mdash;described by many speakers as an incredibly rewarding experience.   Worley said, &ldquo;When you&rsquo;re standing in front of a company and everything is at stake, you feel like a hero.&rdquo;   The NYU School of Engineering was one of the first universities to develop a cyber security program, launching its master&rsquo;s degree in cyber security in 1999. The school also offers numerous cyber security courses and extra-curricular opportunities for undergraduates. It has received all three Center of Excellence designations from the National Security Agency and the United States Cyber Command. Its cyber security program was previously singled out by the Sloan Consortium as the outstanding graduate online program.

Or should administrators even ask about the gender of prospective roommates? Some colleges experiment with \"gender-blind\" dorms          By        Jordan Mazza         (~1046 Words)                    jpm468&#64;gmail&#46;com                                    [Images Attached]                           NEW YORK &#8212; You and your best friend are the perfect match. You share countless qualities: you both like to go to bed early, stay organized, listen to Lady Gaga even eat cold pizza. But one of the few qualities you do not share is gender, and according to your schools housing policy, this means you cannot share a room either.    Such a scenario is increasingly common for college students across America. LGBT rights advocates say that traditional housing arrangements, which require that roommates identify as the same gender, are antiquated and unfair. Some straight students insist that they should be allowed to room regardless of gender, platonically or in a relationship. But many parents, students, and officials assert that the traditional policy is necessary to regulate student behavior.    This year, though, more than 30 colleges nationwide are launching unprecedented gender-neutral, or gender blind, housing policies. Such a policy permits upperclassmen to select their own roommates, with no restrictions on gender. Participating schools include Cornell, Stanford, Sarah Lawrence, the University of Michigan, and Dartmouth.    Jeffrey Chang is the co-founder of the National Student Genderblind Campaign, a grassroots advocacy organization for gender-neutral and LGBT -affirmative policies on college campuses. The groups website calls traditional housing policies relics of an outdated pasta time when all students were assumed to be straight, transgender and queer identities were brushed aside, and friendships between men and women were less common.    Columbia University is one school currently debating gender-neutral housing. Sean Udell is the president of the Columbia College Class of 2011 and leader of the Columbia Genderblind Housing Initiative. He said the newly-proposed policy goes beyond those gay males and straight females most comfortable in a Will &amp; Grace-style existence.    Our policy is first and foremost for transgender and gender-nonconforming students who dont feel comfortable with the current housing options, Udell said. This is taking gender out of the equation.    The groups initial policy proposal in December 2009 attracted considerable attention from local and national media, much of it negative. The first line of a New York Post article said Columbia students would be living in sin on their parents dime. The article also mentioned a parent who threatened to remove her son from housing as a result of the policy.    The media didnt get it. The Post clearly had a moral agenda, Udell said. His organizations website directly responds to the living in sin notion, pointing out that the current policy allows homosexual couples to live together, and the implementation of this [new] policy would eliminate a double standard.    The Columbia proposal passed almost unanimously in the universitys student senate. But just days before housing selection began in February, Dean of Students Kevin Shollenberger announced the policy would not be considered, due to insufficient student support. In response, the Columbia Genderblind Housing Initiative collected more than 1,000 student signatures for a petition, and hopes to draft a new proposal by September.    They just dont want to bother explaining this to incoming freshmen and parents, Udell said of his universitys decision to reject the policy.    Though gender-blind housing is generally not available to freshmen, who are assigned roommates, some parents of incoming students are wary of the option.  As a dad, Id feel a little awkward about it, said Bill Clarke of Bedford, N.Y., whose daughter is a prospective New York University student. The university currently allows mixed-sex suitemates, and is considering offering genderblind rooms.    It should be a kids choice, but then again theyre still kids, said one mother of another prospective NYU student who wished to remain anonymous. I would trust my son, but Im not sure everyones mature enough.    Columbia and NYU may look to the almost 50 colleges nationwide that have implemented some form of genderblind housing, including many in the last year.  Ross Maxwell is the housing services coordinator at Occidental College in Los Angeles, which introduced three gender-neutral rooms in 2009.    Weve expanded it quite a bit this year and added a lot more rooms, Maxwell said. So far, we havent had a whole lot of complaints, but I think it helps that our institution is small and our student body is more liberal.    Yet the idea of co-ed roommates irks some students and officials at other colleges.  I would be afraid as a male that if I had conflicts, the female would always win, and say I tried to sexually harass them, said Mark Cubbage, a junior at Bridgewater College in Bridgewater, Va. And it makes relationships between heterosexual couples awkward. Can you imagine having a girlfriend and her suspicions about your female roommate?    According to a recent study by Dr. Brian Willoughby, professor in the School of Family Life at Brigham Young University, co-ed dorms seem to be associated with higher levels of risk-taking activities like binge drinking.    Willoughby predicts co-ed rooms might force universities to handle notoriously unstable college relationships.    Housing offices with co-ed rooms are likely going to be faced with attempting to relocate individuals who have broken up with their roommate, Willoughby said. Some universities have tried to get around this by requiring students to sign a release claiming they will not enter into a relationship with their roommates, but we can probably all guess how effective that will be.    Chang said that at colleges that offer gender-blind housing, few participating residents are couples.    Most students are smart enough to know not to live together if theyre in a relationship, said Monroe France, director of the Office of LGBT Student Services at NYU and leading advocate of the universitys gender-blind housing proposal.    Dr. Gayatri Gopinath, director of Gender and Sexuality Studies at NYU, said she believes gender-blind housing embodies a logical evolution from earlier movements.    Gender-blind housing should absolutely be an option, Gopinath said. Early feminism was about womens empowerment, and this is a great progression to transgender empowerment. But we should remember that some people prefer the dynamic of single-sex housing.    Im sure theres some social value to the traditional policy, Udell said. But really its about choice. Everyone at this school is an adult, and should be able to make decisions for themselves.    Jordan Mazza studies journalism at New York University.                      A movement to allow college students to choose roommates of either gender is spreading.

Over the course of the two-day conference, students and mid-career professionals alike took part in presentations and workshops presented by some of the most powerful women in the cyber security industry. With the gender gap in the cyber security field at such a significant margin, companies are more eager to seek out women interested in joining this growing industry.   The atmosphere at the symposium was rollicking at times, edge-of-your-seat thrilling at others, and&mdash;because every CISO and industry pro who participated was deeply invested in providing guidance and mentorship to the attendees--always warmly supportive.   The rollicking came courtesy of Shyama Rose, the VP of Information Security at entertainment behemoth Live Nation, who strode the stage looking just as rock-and-roll as any recording artist her company has ever worked with. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re women and you&rsquo;re awesome, so own it,&rdquo; she exhorted the audience, explaining that female cyber security experts should never apologize for their gender or feel intimidated by their male counterparts. &ldquo;Besides,&rdquo; she asserted, &ldquo;I guarantee that you will be the life of every party when you tell people you hack for a living, because, really, how cool is that?&rdquo;   The edge-of-your-seat thrills came when one of Saturday&rsquo;s most highly anticipated speakers, speacial agent with the U.S. Secret Service, took to the stage to talk about her work. She explained that teams of agents are always monitoring social media sites like Twitter and Facebook&mdash;an absolute necessity since more than half of the threats made against the President are now made online. Agents are also consistently watching the so-called Dark Web&mdash;home to black markets that deal in illegal drugs, stolen credit cards, unlawful pornography, and other such items. Criminals get careless, she asserted, dropping digital clues that eventually lead to their arrest.   Lest you think that agents assigned to cyber security details remain cooped up at their desks all day, the agent explained that they are often out in the field, securing electronic evidence at crime scenes and traveling in advance to venues that will be hosting their high-level protectees. &ldquo;Buildings have integrated systems now,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Elevators, HVAC systems, fire sprinklers are all networked together, and we have to be ready to act if anything goes wrong.&rdquo;   The global impact and glaring need for cyber security is huge. Candace Worley, McAfee&rsquo;s Senior Vice President and General Manager of Endpoint Security, expressed the growing need for cyber security professionals by defining what it protects against. &ldquo;A cybercrime is a crime in which a computer is the subject of a crime,&rdquo; Worley said. &ldquo;Cyber security is the profession to thwart cybercrime.&rdquo;   This is a new era of computing. The term, &ldquo;The internet of things,&rdquo; was used several times throughout the conference by speakers to convey the point that number devices which can connect to the internet is exponentially growing. The threat of cybercrime is very real and substantial.   &ldquo;[Hacking] is essentially a job,&rdquo; says Worley. &ldquo;The global economy lost $445 billion in 2013 which resulted in the loss of over 200,000 jobs due to the effects of cybercrime.&rdquo;   Kristen Hayduk, information security consultant for PricewaterhouseCoopers, expanded on the theme: &ldquo;[Cyber security] is no longer just an IT challenge, it&rsquo;s a business imperative. Forty-nine percent of CEOs today are concerned with cyber security attacks on their companies.&rdquo;   The overall impact of cybercrime is undeniable; however, the high-demand workforce in the field of cyber security remains predominantly male. While this is an extreme gender gap, there are few limitations that prevent professionals from entering this industry, none of which are specific to women. To the contrary, Worley told the audience that women are paid significantly more in the cyber security field than their female counterparts in other industries. Women make more in the cyber security industry relative to other industries and the pay gap between men and women in cyber security is much smaller than it is in other industries.   Joanne Martin, Cyber Information Security Officer for IBM, gave the closing keynote to the two-day conference and in it she presented critical career advice such as having both a mentor and a sponsor (who advocates on your behalf with others) to guide you through your goals in the workplace.   &ldquo;It&rsquo;s important to know what you want. Assuming things are safe is the worst thing you can do. The best thing we can do is develop a prepared mind,&rdquo; Martin said. &ldquo;In the workplace we need to know ourselves, know what we want, and how to get there through mentors.&rdquo;   Work in the cyber security industry is rewarding and attendees throughout the symposium were able to hear the stories successful professionals and live the experiences through workshops that included real-world security issues. Women speakers from Yahoo, Etsy, Facebook, Google and other companies all gave presentations on the different aspects of the cyber security field and its vast impact. Attendees participated on their computers during the workshops, learning new skills and techniques used in the industry.   A graduate student studying computer science, Mansi Patel, exclaimed, &ldquo;We were able to learn about the type of work performed in the industry&mdash;it&rsquo;s been interesting to learn about the network expanding and how we are socially connected.&rdquo;   The reasons to join this fast-paced industry are numerous and include helping to keep people safe&mdash;described by many speakers as an incredibly rewarding experience.   Worley said, &ldquo;When you&rsquo;re standing in front of a company and everything is at stake, you feel like a hero.&rdquo;   The NYU School of Engineering was one of the first universities to develop a cyber security program, launching its master&rsquo;s degree in cyber security in 1999. The school also offers numerous cyber security courses and extra-curricular opportunities for undergraduates. It has received all three Center of Excellence designations from the National Security Agency and the United States Cyber Command. Its cyber security program was previously singled out by the Sloan Consortium as the outstanding graduate online program.

Or should administrators even ask about the gender of prospective roommates? Some colleges experiment with \"gender-blind\" dorms          By        Jordan Mazza         (~1046 Words)                    jpm468&#64;gmail&#46;com                                    [Images Attached]                           NEW YORK &#8212; You and your best friend are the perfect match. You share countless qualities: you both like to go to bed early, stay organized, listen to Lady Gaga even eat cold pizza. But one of the few qualities you do not share is gender, and according to your schools housing policy, this means you cannot share a room either.    Such a scenario is increasingly common for college students across America. LGBT rights advocates say that traditional housing arrangements, which require that roommates identify as the same gender, are antiquated and unfair. Some straight students insist that they should be allowed to room regardless of gender, platonically or in a relationship. But many parents, students, and officials assert that the traditional policy is necessary to regulate student behavior.    This year, though, more than 30 colleges nationwide are launching unprecedented gender-neutral, or gender blind, housing policies. Such a policy permits upperclassmen to select their own roommates, with no restrictions on gender. Participating schools include Cornell, Stanford, Sarah Lawrence, the University of Michigan, and Dartmouth.    Jeffrey Chang is the co-founder of the National Student Genderblind Campaign, a grassroots advocacy organization for gender-neutral and LGBT -affirmative policies on college campuses. The groups website calls traditional housing policies relics of an outdated pasta time when all students were assumed to be straight, transgender and queer identities were brushed aside, and friendships between men and women were less common.    Columbia University is one school currently debating gender-neutral housing. Sean Udell is the president of the Columbia College Class of 2011 and leader of the Columbia Genderblind Housing Initiative. He said the newly-proposed policy goes beyond those gay males and straight females most comfortable in a Will &amp; Grace-style existence.    Our policy is first and foremost for transgender and gender-nonconforming students who dont feel comfortable with the current housing options, Udell said. This is taking gender out of the equation.    The groups initial policy proposal in December 2009 attracted considerable attention from local and national media, much of it negative. The first line of a New York Post article said Columbia students would be living in sin on their parents dime. The article also mentioned a parent who threatened to remove her son from housing as a result of the policy.    The media didnt get it. The Post clearly had a moral agenda, Udell said. His organizations website directly responds to the living in sin notion, pointing out that the current policy allows homosexual couples to live together, and the implementation of this [new] policy would eliminate a double standard.    The Columbia proposal passed almost unanimously in the universitys student senate. But just days before housing selection began in February, Dean of Students Kevin Shollenberger announced the policy would not be considered, due to insufficient student support. In response, the Columbia Genderblind Housing Initiative collected more than 1,000 student signatures for a petition, and hopes to draft a new proposal by September.    They just dont want to bother explaining this to incoming freshmen and parents, Udell said of his universitys decision to reject the policy.    Though gender-blind housing is generally not available to freshmen, who are assigned roommates, some parents of incoming students are wary of the option.  As a dad, Id feel a little awkward about it, said Bill Clarke of Bedford, N.Y., whose daughter is a prospective New York University student. The university currently allows mixed-sex suitemates, and is considering offering genderblind rooms.    It should be a kids choice, but then again theyre still kids, said one mother of another prospective NYU student who wished to remain anonymous. I would trust my son, but Im not sure everyones mature enough.    Columbia and NYU may look to the almost 50 colleges nationwide that have implemented some form of genderblind housing, including many in the last year.  Ross Maxwell is the housing services coordinator at Occidental College in Los Angeles, which introduced three gender-neutral rooms in 2009.    Weve expanded it quite a bit this year and added a lot more rooms, Maxwell said. So far, we havent had a whole lot of complaints, but I think it helps that our institution is small and our student body is more liberal.    Yet the idea of co-ed roommates irks some students and officials at other colleges.  I would be afraid as a male that if I had conflicts, the female would always win, and say I tried to sexually harass them, said Mark Cubbage, a junior at Bridgewater College in Bridgewater, Va. And it makes relationships between heterosexual couples awkward. Can you imagine having a girlfriend and her suspicions about your female roommate?    According to a recent study by Dr. Brian Willoughby, professor in the School of Family Life at Brigham Young University, co-ed dorms seem to be associated with higher levels of risk-taking activities like binge drinking.    Willoughby predicts co-ed rooms might force universities to handle notoriously unstable college relationships.    Housing offices with co-ed rooms are likely going to be faced with attempting to relocate individuals who have broken up with their roommate, Willoughby said. Some universities have tried to get around this by requiring students to sign a release claiming they will not enter into a relationship with their roommates, but we can probably all guess how effective that will be.    Chang said that at colleges that offer gender-blind housing, few participating residents are couples.    Most students are smart enough to know not to live together if theyre in a relationship, said Monroe France, director of the Office of LGBT Student Services at NYU and leading advocate of the universitys gender-blind housing proposal.    Dr. Gayatri Gopinath, director of Gender and Sexuality Studies at NYU, said she believes gender-blind housing embodies a logical evolution from earlier movements.    Gender-blind housing should absolutely be an option, Gopinath said. Early feminism was about womens empowerment, and this is a great progression to transgender empowerment. But we should remember that some people prefer the dynamic of single-sex housing.    Im sure theres some social value to the traditional policy, Udell said. But really its about choice. Everyone at this school is an adult, and should be able to make decisions for themselves.    Jordan Mazza studies journalism at New York University.

A rebellious visionary who was unabashedly invested in Rastafari religion, Marley and his group the Wailers became known the world over for songs of universal love and Biblical prophecy, including \"No Woman, No Cry,\" \"Jammin',\" and others. Although Marley died of cancer in 1981, the singer/songwriter left behind a legacy of socially conscious work that continues to remain popular with audiences worldwide. This unique course charts the life and art of Bob Marley, focusing on his engagement with Africa; and the social/spiritual as well as commercial aspects of his involvement with the UK. The Wailers story represents the arc of Jamaican music -- and with it the evolution of a post-colonial generation's identity. Students will receive a thorough grounding in the roots of Jamaican music: slavery and colonialism, the music of Independence; as well as the Wailers and Marley's own artistic progress. Students will ultimately write a research paper on Marley or a related subject or issue in recorded music.   001 70061 WF 02:00pm - 05:15pm     194M 305     LEC 2.0     This section meets from 1/4/2011 to 1/21/2011    UNDERGRADUATE COURSE.

In general, we will focus on how the psychoanalytic method takes narrative seriously that is, at its word, or literally at the same time as it recognizes that whatever is articulated may be in a negative or canted (in other words, encoded) relation to what it means. We will explore how time, memory and history signify in psychoanalytic frameworks, and ask what literature and poetics might share with psychoanalysis. Finally, we will debate the validity of what might be called Freud's reductionism in relation to drive theory and the sexual instincts.   001 70030 MTWR 02:00pm - 05:30pm     1WP     SEM 4.0 CORNYETZ    This section meets from 1/4/2011 to 1/20/2011    UNDERGRADUATE COURSE. TUITION COST: $4,464.00.   K20.1567 - THE ARABIAN NIGHTS Show Description   The Arabian Nights (The Thousand and One Nights) is one of the most fascinating \"world\" texts. Since its translation to and publication in European languages it has captivated the imagination of countless writers and artists such as Poe, Joyce, Borges, Mahfouz, Rushdie, and Pasolini. It continues to plays a disproportionate role in constructing and perpetuating an essentialized and imaginary East, populated by violent and hypersexual beings. The narratives of the Nights and the cultural archive they have spawned have had a fascinating influence on literary and artistic production, popular culture and political imagination. The course introduces students to this important world masterpiece and the debates surrounding it. We will start out by briefly tracing the genealogy of this collectively authored and anonymous text, its collection and versions and the cultural context of its translation and popularity in the west. We will then explore the literary structure and narrative strategies and dynamics of the Nights, read some of its most famous cycles and discuss how they have been read from a variety of perspectives, focusing primarily gender and sexuality, power and politics, and otherness and boundaries. In the last part of the course we will read some of the modern literary works inspired by the Nights (Borges, Mahfouz, and Rushdie) and will watch how the Nights fared in adaptations in Hollywood, Bollywood, and elsewhere and will end with a film by the Italian director Pasolini. All readings will be in English. In addition to the Nights, readings may include Said, Mahfouz, Borges, Rushdie and others.   001 70044 MTWR 10:00am - 01:30pm     1WP     SEM 4.0 ANTOON    This section meets from 1/4/2011 to 1/20/2011    UNDERGRADUATE COURSE.

But if you mouth it, as many of our players do, I had as lief the town crier spoke my lines. Hamlet, (III.ii) Taking our cue from Shakespeare himself, this course will introduce students to methods of approaching the text from an actor's perspective. We will investigate several interpretive techniques that help the performer make the connections between the text, mind, and body. Special focus will be given to the development of a strong vocal instrument and bold interpretive choices that embrace the muscularity of the language. We will explore the structure of the language and how the structure helps the performer make sense of the complexities within the text as well as specific choices related to character and action. The course will also feature a screening component where we examine the range of interpretation of the plays as demonstrated in the work of actors and directors by viewing contrasting versions of the same scene from video and film. Students will work on speeches and scenes from the canon and present their work in class. Students will also keep a journal and attend performances of a Shakespearean play in New York City.   001 70029 MTWR 02:00pm - 05:30pm         SEM 4.0 HORTON    This section meets from 1/4/2011 to 1/20/2011    UNDERGRADUATE COURSE.

K55.9750 - ISTANBUL: MAPPING THE PAST IN THE PRESENT Show Description   From its early centuries as a Greek colony and Roman center, to its unique role as the imperial capital of both the Byzantine and the Ottoman Empires, to its latest distinction as a European Cultural Capital of 2010, Istanbul's vaunted history spans over two and a half millennia. The city has been the site of dramatic shifts in global power, politics, and culture. Even now, its very form which preserves, in its oldest parts, monuments from the ancient, Byzantine, and Ottoman pasts alongside one another commemorates the varied traditions that have contributed to its rich history. In this course, the city itself will serve as the foundation for our investigation of the ways in which Istanbul's pasts have been physically memorialized, narrated, and incorporated into the urban landscape. We will consider this landscape from a horizontal perspective by first mapping existing monuments in relationship to one another and considering the impact of the past on the current experiences of the city's space. We will then map the city from a vertical perspective, addressing what is preserved, reused, or destroyed at pivotal historical moments, and exploring how the physical space at that moment reflects the changing identity of the city. The following monuments and sites in Istanbul's Old City will serve as the center of our discussion: the Roman Hippodrome and Cisterns, the Hagia Sophia, the Suleymaniye Mosque, the Sultan Ahment Mosque, Topkapi Palace. We will also visit the neighborhoods in the New City that provide a contrast to such sites. These may include: Beyoglu, Galata, Kuzguncuk, and Kadikoy.   001 &gt; 70045  *To Be Arranged*         SEM 4.0 FRANKS    This section meets from 1/4/2011 to 1/18/2011    UNDERGRADUATE COURSE.

Yet genocide remains a tragic part of the human experience. Its persistence raises urgent questions: Is genocide preventable? Is it an inescapable aspect of human nature, or the weapon of the grossly-deviant vicious? Can policymakers detect early signs of genocide and prevent it from occurring? Or is punishment after the act of genocide the only viable instrument of international policy? This course will explore these and other questions by examining genocide in an historic and legal context. Proposed policy solutions will be evaluated through a focus on such case studies as Armenia, Ukraine, Cambodia, and the ongoing genocide in Darfur.   001 50013 TWRF 01:00pm - 04:00pm     SILV 712     LEC 4.0     This section meets from 1/4/2011 to 1/21/2011    UNDERGRADUATE COURSE.

Maybe you post a picture of yourself at a party on Facebook or you enter the due date of an assignment in iCal on your iPhone. Of course, these instances are simply ways to share events and remember deadlines -- or are they? How can we shape the digital detritus of our lives into something more artful and thoughtful? How can we sharpen our critical thinking skills about these everyday tools in order to create something new? This course will ask students to develop, design and produce a new form of written and visual media.

But we shouldn't forget that \"form\" also has a material component. Short stories could be published in magazines, newspapers or hardbound collections. What do these material forces mean for how the stories were originally read? How does the way we encounter these stories now change our view of them? Authors studied include Poe, Hawthorne, Stephen Crane, Henry James, Louisa May Alcott, and Paul Lawrence Dunbar, among others. Periodicals will include The New Yorker, Harper's, Blackwood's, and Collier's Magazine. We will end the course with stories chosen by students from Best American Short Fiction 2010.

While the bold forms and engaging theatricality of baroque style characterize many examples, artists also produced intensely perceived portraits and starkly realistic compositions that reflected a keen and unflinching view of nature. Works by masters such as Caravaggio, Bernini, Velazquez, and Ribera will be explored in class lectures and in visits to New York collections, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Frick Collection, allowing the close study of significant artworks.   001 70074 MTWRF 12:30pm - 03:20pm         LEC 4.0 STAFF, TBA    This section meets from 1/4/2011 to 1/21/2011    UNDERGRADUATE COURSE.

We will address the importance of newer media (photography, film, video, installation, performance, digital art) and the ongoing tension between object-based and conceptual practices. Topics include postmodernism, appropriation, institutional critique, commodities and the market, identity politics, the AIDS crisis, the so-called culture wars, and globalization.

J75.0115 - NEW YORK AND MODERNITY Show Description   Modernism was a broad movement in literature, arts, music and architecture that flourished first in Europe and then the United States between from the turn into the twentieth century until just after the Second World War. This course will examine the ways in which New Yorkers reshaped European modernism and created a distinctive legacy that marks the city to this day. We will explore the reciprocal relationship between modernism and the city, investigating how modernism was shaped by urban experience and how, in turn, modernism helped to mold our conception of the modern city. We will investigate the parallels and contrasts among a variety of forms including literature, film, art, music, and architecture, stressing the uneven developments of the period, with special attention paid to the tension between highbrow and lowbrow forms. Coursework will be supplemented with film showings and outings that will include concerts, plays, museum trips, and walking tours. One of the goals of the course will be to see our investigation of New Yorks relationship to modernism as a case study in the relationship between urban culture and modernity more generally. Students will develop a set of conceptual tools that will enable them to analyze modern urban life not only in New York but in other cities around the globe, from London to Abu Dhabi to Shanghai.   002 &gt; 15022  *To Be Arranged*         SEM 4.0 PATELL    This section meets from 1/4/2011 to 1/20/2011    COURSE MEETS AT NYU IN NEW YORK.
