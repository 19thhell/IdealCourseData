In this course, students learn to apply a range of social media - &ldquo;wikis, games, digital video stories and mini-movies, social networking, and virtual worlds - as they work in teams to develop a curriculum module for both teaching and learning. Students will use the Perspectivity Framework, a framework that enables stakeholders to layer diverse \"points of viewing\" using the appropriate technologies required to investigate a complex topic.    EDCT-GE 2015 Interaction Design for Learning Environments    30 hours 3 credits Spring This design course builds on cognitive and cultural theory as well as design theory, translating them into approaches to the design of the representation of information and design of interaction in media environments. Interaction design discussions will explore issues such as types and levels of interactivity, levels of user control, pattern languages, and media-specific instructional strategies for different levels of engagement, and will result in the design of wire frames of a learning environment. For the visual design, discussions will explore topics such as the semiotics of visual representations, use of metaphors, and development of a visual language, and will result in drafts of storyboards of the visual design of the environment.    EDCT-GE 2017 Architecture of Learning Environments    30 hours 3 credits Spring In this course, we will examine the architectural issues involved in designing learning environments by becoming designers of an Atelier. In other words, we will be practicing the theory. Our objective is to gain both theoretical and practical knowledge of the field of design and user experience. Students are not expected to become professional Content (Information) Architects (IAs) when they have completed this course. Instead they are expected to gain a repertoire of approaches and ideas that will enable them to become knowledgeable members of design teams where emerging technologies are used to advance learning, in either academic or industrial settings.    EDCT-GE 2018 Integrating Educational Technology in Teaching &amp; Learning    10 hours 1 credits Fall, Spring, Summer Prepares students to integrate digital media and technology into learner curricula. Through demonstrations, hands-on use, and application projects, students gain experience with the roles digital tools play to support teaching methods and learning strategies associated with a continuum of learner- and teacher-centered educational approaches and goals. Students develop skills in HTML, podcasting, digital storytelling, use of Web 2.0 tools (e.g., content management systems, social networks, e-portfolios), digital video, and virtual worlds, and common software packages in order to design and formatively assess engaging learning communities.    EDCT-GE 2031 Educational Technology in a Global Context    30 hours 3 credits Fall, Spring This course is designed to review how design issues interact with the dynamically evolving global context. Topics include: What does it mean to think globally? How do global dynamics affect career trajectories? What are the key cultural and curricular differences that divide the world? Globalization positives and negatives. The cultural homogenization thesis. The neocolonialism thesis. How educational norms and institutions vary across the globe. Are there lessons to be learned from the global commercial gaming industry? Communicating across cultural boundaries. NGOs and the future of global networks. Rethinking design issues in a global context including the &ldquo;Digital Divide,&rdquo; mobile technology in the developing world, the ICT4D and appropriate technology initiatives. Course activities include individual and collaborative design projects applying key concepts from course materials.    EDCT-GE 2075 Digital Video Ethnography: Cultural Interpretations with New Media    30 hours 3 credits Spring Critical analysis, supported by readings, of selected contemporary research issues and problems, theories and methods in instructional media and technology, in historical perspective. In addition to common readings, students identify and individually research articles related to their research interests and critically assess the studies. Introduces students to software packages to anchor a conceptual understanding of primary statistical procedures and qualitative data analysis. The major task is to develop a research proposal that should inform the direction of their candidacy papers and serve as an initial draft of their dissertation proposals.    EDCT-GE 2095 Educational Communication and Technology Research    45 hours 3 credits Fall, Spring Capstone Project In this course, candidates for the Master of Arts degree develop their final project or thesis, a requirement for this degree. The purpose of the thesis is to provide students an opportunity to integrate their academic studies in the program and bring their learning to bear on a single project of personal and professional interest in a very concentrated way. This culmination of the ECT experience should demonstrate students' proficiency and skill in theory and practice and, in the process, take students to new levels of understanding in their chosen area of interest. The thesis project itself should also make a contribution to the learning of those for whom it is designed and to current knowledge and understanding in the field of educational communication and technology. Thesis alternatives include: (1) the design and development of media for learning; (2) a scholarly critical inquiry paper; (3) a pilot-scale research study; (4) an action media project; (5) a field service media project.

EDCT-GE 2153 Educational Video: Design and Production I    30 hours 3 credits Spring The design and production of educational video programming as well as video segments, both linear and interactive, to be integrated into educational online environments and multimedia programs -- distributed through diverse technology platforms for use in wide-ranging places of learning. Emphasis is on uses of those characteristics of motion picture, as a family of pictorial and iconic forms of representation, that have special potential to support different kinds of learning, as under-stood from the perspectives of cognitive science, constructivism, and other learning sciences. Students learn theoretical underpinnings of design principles and strategies/methods that support learning, and how to apply, use and embed those in such educational video genres as the public service announcement, public advocacy programming, mini-documentary, and social drama. Students do their own script-writing, production management, directing, digital production, editing, and graphics, primarily in crews and on location.    EDCT-GE 2154 Educational Video: Design and Production II    30 hours 3 credits Fall Intermediate design and production of educational video programs and video segments to be integrated into educational interactive environments. Emphasis is on the application of cognitive science and constructivist views of learning to design principles guiding uses of video's representational and structural affordances. Includes advanced instructional design and writing; producing and production management; directing; and the use of digital production, editing, and graphics technology (applications such as Photoshop and Flash may be used to create media to integrate into productions). Students work individually and in crews, on location.    EDCT-GE 2158 Educational Design for Media Environments    30 hours 3 credits Fall The purpose of this course is to provide an introduction to the principles and practices of instructional design for the development of media-based learning. We will address issues in the field of instructional design such as professional definitions and boundaries, different theoretical and philosophical approaches to the design of mediated learning environments, and issues surrounding the use of media in learning. We will then examine representative instructional design models including their components, methodologies, theoretical underpinnings, and the types of learning and learners they support. Emphasis will be given to a detailed study of the \"analysis phase\" of instructional design, including how to conduct varieties of needs assessments, and the \"design phase,\" including the use of theoretical perspectives in cognitive science, developmental psychology, and the learning sciences to inform decisions about instructional strategies and media selection in the design of learning environments.    EDCT-GE 2174 Cognitive Science and Educational Technology I    30 hours 3 credits Spring Introduction to cognitive science applied to teaching, learning, and the design of instructional media. Readings include developments in cognitive science and descriptions and analyses of instructional programs developed in a cognitive science framework. The design and implementation of cognitive aspects of learning and teaching strategies are examined through class demonstrations, discussions, on-line activities, readings, and projects.    EDCT-GE 2175 Cognitive Science and Educational Technology II    30 hours 3 credits Fall This course focuses on the social and cultural issues of learning as they relate to individual and group cognition in the context of media-rich technology learning environments. We will explore how educational technologies are often designed from particular theoretical approaches that are linked to the work of leading educational research communities. We will not only study the often hidden connection between the research community members and the technologies they affect, but also how these theories play upon each other in the invention of new paradigms for learning with technologies. In short, we will delve deeply into constructivism/constructionism, scaffolding, apprenticeship, distributed cognition, computer supported collaborative learning, knowledge building communities, the learning sciences, perspectivity and identity formation as they relate to the creation of successful and equitable learning environments for diverse populations of learners. Students conduct an evaluation of the embedded theories in an existing learning environment of their choice (such as Second Life, Logo, Scratch, NetLogo, The Sims).
