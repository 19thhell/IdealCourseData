You become a resourceful expert in such dynamic \ufb01elds as computer networks, VLSI design and testing, embedded systems design and computer architecture. Focusing on principles and concepts underlying the design and integration of hardware and software components and systems, this online Master&rsquo;s in Computer Engineering gives you what you must know to become a serious professional, con\ufb01dent in electronically controlled systems and devices.   NOTE: Please refer to the Course Catalog to view course descriptions by course number if information is not listed below.   Admissions Requirements   The admissions requirements for this program are parallel to the on-campus requirements. View the Computer Engineering, MS admissions requirements .   Curriculum   Course Requirements   One must complete a total of 30 credits, as described below, with an overall average of 3.0, to earn a Master of Science in Computer Engineering degree at the School of Engineering. In addition, an average of 3.0 is also required among all regular courses, not counting independent studies including thesis, projects and reading courses. At least 15 out of 30 credits should be graduate ECE credits (courses with EL-prefix). Remaining course can be either EL or CS prefixed courses.   Group 1: (6 credits)   Core Courses   3.00 Credits Introduction to Vlsi System Design EL-GY 5473 This course covers CMOS processing technology, MOS transistor theory, static/dynamic circuit and logic design techniques, circuit performance estimation, standard cells and gate arrays, clocking strategies, input/output structures, datapath, memory and control logic design. Advanced VLSI CAD tools are used for schematic capture, layout, timing analysis and simulations for functionality and performance. Prerequisite: Senior or Graduate status, CS-UY 2204 &amp; EE-UY 3114 or equivalent. 3.00 Credits Computer Architecture I CS-GY 6133 This course provides students with an understanding of computer-hardware subsystems, digital design strategies and fundamental computer-performance and capacity-improvement techniques. Combinational and sequential circuits are developed for the essential building blocks of computers. Binary number systems are presented in both human and computer algorithms. A uniprocessor computer is built from the blocks developed. An assembly language and an instruction set are presented. Processor implementation with a data path and hardwired and microprogrammed control is introduced. Performance evaluation of computers is studied. Basic pipelining is introduced to improve system performance. Memory-hierarchy alternatives are introduced to improve the capacity of the computing system. Prerequisite: Graduate standing. *Online version available.   Group 2: (21 credits)   Other graduate ECE and CSE courses (courses with EL and CS prefixes). With adviser approval up to two courses pertinent to computer engineering can be taken from other departments at NYU.
