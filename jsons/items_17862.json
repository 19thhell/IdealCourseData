What kind of professors teach in the department? Can I collaborate with fellow ITP students? What about with students from other departments? Can I take classes in another department? Can I transfer graduate credits from other schools? Does ITP offer any online or distance learning courses? How does ITP keep in touch with the larger new media industry? Where do ITP alumni work after graduation?  Departmental Requirements Admissions Process  What kind of classes does ITP offer? Please see our website for the current course listing . ITP provides a \"hands-on\" approach to teaching and classes tend to be project-driven.    ITP courses are divided into 3 Tiers:       Tier 1 are Foundation Courses and are required of all students in the department. If a student has particular knowledge and experience in an area that a Foundation Course covers, then the class may be waived with the approval of an ITP academic advisor.    Tier 2 consists of elective courses, divided between production and design workshops and seminars.    Tier 3 is the final thesis project where students work on a semester-long project which demonstrates competence in the field and is required of all students. top What kind of professors teach in the department? ITP has a core group of exceptional full-time faculty, which is augmented by a wide-ranging community of adjunct faculty members who are new media industry leaders. The faculty come from such areas as art, industrial design, computer science, game design, writing, media theory, and consulting, just to name a few. They bring their expertise from the real world to the collaborative classroom experience.    Please see the Admin &amp; Faculty for bios on our faculty members. top Can I collaborate with fellow ITP students? What about with students from other departments? Collaboration with other ITP students is a given, and happens in almost every class. This is an important emphasis of the department. ITP students wishing to foster collaborations with students from other graduate programs may certainly do so, but in such cases they would be expected to make their own connections, sometimes through the Tisch Graduate Student Organization (GSO), a governing body made up of student representatives from all the Tisch graduate departments. top Can I take classes in another department? ITP students can take up to 8 credits outside of the department. Students need the approval of an ITP academic advisor and approval from the other department. The classes need to be on the graduate level and related to the ITP course of study. top Can I transfer graduate credits from other schools? Students who have graduate credits that have not already been used towards the completion of a degree may be considered for transfer of credits towards ITP. ITP accepts up to 8 transfer credits. These credits need to be on the graduate level and related to the ITP course of study. Students need to have received an excellent grade (A) in any course they wish to transfer. Students need to provide the department with transcripts, course descriptions and syllabi. Acceptance of transfer credits is subject to the approval of the Chair. top Does ITP offer any online or distance learning courses? ITP does not have any online courses and does not have any plans for any in the near future. Online courses do not share the same general philosophy of the department where collaboration and group work are essential to the learning process. top How does ITP keep in touch with the larger new media industry? ITP regularly hosts special events that are open to current students, alumni and faculty of the department. At least once a week, guest speakers present to the students on various topics related to the industry. Past speakers have included new media entrepreneurs, multimedia artists, new media lawyers, educators, and alumni. See the News &amp; Events page .    ITP also coordinates recruitment with various new media companies and organizations seeking to hire current students and alumni for intern, freelance, and full-time positions. top Where do ITP alumni work after graduation? ITP alumni tend to find jobs in all industries doing many different kinds of work. Because we have such a diverse population of students coming from all different backgrounds, the type of work that is available to the ITP alumni is equally diverse. Some start their own businesses, others work for web development companies, and others work for large and small companies in all industries such as the non-profit sector, education, the art world, and e-commerce, to name just a few.    ITP graduates hold such job titles as:       Creative Director, Frog Design    Senior Designer, Pentagram Design    Director of Strategic Planning, Digital Media, Microsoft Corporation    Interactive Designer, American Museum of Natural History    Senior Creative Director, IBM.com    Applications Engineer in the Technology Development Group, Honeybee Robotics    Senior Designer/ Project Lead, IDEO    Producer of teenpeople.con, Time Interactive    Senior Vice President of Marketing, Infinium Labs    Interaction Designer of R&amp;D and Asst Director, Media Innovations (Mexico City)    Director of Interactive Media, WNYC New York Public Radio    Vice President of Product Development, Upoc Networks, Inc.
