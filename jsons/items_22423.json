Video Game Design: From Concept to Completion (NEW)        We know you like to play games . . . 91% of teens do, so you\u2019re not alone. But what about creating and developing games? Did you know that in 2013 the video game industry had over $93 BILLION in sales (and it continues to grow)? That is a really big number, and gaming is really big business.

A Craigslist-type marketplace? A turn-based storytelling game? You want it to be the next Uber or Seamless, but you don\u2019t know how to code. This course is intended for those with little to no experience in programming, to help translate their ideas into reality.   How is what you learn in this course different from the tools\u2014Wordpress, SquareSpace, Wix, and GoDaddy\u2014which allow you to build a website without knowing HTML? What those tools generally don't do is give you control over your application's flow. Let's say you're building a photo-sharing website, and you want your users to upload a photo, and then select some friends to send it to. You also want an e-mail to go to those friends, and you want that e-mail to have a link they can click on to rate the photo. And, let's say you want a page that shows each users' top-rated photos. Using popular website builders, something like this would be impossible. This course will teach you how to gain complete control over exactly what happens on your website, by defining custom categories of data (like &quot;ratings&quot; or &quot;photos&quot;) and by specifying situation-specific logic (&quot;if the photo's rating is greater than 3, make this headline red...&quot;).   You will spend time thinking about the functionality, design, and business considerations of your site, rather than the specific coding syntax. Taught by experienced software engineers and entrepreneurs, it will provide you with a real-world experience that will allow you to: transform your idea into a web or mobile app; develop the app without getting bogged down in the programming language syntax; and learn to create one-click integrations with services including social networks (Facebook, LinkedIn), analytics (Mixpanel), payments (Stripe), and interesting sources of data (iTunes Songs, Google Books).   Upon completion of this course, you will be able to build an interactive, multi-user app for laptop web browsers and mobile web browsers.

Video Game Design: From Concept to Completion (NEW)        We know you like to play games . . . 91% of teens do, so you\u2019re not alone. But what about creating and developing games? Did you know that in 2013 the video game industry had over $93 BILLION in sales (and it continues to grow)? That is a really big number, and gaming is really big business.   This hands-on course, designed for those with little to no experience in game development, will get you started on the path to learning what\u2019s behind some of the games you play, and will start you on a journey to becoming a game developer.   Working with experienced game designers, you will take a game\u2014from idea to completion\u2014and will learn what goes into making a video game from the ground up. You will focus on planning your idea, designing and creating the artwork for your game, and learning the basics of programming for games by creating the mechanics of your game within the Unity cross-platform game development engine. In addition, there will be a site visit to a game development studio during the week.

Web Apps Design Studio: Beyond Coding (NEW)        Have you ever been struck with a great idea for a web or mobile web app? A real-time voting app? A video-sharing social network? A Craigslist-type marketplace? A turn-based storytelling game? You want it to be the next Uber or Seamless, but you don\u2019t know how to code. This course is intended for those with little to no experience in programming, to help translate their ideas into reality.   How is what you learn in this course different from the tools\u2014Wordpress, SquareSpace, Wix, and GoDaddy\u2014which allow you to build a website without knowing HTML? What those tools generally don't do is give you control over your application's flow. Let's say you're building a photo-sharing website, and you want your users to upload a photo, and then select some friends to send it to. You also want an e-mail to go to those friends, and you want that e-mail to have a link they can click on to rate the photo. And, let's say you want a page that shows each users' top-rated photos. Using popular website builders, something like this would be impossible. This course will teach you how to gain complete control over exactly what happens on your website, by defining custom categories of data (like &quot;ratings&quot; or &quot;photos&quot;) and by specifying situation-specific logic (&quot;if the photo's rating is greater than 3, make this headline red...&quot;).   You will spend time thinking about the functionality, design, and business considerations of your site, rather than the specific coding syntax. Taught by experienced software engineers and entrepreneurs, it will provide you with a real-world experience that will allow you to: transform your idea into a web or mobile app; develop the app without getting bogged down in the programming language syntax; and learn to create one-click integrations with services including social networks (Facebook, LinkedIn), analytics (Mixpanel), payments (Stripe), and interesting sources of data (iTunes Songs, Google Books).   Upon completion of this course, you will be able to build an interactive, multi-user app for laptop web browsers and mobile web browsers.

Video Game Design: From Concept to Completion (NEW)        We know you like to play games . . . 91% of teens do, so you\u2019re not alone. But what about creating and developing games? Did you know that in 2013 the video game industry had over $93 BILLION in sales (and it continues to grow)? That is a really big number, and gaming is really big business.   This hands-on course, designed for those with little to no experience in game development, will get you started on the path to learning what\u2019s behind some of the games you play, and will start you on a journey to becoming a game developer.   Working with experienced game designers, you will take a game\u2014from idea to completion\u2014and will learn what goes into making a video game from the ground up.

This course is intended for those with little to no experience in programming, to help translate their ideas into reality.   How is what you learn in this course different from the tools\u2014Wordpress, SquareSpace, Wix, and GoDaddy\u2014which allow you to build a website without knowing HTML? What those tools generally don't do is give you control over your application's flow. Let's say you're building a photo-sharing website, and you want your users to upload a photo, and then select some friends to send it to. You also want an e-mail to go to those friends, and you want that e-mail to have a link they can click on to rate the photo. And, let's say you want a page that shows each users' top-rated photos. Using popular website builders, something like this would be impossible. This course will teach you how to gain complete control over exactly what happens on your website, by defining custom categories of data (like &quot;ratings&quot; or &quot;photos&quot;) and by specifying situation-specific logic (&quot;if the photo's rating is greater than 3, make this headline red...&quot;).   You will spend time thinking about the functionality, design, and business considerations of your site, rather than the specific coding syntax. Taught by experienced software engineers and entrepreneurs, it will provide you with a real-world experience that will allow you to: transform your idea into a web or mobile app; develop the app without getting bogged down in the programming language syntax; and learn to create one-click integrations with services including social networks (Facebook, LinkedIn), analytics (Mixpanel), payments (Stripe), and interesting sources of data (iTunes Songs, Google Books).   Upon completion of this course, you will be able to build an interactive, multi-user app for laptop web browsers and mobile web browsers.

Course Level: Intermediate This new course, aimed at second semester sophomores, is the launch pad of Television Writing in the department. Before taking any other TV writing courses, students must take Introduction To Television Writing. The course will introduce sophomores interested in TV writing to all aspects of what goes into the creation of a script for a TV program. It is also recommended for non-writers who wish to learn the fundamentals of TV writing as preparation for creating shows and working with writers. The course will also prepare students for other TV-writing courses in the departmental Television Progression. Half-hour comedy, both multi-cam and single cam, and Hour-long drama are the main focus of the course. Students will learn how to come up with storylines, what outlines and treatments entail, the difference between writing for primetime network and cable, collaboration, what it\u2019s like to be on a writing staff, creating an original Pilot and all aspects of writing for television. After taking Introduction To Television Writing, students will be ready to decide whether to move into comedy writing, hour-long drama writing or both. The course is also open to seniors with an interest in television writing who haven\u2019t taken other TV writing courses.
