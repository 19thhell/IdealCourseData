As part of the core curriculum of the NYU Wagner Masters program, Capstone teams spend an academic year addressing challenges and identifying opportunities for a client organization or conducting research on a pressing social question. Wagner's Capstone program provides students with a centerpiece of their graduate experience whereby they are able to experience first-hand turning the theory of their studies into practice under the guidance of an experienced faculty member. Projects require students to get up-to-speed quickly on a specific content or issue area; enhance key process skills including project management and teamwork; and develop competency in gathering, analyzing, and reporting out on data. Capstone requires students to interweave their learning in all these areas, and to do so in real time, in an unpredictable, complex, real-world environment.    Prerequisites: Complete the schoolwide core and declare an international specialization. PNP/MUP students: complete 2 international core courses.

As part of the core curriculum of the NYU Wagner Masters program, Capstone teams spend an academic year addressing challenges and identifying opportunities for a client organization or conducting research on a pressing social question. Wagner's Capstone program provides students with a centerpiece of their graduate experience whereby they are able to experience first-hand turning the theory of their studies into practice under the guidance of an experienced faculty member. Projects require students to get up-to-speed quickly on a specific content or issue area; enhance key process skills including project management and teamwork; and develop competency in gathering, analyzing, and reporting out on data. Capstone requires students to interweave their learning in all these areas, and to do so in real time, in an unpredictable, complex, real-world environment.    Prerequisites: Complete the schoolwide core and declare an international specialization. PNP/MUP students: complete 2 international core courses.

Students with an interest in global public service work gain a unique comparative interdisciplinary skill set that bridges cutting-edge conceptual thinking, critical analytical techniques, and concrete management skills. Students also learn the important and evolving ways that public and nonprofit institutional structures and managerial processes vary around the world and how major international agencies function.   The International Policy and Management specialization enables students to develop area-specific breadth and depth by clustering elective tracks in International Public Finance, International Public Management, International Public Policy, International Health or International Urban Planning.                    Required Specialization (International Core) Courses      Students must complete the following 9 credits:                        PADM-GP.2201 , Institutions, Governance, and International Development             PADM-GP.2202 , Politics of International Development             PADM-GP.2203 , International Economic Development: Governments, Markets, and Communities                        Students must also complete at least 6 credits from the following courses.
