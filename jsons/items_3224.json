Latinos put sofrito and adobo on &ldquo;everything from soup to chili, burgers, rice and eggs,&rdquo; she explains.      In 2001 Taveras earned a business degree with a human resources concentration and decided to pursue a master&rsquo;s in organizational behavior and human resources management at NYU-Poly. &ldquo;Poly intimidated me at first because of my liberal arts background among all the engineers,&rdquo; she admits. But she stayed the course and was awarded her MS degree in 2006. She subsequently worked in human resources at the Sesame Workshop, the organization behind the popular educational program Sesame Street, for almost five years, but she never lost sight of her first love: cooking.     Last fall Taveras and her best friend, Susana Columna, founded Chulita&rsquo;s Famous, which makes two types of sofrito, a mix of vegetables, herbs and spices that season traditional Spanish food, and two adobos, a dry rub with a base of garlic that most Latinos use a lot. &ldquo;Adobo is like our salt,&rdquo; says Taveras, who points out that Chulita&rsquo;s adobo is organic and low in sodium, with no fillers. Chulita&rsquo;s sofrito uses only fresh, natural ingredients with no artificial additives or preservatives.          Chulita&rsquo;s currently sells its products online and in gourmet specialty stores throughout NYC. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m targeting time-strapped individuals and people who like to know what they&rsquo;re putting in their food,&rdquo; Taveras says. &ldquo;We want to get our sofrito into the hands of people who will use it every day. Nowadays who cooks homemade meals? I don&rsquo;t even cook as often as I like to! I don&rsquo;t have time! Which is why sofrito is so great&mdash;it&rsquo;s not complex, but it makes a meal. It&rsquo;s the Latino secret to eating homemade, wholesome meals every day.&rdquo;      &ldquo;We want to get our sofrito into the hands of people who will use it every day. Nowadays who cooks homemade meals?&rdquo;       &ldquo;Chulita&rdquo; means &ldquo;sassy girl,&rdquo; which Taveras says fits her business to a tee. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve had to be persistent and confident that our idea will succeed,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;We honor both traditional Latin cooking and contemporary tastes. To embrace both means that you&rsquo;re pretty bold.&rdquo; Their logo is based on a traditional Dominican doll.      Taveras says her education has been invaluable as she launches her business. &ldquo;At Poly I learned how to create a vision, organize it and execute it,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;My education there definitely helped me. I&rsquo;m blessed to think outside the box and pursue my childhood passion of cooking. Family and cooking and being social are just as important as being successful in corporate America.&rdquo;     Even though Chulita&rsquo;s Famous is less than a year old, it is already seeing some success and was one of four winners of the 2012 Summer Fancy Food Show Contest, sponsored by the NYC Economic Development Corporation to support local food manufacturers.      Taveras has big plans for the future. &ldquo;First of all, I would love to expand the business and create manufacturing plants that would bring jobs to New York City,&rdquo; she says. Her ambitions also run to introducing her traditional food to more people. &ldquo;A lot of Americans feel Latin food is difficult to prepare and isn&rsquo;t healthy. I want to change that perception and let people know Latin food is healthy and easy to make at home. A spoonful of sofrito and voila, you&rsquo;re done. Five years down the line I&rsquo;d like to be on television showing people how easy Latino cooking is.&rdquo;     Chulita&rsquo;s is good for everyone from beginners to gourmet cooks, Taveras concludes. &ldquo;With sofrito you don&rsquo;t have to be a great cook&mdash;your food is still tasty.&rdquo;                                Facebook Twitter Linked In    Cable The alumni magazine of NYU Polytechnic School of Engineering"}]},

The course is designed for students who want to perfect their Spanish as they expand their knowledge regarding literature, cinema, and social and political problems that exist today within modern Argentine society. The reading of different dramatic texts and viewing of various films throughout the semester will serve to expand lexicon, strengthen grammar and improve the student's style. The objective of this course is that the students familiarize themselves with everyday language of current newspapers and magazines, at the same time as they enter into the world of Spanish literature.   The most important goal of the course is to offer a methodologically simple approximation that helps the student to develop a greater verbal and communicative dexterity. To this end, every week the students will analyze and debate the cultural and literary content texts that are to be studied and every two weeks the students will present a written composition of the topics covered in class. In the classroom linguistic correction will be emphasized along with auditory practice through the use of a wide range of materials and resources: theoretical explanations, comprehension and vocabulary exercises, film viewing, as well as exercises that highlight certain morphological aspects or grammatical usage of Spanish.

Mitos, \u00edconos y tradiciones inventadas is an advanced conversation course, which seeks to make students familiar with the rich and complex history of Latin America through the study of some of its most known and iconic cultural expressions. It does also work as an introductory map to the most influential and widespread approaches in Latin American social sciences, cultural studies and literary criticism. Thus, students will not only have a first encounter with key historical processes that lie behind some well know cultural icons, but also will be introduced to arguments and ways of writing that help constitute modern Latin American educated Spanish. The course will be structured in seven topics; each topic will be covered in two weeks. During these four classes, students will be exposed to different kinds of cultural materials, including literary texts, film, papers from several disciplines, theater plays, art shows and live concerts.

When Taught in Spanish, Prerequisite of Advanced Spanish language skills required. (NYU SPAN-UA 100 Advanced Grammar &amp; Composition or equivalent.)   The objective of the course is to analyze the social, cultural and political transformations experienced in Argentina during the XX century. The scheduled activities are divided into theory-practice classes and cultural visits. There are required readings for the classes which are usually based in a general bibliography that will give the student a factual context of each unit. Ideas exchange will take place, so the students should read the material in advance in order to continue with the course. The objective of cultural activities is to link the students with the material dimension of history, putting themselves in contact with crucial clues for its comprehension.

La lengua de Buenos Aires is an advanced conversation course, which seeks to make students familiar with the most outstanding features of the Spanish of the Rio de la Plata area. It does also work as an introductory map to the main problems and questions of the culture of the city of Buenos Aires. Through a lively discussion of current cultural conflicts in politics, literature, music, drama and film, the course will enhance the listening and reading abilities of the students, while improving their speaking and writing proficiency in Spanish. These said conflicts and their transformations are key to an understanding of the way porte\u00f1os speak and think. From a first section devoted to political discourse, we will move onto a consideration of its rhetorical precedents in argentine literature. This will give us the critical tools we need to further our inquiries in other fields such as rock, drama, journalism and film.

With very few exceptions, students must have completed Critical Approaches before taking advanced literature courses taught in Spanish.   Sample Syllabus                                                                    Myths, Icons, and Invented Traditions: A Cultural History of Latin America -\u00a0SASEM-UG 9151 or SPAN-UA 9201 - 4 points                               Prerequisite: Open to students who have completed SPAN-UA 200 Critical Approaches (or equivalent), or to students enrolled concurrently in SPAN-UA 9200.     Mitos, \u00edconos y tradiciones inventadas is an advanced conversation course, which seeks to make students familiar with the rich and complex history of Latin America through the study of some of its most known and iconic cultural expressions. It does also work as an introductory map to the most influential and widespread approaches in Latin American social sciences, cultural studies and literary criticism. Thus, students will not only have a first encounter with key historical processes that lie behind some well know cultural icons, but also will be introduced to arguments and ways of writing that help constitute modern Latin American educated Spanish. The course will be structured in seven topics; each topic will be covered in two weeks. During these four classes, students will be exposed to different kinds of cultural materials, including literary texts, film, papers from several disciplines, theater plays, art shows and live concerts.   Sample Syllabus                                                                    Borges and Argentine Literature -\u00a0SPAN-UA\u00a09845 - 4 points                               Prerequisite: Open to students who have completed SPAN-UA 200 Critical Approaches (or equivalent), or to students enrolled concurrently in SPAN-UA 9200.     The course is designed to introduce students to the work of Jorge Luis Borges, one of the most influential writers of the twentieth century. Through reading, analysis, and discussion of short fiction or poems and critical bibliography, the students will examine the dichotomy civilization-barbarism in Borges works (in connection to the Argentine cultural tradition since nineteenth century); some key topics in his texts such as tigers, labyrinths and libraries; the relationship between writing and translation (specifically in the English translations of his fictions); the political aspects of the literature produced by Borges and other contemporary Argentine writers on Eva Per\u00f3n. The course will also develop the connections between Borges and other contemporary Argentine writers.

This course deals with themes of culture, cultural identity and the politics of culture and identity, with reference to five specific Latin American cases: a). Indigenous communities of the Amazon (Achuar) and the Pampas-Patagonia region (Mapuche, Rank\u00fclche); b) Andean peasants (Aymaras) and indigenous proletariat of the Chaco (Toba); c). working class and ethnic neighborhoods of the city. By means of this empirical survey we hope to illustrate and discuss the some of the different ideas that have come to the fore in recent debates about \u201cculture,\u201d including essentialism and constructivism; rethinking of the nature/culture dichotomy; and the idea of cultural identity as a right, as a strategy of domination or as a form of resistance, etc.     Sample Syllabus                                                                    Fotograf\u00eda y literatura en Am\u00e9rica Latina - SPAN-UA 9550 - 4 points                               Este curso se pregunta qu\u00e9 es y c\u00f3mo se lee una fotograf\u00eda.

In order to explore this rich and multi-layered landscape, this course wants to trace and reconstruct the historical detours of queer cultures in Buenos Aires and New York. Taking as starting point the present context of growing acceptance and inclusion of queer citizens both in Latin America and the US, the course revisits the last three decades in order to question the dominant and frequently reductive narratives of steady, lineal progress.

Over the last 50 years, millions of Latin Americans have experienced extraordinary shifts in their social, political, and cultural landscape, a result of the transformative effects of revolution or insurgency, state repression, popular resistance and social movements. We focus on events that had continental, hemispheric, and even global impact, including the Cuban Revolution of 1959, the military coups of the 1970s, and the Zapatista uprising in 1994. Drawing on a range of primary sources and cultural forms, we listen carefully to the voices of the major social actors of the time. Our sources are drawn from a wide range of media: newsprint, television broadcasts, transcripts, testimony, essay, documentary and feature film, art, and music. We deliberately mix artistic representations with documentary evidence to understand how the arts\u2014music, visual art, literature, film\u2014do not just reflect the reality around them, but are themselves vital sites for shaping and changing that reality and our imagination of it, both then and now.

Prerequisites: Introduction to Macroeconomics (ECON-UA 1) and Introduction to Microeconomics (ECON-UA 2), or Introduction to Economic Analysis (ECON-UA 5) or equivalents.   There are two parts to this course. In the first part of the course we will study two of the main financial asset markets: bond markets and stock markets. We will study the concept and determination of interest rates; the risk structure and the term structure of interest rates; stock pricing and the efficient markets hypothesis; cross-border arbitrage. We will also analyze financial structure in Argentina and other Latin American banks.   In the second part of the course we will study the monetary and financial system. We will study how money is created, the tools of monetary policy, the commercial banking industry and its links to monetary policy and the Central Bank, and how monetary policy affects the economy in general. In this part we will also analyze how market failures (such as information asymmetries) and distortionary policies (such as financial repression) may hinder the contribution of financial markets and monetary policy to macroeconomic stability. The roles of state-owned banks in Latin American economies will also be discussed.

Two sections, one in each city, will meet and collaborate simultaneously via internet to address several key questions: How are art and politics understood and expressed differently and similarly in these two American metropolises and why? How do shared aesthetic features of public art reflect the global circulation of urban creative modes? What do we learn about local politics from looking at the art and writing on a city\u2019s public spaces? Teams of students in both cities will conduct field work in selected neighborhoods to help create an archive of murals, graffiti, performances, and installations. Then, drawing from readings in history, art criticism, and urban studies, as well as from census and electoral data and using GIS technology, we will analyze how social and political processes like gentrification, inequality, and planning generate and reflect creative political expression as captured in our database, culminating in transnational, collaborative projects that explore what wisdom and truths America's streets continue to reveal, 500 years after conquest.

The experiential part will consist of 10 weekly hours of work within a pre-arranged organization. The academic part is meant to assist students in getting the most from this experience and provide theoretical and methodological elements to critically examine their experiences. It weaves together research design and methods with an empirical and theoretical examination of recent social phenomena in Argentina. We will use selected themes and topics to explore theoretical perspectives and selected aspects of contemporary Argentine society. In parallel we will explore how to construct a research project, collect data and analyze its contents.

This course introduces students to key concepts in health policy formation, implementation and evaluation in a global context. Using a comparative lens, students explore organization, financing and delivery of health care services and health systems around the world. We examine the role of governmental and non-governmental agencies in delivering care and contributing to a health care infrastructure using case studies and other materials in a comparative approach. Key lessons in the implementation of new health policies and initiatives are explored across the developing world, as well as in a US as students explore health system performance, the quality and cost of care, the management of health care services, the process of health improvement and health reform. The course will use a multidisciplinary approach that employs sociological, political, economics, and ethical perspectives. The objective is to build an understanding of the fundamental ideas, issues, and problems currently debated in global health policy and management and to provide a foundation for future studies and careers in the global health field. Epidemiology in a Global World and Health and Society in a Global Context are recommended but not required pre-requisites for the course.

There is a central question for the course: Is there any singularity in Latin American media? The answer assumes that there is a specific relation between tradition and modernity in Latin American societies with many consequences for mass culture and media. The constitution of mass audiences in societies where literacy was not a universal value, made significant the development of audiovisual media. The course will focus on melodrama as a configuration that made possible the emergence of specific genres in Latin American cinema, radio and television. Particularly, the \u201ctelenovela\u201d is simultaneously an aesthetic, industrial and audience phenomenon with local and global circulation. Finally, the course will discuss the role of media in dictatorship and democratic processes. Censorship and alternative media enabled many different practices for radio journalists, filmmakers or contemporary bloggers.

Their roots, influences and characteristics. Their social and historical context. Their uniqueness and similarities. Emphasis in the rhythmic aspect of folk music as a foundation for dance and as a resource of cultural identity. The irruption of Latin American rhythms in the music market through the World Music\u00e2phenomenon.

Covering in parallel the evolution of the international system and the changing position of the region in that same system, the course attempts to reinterpret the frameworks of analysis as perceived from the Western Hemisphere. The student will be provided with a Latin American view of the main economic developments and political processes that have given shape to each stage in time- to the structure and dynamics of the international system. The ultimate goal is to make students aware that where you stand depends on where you sit by exposing them to alternate views on concepts they are already familiar with.

Queer Cultures and Democracy - SPAN-UA 9481 or SCA-UA 9844 - 4 points                               In the last ten years, several Latin American nations have witnessed decisive progress in the legal recognition of non-normative sexualities and gender identities. Argentina passed the same-sex marriage law in 2010 and the gender identity law in 2011, followed by Uruguay; Colombia approved the legal recognition of same sex couples, and in Mexico, Cuba, Brazil, the pressure of queer demands and visibility in the public sphere is stronger than ever. The conventional map of \u201cadvanced democracies\u201d crafting models of democratization that could be exported to less developed nations seems definitely challenged: a new understanding of the complex, and multiple temporalities of queer cultures in North and South America is more necessary than ever.    In order to explore this rich and multi-layered landscape, this course wants to trace and reconstruct the historical detours of queer cultures in Buenos Aires and New York. Taking as starting point the present context of growing acceptance and inclusion of queer citizens both in Latin America and the US, the course revisits the last three decades in order to question the dominant and frequently reductive narratives of steady, lineal progress. Our goal is precisely to advance a periodization sensitive to the nuances and contradictions of this complex historical transformation.

{"detail": [{"content": "Spice Girl | Cable                                                 Menu  Alumni Community Archives                                                                    Spice Girl                      When she was away at college, at Skidmore in upstate New York, Brooklyn native Gloribell Taveras found herself missing home cooking&mdash;especially Latino spices like adobo and sofrito. Latinos put sofrito and adobo on &ldquo;everything from soup to chili, burgers, rice and eggs,&rdquo; she explains.      In 2001 Taveras earned a business degree with a human resources concentration and decided to pursue a master&rsquo;s in organizational behavior and human resources management at NYU-Poly. &ldquo;Poly intimidated me at first because of my liberal arts background among all the engineers,&rdquo; she admits. But she stayed the course and was awarded her MS degree in 2006. She subsequently worked in human resources at the Sesame Workshop, the organization behind the popular educational program Sesame Street, for almost five years, but she never lost sight of her first love: cooking.     Last fall Taveras and her best friend, Susana Columna, founded Chulita&rsquo;s Famous, which makes two types of sofrito, a mix of vegetables, herbs and spices that season traditional Spanish food, and two adobos, a dry rub with a base of garlic that most Latinos use a lot. &ldquo;Adobo is like our salt,&rdquo; says Taveras, who points out that Chulita&rsquo;s adobo is organic and low in sodium, with no fillers. Chulita&rsquo;s sofrito uses only fresh, natural ingredients with no artificial additives or preservatives.          Chulita&rsquo;s currently sells its products online and in gourmet specialty stores throughout NYC. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m targeting time-strapped individuals and people who like to know what they&rsquo;re putting in their food,&rdquo; Taveras says. &ldquo;We want to get our sofrito into the hands of people who will use it every day. Nowadays who cooks homemade meals? I don&rsquo;t even cook as often as I like to! I don&rsquo;t have time! Which is why sofrito is so great&mdash;it&rsquo;s not complex, but it makes a meal. It&rsquo;s the Latino secret to eating homemade, wholesome meals every day.&rdquo;      &ldquo;We want to get our sofrito into the hands of people who will use it every day. Nowadays who cooks homemade meals?&rdquo;       &ldquo;Chulita&rdquo; means &ldquo;sassy girl,&rdquo; which Taveras says fits her business to a tee. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve had to be persistent and confident that our idea will succeed,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;We honor both traditional Latin cooking and contemporary tastes. To embrace both means that you&rsquo;re pretty bold.&rdquo; Their logo is based on a traditional Dominican doll.      Taveras says her education has been invaluable as she launches her business. &ldquo;At Poly I learned how to create a vision, organize it and execute it,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;My education there definitely helped me. I&rsquo;m blessed to think outside the box and pursue my childhood passion of cooking. Family and cooking and being social are just as important as being successful in corporate America.&rdquo;     Even though Chulita&rsquo;s Famous is less than a year old, it is already seeing some success and was one of four winners of the 2012 Summer Fancy Food Show Contest, sponsored by the NYC Economic Development Corporation to support local food manufacturers.      Taveras has big plans for the future. &ldquo;First of all, I would love to expand the business and create manufacturing plants that would bring jobs to New York City,&rdquo; she says. Her ambitions also run to introducing her traditional food to more people. &ldquo;A lot of Americans feel Latin food is difficult to prepare and isn&rsquo;t healthy. I want to change that perception and let people know Latin food is healthy and easy to make at home. A spoonful of sofrito and voila, you&rsquo;re done. Five years down the line I&rsquo;d like to be on television showing people how easy Latino cooking is.&rdquo;     Chulita&rsquo;s is good for everyone from beginners to gourmet cooks, Taveras concludes. &ldquo;With sofrito you don&rsquo;t have to be a great cook&mdash;your food is still tasty.&rdquo;                                Facebook Twitter Linked In    Cable The alumni magazine of NYU Polytechnic School of Engineering"}, {"content": "Courses - Spring 2015                                                                                                               NYU.edu requires JavaScript be enabled in your browser in order to use important features of the site.

The course is designed for students who want to perfect their Spanish as they expand their knowledge regarding literature, cinema, and social and political problems that exist today within modern Argentine society. The reading of different dramatic texts and viewing of various films throughout the semester will serve to expand lexicon, strengthen grammar and improve the student's style. The objective of this course is that the students familiarize themselves with everyday language of current newspapers and magazines, at the same time as they enter into the world of Spanish literature.   The most important goal of the course is to offer a methodologically simple approximation that helps the student to develop a greater verbal and communicative dexterity. To this end, every week the students will analyze and debate the cultural and literary content texts that are to be studied and every two weeks the students will present a written composition of the topics covered in class. In the classroom linguistic correction will be emphasized along with auditory practice through the use of a wide range of materials and resources: theoretical explanations, comprehension and vocabulary exercises, film viewing, as well as exercises that highlight certain morphological aspects or grammatical usage of Spanish.

Through the analysis of artistic images of Mexico , Peru, Brazil and Argentina, will discuss the role of visual representation in the process of conquest and colonization of the territory in Latin America, and later in the construction and consolidation of national states and regional identities. With the alternation of guided visits to museums in Buenos Aires and classes, students will have the opportunity to learn about artistic languages \u200b\u200b, techniques , iconography , production systems , and some aspects of Latin American history .

Mitos, \u00edconos y tradiciones inventadas is an advanced conversation course, which seeks to make students familiar with the rich and complex history of Latin America through the study of some of its most known and iconic cultural expressions. It does also work as an introductory map to the most influential and widespread approaches in Latin American social sciences, cultural studies and literary criticism. Thus, students will not only have a first encounter with key historical processes that lie behind some well know cultural icons, but also will be introduced to arguments and ways of writing that help constitute modern Latin American educated Spanish. The course will be structured in seven topics; each topic will be covered in two weeks. During these four classes, students will be exposed to different kinds of cultural materials, including literary texts, film, papers from several disciplines, theater plays, art shows and live concerts.

When Taught in Spanish, Prerequisite of Advanced Spanish language skills required. (NYU SPAN-UA 100 Advanced Grammar &amp; Composition or equivalent.)   The objective of the course is to analyze the social, cultural and political transformations experienced in Argentina during the XX century. The scheduled activities are divided into theory-practice classes and cultural visits. There are required readings for the classes which are usually based in a general bibliography that will give the student a factual context of each unit. Ideas exchange will take place, so the students should read the material in advance in order to continue with the course. The objective of cultural activities is to link the students with the material dimension of history, putting themselves in contact with crucial clues for its comprehension.

La lengua de Buenos Aires is an advanced conversation course, which seeks to make students familiar with the most outstanding features of the Spanish of the Rio de la Plata area. It does also work as an introductory map to the main problems and questions of the culture of the city of Buenos Aires. Through a lively discussion of current cultural conflicts in politics, literature, music, drama and film, the course will enhance the listening and reading abilities of the students, while improving their speaking and writing proficiency in Spanish. These said conflicts and their transformations are key to an understanding of the way porte\u00f1os speak and think. From a first section devoted to political discourse, we will move onto a consideration of its rhetorical precedents in argentine literature. This will give us the critical tools we need to further our inquiries in other fields such as rock, drama, journalism and film.

Introduction to literary analysis through close reading of texts from the early to modern periods of peninsular Spanish and Spanish American literatures. Engages students in the practice of textual explication, provides basic critical skills, and encourages reflection on literature as a system. This course is the gateway course for students interested in pursuing advanced literature courses in Spanish. With very few exceptions, students must have completed Critical Approaches before taking advanced literature courses taught in Spanish.

Mitos, \u00edconos y tradiciones inventadas is an advanced conversation course, which seeks to make students familiar with the rich and complex history of Latin America through the study of some of its most known and iconic cultural expressions. It does also work as an introductory map to the most influential and widespread approaches in Latin American social sciences, cultural studies and literary criticism. Thus, students will not only have a first encounter with key historical processes that lie behind some well know cultural icons, but also will be introduced to arguments and ways of writing that help constitute modern Latin American educated Spanish. The course will be structured in seven topics; each topic will be covered in two weeks. During these four classes, students will be exposed to different kinds of cultural materials, including literary texts, film, papers from several disciplines, theater plays, art shows and live concerts.

The course is designed to introduce students to the work of Jorge Luis Borges, one of the most influential writers of the twentieth century. Through reading, analysis, and discussion of short fiction or poems and critical bibliography, the students will examine the dichotomy civilization-barbarism in Borges works (in connection to the Argentine cultural tradition since nineteenth century); some key topics in his texts such as tigers, labyrinths and libraries; the relationship between writing and translation (specifically in the English translations of his fictions); the political aspects of the literature produced by Borges and other contemporary Argentine writers on Eva Per\u00f3n. The course will also develop the connections between Borges and other contemporary Argentine writers.

Indigenous communities of the Amazon (Achuar) and the Pampas-Patagonia region (Mapuche, Rank\u00fclche); b) Andean peasants (Aymaras) and indigenous proletariat of the Chaco (Toba); c). working class and ethnic neighborhoods of the city. By means of this empirical survey we hope to illustrate and discuss the some of the different ideas that have come to the fore in recent debates about \u201cculture,\u201d including essentialism and constructivism; rethinking of the nature/culture dichotomy; and the idea of cultural identity as a right, as a strategy of domination or as a form of resistance, etc.     Sample Syllabus                                                                    Fotograf\u00eda y literatura en Am\u00e9rica Latina - SPAN-UA 9550 - 4 points                               Este curso se pregunta qu\u00e9 es y c\u00f3mo se lee una fotograf\u00eda.

Over the last 50 years, millions of Latin Americans have experienced extraordinary shifts in their social, political, and cultural landscape, a result of the transformative effects of revolution or insurgency, state repression, popular resistance and social movements. We focus on events that had continental, hemispheric, and even global impact, including the Cuban Revolution of 1959, the military coups of the 1970s, and the Zapatista uprising in 1994. Drawing on a range of primary sources and cultural forms, we listen carefully to the voices of the major social actors of the time. Our sources are drawn from a wide range of media: newsprint, television broadcasts, transcripts, testimony, essay, documentary and feature film, art, and music. We deliberately mix artistic representations with documentary evidence to understand how the arts\u2014music, visual art, literature, film\u2014do not just reflect the reality around them, but are themselves vital sites for shaping and changing that reality and our imagination of it, both then and now.

There are two parts to this course. In the first part of the course we will study two of the main financial asset markets: bond markets and stock markets. We will study the concept and determination of interest rates; the risk structure and the term structure of interest rates; stock pricing and the efficient markets hypothesis; cross-border arbitrage. We will also analyze financial structure in Argentina and other Latin American banks.   In the second part of the course we will study the monetary and financial system. We will study how money is created, the tools of monetary policy, the commercial banking industry and its links to monetary policy and the Central Bank, and how monetary policy affects the economy in general. In this part we will also analyze how market failures (such as information asymmetries) and distortionary policies (such as financial repression) may hinder the contribution of financial markets and monetary policy to macroeconomic stability. The roles of state-owned banks in Latin American economies will also be discussed.

Two sections, one in each city, will meet and collaborate simultaneously via internet to address several key questions: How are art and politics understood and expressed differently and similarly in these two American metropolises and why? How do shared aesthetic features of public art reflect the global circulation of urban creative modes? What do we learn about local politics from looking at the art and writing on a city\u2019s public spaces? Teams of students in both cities will conduct field work in selected neighborhoods to help create an archive of murals, graffiti, performances, and installations. Then, drawing from readings in history, art criticism, and urban studies, as well as from census and electoral data and using GIS technology, we will analyze how social and political processes like gentrification, inequality, and planning generate and reflect creative political expression as captured in our database, culminating in transnational, collaborative projects that explore what wisdom and truths America's streets continue to reveal, 500 years after conquest.

This course introduces students to key concepts in health policy formation, implementation and evaluation in a global context. Using a comparative lens, students explore organization, financing and delivery of health care services and health systems around the world. We examine the role of governmental and non-governmental agencies in delivering care and contributing to a health care infrastructure using case studies and other materials in a comparative approach. Key lessons in the implementation of new health policies and initiatives are explored across the developing world, as well as in a US as students explore health system performance, the quality and cost of care, the management of health care services, the process of health improvement and health reform. The course will use a multidisciplinary approach that employs sociological, political, economics, and ethical perspectives. The objective is to build an understanding of the fundamental ideas, issues, and problems currently debated in global health policy and management and to provide a foundation for future studies and careers in the global health field. Epidemiology in a Global World and Health and Society in a Global Context are recommended but not required pre-requisites for the course.

Media, Culture, &amp; Communication                                                  Global Media Seminar: Latin America - MCC-UE 9455 - 4 points                               This course proposes a historical and cultural approach to the development of the popular press, cinema, radio, television and the contemporary processes of the new media. There is a central question for the course: Is there any singularity in Latin American media? The answer assumes that there is a specific relation between tradition and modernity in Latin American societies with many consequences for mass culture and media. The constitution of mass audiences in societies where literacy was not a universal value, made significant the development of audiovisual media. The course will focus on melodrama as a configuration that made possible the emergence of specific genres in Latin American cinema, radio and television. Particularly, the \u201ctelenovela\u201d is simultaneously an aesthetic, industrial and audience phenomenon with local and global circulation. Finally, the course will discuss the role of media in dictatorship and democratic processes. Censorship and alternative media enabled many different practices for radio journalists, filmmakers or contemporary bloggers.   Sample Syllabus                              Metropolitan Studies (Social &amp; Cultural Analysis)                                                    Internship Seminar and Fieldwork SCA-UA 9042 or INDIV-UG 9150 - 4 points                               Enrollment by permission only. Application required. Please visit the NYU Buenos Aires Internships Page for application information. Intermediate Spanish or above is strongly recommended.   This course requires a 90-minute weekly seminar and a minimum of 10 hours fieldwork a week at an approved internship field site. The seminar is designed to complement your internship fieldwork, exploring many different aspects of your organization and of Argentine Civil Society. Your goal is to finish the semester with an in-depth understanding of your agency. The course provides you with tools to analyze your organization\u2019s approach, its policies, its programs, and the political, legal, social, economic and cultural contexts in which it operates. Guest-speakers are invited to the seminar and case studies on Argentina civil society are discussed.&amp;nbsp; You will also spend time reflecting on the internship experience itself as a way to better understand your academic, personal, and career goals.     Sample Syllabus                                Music                                                  The Music of Latin America - MUSIC-UA 9155 - 4 points                                 When taught in Spanish section: Advanced Spanish language skills required. (NYU SPAN-UA 100 Advanced Grammar &amp; Composition or equivalent.)   This course is a journey through the different styles of Latin American Folk and Popular Music (LAFM), particularly those coming from Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay. Their roots, influences and characteristics. Their social and historical context. Their uniqueness and similarities. Emphasis in the rhythmic aspect of folk music as a foundation for dance and as a resource of cultural identity. The irruption of Latin American rhythms in the music market through the World Music\u00e2phenomenon. Even though there is no musical prerequisite, the course is recommended for students with any kind and/or level of musical experience.

Covering in parallel the evolution of the international system and the changing position of the region in that same system, the course attempts to reinterpret the frameworks of analysis as perceived from the Western Hemisphere. The student will be provided with a Latin American view of the main economic developments and political processes that have given shape to each stage in time- to the structure and dynamics of the international system. The ultimate goal is to make students aware that where you stand depends on where you sit by exposing them to alternate views on concepts they are already familiar with.   Sample Syllabus                              Social and Cultural Analysis   Courses listed under the Social and Cultural Analysis heading count for Social and Cultural Analysis major or minor credit. Additional courses offered by the SCA department can be found under the appropriate area(s) of study. Students are always encouraged to check with their departmental advisor regarding which courses count for major and minor credit.                                                  Queer Cultures and Democracy - SPAN-UA 9481 or SCA-UA 9844 - 4 points                               In the last ten years, several Latin American nations have witnessed decisive progress in the legal recognition of non-normative sexualities and gender identities. Argentina passed the same-sex marriage law in 2010 and the gender identity law in 2011, followed by Uruguay; Colombia approved the legal recognition of same sex couples, and in Mexico, Cuba, Brazil, the pressure of queer demands and visibility in the public sphere is stronger than ever. The conventional map of \u201cadvanced democracies\u201d crafting models of democratization that could be exported to less developed nations seems definitely challenged: a new understanding of the complex, and multiple temporalities of queer cultures in North and South America is more necessary than ever.    In order to explore this rich and multi-layered landscape, this course wants to trace and reconstruct the historical detours of queer cultures in Buenos Aires and New York. Taking as starting point the present context of growing acceptance and inclusion of queer citizens both in Latin America and the US, the course revisits the last three decades in order to question the dominant and frequently reductive narratives of steady, lineal progress.
