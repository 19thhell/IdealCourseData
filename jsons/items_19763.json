First, a factorized robust matrix completion algorithm is described to solve the video background subtraction problem. The algorithm decomposes a sequence of video frames into the sum of a low rank background component and a sparse motion component. The next part of the talk discusses how similar low-rank matrix factorization techniques can be used to realize a compact visual feature representation for content retrieval. Finally, an approach based on quantized embeddings is presented as means to achieve a rate-efficient representation of high-dimensional features such that pair-wise distances between the underlying feature vectors are preserved.

Web site: http://www.merl.com/people/avetro   A Framework for Structural Input/Output and Control Configuration Selection of Large - Scale Systems   Speaker: S&eacute;rgio Pequito, University of Pennsylvania    Time: 11:00 am - 12:00 pm, Jan 30, 2015    Location: LC433, 5 MetroTech Center, Brooklyn, NY   The structure control system design consists mainly of two steps: input/output (I/O) selection and control configuration (CC) selection. The first one is devoted to the problem of computing how many actuators/sensors are needed and where should be placed in the plant to obtain some desired property. Control configuration is related to the decentralized control problem and is dedicated to the task of selecting which outputs (sensors) should be available for feedback and to which inputs (actuators) in order to achieve a predefined goal. The choice of inputs and outputs affects the performance, complexity and costs of the control system. Due to the combinatorial nature of the selection problem, an efficient and systematic method is required to complement the designer intuition, experience and physical insight. Motivated by the above, this presentation addresses the structure control system design taking explicitly into consideration the possible application to large - scale systems. We provide an efficient framework to solve the following major minimization problems: i) selection of the minimum number of manipulated/measured variables to achieve structural controllability/observability of the system, and ii) selection of the minimum number of measured and manipulated variables, and feedback interconnections between them such that the system has no structural fixed modes. Contrary to what would be expected, we showed that it is possible to obtain the global solution of the aforementioned minimization problems in polynomial complexity in the number of the state variables of the system. To this effect, we propose a methodology that is efficient (polynomial complexity) and unified in the sense that it solves simultaneously the I/O and the CC selection problems. This is done by exploiting the implications of the I/O selection in the solution to the CC problem.   About the Speaker: S&eacute;rgio Pequito is a postdoctoral researcher at University of Pennsylvania. He obtained his PhD in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Carnegie Mellon University and Instituto Superior T&eacute;cnico, through the CMU-Portugal program. Furthermore, he received his BSc and MSc in Applied Mathematics from the Instituto Superior T&eacute;cnico. Pequito&#39;s research consists in understanding the global qualitative behavior of large scale systems from their structural or parametric descriptions and provide a rigorous framework for the design, analysis, optimization and control of large scale (real-world) systems.

Capacity management in stochastic loss network models   Speaker: Yingdong Lu, IBM T.J. Watson Research Center    Time: 11:00 am - 12:00 pm, Feb 5, 2015    Location: 2MTC, 10th floor, Room 10.099, Brooklyn, NY   Motivated by capacity management problems in cloud computing and business analytics, we study a set of stochastic optimization problems centered around the analysis of stochastic loss networks. Several different methods of calculating loss probability, a key performance metric, are developed for different applications. We will discuss both the theoretical development and numerical experiments for these methods.

From biomedical imaging to online blogs: Graph signal processing   Speaker: Jelena Kova\u010devi\u0107, Carnegie Mellon University    Time: 11:00 am - 12:00 pm, Feb 12, 2015    Location: 2MTC, 10th floor, Room 10.099, Brooklyn, NY   I will present a path from classification in biomedical imaging to online blogs, where a common thread is graph signal processing, a theoretical framework that generalizes fundamental concepts of classical signal processing from regular domains, such as lines and rectangular lattices, to general graphs. It is particularly applicable to domains such as physical, engineering, and social, where signals are characterized by irregular structure. Signal processing on graphs has found multiple applications, including approximation, sampling, classification, inpainting and clustering, and I will describe some of these.

Information Security in Controlled Dynamical Systems: Trading Utility for Privacy   Speaker: Parv Venkitasubramaniam, Lehigh University    Time: 11:00 am - 12:00 pm, Feb 13, 2015    Location: LC433, 5 MetroTech Center, Brooklyn, NY   Cyber physical systems, which rely on the joint functioning of information and physical systems, are vulnerable to information leakage through the actions of the internal physical control system. In particular, if an external observer has access to input and output variables of the system exposed through cyber communication links, then critical information can be inferred about the internal states of the system and consequently compromise the security of system operation. In this talk, a mathematical framework based on Markov Decision Process models will be discussed to investigate the design of controller actions when an internal state privacy requirement is imposed as part of the system objective. Fundamental tradeoffs will be presented between the privacy achievable-- as measured using information theoretic equivocation-- and the tangible utility of the internal controller. Two examples will be discussed that apply the developed model-- the first maximizes user anonymity in data networks under memory and fairness restrictions, and the second maximizes privacy of energy usage from smart metered electricity measurement using an in-home energy storage mechanism.   About the Speaker: Parv Venkitasubramaniam is an assistant professor in the Electrical and Computer Engineering department at Lehigh University. His current research interests are in developing theoretical foundations for privacy and security for networked cyber and cyber physical systems. He received a B. Tech degree from the Indian Institute of Technology, Madras and graduated with a Ph.D from Cornell University under the advise of Prof. Lang Tong.

Abraham Award and a 2012 NSF CAREER Award.   Mind the Map! The Impact of Subway Map on Passengers&#39; Route Choice Decisions in London and Washington DC   Speaker: Zhan Guo, New York University    Time: 11:00 am - 12:00 pm, Feb 26, 2015    Location: 2MTC, 10th floor, Room 10.099, Brooklyn, NY   Subway users often rely on schematic system maps to identify the best route from A to B. However, the schematic map is always distorted. Some routes may appear longer or shorter on the map than in reality. The line alignment also differs between a schematic map and an actual map. Such distortion may &ldquo;misguide&rdquo; passengers to favor a particular route over another, thus &ldquo;rebalance&rdquo; the passenger flows inside a subway network, creating or relieving bottlenecks in the system. If this is true, schematic subway maps could become an effective planning tool to influence route decisions for the benefits of not only the system but also individual passengers.   The London study, based on actual route choices in the London Underground, tests the first assumption, and confirms that when choosing a route most passengers would trust the schematic map more than their own experience of reality. This is true even for the most experienced passengers who have frequently used the system for many years. The Washington DC study, based on an experiment in the crowdsourcing platform--Amazon&rsquo;s Mechanic Turk, tests the second assumption, and illustrates that changing the length and alignment of lines on a schematic map can switch passengers from bottlenecks to underutilized segments in the DC subway, thus improving the efficiency of the system. Depending on how the lines are exactly modified, the &ldquo;switching&rdquo; effect also differs.   About the Speaker: Zhan Guo studies individuals&rsquo; travel behavior and explores innovative ways to influence the decision-making process to produce better social outcomes such as reduced congestion and carbon emissions. At the micro level, he focuses how travelers perceive travel alternatives and attributes and what discrepancies exist between perception and reality. The ability to reinforce, change, or even deceive that perception to promote the &quot;right&quot; behavior, and the methods used to do so, also figure largely in his research. At the macro level, he is interested in the effect of technical standards, such as parking and street standards, on the built environment and the rationale behind these standards. The (dis)connection between government regulations, market forces, and consumer preferences is the focus of his research. Zhan has conducted empirical work on transfer behavior in Boston, metro map design in London, parking policy in New York, and pedestrian environments in Hong Kong. His work has been covered by New York Times, Wall Street Journal, BBC, Economist, Le Monde, ABC Evening News, the Atlantic Cities, Nudges.org, etc.   Zhan Guo received a B. Arch from Tianjin University, a MUD from Tsinghua University, China, and a MCP and a Ph.D in Urban Planning from MIT.   Proximal Splitting Algorithms in Data Sciences   Speaker: Patrick L. Combettes, Pierre and Marie Curie University, Paris    Time: 11:00 am - 12:00 pm, Mar 2, 2015    Location: LC433, 5 MetroTech Center, Brooklyn, NY   In recent years proximal splitting algorithms have become prominent tools for solving a wide array of data-driven problems. We provide an overview of the field and report on recent developments in the area of complex structured optimization problems. In particular, we present a new block-coordinate approach to tackle problems of very large sizes. Applications to machine learning, inverse problems, and image recovery will be discussed.

He was elected a Fellow of the IEEE in 2005.   Systems, Algorithms, and Applications for Robotic Sensing   Speaker: Pratap Tokekar, University of Pennsylvania    Time: 11:00 am - 12:00 pm, Mar 5, 2015    Location: 2MTC, 10th floor, Room 9.009, Brooklyn, NY   A connected network of robots, sensors, and smart devices has the potential to solve grand challenges in domains such as agronomy, oceanography, and emergency response. Robots will form the &quot;physical&quot; layer of this network and collect data from hard to reach places at unprecedented spatio-temporal scales. A key challenge for roboticists is to design decision-making algorithms that enable optimal sensing and data collection. In this talk, I will present such algorithms for three types of problems: (i) How to cover complex environments using few sensors and robots? (ii) How to optimize the robots&#39; energy to enable long term operation? (iii) How to coordinate teams of robots and sensors?   In the first part, we will focus on the algorithmic aspects of the Art Gallery Problem, a classical sensor placement problem. I will present a new formulation that guarantees a good view of convex objects in polygonal environments, despite self-occlusions. I will present bounds and approximation algorithms for placing minimum number of sensors for this new formulation. I will also present algorithms for robotic coverage and informative path planning problems. In the second part, I will describe techniques for efficient solar energy harvesting and planning energy-aware trajectories for collaborative aerial and ground robots. In the third part, I will present coordination algorithms for target tracking with robotic teams that respects the communication constraints between the robots.   We will study these problems in the context of two practical applications: precision agriculture and autonomous monitoring radio-tagged fish in Minnesota lakes. Throughout the talk, along with theoretical results, I will present experiments conducted with autonomous boats in Minnesota lakes, wheeled robots operating on frozen lakes, and aerial robots operating in corn plots and apple orchards.   About the Speaker: Pratap Tokekar is a Postdoctoral Researcher at the University of Pennsylvania. He obtained his Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Minnesota in 2014 and Bachelor of Technology degree in Electronics and Telecommunication from College of Engineering Pune, India in 2008. His research interests include algorithmic and field robotics, sensor networks, and computational geometry.   Sparse Modeling for High-Dimensional Multi-Manifold Data Analysis   Speaker: Ehsan Elhamifar, University of California, Berkeley    Time: 11:00 am - 12:00 pm, Mar 9, 2015    Location: 2MTC, 10th floor, Room 10.099, Brooklyn, NY   One of the most fundamental challenges facing scientists and engineers across different fields, such as signal/image processing, computer vision, robotics and bioinformatics, is the large amounts of high-dimensional data that need to be analyzed and understood. In this talk, I present provably correct and efficient algorithms, based on the sparse representation theory, for the analysis of high-dimensional datasets by exploiting their underlying low-dimensional structures. I talk about algorithms for the two fundamental problems of clustering and subset selection in unions of subspaces and discuss the robustness of the algorithms to data nuisances. I show that these tools effectively advance the state-of-the-art data analysis in a wide range of important real-world problems, such as segmentation of motions in videos, clustering of images of objects, energy disaggregation and identification of hybrid dynamical systems.   About the Speaker: Ehsan Elhamifar is a postdoctoral scholar in the department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences at the University of California, Berkeley. He obtained his PhD in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the Johns Hopkins University. Ehsan is broadly interested in developing provably correct and efficient data analysis algorithms that can address challenges of complex and large-scale high-dimensional datasets. Specifically, he focuses on the intrinsic low-dimensionality of real data and uses tools from convex geometry and analysis, sparse / low-rank representation, high-dimensional statistics and graph theory to develop such algorithms. Ehsan obtained MS and MSE degrees in Electrical Engineering and Applied Mathematics and Statistics, respectively, from Sharif University of Technology in Iran and the Johns Hopkins University.   Boosting Multimedia Content Analysis with Machine Learning Techniques   Speaker: Zhigang Ma, Carnegie Mellon University    Time: 11:00 am - 12:00 pm, Mar 11, 2015    Location: 2MTC, 10th floor, Room 10.099, Brooklyn, NY   Image and video analysis is the fundamental problem in multimedia community. In this talk, I will present how we improved the performance of multimedia content analysis by leveraging the advance of machine learning. The primary techniques harnessed in our work are comprised of feature selection, semi-supervised learning, learning an intermediate representation and knowledge adaptation. I will start from image annotation. In the literature, many different types of feature have been proposed to capture the semantic information of images. Impressive progress on image analysis has been witnessed based on these feature representations. However, it is inevitable that the feature representation has certain amount of noise and redundancy. Consequently, I will introduce a feature selection algorithm that is able to get a more compact representation, thus improving the annotation accuracy.   We also noticed that multimedia analysis faces a reality that precisely labeled images and videos are difficult to obtain, which is detrimental to learning a robust classifier. To address this issue, we proposed a semi-supervised learning framework for image and video analysis. Our approach is based on semi-supervised learning and it simultaneously considers eliminating feature noise and redundancy. Through extensive experiments on image and video classification, we validate that properly utilizing unlabeled data does contribute to the performance boost.   To step further, I will talk about a more challenging task in multimedia community, i.e., multimedia event detection. A multimedia event is a higher-level semantic abstraction of video sequences than a concept and consists of multiple concepts. As a multimedia event builds upon several basic elements of objects, scenes and human actions we propose to learn an intermediate representation coupled with the classifier learning by exploiting external resources. Our method is capable of learning an optimal event detector that carries more informative cues from the intermediate representation.   Lastly, I will introduce how to exploit knowledge adaptation to improve the performance of multimedia event detection when only few positive exemplars are given. The method is based on the assumption that multimedia events consist of low-level concepts and we proposed to adapt the knowledge from concept level to assist in event detection. Specifically, we use the available video corpora with annotated concepts as our auxiliary resource. Our approach has another desirable property that it is able to adapt knowledge from the source to the target even if the features of them are partially different, but overlapping.

Aerial autonomy at insect scale: What flying insects can tell us about robotics and vice versa   Speaker: Sawyer Buckminster Fuller, Harvard University    Time: 11:00 am - 12:00 pm, Mar 12, 2015    Location: 2MTC, 9th floor, Room 9.009, Brooklyn, NY   Insect-sized aerial robots will be deployed where their small size, low cost, and maneuverability give them an advantage over larger robots. For example, they could follow airborne plumes to locate methane leaks in dense piping infrastructure. Or deploy in swarms to perform detailed environmental monitoring. However, miniaturization poses challenges because scaling physics dictates that many conventional approaches used in larger aircraft, from electric motors and fixed wings, to the Global Positioning System and general-purpose microprocessors, cannot operate effectively at the size of insects. Insects have overcome these challenges, evolving a superlatively robust and agile flight apparatus that can land on flowers buffeted by wind or deftly avoiding a flyswatter. Though a detailed understanding of their flight systems lacking, they inspire robots with similar performance. My research is aimed at understanding the constraints inherent to autonomy -- that is, performing without a human operator -- at the insect scale. This includes investigations into the flight systems of flies and forward engineering robotic equivalents. I will describe experiments that revealed how flies compensate for wind disturbances in flight, and flight tests of insect-inspired controllers for fly-sized aerial robots. The results indicate that the severe power and weight constraints at this scale will require designs in which mechanisms, sensing, and computation are intricately interconnected. This suggests a multi-disciplinary design process that is reminiscent of evolution.   About the Speaker: Sawyer Buckminster Fuller is currently a Postdoctoral Scholar in the Microrobotics Laboratory of Prof. Robert Wood at Harvard. He creates biologically-inspired sensors, control systems, and mechanical designs targeted at insect-sized air vehicles and investigates the flight systems of aerial insects. He completed his Ph.D. in Biological Engineering at the California Institute of Technology and B.S. and M.S. degrees in Mechanical Engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. In addition to his work in insect flight control, he has also developed a frog-hopping robot at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory and invented a 3D ink-jet microfabrication technology at the MIT Media Lab. His work at the intersection of robotics and biology has appeared in Science and Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, and been covered in news outlets such as Wired and The Scientist, and in an article on the cover of The MIT Technology Review.   Scenario-Based Model Predictive Control   Speaker: Georg Schildbach, University of California Berkeley    Time: 11:00 am - 12:00 pm, Mar 13, 2015    Location: LC433, 5 MetroTech Center, Brooklyn, NY   Model Predictive Control (MPC) is a powerful approach for optimal control of multi-variable systems with constraints. Its concept is to repeatedly solve a Constrained Finite-Horizon Optimal Control Problem (CFHOCP) on-line by numerical optimization. The CFHOCP requires predictions of the controlled system and the environment to be made. In reality, these predictions are subject to uncertainty, resulting from model errors, disturbances, and the uncertain evolution of the environment. In this context, both robust optimization (Robust MPC) and stochastic optimization (Stochastic MPC) have been well explored for handling this uncertainty. However, both approaches suffer from a variety of potential drawbacks, as discussed in this talk. Instead, we explore a much less treaded path that has proven to be very successful in estimation: particles, or in the context of MPC: scenarios. We will discuss the practical aspects of Scenario-Based MPC by looking at two different examples. We will also show that decision making based on scenarios leads into a deep mathematical theory. Recently, great advances were made in this field, but many open questions remain.   About the Speaker: Dr. Georg Schildbach obtained his Masters degrees in Applied Mechanics (Dipl.-Ing.) and Industrial Engineering (Dipl. Wirtsch.-Ing.), both at the Technical University of Darmstadt in Germany. He worked in various positions in the field of quantitative finance and investment banking for two years. Then he joined the Automatic Control Laboratory at ETH Zurich in 2010, where obtained his Ph.D. degree in the field of control and optimization in 2014. He currently holds the position of an Associate Director at the Hyundai of Excellence at UC Berkeley. His research interests evolve around algorithms for optimal and constrained control in uncertain environments, and their application to real-life problems in engineering and finance. His current research focus lies on developing new control algorithms for autonomous driving and intelligent transportation systems.   Semantic processing of visual signals in the era of data abundance   Speaker: Ruonan Li, Harvard University    Time: 11:00 am - 12:00 pm, Mar 23, 2015    Location: 2MTC, 10th floor, Room 10.009, Brooklyn, NY   What does the era of unprecedented amount of images and videos mean to semantic signal processing and machine learning? For inferring simple semantics such as object categories, identities, and event types, two predominant challenges are annotation poverty combined with data-selection bias, and the increased variations among the instances of the same semantic concept. Beyond simple semantics, richer semantics are emerging, such as social interactions and social relationships, to which current machines remain quite blind. I present three research vignettes that account for these challenges and opportunities. The first one introduces one of the earliest unsupervised domain adaption mechanisms that \u202ctransfers knowledge from `in-house&#39; training data (source domain) to a target domain, by exploiting geodesics in the space of factor analyzers, and I will also show its application to natural language processing\u202a. The second one develops a Bayesian optimization framework on a Riemannian manifold with a global convergence guarantee, to remove the spatio-temporal mismatch between two videos of the same type of activity, and I will also show its outstanding performance on a benchmark in operations research.

Robots Perceive, Learn, and Adapt   Speaker: Yu Sun, University of South Florida    Time: 11:00 am - 12:00 pm, Mar 25, 2015    Location: 2MTC, 10th floor, Room 10.099, Brooklyn, NY   To enable robots to work in unstructured environments and perform manipulation tasks with uncertain physical interactions, we propose a novel functional-object-oriented network (FOON) to connect functional-related objects with their interactive manipulation motions. The connections between objects and manipulation motions are learned from observing humans performing daily manipulation tasks. Using a well-trained FOON, robots will be able to decipher a task goal, seek the correct objects to operate, and generate an optimal motion adapted to new conditions. To best facilitate manipulation motions, we also developed new grasping strategies for robots to hold objects with a firm grasp to withstand the disturbance during their physical interactions. In addition, for tasks in computer-assisted surgery, we have developed a comprehensive situation awareness (CSA) platform that is composed of a network of wireless video cameras anchored on the abdominal cavity wall. The CSA platform allows surgeons and computer software to observe a surgical area from different viewpoints and perceive interactions between surgical instrument and tissues for safe and efficient surgery planning and execution.

Web-scale Multimedia Data Analytics   Speaker: Zhu Liu, AT&amp;T Labs &ndash; Research    Time: 11:00 am - 12:00 pm, Apr 1, 2015    Location: 2MTC, 10th floor, Room 10.009, Brooklyn, NY   Multimedia, the &ldquo;biggest Big Data,&rdquo; is becoming the most important and valuable source for information and insights. Ubiquitous multimedia analytics is the indispensable tool that unlocks the underlying value from the explosively increasing amount of multimedia data. While multimedia analytics technologies have found success in many real world applications, enormous challenges, including the scalability, flexibility, efficiency, and reliability of the underlying techniques, still exist. This talk addresses some of these challenges, and it is composed of two subjects. The first topic is on a real-time and robust multimedia content search system, which is composed of audio- and visual-based copy detection modules and a late fusion scheme. The visual module adopts a bag of visual word representation based on the vocabulary tree quantization method, and it is able to query a database of 4.5 million images within 50 milliseconds. The audio module relies on audio fingerprint extracted from sub-band energies, and it takes less than a second to search a database of 6 thousand music tracks. The second topic is about a novel image hashing algorithm powered by deep learning techniques. Traditional image hashing techniques feed hand-crafted visual features into hash functions, and the proposed deep hashing method simultaneously learns both the visual features and the hash functions utilizing a deep network. Comprehensive quantitative evaluations on several large-scale image benchmarks demonstrate its high accuracy in comparison to other supervised hashing algorithms.

Formulation of Image Quality Metric for Gaussian Blur Images and Dynamic Heart Rate Measurements from Four to Six Seconds Video Frames   Speaker: Raveendran Paramesran, University of Malaya, Malaysia    Time: 2:30 pm - 3:30 pm, Apr 13, 2015    Location: 2MTC, 10th floor, Room 10.009, Brooklyn, NY   In this talk, two current research areas in my lab will be presented. First, we will show how some of the exact Zernike moments can be used in the design of image quality metric to measure the quality of a blurred image. Next, we will show a method on how to obtain the dynamic heart rates of subjects in a cycling exercise from a short duration of video frames.   Features that exhibit human visual perception of image quality scores for blurred images are useful in constructing an image quality metric. In this talk, we show some of the exact Zernike moments (EZMs) that closely model the human quality scores for images of varying degrees of blurriness can be used to measure these distortions. A theoretical framework is developed to identify these EZMs.   The second part of my talk is on how dynamic heart rate measurements that are typically obtained from sensors mounted near to the heart can also be obtained from a short duration of video frames. In this study, two experiments are carried out where a video camera captures the facial images of seven subjects during a cycling exercise.   About the Speaker: P.

Learning From Distributed Private Data: Algorithms and Applications   Speaker: Anand D. Sarwate, Rutgers University    Time: 11:00 am - 12:00 pm, Apr 17, 2015    Location: LC433, 5 MetroTech Center, Brooklyn, NY   Distributed learning from biomedical data is often hindered by ethical, legal, and technological concerns about data sharing. Data holders wish to maintain control over the uses of their data, and patients or study subjects may be hesitant to allow free and open use of their private medical data. Differential privacy is a framework which allows the quantification of privacy risk. In privacy-preserving distributed learning, the data stays at each site: they locally compute a privacy-preserving summary of their information. The summaries are sent to a private aggregator that performs the final analysis. Differentially private algorithms guarantee privacy by deliberately introducing some noise into the computation &ndash; the uncertainty from the noise masks individual data points. This leads to a tradeoff between privacy and accuracy. In this talk I will discuss algorithms for privacy-preserving learning as well as a recent proof-of-concept for this approach applied to neuroimaging data for mental health research.   About the Speaker: Anand D. Sarwate joined as an Assistant Professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey in January 2014.

Microgrid is one of the emerging smart grid killer applications. A truly viable wide-scale microgrid adoption presents utilities with both numerous challenges and opportunities. In this presentation, one of the technical challenges facing islanded microgrids due to their finite inertia will be discussed. Specifically, the impacts of heavy loads, with intermittent non-linear nature, on the stability/security of microgrids operating in an islanded mode will be investigated. A case study on a shipboard power system example representing an islanded microgrid will be presented. The microgrid architecture is assumed to have local renewable energy generation, energy storage system and multiple emergency generators. The impact of non-liner loads will be discussed during normal operating conditions, and in the case of various contingencies. Moreover, a solution to mitigate the effect of these non-linear loads based on storage distribution will be presented.

Improving Long-Term Financial Decision Making Using Behavioral Economics Theory-driven User Interfaces   Speaker: Oded Nov, New York University    Time: 11:00 am - 12:00 pm, May 7, 2015    Location: 2MTC, 10th floor, Room 10.009, Brooklyn, NY   Can human-computer interaction help people make informed and effective decisions about their retirement savings? We applied the behavioral economic theories of endowment effect and loss aversion to the design of novel retirement saving user interfaces. To examine effectiveness, we conducted two experiments in which participants were exposed to one of three experimental user interface designs of a retirement saving simulator, representing endowment effect, loss aversion, social comparison, peer advice and control. Users made 34 yearly asset allocation decisions. We found that designs informed by behavioral economic and social psychology principles and which communicated to savers the long-term implications of their asset allocation choices, led users to adjust their behavior, make larger and more frequent asset allocation changes, and achieve their saving goals more effectively.

First, a factorized robust matrix completion algorithm is described to solve the video background subtraction problem. The algorithm decomposes a sequence of video frames into the sum of a low rank background component and a sparse motion component. The next part of the talk discusses how similar low-rank matrix factorization techniques can be used to realize a compact visual feature representation for content retrieval. Finally, an approach based on quantized embeddings is presented as means to achieve a rate-efficient representation of high-dimensional features such that pair-wise distances between the underlying feature vectors are preserved.

Web site: http://www.merl.com/people/avetro   A Framework for Structural Input/Output and Control Configuration Selection of Large - Scale Systems   Speaker: S&eacute;rgio Pequito, University of Pennsylvania    Time: 11:00 am - 12:00 pm, Jan 30, 2015    Location: LC433, 5 MetroTech Center, Brooklyn, NY   The structure control system design consists mainly of two steps: input/output (I/O) selection and control configuration (CC) selection. The first one is devoted to the problem of computing how many actuators/sensors are needed and where should be placed in the plant to obtain some desired property. Control configuration is related to the decentralized control problem and is dedicated to the task of selecting which outputs (sensors) should be available for feedback and to which inputs (actuators) in order to achieve a predefined goal. The choice of inputs and outputs affects the performance, complexity and costs of the control system. Due to the combinatorial nature of the selection problem, an efficient and systematic method is required to complement the designer intuition, experience and physical insight. Motivated by the above, this presentation addresses the structure control system design taking explicitly into consideration the possible application to large - scale systems. We provide an efficient framework to solve the following major minimization problems: i) selection of the minimum number of manipulated/measured variables to achieve structural controllability/observability of the system, and ii) selection of the minimum number of measured and manipulated variables, and feedback interconnections between them such that the system has no structural fixed modes. Contrary to what would be expected, we showed that it is possible to obtain the global solution of the aforementioned minimization problems in polynomial complexity in the number of the state variables of the system. To this effect, we propose a methodology that is efficient (polynomial complexity) and unified in the sense that it solves simultaneously the I/O and the CC selection problems. This is done by exploiting the implications of the I/O selection in the solution to the CC problem.

Information Security in Controlled Dynamical Systems: Trading Utility for Privacy   Speaker: Parv Venkitasubramaniam, Lehigh University    Time: 11:00 am - 12:00 pm, Feb 13, 2015    Location: LC433, 5 MetroTech Center, Brooklyn, NY   Cyber physical systems, which rely on the joint functioning of information and physical systems, are vulnerable to information leakage through the actions of the internal physical control system. In particular, if an external observer has access to input and output variables of the system exposed through cyber communication links, then critical information can be inferred about the internal states of the system and consequently compromise the security of system operation. In this talk, a mathematical framework based on Markov Decision Process models will be discussed to investigate the design of controller actions when an internal state privacy requirement is imposed as part of the system objective. Fundamental tradeoffs will be presented between the privacy achievable-- as measured using information theoretic equivocation-- and the tangible utility of the internal controller. Two examples will be discussed that apply the developed model-- the first maximizes user anonymity in data networks under memory and fairness restrictions, and the second maximizes privacy of energy usage from smart metered electricity measurement using an in-home energy storage mechanism.   About the Speaker: Parv Venkitasubramaniam is an assistant professor in the Electrical and Computer Engineering department at Lehigh University.

The Impact of Subway Map on Passengers&#39; Route Choice Decisions in London and Washington DC   Speaker: Zhan Guo, New York University    Time: 11:00 am - 12:00 pm, Feb 26, 2015    Location: 2MTC, 10th floor, Room 10.099, Brooklyn, NY   Subway users often rely on schematic system maps to identify the best route from A to B. However, the schematic map is always distorted. Some routes may appear longer or shorter on the map than in reality. The line alignment also differs between a schematic map and an actual map. Such distortion may &ldquo;misguide&rdquo; passengers to favor a particular route over another, thus &ldquo;rebalance&rdquo; the passenger flows inside a subway network, creating or relieving bottlenecks in the system. If this is true, schematic subway maps could become an effective planning tool to influence route decisions for the benefits of not only the system but also individual passengers.   The London study, based on actual route choices in the London Underground, tests the first assumption, and confirms that when choosing a route most passengers would trust the schematic map more than their own experience of reality. This is true even for the most experienced passengers who have frequently used the system for many years. The Washington DC study, based on an experiment in the crowdsourcing platform--Amazon&rsquo;s Mechanic Turk, tests the second assumption, and illustrates that changing the length and alignment of lines on a schematic map can switch passengers from bottlenecks to underutilized segments in the DC subway, thus improving the efficiency of the system. Depending on how the lines are exactly modified, the &ldquo;switching&rdquo; effect also differs.   About the Speaker: Zhan Guo studies individuals&rsquo; travel behavior and explores innovative ways to influence the decision-making process to produce better social outcomes such as reduced congestion and carbon emissions. At the micro level, he focuses how travelers perceive travel alternatives and attributes and what discrepancies exist between perception and reality. The ability to reinforce, change, or even deceive that perception to promote the &quot;right&quot; behavior, and the methods used to do so, also figure largely in his research. At the macro level, he is interested in the effect of technical standards, such as parking and street standards, on the built environment and the rationale behind these standards. The (dis)connection between government regulations, market forces, and consumer preferences is the focus of his research. Zhan has conducted empirical work on transfer behavior in Boston, metro map design in London, parking policy in New York, and pedestrian environments in Hong Kong. His work has been covered by New York Times, Wall Street Journal, BBC, Economist, Le Monde, ABC Evening News, the Atlantic Cities, Nudges.org, etc.   Zhan Guo received a B.

Systems, Algorithms, and Applications for Robotic Sensing   Speaker: Pratap Tokekar, University of Pennsylvania    Time: 11:00 am - 12:00 pm, Mar 5, 2015    Location: 2MTC, 10th floor, Room 9.009, Brooklyn, NY   A connected network of robots, sensors, and smart devices has the potential to solve grand challenges in domains such as agronomy, oceanography, and emergency response. Robots will form the &quot;physical&quot; layer of this network and collect data from hard to reach places at unprecedented spatio-temporal scales. A key challenge for roboticists is to design decision-making algorithms that enable optimal sensing and data collection. In this talk, I will present such algorithms for three types of problems: (i) How to cover complex environments using few sensors and robots? (ii) How to optimize the robots&#39; energy to enable long term operation? (iii) How to coordinate teams of robots and sensors?   In the first part, we will focus on the algorithmic aspects of the Art Gallery Problem, a classical sensor placement problem. I will present a new formulation that guarantees a good view of convex objects in polygonal environments, despite self-occlusions. I will present bounds and approximation algorithms for placing minimum number of sensors for this new formulation. I will also present algorithms for robotic coverage and informative path planning problems. In the second part, I will describe techniques for efficient solar energy harvesting and planning energy-aware trajectories for collaborative aerial and ground robots. In the third part, I will present coordination algorithms for target tracking with robotic teams that respects the communication constraints between the robots.   We will study these problems in the context of two practical applications: precision agriculture and autonomous monitoring radio-tagged fish in Minnesota lakes. Throughout the talk, along with theoretical results, I will present experiments conducted with autonomous boats in Minnesota lakes, wheeled robots operating on frozen lakes, and aerial robots operating in corn plots and apple orchards.   About the Speaker: Pratap Tokekar is a Postdoctoral Researcher at the University of Pennsylvania.

Sparse Modeling for High-Dimensional Multi-Manifold Data Analysis   Speaker: Ehsan Elhamifar, University of California, Berkeley    Time: 11:00 am - 12:00 pm, Mar 9, 2015    Location: 2MTC, 10th floor, Room 10.099, Brooklyn, NY   One of the most fundamental challenges facing scientists and engineers across different fields, such as signal/image processing, computer vision, robotics and bioinformatics, is the large amounts of high-dimensional data that need to be analyzed and understood. In this talk, I present provably correct and efficient algorithms, based on the sparse representation theory, for the analysis of high-dimensional datasets by exploiting their underlying low-dimensional structures. I talk about algorithms for the two fundamental problems of clustering and subset selection in unions of subspaces and discuss the robustness of the algorithms to data nuisances. I show that these tools effectively advance the state-of-the-art data analysis in a wide range of important real-world problems, such as segmentation of motions in videos, clustering of images of objects, energy disaggregation and identification of hybrid dynamical systems.

Boosting Multimedia Content Analysis with Machine Learning Techniques   Speaker: Zhigang Ma, Carnegie Mellon University    Time: 11:00 am - 12:00 pm, Mar 11, 2015    Location: 2MTC, 10th floor, Room 10.099, Brooklyn, NY   Image and video analysis is the fundamental problem in multimedia community. In this talk, I will present how we improved the performance of multimedia content analysis by leveraging the advance of machine learning. The primary techniques harnessed in our work are comprised of feature selection, semi-supervised learning, learning an intermediate representation and knowledge adaptation. I will start from image annotation. In the literature, many different types of feature have been proposed to capture the semantic information of images. Impressive progress on image analysis has been witnessed based on these feature representations. However, it is inevitable that the feature representation has certain amount of noise and redundancy. Consequently, I will introduce a feature selection algorithm that is able to get a more compact representation, thus improving the annotation accuracy.   We also noticed that multimedia analysis faces a reality that precisely labeled images and videos are difficult to obtain, which is detrimental to learning a robust classifier. To address this issue, we proposed a semi-supervised learning framework for image and video analysis. Our approach is based on semi-supervised learning and it simultaneously considers eliminating feature noise and redundancy. Through extensive experiments on image and video classification, we validate that properly utilizing unlabeled data does contribute to the performance boost.   To step further, I will talk about a more challenging task in multimedia community, i.e., multimedia event detection. A multimedia event is a higher-level semantic abstraction of video sequences than a concept and consists of multiple concepts. As a multimedia event builds upon several basic elements of objects, scenes and human actions we propose to learn an intermediate representation coupled with the classifier learning by exploiting external resources. Our method is capable of learning an optimal event detector that carries more informative cues from the intermediate representation.   Lastly, I will introduce how to exploit knowledge adaptation to improve the performance of multimedia event detection when only few positive exemplars are given. The method is based on the assumption that multimedia events consist of low-level concepts and we proposed to adapt the knowledge from concept level to assist in event detection. Specifically, we use the available video corpora with annotated concepts as our auxiliary resource. Our approach has another desirable property that it is able to adapt knowledge from the source to the target even if the features of them are partially different, but overlapping.

Aerial autonomy at insect scale: What flying insects can tell us about robotics and vice versa   Speaker: Sawyer Buckminster Fuller, Harvard University    Time: 11:00 am - 12:00 pm, Mar 12, 2015    Location: 2MTC, 9th floor, Room 9.009, Brooklyn, NY   Insect-sized aerial robots will be deployed where their small size, low cost, and maneuverability give them an advantage over larger robots. For example, they could follow airborne plumes to locate methane leaks in dense piping infrastructure. Or deploy in swarms to perform detailed environmental monitoring. However, miniaturization poses challenges because scaling physics dictates that many conventional approaches used in larger aircraft, from electric motors and fixed wings, to the Global Positioning System and general-purpose microprocessors, cannot operate effectively at the size of insects. Insects have overcome these challenges, evolving a superlatively robust and agile flight apparatus that can land on flowers buffeted by wind or deftly avoiding a flyswatter. Though a detailed understanding of their flight systems lacking, they inspire robots with similar performance. My research is aimed at understanding the constraints inherent to autonomy -- that is, performing without a human operator -- at the insect scale. This includes investigations into the flight systems of flies and forward engineering robotic equivalents. I will describe experiments that revealed how flies compensate for wind disturbances in flight, and flight tests of insect-inspired controllers for fly-sized aerial robots. The results indicate that the severe power and weight constraints at this scale will require designs in which mechanisms, sensing, and computation are intricately interconnected. This suggests a multi-disciplinary design process that is reminiscent of evolution.   About the Speaker: Sawyer Buckminster Fuller is currently a Postdoctoral Scholar in the Microrobotics Laboratory of Prof. Robert Wood at Harvard.

In addition to his work in insect flight control, he has also developed a frog-hopping robot at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory and invented a 3D ink-jet microfabrication technology at the MIT Media Lab. His work at the intersection of robotics and biology has appeared in Science and Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, and been covered in news outlets such as Wired and The Scientist, and in an article on the cover of The MIT Technology Review.   Scenario-Based Model Predictive Control   Speaker: Georg Schildbach, University of California Berkeley    Time: 11:00 am - 12:00 pm, Mar 13, 2015    Location: LC433, 5 MetroTech Center, Brooklyn, NY   Model Predictive Control (MPC) is a powerful approach for optimal control of multi-variable systems with constraints. Its concept is to repeatedly solve a Constrained Finite-Horizon Optimal Control Problem (CFHOCP) on-line by numerical optimization. The CFHOCP requires predictions of the controlled system and the environment to be made. In reality, these predictions are subject to uncertainty, resulting from model errors, disturbances, and the uncertain evolution of the environment. In this context, both robust optimization (Robust MPC) and stochastic optimization (Stochastic MPC) have been well explored for handling this uncertainty. However, both approaches suffer from a variety of potential drawbacks, as discussed in this talk. Instead, we explore a much less treaded path that has proven to be very successful in estimation: particles, or in the context of MPC: scenarios. We will discuss the practical aspects of Scenario-Based MPC by looking at two different examples. We will also show that decision making based on scenarios leads into a deep mathematical theory. Recently, great advances were made in this field, but many open questions remain.   About the Speaker: Dr. Georg Schildbach obtained his Masters degrees in Applied Mechanics (Dipl.-Ing.) and Industrial Engineering (Dipl. Wirtsch.-Ing.), both at the Technical University of Darmstadt in Germany. He worked in various positions in the field of quantitative finance and investment banking for two years. Then he joined the Automatic Control Laboratory at ETH Zurich in 2010, where obtained his Ph.D. degree in the field of control and optimization in 2014. He currently holds the position of an Associate Director at the Hyundai of Excellence at UC Berkeley. His research interests evolve around algorithms for optimal and constrained control in uncertain environments, and their application to real-life problems in engineering and finance. His current research focus lies on developing new control algorithms for autonomous driving and intelligent transportation systems.   Semantic processing of visual signals in the era of data abundance   Speaker: Ruonan Li, Harvard University    Time: 11:00 am - 12:00 pm, Mar 23, 2015    Location: 2MTC, 10th floor, Room 10.009, Brooklyn, NY   What does the era of unprecedented amount of images and videos mean to semantic signal processing and machine learning? For inferring simple semantics such as object categories, identities, and event types, two predominant challenges are annotation poverty combined with data-selection bias, and the increased variations among the instances of the same semantic concept. Beyond simple semantics, richer semantics are emerging, such as social interactions and social relationships, to which current machines remain quite blind. I present three research vignettes that account for these challenges and opportunities. The first one introduces one of the earliest unsupervised domain adaption mechanisms that \u202ctransfers knowledge from `in-house&#39; training data (source domain) to a target domain, by exploiting geodesics in the space of factor analyzers, and I will also show its application to natural language processing\u202a. The second one develops a Bayesian optimization framework on a Riemannian manifold with a global convergence guarantee, to remove the spatio-temporal mismatch between two videos of the same type of activity, and I will also show its outstanding performance on a benchmark in operations research. The last one defines multi-dimensional signal models on both vertices and edges of a dynamic graph, and extracts from imagery social interactions, and I will show its impact on transforming research in social science and education.\u202c   About the Speaker: Dr. Ruonan Li is a Research Associate with the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Harvard University, where he was a Postdoctoral Fellow. He received the B.Eng. and M.S. degrees with honors in electronic engineering from Tsinghua University, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Maryland, College Park.

Ruonan Li&#39;s research is focused on understanding signals and datasets that emerge from and evolve with new acquisition and sharing modalities. His work involves image and video data, and is motivated by applications in pattern recognition, semi-supervised and unsupervised learning, spatio-temporal analysis and modeling, and social signal processing.   Robots Perceive, Learn, and Adapt   Speaker: Yu Sun, University of South Florida    Time: 11:00 am - 12:00 pm, Mar 25, 2015    Location: 2MTC, 10th floor, Room 10.099, Brooklyn, NY   To enable robots to work in unstructured environments and perform manipulation tasks with uncertain physical interactions, we propose a novel functional-object-oriented network (FOON) to connect functional-related objects with their interactive manipulation motions. The connections between objects and manipulation motions are learned from observing humans performing daily manipulation tasks. Using a well-trained FOON, robots will be able to decipher a task goal, seek the correct objects to operate, and generate an optimal motion adapted to new conditions. To best facilitate manipulation motions, we also developed new grasping strategies for robots to hold objects with a firm grasp to withstand the disturbance during their physical interactions. In addition, for tasks in computer-assisted surgery, we have developed a comprehensive situation awareness (CSA) platform that is composed of a network of wireless video cameras anchored on the abdominal cavity wall. The CSA platform allows surgeons and computer software to observe a surgical area from different viewpoints and perceive interactions between surgical instrument and tissues for safe and efficient surgery planning and execution.

Distributed Coordination of Power Electronics Systems   Speaker: Ali Davoudi, University of Texas-Arlington    Time: 11:00 am - 12:00 pm, Mar 30, 2015    Location: 2MTC, 10th floor, Room 10.009, Brooklyn, NY   Next generation power distribution systems will be massively populated with power electronics devices with ubiquitous computational and communication capabilities to route power among source/load/storage units. Central to realizing this vision are control paradigms that will allow the emergent behaviors of networked power electronics devices to converge to optimal solutions dictated only by mission requirements, and independent of communication structure limitations or individual converter dynamics. Such control frameworks are discussed here for both AC and DC distribution systems. In AC distribution systems, synchronization of parallel inverters and proportional active and reactive load sharing are studied. In DC distribution systems, voltage regulation and proportional load sharing has been achieved. The research outcomes will enable autonomous, self-organizing, and reliable power distribution systems that will be critical building blocks of the emerging smart grid. Current endeavors and future research directions will be discussed.

Web-scale Multimedia Data Analytics   Speaker: Zhu Liu, AT&amp;T Labs &ndash; Research    Time: 11:00 am - 12:00 pm, Apr 1, 2015    Location: 2MTC, 10th floor, Room 10.009, Brooklyn, NY   Multimedia, the &ldquo;biggest Big Data,&rdquo; is becoming the most important and valuable source for information and insights. Ubiquitous multimedia analytics is the indispensable tool that unlocks the underlying value from the explosively increasing amount of multimedia data. While multimedia analytics technologies have found success in many real world applications, enormous challenges, including the scalability, flexibility, efficiency, and reliability of the underlying techniques, still exist. This talk addresses some of these challenges, and it is composed of two subjects. The first topic is on a real-time and robust multimedia content search system, which is composed of audio- and visual-based copy detection modules and a late fusion scheme. The visual module adopts a bag of visual word representation based on the vocabulary tree quantization method, and it is able to query a database of 4.5 million images within 50 milliseconds. The audio module relies on audio fingerprint extracted from sub-band energies, and it takes less than a second to search a database of 6 thousand music tracks. The second topic is about a novel image hashing algorithm powered by deep learning techniques. Traditional image hashing techniques feed hand-crafted visual features into hash functions, and the proposed deep hashing method simultaneously learns both the visual features and the hash functions utilizing a deep network. Comprehensive quantitative evaluations on several large-scale image benchmarks demonstrate its high accuracy in comparison to other supervised hashing algorithms.

Formulation of Image Quality Metric for Gaussian Blur Images and Dynamic Heart Rate Measurements from Four to Six Seconds Video Frames   Speaker: Raveendran Paramesran, University of Malaya, Malaysia    Time: 2:30 pm - 3:30 pm, Apr 13, 2015    Location: 2MTC, 10th floor, Room 10.009, Brooklyn, NY   In this talk, two current research areas in my lab will be presented. First, we will show how some of the exact Zernike moments can be used in the design of image quality metric to measure the quality of a blurred image. Next, we will show a method on how to obtain the dynamic heart rates of subjects in a cycling exercise from a short duration of video frames.   Features that exhibit human visual perception of image quality scores for blurred images are useful in constructing an image quality metric. In this talk, we show some of the exact Zernike moments (EZMs) that closely model the human quality scores for images of varying degrees of blurriness can be used to measure these distortions. A theoretical framework is developed to identify these EZMs.   The second part of my talk is on how dynamic heart rate measurements that are typically obtained from sensors mounted near to the heart can also be obtained from a short duration of video frames. In this study, two experiments are carried out where a video camera captures the facial images of seven subjects during a cycling exercise.   About the Speaker: P.

Learning From Distributed Private Data: Algorithms and Applications   Speaker: Anand D. Sarwate, Rutgers University    Time: 11:00 am - 12:00 pm, Apr 17, 2015    Location: LC433, 5 MetroTech Center, Brooklyn, NY   Distributed learning from biomedical data is often hindered by ethical, legal, and technological concerns about data sharing. Data holders wish to maintain control over the uses of their data, and patients or study subjects may be hesitant to allow free and open use of their private medical data. Differential privacy is a framework which allows the quantification of privacy risk. In privacy-preserving distributed learning, the data stays at each site: they locally compute a privacy-preserving summary of their information. The summaries are sent to a private aggregator that performs the final analysis. Differentially private algorithms guarantee privacy by deliberately introducing some noise into the computation &ndash; the uncertainty from the noise masks individual data points. This leads to a tradeoff between privacy and accuracy. In this talk I will discuss algorithms for privacy-preserving learning as well as a recent proof-of-concept for this approach applied to neuroimaging data for mental health research.   About the Speaker: Anand D. Sarwate joined as an Assistant Professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey in January 2014.

Control of Islanded Microgrids Encountering Heavy Non-liner Loads   Speaker: Ahmed Mohamed, City University of New York    Time: 2:00 pm - 3:00 pm, Apr 22, 2015    Location: LC433, 5 MetroTech Center, Brooklyn, NY   The smart grid promises radical transformation of the current electricity infrastructure, with a long list of ambitious goals including improved reliability, resiliency and sustainability, smooth integration of renewable and alternative energy resources, controlling emissions, and combating global warming. Microgrid is one of the emerging smart grid killer applications. A truly viable wide-scale microgrid adoption presents utilities with both numerous challenges and opportunities. In this presentation, one of the technical challenges facing islanded microgrids due to their finite inertia will be discussed. Specifically, the impacts of heavy loads, with intermittent non-linear nature, on the stability/security of microgrids operating in an islanded mode will be investigated. A case study on a shipboard power system example representing an islanded microgrid will be presented. The microgrid architecture is assumed to have local renewable energy generation, energy storage system and multiple emergency generators. The impact of non-liner loads will be discussed during normal operating conditions, and in the case of various contingencies. Moreover, a solution to mitigate the effect of these non-linear loads based on storage distribution will be presented.

Improving Long-Term Financial Decision Making Using Behavioral Economics Theory-driven User Interfaces   Speaker: Oded Nov, New York University    Time: 11:00 am - 12:00 pm, May 7, 2015    Location: 2MTC, 10th floor, Room 10.009, Brooklyn, NY   Can human-computer interaction help people make informed and effective decisions about their retirement savings? We applied the behavioral economic theories of endowment effect and loss aversion to the design of novel retirement saving user interfaces. To examine effectiveness, we conducted two experiments in which participants were exposed to one of three experimental user interface designs of a retirement saving simulator, representing endowment effect, loss aversion, social comparison, peer advice and control. Users made 34 yearly asset allocation decisions. We found that designs informed by behavioral economic and social psychology principles and which communicated to savers the long-term implications of their asset allocation choices, led users to adjust their behavior, make larger and more frequent asset allocation changes, and achieve their saving goals more effectively.   Oded Nov is an associate professor at New York University&rsquo;s Polytechnic School of Engineering. He received his PhD from Cambridge University. His research focuses on HCI and financial decision making, and on peer production and social computing.

First, a factorized robust matrix completion algorithm is described to solve the video background subtraction problem. The algorithm decomposes a sequence of video frames into the sum of a low rank background component and a sparse motion component. The next part of the talk discusses how similar low-rank matrix factorization techniques can be used to realize a compact visual feature representation for content retrieval. Finally, an approach based on quantized embeddings is presented as means to achieve a rate-efficient representation of high-dimensional features such that pair-wise distances between the underlying feature vectors are preserved.

Web site: http://www.merl.com/people/avetro   A Framework for Structural Input/Output and Control Configuration Selection of Large - Scale Systems   Speaker: S&eacute;rgio Pequito, University of Pennsylvania    Time: 11:00 am - 12:00 pm, Jan 30, 2015    Location: LC433, 5 MetroTech Center, Brooklyn, NY   The structure control system design consists mainly of two steps: input/output (I/O) selection and control configuration (CC) selection. The first one is devoted to the problem of computing how many actuators/sensors are needed and where should be placed in the plant to obtain some desired property. Control configuration is related to the decentralized control problem and is dedicated to the task of selecting which outputs (sensors) should be available for feedback and to which inputs (actuators) in order to achieve a predefined goal. The choice of inputs and outputs affects the performance, complexity and costs of the control system. Due to the combinatorial nature of the selection problem, an efficient and systematic method is required to complement the designer intuition, experience and physical insight. Motivated by the above, this presentation addresses the structure control system design taking explicitly into consideration the possible application to large - scale systems. We provide an efficient framework to solve the following major minimization problems: i) selection of the minimum number of manipulated/measured variables to achieve structural controllability/observability of the system, and ii) selection of the minimum number of measured and manipulated variables, and feedback interconnections between them such that the system has no structural fixed modes. Contrary to what would be expected, we showed that it is possible to obtain the global solution of the aforementioned minimization problems in polynomial complexity in the number of the state variables of the system. To this effect, we propose a methodology that is efficient (polynomial complexity) and unified in the sense that it solves simultaneously the I/O and the CC selection problems. This is done by exploiting the implications of the I/O selection in the solution to the CC problem.   About the Speaker: S&eacute;rgio Pequito is a postdoctoral researcher at University of Pennsylvania. He obtained his PhD in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Carnegie Mellon University and Instituto Superior T&eacute;cnico, through the CMU-Portugal program. Furthermore, he received his BSc and MSc in Applied Mathematics from the Instituto Superior T&eacute;cnico. Pequito&#39;s research consists in understanding the global qualitative behavior of large scale systems from their structural or parametric descriptions and provide a rigorous framework for the design, analysis, optimization and control of large scale (real-world) systems.

From biomedical imaging to online blogs: Graph signal processing   Speaker: Jelena Kova\u010devi\u0107, Carnegie Mellon University    Time: 11:00 am - 12:00 pm, Feb 12, 2015    Location: 2MTC, 10th floor, Room 10.099, Brooklyn, NY   I will present a path from classification in biomedical imaging to online blogs, where a common thread is graph signal processing, a theoretical framework that generalizes fundamental concepts of classical signal processing from regular domains, such as lines and rectangular lattices, to general graphs. It is particularly applicable to domains such as physical, engineering, and social, where signals are characterized by irregular structure. Signal processing on graphs has found multiple applications, including approximation, sampling, classification, inpainting and clustering, and I will describe some of these.

Information Security in Controlled Dynamical Systems: Trading Utility for Privacy   Speaker: Parv Venkitasubramaniam, Lehigh University    Time: 11:00 am - 12:00 pm, Feb 13, 2015    Location: LC433, 5 MetroTech Center, Brooklyn, NY   Cyber physical systems, which rely on the joint functioning of information and physical systems, are vulnerable to information leakage through the actions of the internal physical control system. In particular, if an external observer has access to input and output variables of the system exposed through cyber communication links, then critical information can be inferred about the internal states of the system and consequently compromise the security of system operation. In this talk, a mathematical framework based on Markov Decision Process models will be discussed to investigate the design of controller actions when an internal state privacy requirement is imposed as part of the system objective. Fundamental tradeoffs will be presented between the privacy achievable-- as measured using information theoretic equivocation-- and the tangible utility of the internal controller. Two examples will be discussed that apply the developed model-- the first maximizes user anonymity in data networks under memory and fairness restrictions, and the second maximizes privacy of energy usage from smart metered electricity measurement using an in-home energy storage mechanism.   About the Speaker: Parv Venkitasubramaniam is an assistant professor in the Electrical and Computer Engineering department at Lehigh University. His current research interests are in developing theoretical foundations for privacy and security for networked cyber and cyber physical systems. He received a B. Tech degree from the Indian Institute of Technology, Madras and graduated with a Ph.D from Cornell University under the advise of Prof. Lang Tong.

Abraham Award and a 2012 NSF CAREER Award.   Mind the Map! The Impact of Subway Map on Passengers&#39; Route Choice Decisions in London and Washington DC   Speaker: Zhan Guo, New York University    Time: 11:00 am - 12:00 pm, Feb 26, 2015    Location: 2MTC, 10th floor, Room 10.099, Brooklyn, NY   Subway users often rely on schematic system maps to identify the best route from A to B. However, the schematic map is always distorted. Some routes may appear longer or shorter on the map than in reality. The line alignment also differs between a schematic map and an actual map. Such distortion may &ldquo;misguide&rdquo; passengers to favor a particular route over another, thus &ldquo;rebalance&rdquo; the passenger flows inside a subway network, creating or relieving bottlenecks in the system. If this is true, schematic subway maps could become an effective planning tool to influence route decisions for the benefits of not only the system but also individual passengers.   The London study, based on actual route choices in the London Underground, tests the first assumption, and confirms that when choosing a route most passengers would trust the schematic map more than their own experience of reality. This is true even for the most experienced passengers who have frequently used the system for many years. The Washington DC study, based on an experiment in the crowdsourcing platform--Amazon&rsquo;s Mechanic Turk, tests the second assumption, and illustrates that changing the length and alignment of lines on a schematic map can switch passengers from bottlenecks to underutilized segments in the DC subway, thus improving the efficiency of the system. Depending on how the lines are exactly modified, the &ldquo;switching&rdquo; effect also differs.   About the Speaker: Zhan Guo studies individuals&rsquo; travel behavior and explores innovative ways to influence the decision-making process to produce better social outcomes such as reduced congestion and carbon emissions. At the micro level, he focuses how travelers perceive travel alternatives and attributes and what discrepancies exist between perception and reality. The ability to reinforce, change, or even deceive that perception to promote the &quot;right&quot; behavior, and the methods used to do so, also figure largely in his research. At the macro level, he is interested in the effect of technical standards, such as parking and street standards, on the built environment and the rationale behind these standards. The (dis)connection between government regulations, market forces, and consumer preferences is the focus of his research. Zhan has conducted empirical work on transfer behavior in Boston, metro map design in London, parking policy in New York, and pedestrian environments in Hong Kong. His work has been covered by New York Times, Wall Street Journal, BBC, Economist, Le Monde, ABC Evening News, the Atlantic Cities, Nudges.org, etc.   Zhan Guo received a B. Arch from Tianjin University, a MUD from Tsinghua University, China, and a MCP and a Ph.D in Urban Planning from MIT.   Proximal Splitting Algorithms in Data Sciences   Speaker: Patrick L. Combettes, Pierre and Marie Curie University, Paris    Time: 11:00 am - 12:00 pm, Mar 2, 2015    Location: LC433, 5 MetroTech Center, Brooklyn, NY   In recent years proximal splitting algorithms have become prominent tools for solving a wide array of data-driven problems. We provide an overview of the field and report on recent developments in the area of complex structured optimization problems. In particular, we present a new block-coordinate approach to tackle problems of very large sizes. Applications to machine learning, inverse problems, and image recovery will be discussed.

He was elected a Fellow of the IEEE in 2005.   Systems, Algorithms, and Applications for Robotic Sensing   Speaker: Pratap Tokekar, University of Pennsylvania    Time: 11:00 am - 12:00 pm, Mar 5, 2015    Location: 2MTC, 10th floor, Room 9.009, Brooklyn, NY   A connected network of robots, sensors, and smart devices has the potential to solve grand challenges in domains such as agronomy, oceanography, and emergency response. Robots will form the &quot;physical&quot; layer of this network and collect data from hard to reach places at unprecedented spatio-temporal scales. A key challenge for roboticists is to design decision-making algorithms that enable optimal sensing and data collection. In this talk, I will present such algorithms for three types of problems: (i) How to cover complex environments using few sensors and robots? (ii) How to optimize the robots&#39; energy to enable long term operation? (iii) How to coordinate teams of robots and sensors?   In the first part, we will focus on the algorithmic aspects of the Art Gallery Problem, a classical sensor placement problem. I will present a new formulation that guarantees a good view of convex objects in polygonal environments, despite self-occlusions. I will present bounds and approximation algorithms for placing minimum number of sensors for this new formulation. I will also present algorithms for robotic coverage and informative path planning problems. In the second part, I will describe techniques for efficient solar energy harvesting and planning energy-aware trajectories for collaborative aerial and ground robots. In the third part, I will present coordination algorithms for target tracking with robotic teams that respects the communication constraints between the robots.   We will study these problems in the context of two practical applications: precision agriculture and autonomous monitoring radio-tagged fish in Minnesota lakes. Throughout the talk, along with theoretical results, I will present experiments conducted with autonomous boats in Minnesota lakes, wheeled robots operating on frozen lakes, and aerial robots operating in corn plots and apple orchards.   About the Speaker: Pratap Tokekar is a Postdoctoral Researcher at the University of Pennsylvania. He obtained his Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Minnesota in 2014 and Bachelor of Technology degree in Electronics and Telecommunication from College of Engineering Pune, India in 2008. His research interests include algorithmic and field robotics, sensor networks, and computational geometry.   Sparse Modeling for High-Dimensional Multi-Manifold Data Analysis   Speaker: Ehsan Elhamifar, University of California, Berkeley    Time: 11:00 am - 12:00 pm, Mar 9, 2015    Location: 2MTC, 10th floor, Room 10.099, Brooklyn, NY   One of the most fundamental challenges facing scientists and engineers across different fields, such as signal/image processing, computer vision, robotics and bioinformatics, is the large amounts of high-dimensional data that need to be analyzed and understood. In this talk, I present provably correct and efficient algorithms, based on the sparse representation theory, for the analysis of high-dimensional datasets by exploiting their underlying low-dimensional structures. I talk about algorithms for the two fundamental problems of clustering and subset selection in unions of subspaces and discuss the robustness of the algorithms to data nuisances. I show that these tools effectively advance the state-of-the-art data analysis in a wide range of important real-world problems, such as segmentation of motions in videos, clustering of images of objects, energy disaggregation and identification of hybrid dynamical systems.   About the Speaker: Ehsan Elhamifar is a postdoctoral scholar in the department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences at the University of California, Berkeley. He obtained his PhD in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the Johns Hopkins University. Ehsan is broadly interested in developing provably correct and efficient data analysis algorithms that can address challenges of complex and large-scale high-dimensional datasets. Specifically, he focuses on the intrinsic low-dimensionality of real data and uses tools from convex geometry and analysis, sparse / low-rank representation, high-dimensional statistics and graph theory to develop such algorithms. Ehsan obtained MS and MSE degrees in Electrical Engineering and Applied Mathematics and Statistics, respectively, from Sharif University of Technology in Iran and the Johns Hopkins University.   Boosting Multimedia Content Analysis with Machine Learning Techniques   Speaker: Zhigang Ma, Carnegie Mellon University    Time: 11:00 am - 12:00 pm, Mar 11, 2015    Location: 2MTC, 10th floor, Room 10.099, Brooklyn, NY   Image and video analysis is the fundamental problem in multimedia community. In this talk, I will present how we improved the performance of multimedia content analysis by leveraging the advance of machine learning. The primary techniques harnessed in our work are comprised of feature selection, semi-supervised learning, learning an intermediate representation and knowledge adaptation. I will start from image annotation. In the literature, many different types of feature have been proposed to capture the semantic information of images. Impressive progress on image analysis has been witnessed based on these feature representations. However, it is inevitable that the feature representation has certain amount of noise and redundancy. Consequently, I will introduce a feature selection algorithm that is able to get a more compact representation, thus improving the annotation accuracy.   We also noticed that multimedia analysis faces a reality that precisely labeled images and videos are difficult to obtain, which is detrimental to learning a robust classifier. To address this issue, we proposed a semi-supervised learning framework for image and video analysis. Our approach is based on semi-supervised learning and it simultaneously considers eliminating feature noise and redundancy. Through extensive experiments on image and video classification, we validate that properly utilizing unlabeled data does contribute to the performance boost.   To step further, I will talk about a more challenging task in multimedia community, i.e., multimedia event detection. A multimedia event is a higher-level semantic abstraction of video sequences than a concept and consists of multiple concepts. As a multimedia event builds upon several basic elements of objects, scenes and human actions we propose to learn an intermediate representation coupled with the classifier learning by exploiting external resources. Our method is capable of learning an optimal event detector that carries more informative cues from the intermediate representation.   Lastly, I will introduce how to exploit knowledge adaptation to improve the performance of multimedia event detection when only few positive exemplars are given. The method is based on the assumption that multimedia events consist of low-level concepts and we proposed to adapt the knowledge from concept level to assist in event detection. Specifically, we use the available video corpora with annotated concepts as our auxiliary resource. Our approach has another desirable property that it is able to adapt knowledge from the source to the target even if the features of them are partially different, but overlapping.

Aerial autonomy at insect scale: What flying insects can tell us about robotics and vice versa   Speaker: Sawyer Buckminster Fuller, Harvard University    Time: 11:00 am - 12:00 pm, Mar 12, 2015    Location: 2MTC, 9th floor, Room 9.009, Brooklyn, NY   Insect-sized aerial robots will be deployed where their small size, low cost, and maneuverability give them an advantage over larger robots. For example, they could follow airborne plumes to locate methane leaks in dense piping infrastructure. Or deploy in swarms to perform detailed environmental monitoring. However, miniaturization poses challenges because scaling physics dictates that many conventional approaches used in larger aircraft, from electric motors and fixed wings, to the Global Positioning System and general-purpose microprocessors, cannot operate effectively at the size of insects. Insects have overcome these challenges, evolving a superlatively robust and agile flight apparatus that can land on flowers buffeted by wind or deftly avoiding a flyswatter. Though a detailed understanding of their flight systems lacking, they inspire robots with similar performance. My research is aimed at understanding the constraints inherent to autonomy -- that is, performing without a human operator -- at the insect scale. This includes investigations into the flight systems of flies and forward engineering robotic equivalents. I will describe experiments that revealed how flies compensate for wind disturbances in flight, and flight tests of insect-inspired controllers for fly-sized aerial robots. The results indicate that the severe power and weight constraints at this scale will require designs in which mechanisms, sensing, and computation are intricately interconnected. This suggests a multi-disciplinary design process that is reminiscent of evolution.   About the Speaker: Sawyer Buckminster Fuller is currently a Postdoctoral Scholar in the Microrobotics Laboratory of Prof. Robert Wood at Harvard. He creates biologically-inspired sensors, control systems, and mechanical designs targeted at insect-sized air vehicles and investigates the flight systems of aerial insects. He completed his Ph.D. in Biological Engineering at the California Institute of Technology and B.S. and M.S. degrees in Mechanical Engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. In addition to his work in insect flight control, he has also developed a frog-hopping robot at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory and invented a 3D ink-jet microfabrication technology at the MIT Media Lab. His work at the intersection of robotics and biology has appeared in Science and Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, and been covered in news outlets such as Wired and The Scientist, and in an article on the cover of The MIT Technology Review.   Scenario-Based Model Predictive Control   Speaker: Georg Schildbach, University of California Berkeley    Time: 11:00 am - 12:00 pm, Mar 13, 2015    Location: LC433, 5 MetroTech Center, Brooklyn, NY   Model Predictive Control (MPC) is a powerful approach for optimal control of multi-variable systems with constraints. Its concept is to repeatedly solve a Constrained Finite-Horizon Optimal Control Problem (CFHOCP) on-line by numerical optimization. The CFHOCP requires predictions of the controlled system and the environment to be made. In reality, these predictions are subject to uncertainty, resulting from model errors, disturbances, and the uncertain evolution of the environment. In this context, both robust optimization (Robust MPC) and stochastic optimization (Stochastic MPC) have been well explored for handling this uncertainty. However, both approaches suffer from a variety of potential drawbacks, as discussed in this talk. Instead, we explore a much less treaded path that has proven to be very successful in estimation: particles, or in the context of MPC: scenarios. We will discuss the practical aspects of Scenario-Based MPC by looking at two different examples. We will also show that decision making based on scenarios leads into a deep mathematical theory. Recently, great advances were made in this field, but many open questions remain.

Semantic processing of visual signals in the era of data abundance   Speaker: Ruonan Li, Harvard University    Time: 11:00 am - 12:00 pm, Mar 23, 2015    Location: 2MTC, 10th floor, Room 10.009, Brooklyn, NY   What does the era of unprecedented amount of images and videos mean to semantic signal processing and machine learning? For inferring simple semantics such as object categories, identities, and event types, two predominant challenges are annotation poverty combined with data-selection bias, and the increased variations among the instances of the same semantic concept. Beyond simple semantics, richer semantics are emerging, such as social interactions and social relationships, to which current machines remain quite blind. I present three research vignettes that account for these challenges and opportunities. The first one introduces one of the earliest unsupervised domain adaption mechanisms that \u202ctransfers knowledge from `in-house&#39; training data (source domain) to a target domain, by exploiting geodesics in the space of factor analyzers, and I will also show its application to natural language processing\u202a. The second one develops a Bayesian optimization framework on a Riemannian manifold with a global convergence guarantee, to remove the spatio-temporal mismatch between two videos of the same type of activity, and I will also show its outstanding performance on a benchmark in operations research. The last one defines multi-dimensional signal models on both vertices and edges of a dynamic graph, and extracts from imagery social interactions, and I will show its impact on transforming research in social science and education.\u202c   About the Speaker: Dr. Ruonan Li is a Research Associate with the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Harvard University, where he was a Postdoctoral Fellow.

Robots Perceive, Learn, and Adapt   Speaker: Yu Sun, University of South Florida    Time: 11:00 am - 12:00 pm, Mar 25, 2015    Location: 2MTC, 10th floor, Room 10.099, Brooklyn, NY   To enable robots to work in unstructured environments and perform manipulation tasks with uncertain physical interactions, we propose a novel functional-object-oriented network (FOON) to connect functional-related objects with their interactive manipulation motions. The connections between objects and manipulation motions are learned from observing humans performing daily manipulation tasks. Using a well-trained FOON, robots will be able to decipher a task goal, seek the correct objects to operate, and generate an optimal motion adapted to new conditions. To best facilitate manipulation motions, we also developed new grasping strategies for robots to hold objects with a firm grasp to withstand the disturbance during their physical interactions. In addition, for tasks in computer-assisted surgery, we have developed a comprehensive situation awareness (CSA) platform that is composed of a network of wireless video cameras anchored on the abdominal cavity wall. The CSA platform allows surgeons and computer software to observe a surgical area from different viewpoints and perceive interactions between surgical instrument and tissues for safe and efficient surgery planning and execution.

Distributed Coordination of Power Electronics Systems   Speaker: Ali Davoudi, University of Texas-Arlington    Time: 11:00 am - 12:00 pm, Mar 30, 2015    Location: 2MTC, 10th floor, Room 10.009, Brooklyn, NY   Next generation power distribution systems will be massively populated with power electronics devices with ubiquitous computational and communication capabilities to route power among source/load/storage units. Central to realizing this vision are control paradigms that will allow the emergent behaviors of networked power electronics devices to converge to optimal solutions dictated only by mission requirements, and independent of communication structure limitations or individual converter dynamics. Such control frameworks are discussed here for both AC and DC distribution systems. In AC distribution systems, synchronization of parallel inverters and proportional active and reactive load sharing are studied. In DC distribution systems, voltage regulation and proportional load sharing has been achieved. The research outcomes will enable autonomous, self-organizing, and reliable power distribution systems that will be critical building blocks of the emerging smart grid. Current endeavors and future research directions will be discussed.

Web-scale Multimedia Data Analytics   Speaker: Zhu Liu, AT&amp;T Labs &ndash; Research    Time: 11:00 am - 12:00 pm, Apr 1, 2015    Location: 2MTC, 10th floor, Room 10.009, Brooklyn, NY   Multimedia, the &ldquo;biggest Big Data,&rdquo; is becoming the most important and valuable source for information and insights. Ubiquitous multimedia analytics is the indispensable tool that unlocks the underlying value from the explosively increasing amount of multimedia data. While multimedia analytics technologies have found success in many real world applications, enormous challenges, including the scalability, flexibility, efficiency, and reliability of the underlying techniques, still exist. This talk addresses some of these challenges, and it is composed of two subjects. The first topic is on a real-time and robust multimedia content search system, which is composed of audio- and visual-based copy detection modules and a late fusion scheme. The visual module adopts a bag of visual word representation based on the vocabulary tree quantization method, and it is able to query a database of 4.5 million images within 50 milliseconds. The audio module relies on audio fingerprint extracted from sub-band energies, and it takes less than a second to search a database of 6 thousand music tracks. The second topic is about a novel image hashing algorithm powered by deep learning techniques. Traditional image hashing techniques feed hand-crafted visual features into hash functions, and the proposed deep hashing method simultaneously learns both the visual features and the hash functions utilizing a deep network. Comprehensive quantitative evaluations on several large-scale image benchmarks demonstrate its high accuracy in comparison to other supervised hashing algorithms.

Formulation of Image Quality Metric for Gaussian Blur Images and Dynamic Heart Rate Measurements from Four to Six Seconds Video Frames   Speaker: Raveendran Paramesran, University of Malaya, Malaysia    Time: 2:30 pm - 3:30 pm, Apr 13, 2015    Location: 2MTC, 10th floor, Room 10.009, Brooklyn, NY   In this talk, two current research areas in my lab will be presented. First, we will show how some of the exact Zernike moments can be used in the design of image quality metric to measure the quality of a blurred image. Next, we will show a method on how to obtain the dynamic heart rates of subjects in a cycling exercise from a short duration of video frames.   Features that exhibit human visual perception of image quality scores for blurred images are useful in constructing an image quality metric. In this talk, we show some of the exact Zernike moments (EZMs) that closely model the human quality scores for images of varying degrees of blurriness can be used to measure these distortions. A theoretical framework is developed to identify these EZMs.   The second part of my talk is on how dynamic heart rate measurements that are typically obtained from sensors mounted near to the heart can also be obtained from a short duration of video frames. In this study, two experiments are carried out where a video camera captures the facial images of seven subjects during a cycling exercise.   About the Speaker: P.

Learning From Distributed Private Data: Algorithms and Applications   Speaker: Anand D. Sarwate, Rutgers University    Time: 11:00 am - 12:00 pm, Apr 17, 2015    Location: LC433, 5 MetroTech Center, Brooklyn, NY   Distributed learning from biomedical data is often hindered by ethical, legal, and technological concerns about data sharing. Data holders wish to maintain control over the uses of their data, and patients or study subjects may be hesitant to allow free and open use of their private medical data. Differential privacy is a framework which allows the quantification of privacy risk. In privacy-preserving distributed learning, the data stays at each site: they locally compute a privacy-preserving summary of their information. The summaries are sent to a private aggregator that performs the final analysis. Differentially private algorithms guarantee privacy by deliberately introducing some noise into the computation &ndash; the uncertainty from the noise masks individual data points. This leads to a tradeoff between privacy and accuracy. In this talk I will discuss algorithms for privacy-preserving learning as well as a recent proof-of-concept for this approach applied to neuroimaging data for mental health research.   About the Speaker: Anand D. Sarwate joined as an Assistant Professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey in January 2014.

Microgrid is one of the emerging smart grid killer applications. A truly viable wide-scale microgrid adoption presents utilities with both numerous challenges and opportunities. In this presentation, one of the technical challenges facing islanded microgrids due to their finite inertia will be discussed. Specifically, the impacts of heavy loads, with intermittent non-linear nature, on the stability/security of microgrids operating in an islanded mode will be investigated. A case study on a shipboard power system example representing an islanded microgrid will be presented. The microgrid architecture is assumed to have local renewable energy generation, energy storage system and multiple emergency generators. The impact of non-liner loads will be discussed during normal operating conditions, and in the case of various contingencies. Moreover, a solution to mitigate the effect of these non-linear loads based on storage distribution will be presented.

Improving Long-Term Financial Decision Making Using Behavioral Economics Theory-driven User Interfaces   Speaker: Oded Nov, New York University    Time: 11:00 am - 12:00 pm, May 7, 2015    Location: 2MTC, 10th floor, Room 10.009, Brooklyn, NY   Can human-computer interaction help people make informed and effective decisions about their retirement savings? We applied the behavioral economic theories of endowment effect and loss aversion to the design of novel retirement saving user interfaces. To examine effectiveness, we conducted two experiments in which participants were exposed to one of three experimental user interface designs of a retirement saving simulator, representing endowment effect, loss aversion, social comparison, peer advice and control. Users made 34 yearly asset allocation decisions. We found that designs informed by behavioral economic and social psychology principles and which communicated to savers the long-term implications of their asset allocation choices, led users to adjust their behavior, make larger and more frequent asset allocation changes, and achieve their saving goals more effectively.   Oded Nov is an associate professor at New York University&rsquo;s Polytechnic School of Engineering. He received his PhD from Cambridge University.
