If you are participating in a dual-enrollment program, you should apply as a freshman even if you will have earned enough college credits for an associate's degree upon completion of your program. If you have left high school early and are attending a college or university as a full-time student, you must apply as a transfer student.     All applicants must apply by submitting a Common Application online, which includes a Writing Supplement.          Key Dates and Deadlines  Application Type Application Deadline Financial Aid Deadline Notification Date   Early Decision I  November 1 November 15 December 15  Early Decision II  January 1 January 15 February 15  Regular Decision  January 1 February 15 April 1      Applicants to Tisch School of the Arts or Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development :   We recommend submitting the Common Application one month in advance for any program that requires an artistic review . This will allow you more time to prepare your portfolio or schedule an audition by the application deadline.              Applying for Early Decision at NYU   Philosophy and Process     NYU's Early Decision programs are binding agreements: if an applicant is offered admission and provided with a financial aid package that enables the student to enroll, the student must withdraw any previously submitted applications and accept NYU's admission offer \u2013 roughly within 2-3 weeks of receiving an admission offer. Students are then restricted from filing any new applications as well. We believe that part of our commitment to Early Decision applicants is to provide an &quot;early&quot; decision, and as a result, we either admit or deny Early Decision candidates. Please note that Early Decision students who are denied admission may not re-apply as Regular Decision applicants.   Students applying for Early Decision admission must follow the same procedures and submit all of the same materials outlined on the instructions page of our website, including meeting any Additional Program Requirements for the student\u2019s school or college of interest.   Early Decision and Financial Aid   NYU uses the same methodology in providing financial aid for Early Decision candidates as we do in providing financial aid for Regular Decision candidates. Students are not offered more or less financial aid based on when they apply for admission.   For Early Decision candidates, we use information students share with us via the CSS Profile application, administered by the College Board, to provide admitted students with an estimated financial aid package with their admissions decision. Students who are admitted during ED I must follow up by submitting the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) to be provided with their official financial aid award in late April.   Students will only be released from the Early Decision agreement if their estimated financial aid package does not enable them to attend. Students must be aware that applying Early Decision will not enable them to compare financial aid packages from other universities. If comparing financial aid packages will be necessary for a student, the student should apply under our Regular Decision program. NYU will still reserve the majority of our admission offers for students applying for Regular Decision, so students should not feel pressure to apply Early Decision if finances are of concern.   Advantages and Disadvantages of Applying Early Decision   The biggest advantage to applying Early Decision is that if you are offered admission, your search process can be completed early and thus, reduce anxiety over the admission process. Our Early Decision programs are only binding if we are able to admit you to your primary school, college, program or campus of interest. If offered admission, you will have 25 days to respond to your offer of admission. You may not apply Early Decision for one campus and request to be considered under our Regular Decision for another campus. You will be considered for any and all campuses when you initially apply for admission.   Many students want to know if it is \u201ceasier\u201d to be admitted through our Early Decision process. The reality is that no, it is not \u201ceasier\u201d to be admitted Early Decision, as the quantifiable criteria we use to evaluate candidates for admission \u2013 GPA and class rank (if available), test scores, etc. \u2013 is the same during both the Early and Regular Decision processes. That said, given the relatively small size of our Early Decision applicant pool, we are sometimes able to admit a larger percentage of our applicants during Early Decision. For our New York campus, however, our most recent admit rate was roughly 32% - both Early Decision and Regular Decision.

NYU Shanghai applicants who are offered admission to an alternative program or campus at NYU will be released from the binding agreement\u00a0but will be asked to either accept or decline their offer of admission within 25 days of receiving it.   Students who are offered Early Decision admission are prohibited from filing any new applications once they confirm their intent to enroll at NYU Shanghai. Early Decision applicants who are denied admission may not reapply as Regular Decision applicants in the same application cycle.   Students applying for Early Decision admission must follow the same procedures and submit all of the same materials outlined on the Application Requirements page of our website. Please be mindful of the deadlines associated with the Early Decision plan; late or incomplete applications will not be considered.   Applicants to Multiple NYU Campuses   Students who are interested in applying to NYU Shanghai and one of NYU\u2019s other campus locations should submit only one application and indicate their alternate program(s) of interest. Applicants must select Early Decision I, Early Decision II, or Regular Decision, which will be the admissions plan for all New York University campuses, programs, and schools for which they intend to be considered. A student cannot opt to apply Early Decision I for one NYU campus or program and Early Decision II or Regular Decision for another.   You will be released from the binding Early Decision agreement if you are offered admission to anything other than your primary campus, program, or school of interest.   Early Decision and Financial Support   NYU Shanghai uses the same methodology in providing financial support for Early Decision candidates as we do in providing financial support for Regular Decision candidates. Students are not offered more or less financial support based on when they apply for admission.   Early Decision candidates\u2019 financial circumstances are evaluated based on the CSS/Financial Aid\u00a0Profile application, administered by the College Board (a separate US\u00a0nonprofit organization). Based on this evaluation, NYU will provide an estimated financial support package with the admissions decision. US\u00a0citizens and permanent residents who are admitted during Early Decision are required to submit the FAFSA by February 15. The final financial aid package will be awarded in April. Applicants must submit the appropriate forms by the deadlines to be considered for financial aid.   You will be released from the Early Decision agreement if your estimated financial support package does not enable you to attend.   Advantages and Disadvantages of Applying Early Decision   The biggest advantage to applying Early Decision is that if you are offered admission, your college search process can then be completed early, thus reducing anxiety associated with the college admissions process.   However, it is important to be sure that you have all of your admissions-related information available at the time you apply\u2014including academic transcripts, actual or predicted exam results (predicted results must be provided by your school), teacher evaluations, etc. If you can complete your application by the Early Decision I deadline\u2014November 1\u2014and you are prepared to commit to NYU Shanghai,\u00a0then this may be the best option for you.   Many students want to know if it is easier\u00a0to be admitted through our Early Decision process. The reality is that the criteria we use to evaluate candidates for admission\u2014academic transcript and class rank (if available), test scores, teacher evaluations, potential fit with our campus, etc.\u2014is the same during both the Early Decision and Regular Decision processes. That said, given the relatively small size of our Early Decision applicant pool, we have been, in recent years, able to admit a larger percentage of our applicants during Early Decision.
