Richard Olivier, 1989), presented by Brent Edwards (Columbia University)   Presented by the Colloquium for Unpopular Culture     \u201cI\u2019m sad because I\u2019m schizophrenic, torn between many passions, desires and lovers. I\u2019m sad because I know the bottom line. I know what is going to happen to this world.\u201d     \u201cI\u2019m an orphan. And Ostend? That\u2019s my orphanage.\u201d     By 1981 Marvin Gaye was pretty much washed up. Heavily in debt, on the run from the I.R.S., in the middle of protracted divorces from Motown and from his wife, overing up mini-mountains of cocaine each day, abusive to his many partners, and, prone to dropping references to Nostradamus and Revelations, increasingly convinced that Apocalypse was imminent. He ended up in Ostend, a Belgian seafront town where, largely ignored by locals (\u201cWhere are you from? Paraguay?\u201d), he gazed at the grey skies, ran across lonely beaches and played darts badly in family cafes. He called it \u201ca beat back in tempo\u201d. It was a time of drift, reflection, expansion. A time of taking stock and recharging. Some kind of analogue to David Bowie\u2019s stay in Berlin at the end of the 1970s. Some kind of interregnum before the international but short-lived success of Sexual Healing and his violent death at the hands of his preacher father in 1984.     TRANSIT OSTEND is a moody, sometimes funny and quietly unforgettable portrait of the troubled singer that has long enjoyed a word-of-mouth reputation among filmmakers (Paul Kelly cited it as an influence on Lawrence Of Belgravia, his documentary about Lawrence from Felt), has inspired a song by the Band of Holy Joy (as well as a long-running comic routine by Reeves and Mortimer), but has rarely been seen.     BRENT EDWARDS, who will present Transit Ostend, is a Professor in the Department of English and Comparative Literature and the Center for Jazz Studies at Columbia University. His books include The Practice of Diaspora (2003), Uptown Conversation: The New Jazz Studies (2004), and the forthcoming Epistrophies: Jazz and the Literary Imagination. His current projects include the restoration of Sweet Willie Rollbar\u2019s Orientation (an experimental film made by Julius Hemphill and members of the Black Artists Group in 1972), and a translation of Michel Leiris\u2019s 1934 classic Phantom Africa.

Location: Fales Library, 70 Washington Square South, Third Floor            ,           Medieval Virtual Seminar: \"The Subtlety and Philosophy of Limoux N\u00e8gre's Coagulating Cosmos,\" Professor Louisa A. Burnham (Middlebury College)   Presented by the Medieval Virtual Seminar, a collaboration of the University of Bristol, The University of Oslo, Middlebury College, and New York University. A series of lectures on topics in medieval studies, one hosted by each institution, to take place during the 2014-15 academic year.     In 1329, Limoux N\u00e8gre was burned at the stake as an unrepentant heretic who claimed mystical inspiration for what he called his \"subtlety\" and his \"philosophy.\" The beliefs he professed were unlike any the inquisitors of Carcassonne had ever heard: skeptical and materialist, but also blasphemous, fantastical, and difficult for inquisitors and scholars alike to untangle. In this paper, I will argue that his mystical revelations bloomed on an alchemical substrate and that his most outrageous assertions regarding Jesus's death and resurrection were based on the science of the Pseudo-Llullian Testamentum.   Location: 3 Washington Square Village, Suite 1M (Ground Floor), Conference Room 104            ,           Book Talk: In Conversation with Daniel Schulman   Presented by the Tamiment Library and the John Brademas Center     Please join us for an upcoming book talk, \"In Conversation with Daniel Schulman\" on February 18th (6:00 PM) at the Tamiment Library.

While the observation that this fiction is a project in writing the nation may have grown to be something of a commonplace, what is less generally recognized is its inflection by elite ideologies of rule. I am interested in tracking the anxiety, rivalry, and ambivalence that surround the precariousness of elite authority on the national scene. In successive chapters of the book I seek out the internal contradictions and external threats that destabilize the status and assumptions of this historical ruling class. This paper identifies the connections, affective and historical, that a post-Independence-born generation of authors and their protagonists variously develop with their nationalist fathers in the process of inheriting the nation.      Rajeswari Sunder Rajan is Global Distinguished Professor in the Department of English at New York University, and has taught earlier at the universities of Delhi and Oxford. She works in the areas of postcolonial studies, feminist theory, gender, law, and religion in South Asia, British Victorian literature and the Anglophone novel in India.

Reception to follow   RSVP by February 13, 2015.   Location: Hemmerdinger Hall, Silver Center of Arts and Science            ,               Legacy in the Dust: The Four Aces Story, presented by Vivien Goldman   Few clubs in Britain can claim to have a history as illustrious as The Four Aces in Dalston, north-east London. Set up by Jamaican-born Newton Dunbar in 1967 to play blue beat, rocksteady and ska, it soon became a mecca not just for the capital's growing Caribbean population but for all Londoners bored of the sifted, soulless sounds they were hearing on mainstream radio. The club was a place to dance, but also a community centre, a para-academic space, a retreat from the increasingly militarised, stop-and-frisk streetscapes outside. Musicians such as Bob Marley, Joe Strummer, Stevie Wonder and even Bob Dylan made a beeline there. It played a pivotal role in the development of lover's rock, acid house, jungle and happy hardcore. But it was hated by local politicians and property speculators who demonised it as a gangster hang-out and Yardie-run drug hole before colluding to money-maim it into a block of luxury apartments. LEGACY IN THE DUST unearths rare archival material, talks to pioneering musicians such as Bunny Lee and Dennis Bovell, and tells - with love and with sadness - the rich history of a remarkable club.     LEGACY IN THE DUST will be presented by writer, broadcaster and post-punk musician VIVIEN GOLDMAN who spent many halcyon nights at The Four Aces. As well as recording a number of classic records, both solo and in Chantage, she has written for the likes of The Flying Lizards, Massive Attack and Ryuichi Sakamoto. She is an Adjunct Professor at NYU's Clive Davis Institute of Recorded Music, Tisch School of the Arts where she teaches punk, Fela Kuti and reggae. Her five books include two on Bob Marley, most recently The Book of Exodus: The Making & Meaning of Marley's Album of the Century (Three Rivers Press). A Londoner, she now resides in Jackson Heights, Queens.     LEGACY IN THE DUST is the first screening in History Is Made At Night , an occasional series that gets its name from Neil Gordon-Orr's blog devoted to the politics of dancing and musicking.

Exploring how the performative can complement the exegetical and theoretical, Professor Gunn will also offer a live reading from Beckett\u2019s selected correspondence.     Daniel Gunn is Professor of Comparative Literature and English at the American University of Paris and Co-Editor of the monumental four volume The Letters of Samuel Beckett (Cambridge UP, 2009-Present).            ,           Medieval Virtual Seminar: \"Searching for Marguerite Porete,\" Professor E.A.R Brown (City University of New York)       Location: 3 Washington Square Village, Suite 1M, Conference Room 104            , -           \"Translation-Machination\" Conference   This event explores the changing circumstances of linguistic exchange and considers the implications of translation as a language technology from a media theoretical perspective. It aims to render discernible the materialities of translation as they shape and are shaped by the contours of politics of economies of language and culture.

Henry V and the Use of Languages,\u201d Malcolm Vale (Emeritus Research Fellow of History, St. John\u2019s College)   The reign of Henry V (1413-1422) was not only concerned with military victories. It also witnessed the emergence of the English language as an idiom and medium of government, politics and administration. For the first time since the Anglo-Saxon era, English was formally accepted as a language in which the ruler addressed his correspondents, officers and subjects. His promotion of English was part of an increasing \u2018personalisation\u2019 of kingship, and, paradoxically, its furtherance owed something to the continental ambitions of the English crown. We hear much about the rise of an English literary vernacular; less about its everyday use as a language of government, administration and business. The lecture will try to redress the balance.   Location: The Event Space, 244 Greene St.            , -           Renaissance Salon Meeting   You are invited to the Renaissance Salon Meetings for Spring Semester 2015.

Location: Event Space, 244 Greene St.            ,           Reading for Mood: A Lecture by Jonathan Flatley (Wayne State University, Visiting Professor NYU)   Presented by the Department of Performance Studies Lecture Series     This lecture examines the usefulness of mood as a critical term at the current moment. Beginning with a consideration of the distinct places of affect in aesthetic theory and in critical reading practices, it makes a case for Martin Heidegger\u2019s understanding of Stimmung (which could also be translated as attunement) as a critical concept that helps us to read for the historicity and potentially political effects of aesthetic practices. To give an example of \u201creading for mood,\u201d I turn to the film Finally Got the News (1970), which the League of Revolutionary Black Workers made in collaboration with the Newsreel collective. I read this film as an attempt by the League to engage in the project of sustaining the revolutionary mood that had been awakened by the Dodge Revolutionary Union Movement in 1968: how can such a mood, once awakened, be maintained? How does a politically active collective sustain and refresh itself?     The Performance Studies Lecture Series is a series of evening events featuring preeminent scholars and practitioners in the fields of art and performance. The events are presented on weekday evenings in the department's studio space, and are designed to create an informal and intimate setting for intellectual exchange among artists, students and scholars.

Location: Room 222, 19 University Place            , -           \"Modernity, world literature, and early modernisms in India,\" Supriya Chaudhuri (Jadavpur University)   Professor Chaudhuri\u2019s paper will examine the contested notion of world literature in the context of Bengali and other Indian modernisms in early twentieth century India. It has been argued that the idea of a world literature is tied in with the global reach of capital and its production of what Fredric Jameson calls a \u2018singular modernity\u2019 as well as what Franco Moretti describes as \u2018the world literary system\u2019. On such a view modernist literary communities in Calcutta or Buenos Aires are peripheral to the core modernist projects developed in Europe and America. This paper will posit instead the existence of a set of distributed, often resistant centers, whose members experience, as immediately as their European counterparts, the trauma, violence, and \u2018loss of history\u2019 that the process of modernization involves, and who struggle for a form of aesthetic recourse. How do early Indian modernisms negotiate with the world and with a notion of world literature? To understand this, Professor Chaudhuri will examine Rabindranath Tagore\u2019s essays on \u2018World Literature\u2019 (1907) and \u2018Modern Poetry\u2019 (1931) and his differences with the modernists; at rifts within early modernist groups; and at political radicalism and cosmopolitan friendships in the 1930s.   Location: The Event Space, 244 Greene St.            , -               MARC Distinguished Lecture Series: \u201cTelling Tales: Piero di Cosimo, Renaissance Painter of Faith and Fantasy,\u201d Dennis Geronimus (NYU Art History)   Occasioned by the first-ever museum exhibition of Piero di Cosimo (1462-1522) painting career, now on view at the National Gallery of Art, Washington, this talk will introduce us to the most spellbinding storyteller of Renaissance Florence. A contemporary of Botticelli and Leonardo, Piero was esteemed in his day as a creative spirit of rare imagination, his visual poems rivaling the verses of the ancient poets whose myths and allegories he set out to transform in a wonderfully strange language all his own.     As his impressive list of patrons attests, Piero used his creative license to great advantage, devising elaborate fables the meanings of which continue to beguile us. But fantasy was not Piero\u2019s only domain. Equally compelling was his versatility as a master of many different styles, moods and subjects, sacred and profane. The common thread throughout is Piero\u2019s appeal to magical thinking.

Location: The Event Space, 244 Greene St.            ,               Surrounding One\u2019s Self with the Beauty of Life: Historicizing Nineteenth-Century Latina/o Writing   What distinguishes literature from other forms of writing? For example, Latina/o literary historians have uncovered only a handful of novels written by U.S. Latinas/os in the nineteenth century. And yet, the nineteenth-century Latina/o archive is chock-full of writing, both in manuscript-form and printed documents. How can these other documents contribute to our understanding of Latina/o literary history, and how might they force us to get at the root of what literature is supposed to offer? In 1850s San Antonio, Texas, Florencia Leal, a teenager attending the first girls\u2019 school, kept a beautiful journal where she transcribed letters to friends, wrote poems, copied lessons from school, and included sketches. My talk will address these questions by paying close attention to her journal, the earliest document written by a Texas-Mexican woman that I have been able to find in the course of fifteen years of archival research.     Ra\u00fal Coronado is an Associate Professor of Ethnic Studies at UC Berkeley. Prior to Berkeley, Coronado was an associate professor in the English Department at the University of Chicago. Coronado's research focuses on Latina/o literary and intellectual history, from the colonial period to the 1940s. His first book A World Not to Come: A History of Latino Writing and Print Culture (Harvard 2013) won numerous awards, including the Modern Language Association Prize for a First Book and the Sixteenth Annual Susanne M. Glasscock Humanities Book Prize for Interdisciplinary Scholarship. This event is free and open to the public.   Location: 20 Cooper Square, 4th Floor            ,               Medieval Forum Two-Part Event: \"Containing Texts: Literature in One, Two, and Three Dimensions,\" Thomas A. Bredehoft   Tom Bredehoft's talk examines the literary implications of textual materiality, specifically the literary effects and uses of the three-dimensional objects we call books or codexes. In asking whether the shape of the physical container affects or constrains the shapes of the texts it contains, Bredehoft opens the door for a new understanding of textual dimensionality, including a clarification of whether verse is to be understood as one-dimensional or two. Consider examples ranging from Anglo-Saxon poems to the contemporary comics of Chris Ware, Bredehoft argues that two- and three-dimensional texts give us crucial insight into both the unconscious habits of typographic print textuality and the promises and challenges of digital text.   Location: The Event Space, 244 Greene St.            ,           Poetry Reading: Theo Dorgan reads from Nine Bright Shiners   Cork-born Theo Dorgan is a novelist, translator, editor, sailor and poet whose most recent collection of poems, Nine Bright Shiners (Dedalus Press, 2014) was an Irish Times notable book of the year. He has also won the O'Shaughnessy Award for Irish Poetry and Listowel Prize for Poetry.     Theo Dorgan will read from Nine Bright Shiners , a sequence of elegies that reflect on early and recent deaths, from the loss of his infant sister to that of a contemporary by suicide. The book is unflinching in facing up to death and the poet\u2019s own mortality, but these dark meditations are framed by, subsumed into, whole-hearted celebrations of love, life, art and voyaging.     A former Director of Poetry Ireland/\u00c9igse \u00c9ireann, Theo has worked extensively as a broadcaster of literary programs on both radio and television. His other poetry collections include The Ordinary House of Love and Rosa Mundi (reprinted together as What This Earth Cost Us ), as well as, in Italian, La Case ai Margini del Mundo . He has edited several volumes.     Introduction by Luke Gibbons of Maynooth University, Ireland, Visiting Professor at NYU for Spring 2015.

Location: TBA            ,               The Presence of the Past: Histories of the 18th-Century Transatlantic Book Trade in the Digital Age (Molly Hardy)   The digitization of early modern texts offers an encounter with temporal dislocation as new and old media meet. The presence of the past in objects that have been retained and remediated is at once foregrounded and elided in the digital moment. With examples from the eighteenth-century transatlantic book trade as represented in library catalogs and content databases, Molly O'Hagan Hardy will examine time's traces in the archives and how such traces can be re-conceived or eclipsed in digital humanities projects, ultimately asking how dueling temporalities define scholarly practices of research on archival materials in the digital age.     Molly Hardy manages the Isaiah Thomas Broadside Ballads digital project, the Database of the Early American Book Trades, and the Digital Antiquarian initiative. She has recently completed a digital edition of A Narrative of the Proceedings of the Black People, During the Late Awful Calamity in Philadelphia (1794). She received her in PhD in English from the University of Texas Austin, and her scholarship on archival research has appeared in The New Centennial Review and Book History .

Joyce\u2019s stylistic innovations are haunted by memory that slips its moorings in inner life, and circulates through the silences and shadows of a colonial counter-public sphere.     Luke Gibbons is professor of Irish literary and cultural studies at Maynooth University, Ireland, and the author of several books. He is Visiting Professor at NYU for Spring 2015.

But this sort of re-thinking has rarely been retrospective. A \"pre-history\" of postcolonial ideas is evident in the great internationalist movement of Third-Worldism that took place in the wake of decolonization after WWII. In this paper, Professor Srivastava compares postcolonial receptions of Frantz Fanon with earlier, Third-Worldist and anti-colonial receptions in the Italian context, with discussions of his role in influencing Italian psychiatry and renovating European Marxism. By examining 1960s and 1970s Italian editions and translations of his texts, she argues that historicizing this major anti-colonial thinker can lead to a re-reading of Fanon's theoretical body of work and his significance to the field.

The struggle for a comprehensive \u201cpermission to perform,\u201d which serves as a reminder of the disparity in power between the occupier and the occupied, characterizes the relationship between the Palestinian theatre artists and the state of Israel. I define \u201cpermission to perform\u201d as the guaranteed ability to legally, physically, literally, and publicly perform the experience of the oppressed under a systematically oppressive structure. By presenting three stories from the 1960s, 1970s, and the 1980s, I show that the Israeli censors\u2019 performance permit did not necessarily offer Palestinians the ability to perform freely. But in the struggle for such permission, these artists and their supporters created an inspiring model for cultural resistance.     Dr. Al-Saber is a Mellon Postdoctoral Fellow in the Department of Theatre at Davidson College. His teaching and scholarship focus on the intersections of cultural production and political conflict.

Continuing this semester's focus on Marxist urban theory, we'll be looking at two essays from Edward Soja's Postmodern Geographies (chapters 3 and 4, attached). The first contains core concepts in Soja's reading of Henri Lefebvre, and frames the subfield of Marxist geography as it emerged in the 1970s. The second comprises Soja's formulation of uneven geographical development via David Harvey and Ernest Mandel. This makes for a good transition from our last session on Harvey and should provide a useful point of entry into Soja's work. And yet it misses much, notably leaving out his clearest postmodern commitments and famous case studies of Los Angeles (chapters 7, 8 and 9), his foray into ontology and critique of Heidegger (chapter 5), as well as his useful tour of developments in the spatial imaginary of critical social theory (chapters 1 and 2). I hope we'll get to briefly discuss these other bits, and if you get the chance, take a look at the last two chapters in particular.   Location: 244 Greene Street, Rm 805           May          ,           Medieval Movie Night: Kingdom of Heaven       Location: Event Space, 244 Greene St.            ,           Transported: Imagining colonies with Edward Gibbon Wakefield and the young Charlotte Bront\u00eb   In 1829 in the seclusion of the Parsonage at Howarth in Yorkshire, a twelve-year-old Charlotte Bront\u00eb and her three younger siblings imagined a colony in Africa, a place they called Glass Town. On tiny pieces of paper sewn together into books, they composed an intricate saga of conquest and colonisation by a group of European discoverers. In the same year, the philosophical radical and occasional rake, Edward Gibbon Wakefield imagined a colony in Australia in his newspaper serial, \u2018Letter From Sydney\u2019. Wakefield\u2019s theory of colonisation, \u2018systematic colonisation\u2019, influenced some of the most important thinkers of his day, and shaped British colonial policy throughout the middle decades of the century -- surprisingly, perhaps, given that he wrote the \u2018Letter\u2019 while in Newgate prison, serving a sentence for a sexual crime, and had never been to Australia. Bront\u00eb\u2019s juvenile stories and Wakefield\u2019s text are different in style, scale, and intent, yet they share some intriguing preoccupations and contexts. Taken together they provide some commentary on this important phase of transcontinental migrations of the nineteenth century. In this paper I consider their parallel disquisitions on mobility, transportation (in relation to migration, punishment, and the imagination), individual freedom, and the capture of property and persons.

Richard Olivier, 1989), presented by Brent Edwards (Columbia University)   Presented by the Colloquium for Unpopular Culture     \u201cI\u2019m sad because I\u2019m schizophrenic, torn between many passions, desires and lovers. I\u2019m sad because I know the bottom line. I know what is going to happen to this world.\u201d     \u201cI\u2019m an orphan. And Ostend? That\u2019s my orphanage.\u201d     By 1981 Marvin Gaye was pretty much washed up. Heavily in debt, on the run from the I.R.S., in the middle of protracted divorces from Motown and from his wife, overing up mini-mountains of cocaine each day, abusive to his many partners, and, prone to dropping references to Nostradamus and Revelations, increasingly convinced that Apocalypse was imminent. He ended up in Ostend, a Belgian seafront town where, largely ignored by locals (\u201cWhere are you from? Paraguay?\u201d), he gazed at the grey skies, ran across lonely beaches and played darts badly in family cafes. He called it \u201ca beat back in tempo\u201d. It was a time of drift, reflection, expansion. A time of taking stock and recharging. Some kind of analogue to David Bowie\u2019s stay in Berlin at the end of the 1970s. Some kind of interregnum before the international but short-lived success of Sexual Healing and his violent death at the hands of his preacher father in 1984.     TRANSIT OSTEND is a moody, sometimes funny and quietly unforgettable portrait of the troubled singer that has long enjoyed a word-of-mouth reputation among filmmakers (Paul Kelly cited it as an influence on Lawrence Of Belgravia, his documentary about Lawrence from Felt), has inspired a song by the Band of Holy Joy (as well as a long-running comic routine by Reeves and Mortimer), but has rarely been seen.     BRENT EDWARDS, who will present Transit Ostend, is a Professor in the Department of English and Comparative Literature and the Center for Jazz Studies at Columbia University. His books include The Practice of Diaspora (2003), Uptown Conversation: The New Jazz Studies (2004), and the forthcoming Epistrophies: Jazz and the Literary Imagination. His current projects include the restoration of Sweet Willie Rollbar\u2019s Orientation (an experimental film made by Julius Hemphill and members of the Black Artists Group in 1972), and a translation of Michel Leiris\u2019s 1934 classic Phantom Africa.

Burnham (Middlebury College)   Presented by the Medieval Virtual Seminar, a collaboration of the University of Bristol, The University of Oslo, Middlebury College, and New York University. A series of lectures on topics in medieval studies, one hosted by each institution, to take place during the 2014-15 academic year.     In 1329, Limoux N\u00e8gre was burned at the stake as an unrepentant heretic who claimed mystical inspiration for what he called his \"subtlety\" and his \"philosophy.\" The beliefs he professed were unlike any the inquisitors of Carcassonne had ever heard: skeptical and materialist, but also blasphemous, fantastical, and difficult for inquisitors and scholars alike to untangle. In this paper, I will argue that his mystical revelations bloomed on an alchemical substrate and that his most outrageous assertions regarding Jesus's death and resurrection were based on the science of the Pseudo-Llullian Testamentum.   Location: 3 Washington Square Village, Suite 1M (Ground Floor), Conference Room 104            ,           Book Talk: In Conversation with Daniel Schulman   Presented by the Tamiment Library and the John Brademas Center     Please join us for an upcoming book talk, \"In Conversation with Daniel Schulman\" on February 18th (6:00 PM) at the Tamiment Library.

While the observation that this fiction is a project in writing the nation may have grown to be something of a commonplace, what is less generally recognized is its inflection by elite ideologies of rule. I am interested in tracking the anxiety, rivalry, and ambivalence that surround the precariousness of elite authority on the national scene. In successive chapters of the book I seek out the internal contradictions and external threats that destabilize the status and assumptions of this historical ruling class. This paper identifies the connections, affective and historical, that a post-Independence-born generation of authors and their protagonists variously develop with their nationalist fathers in the process of inheriting the nation.      Rajeswari Sunder Rajan is Global Distinguished Professor in the Department of English at New York University, and has taught earlier at the universities of Delhi and Oxford. She works in the areas of postcolonial studies, feminist theory, gender, law, and religion in South Asia, British Victorian literature and the Anglophone novel in India.

Reception to follow   RSVP by February 13, 2015.   Location: Hemmerdinger Hall, Silver Center of Arts and Science            ,               Legacy in the Dust: The Four Aces Story, presented by Vivien Goldman   Few clubs in Britain can claim to have a history as illustrious as The Four Aces in Dalston, north-east London. Set up by Jamaican-born Newton Dunbar in 1967 to play blue beat, rocksteady and ska, it soon became a mecca not just for the capital's growing Caribbean population but for all Londoners bored of the sifted, soulless sounds they were hearing on mainstream radio. The club was a place to dance, but also a community centre, a para-academic space, a retreat from the increasingly militarised, stop-and-frisk streetscapes outside. Musicians such as Bob Marley, Joe Strummer, Stevie Wonder and even Bob Dylan made a beeline there. It played a pivotal role in the development of lover's rock, acid house, jungle and happy hardcore. But it was hated by local politicians and property speculators who demonised it as a gangster hang-out and Yardie-run drug hole before colluding to money-maim it into a block of luxury apartments. LEGACY IN THE DUST unearths rare archival material, talks to pioneering musicians such as Bunny Lee and Dennis Bovell, and tells - with love and with sadness - the rich history of a remarkable club.     LEGACY IN THE DUST will be presented by writer, broadcaster and post-punk musician VIVIEN GOLDMAN who spent many halcyon nights at The Four Aces. As well as recording a number of classic records, both solo and in Chantage, she has written for the likes of The Flying Lizards, Massive Attack and Ryuichi Sakamoto. She is an Adjunct Professor at NYU's Clive Davis Institute of Recorded Music, Tisch School of the Arts where she teaches punk, Fela Kuti and reggae. Her five books include two on Bob Marley, most recently The Book of Exodus: The Making & Meaning of Marley's Album of the Century (Three Rivers Press). A Londoner, she now resides in Jackson Heights, Queens.     LEGACY IN THE DUST is the first screening in History Is Made At Night , an occasional series that gets its name from Neil Gordon-Orr's blog devoted to the politics of dancing and musicking.

Henry V and the Use of Languages,\u201d Malcolm Vale (Emeritus Research Fellow of History, St. John\u2019s College)   The reign of Henry V (1413-1422) was not only concerned with military victories. It also witnessed the emergence of the English language as an idiom and medium of government, politics and administration. For the first time since the Anglo-Saxon era, English was formally accepted as a language in which the ruler addressed his correspondents, officers and subjects. His promotion of English was part of an increasing \u2018personalisation\u2019 of kingship, and, paradoxically, its furtherance owed something to the continental ambitions of the English crown. We hear much about the rise of an English literary vernacular; less about its everyday use as a language of government, administration and business. The lecture will try to redress the balance.

Location: Event Space, 244 Greene St.            ,           Reading for Mood: A Lecture by Jonathan Flatley (Wayne State University, Visiting Professor NYU)   Presented by the Department of Performance Studies Lecture Series     This lecture examines the usefulness of mood as a critical term at the current moment. Beginning with a consideration of the distinct places of affect in aesthetic theory and in critical reading practices, it makes a case for Martin Heidegger\u2019s understanding of Stimmung (which could also be translated as attunement) as a critical concept that helps us to read for the historicity and potentially political effects of aesthetic practices. To give an example of \u201creading for mood,\u201d I turn to the film Finally Got the News (1970), which the League of Revolutionary Black Workers made in collaboration with the Newsreel collective. I read this film as an attempt by the League to engage in the project of sustaining the revolutionary mood that had been awakened by the Dodge Revolutionary Union Movement in 1968: how can such a mood, once awakened, be maintained? How does a politically active collective sustain and refresh itself?     The Performance Studies Lecture Series is a series of evening events featuring preeminent scholars and practitioners in the fields of art and performance.

Location: Room 222, 19 University Place            , -           \"Modernity, world literature, and early modernisms in India,\" Supriya Chaudhuri (Jadavpur University)   Professor Chaudhuri\u2019s paper will examine the contested notion of world literature in the context of Bengali and other Indian modernisms in early twentieth century India. It has been argued that the idea of a world literature is tied in with the global reach of capital and its production of what Fredric Jameson calls a \u2018singular modernity\u2019 as well as what Franco Moretti describes as \u2018the world literary system\u2019. On such a view modernist literary communities in Calcutta or Buenos Aires are peripheral to the core modernist projects developed in Europe and America. This paper will posit instead the existence of a set of distributed, often resistant centers, whose members experience, as immediately as their European counterparts, the trauma, violence, and \u2018loss of history\u2019 that the process of modernization involves, and who struggle for a form of aesthetic recourse. How do early Indian modernisms negotiate with the world and with a notion of world literature? To understand this, Professor Chaudhuri will examine Rabindranath Tagore\u2019s essays on \u2018World Literature\u2019 (1907) and \u2018Modern Poetry\u2019 (1931) and his differences with the modernists; at rifts within early modernist groups; and at political radicalism and cosmopolitan friendships in the 1930s.   Location: The Event Space, 244 Greene St.            , -               MARC Distinguished Lecture Series: \u201cTelling Tales: Piero di Cosimo, Renaissance Painter of Faith and Fantasy,\u201d Dennis Geronimus (NYU Art History)   Occasioned by the first-ever museum exhibition of Piero di Cosimo (1462-1522) painting career, now on view at the National Gallery of Art, Washington, this talk will introduce us to the most spellbinding storyteller of Renaissance Florence. A contemporary of Botticelli and Leonardo, Piero was esteemed in his day as a creative spirit of rare imagination, his visual poems rivaling the verses of the ancient poets whose myths and allegories he set out to transform in a wonderfully strange language all his own.     As his impressive list of patrons attests, Piero used his creative license to great advantage, devising elaborate fables the meanings of which continue to beguile us. But fantasy was not Piero\u2019s only domain. Equally compelling was his versatility as a master of many different styles, moods and subjects, sacred and profane. The common thread throughout is Piero\u2019s appeal to magical thinking.   Location: Silver, Room 300            ,               Can\u00edcula: Snapshots of a Girlhood in La Frontera, a Reading by Norma Elia Cant\u00fa   Chicana writer, folklorist, professor, and activist Norma Cant\u00fa will be reading and discussing excerpts from her book Can\u00edcula , winner of the 1995 Premio Azl\u00e5an Literary Prize, as well as from her works of poetry and her newly edited book on Chilean artist Liliana Wilson entitled Ofrenda: Liliana Wilson\u2019s Art of Dissidence and Dreams (Texas A&M University Press, 2014).

Location: The Event Space, 244 Greene St.            ,               Surrounding One\u2019s Self with the Beauty of Life: Historicizing Nineteenth-Century Latina/o Writing   What distinguishes literature from other forms of writing? For example, Latina/o literary historians have uncovered only a handful of novels written by U.S. Latinas/os in the nineteenth century. And yet, the nineteenth-century Latina/o archive is chock-full of writing, both in manuscript-form and printed documents. How can these other documents contribute to our understanding of Latina/o literary history, and how might they force us to get at the root of what literature is supposed to offer? In 1850s San Antonio, Texas, Florencia Leal, a teenager attending the first girls\u2019 school, kept a beautiful journal where she transcribed letters to friends, wrote poems, copied lessons from school, and included sketches. My talk will address these questions by paying close attention to her journal, the earliest document written by a Texas-Mexican woman that I have been able to find in the course of fifteen years of archival research.     Ra\u00fal Coronado is an Associate Professor of Ethnic Studies at UC Berkeley. Prior to Berkeley, Coronado was an associate professor in the English Department at the University of Chicago. Coronado's research focuses on Latina/o literary and intellectual history, from the colonial period to the 1940s. His first book A World Not to Come: A History of Latino Writing and Print Culture (Harvard 2013) won numerous awards, including the Modern Language Association Prize for a First Book and the Sixteenth Annual Susanne M. Glasscock Humanities Book Prize for Interdisciplinary Scholarship. This event is free and open to the public.   Location: 20 Cooper Square, 4th Floor            ,               Medieval Forum Two-Part Event: \"Containing Texts: Literature in One, Two, and Three Dimensions,\" Thomas A. Bredehoft   Tom Bredehoft's talk examines the literary implications of textual materiality, specifically the literary effects and uses of the three-dimensional objects we call books or codexes. In asking whether the shape of the physical container affects or constrains the shapes of the texts it contains, Bredehoft opens the door for a new understanding of textual dimensionality, including a clarification of whether verse is to be understood as one-dimensional or two. Consider examples ranging from Anglo-Saxon poems to the contemporary comics of Chris Ware, Bredehoft argues that two- and three-dimensional texts give us crucial insight into both the unconscious habits of typographic print textuality and the promises and challenges of digital text.   Location: The Event Space, 244 Greene St.            ,           Poetry Reading: Theo Dorgan reads from Nine Bright Shiners   Cork-born Theo Dorgan is a novelist, translator, editor, sailor and poet whose most recent collection of poems, Nine Bright Shiners (Dedalus Press, 2014) was an Irish Times notable book of the year. He has also won the O'Shaughnessy Award for Irish Poetry and Listowel Prize for Poetry.     Theo Dorgan will read from Nine Bright Shiners , a sequence of elegies that reflect on early and recent deaths, from the loss of his infant sister to that of a contemporary by suicide. The book is unflinching in facing up to death and the poet\u2019s own mortality, but these dark meditations are framed by, subsumed into, whole-hearted celebrations of love, life, art and voyaging.     A former Director of Poetry Ireland/\u00c9igse \u00c9ireann, Theo has worked extensively as a broadcaster of literary programs on both radio and television. His other poetry collections include The Ordinary House of Love and Rosa Mundi (reprinted together as What This Earth Cost Us ), as well as, in Italian, La Case ai Margini del Mundo . He has edited several volumes.     Introduction by Luke Gibbons of Maynooth University, Ireland, Visiting Professor at NYU for Spring 2015.

Location: TBA            ,               The Presence of the Past: Histories of the 18th-Century Transatlantic Book Trade in the Digital Age (Molly Hardy)   The digitization of early modern texts offers an encounter with temporal dislocation as new and old media meet. The presence of the past in objects that have been retained and remediated is at once foregrounded and elided in the digital moment. With examples from the eighteenth-century transatlantic book trade as represented in library catalogs and content databases, Molly O'Hagan Hardy will examine time's traces in the archives and how such traces can be re-conceived or eclipsed in digital humanities projects, ultimately asking how dueling temporalities define scholarly practices of research on archival materials in the digital age.     Molly Hardy manages the Isaiah Thomas Broadside Ballads digital project, the Database of the Early American Book Trades, and the Digital Antiquarian initiative. She has recently completed a digital edition of A Narrative of the Proceedings of the Black People, During the Late Awful Calamity in Philadelphia (1794). She received her in PhD in English from the University of Texas Austin, and her scholarship on archival research has appeared in The New Centennial Review and Book History .   Location: Avery Room, Bobst Library, 2nd Floor            ,           \"Joyce's Ghosts,\" Professor Luke Gibbons (Maynooth University, Ireland and Visiting Professor at NYU)   In his lecture, \u201cJoyce\u2019s Ghosts,\u201d Luke Gibbons proposes that Joyce\u2019s Irishness is intrinsic to his modernism, and is not just a source of subject matter but of form itself. Joyce\u2019s stylistic innovations are haunted by memory that slips its moorings in inner life, and circulates through the silences and shadows of a colonial counter-public sphere.     Luke Gibbons is professor of Irish literary and cultural studies at Maynooth University, Ireland, and the author of several books. He is Visiting Professor at NYU for Spring 2015.

But this sort of re-thinking has rarely been retrospective. A \"pre-history\" of postcolonial ideas is evident in the great internationalist movement of Third-Worldism that took place in the wake of decolonization after WWII. In this paper, Professor Srivastava compares postcolonial receptions of Frantz Fanon with earlier, Third-Worldist and anti-colonial receptions in the Italian context, with discussions of his role in influencing Italian psychiatry and renovating European Marxism. By examining 1960s and 1970s Italian editions and translations of his texts, she argues that historicizing this major anti-colonial thinker can lead to a re-reading of Fanon's theoretical body of work and his significance to the field.

The struggle for a comprehensive \u201cpermission to perform,\u201d which serves as a reminder of the disparity in power between the occupier and the occupied, characterizes the relationship between the Palestinian theatre artists and the state of Israel. I define \u201cpermission to perform\u201d as the guaranteed ability to legally, physically, literally, and publicly perform the experience of the oppressed under a systematically oppressive structure. By presenting three stories from the 1960s, 1970s, and the 1980s, I show that the Israeli censors\u2019 performance permit did not necessarily offer Palestinians the ability to perform freely. But in the struggle for such permission, these artists and their supporters created an inspiring model for cultural resistance.     Dr. Al-Saber is a Mellon Postdoctoral Fellow in the Department of Theatre at Davidson College. His teaching and scholarship focus on the intersections of cultural production and political conflict. He has taught courses on the cultural representations of the Israel/Palestine conflict and \u201cperforming Arabs\u201d in a postcolonial context. His areas of scholarly interest include Middle Eastern culture, theatre, and performance, the modern history of East Jerusalem, Palestinian Theatre, Arab Theatre, and the performance culture of the Roman Middle East.

Continuing this semester's focus on Marxist urban theory, we'll be looking at two essays from Edward Soja's Postmodern Geographies (chapters 3 and 4, attached). The first contains core concepts in Soja's reading of Henri Lefebvre, and frames the subfield of Marxist geography as it emerged in the 1970s. The second comprises Soja's formulation of uneven geographical development via David Harvey and Ernest Mandel. This makes for a good transition from our last session on Harvey and should provide a useful point of entry into Soja's work. And yet it misses much, notably leaving out his clearest postmodern commitments and famous case studies of Los Angeles (chapters 7, 8 and 9), his foray into ontology and critique of Heidegger (chapter 5), as well as his useful tour of developments in the spatial imaginary of critical social theory (chapters 1 and 2). I hope we'll get to briefly discuss these other bits, and if you get the chance, take a look at the last two chapters in particular.   Location: 244 Greene Street, Rm 805           May          ,           Medieval Movie Night: Kingdom of Heaven       Location: Event Space, 244 Greene St.            ,           Transported: Imagining colonies with Edward Gibbon Wakefield and the young Charlotte Bront\u00eb   In 1829 in the seclusion of the Parsonage at Howarth in Yorkshire, a twelve-year-old Charlotte Bront\u00eb and her three younger siblings imagined a colony in Africa, a place they called Glass Town. On tiny pieces of paper sewn together into books, they composed an intricate saga of conquest and colonisation by a group of European discoverers. In the same year, the philosophical radical and occasional rake, Edward Gibbon Wakefield imagined a colony in Australia in his newspaper serial, \u2018Letter From Sydney\u2019. Wakefield\u2019s theory of colonisation, \u2018systematic colonisation\u2019, influenced some of the most important thinkers of his day, and shaped British colonial policy throughout the middle decades of the century -- surprisingly, perhaps, given that he wrote the \u2018Letter\u2019 while in Newgate prison, serving a sentence for a sexual crime, and had never been to Australia. Bront\u00eb\u2019s juvenile stories and Wakefield\u2019s text are different in style, scale, and intent, yet they share some intriguing preoccupations and contexts. Taken together they provide some commentary on this important phase of transcontinental migrations of the nineteenth century. In this paper I consider their parallel disquisitions on mobility, transportation (in relation to migration, punishment, and the imagination), individual freedom, and the capture of property and persons.

Texts and Ideas   In addition to the traditional  lecture/recitation format, selected sections of Texts and Ideas are  also offered in writing-intensive versions in conjunction with   Writing the Essay (EXPOS-UA 1). Consult the MAP website for each  year's schedule.   Texts and Ideas: Topics   MAP-UA 400 Offered every semester. 4  points.   Recent topics include: Objectivity,  Liberation, the Deliberating Citizen, Animal Humans, Utopias and  Distopias, Freedom and Opression, and Literature in Wonderland.  Consult the MAP website for descriptions of each term's offerings.      Texts and Ideas: Antiquity and the  Middle Ages   MAP-UA 401 Offered occasionally. 4  points.   Readings: Hebrew Scriptures and  Christian New Testament, ancient Greek drama and philosophy, Vergil,  and Augustine. Continues with Dante's Inferno, selections from  Paradiso, and other texts from the Middle Ages.      Texts and Ideas: Antiquity and the  Renaissance   MAP-UA 402 Offered every semester. 4  points.   Readings: Hebrew Scriptures and  Christian New Testament, ancient Greek drama and philosophy, Vergil,  and Augustine. Continues with Machiavelli's Prince, a Shakespearean  play or Milton's Samson Agonistes, and other texts from the  Renaissance.      Texts and Ideas: Antiquity and the  Enlightenment   MAP-UA 403 Offered every semester. 4  points.   Readings: Hebrew Scriptures and  Christian New Testament, ancient Greek drama and philosophy, Vergil,  and Augustine. Continues with Pascal's Pens\u00e9es, Rousseau's  Confessions, and other texts from the Enlightenment.        Texts and Ideas: Antiquity and the 19th  Century   MAP-UA 404 Offered every semester. 4  points. Readings: Hebrew Scriptures and  Christian New Testament, ancient Greek drama and philosophy, Vergil,  and Augustine. Continues with Marx and Engels' Communist Manifesto,  selections from Darwin, Nietzsche's Genealogy of Morality, or  Freud's Civilization and Its Discontents, and other texts from the  19th and early 20th centuries.    Texts and Ideas: Antiquity and the   Renaissance\u2014Writing Intensive   MAP-UA 412 Offered in the fall. 4  points.   The same as MAP-UA 402, but with  additional emphasis on writing. Students read and write about the  course texts both for the lecture course and in their linked section  of Writing the Essay (EXPOS-UA 1).      Texts and Ideas: Antiquity and the 19th  Century\u2014Writing Intensive   MAP-UA 414 Offered in the fall. 4  points.   The same as MAP-UA 404, but with  additional emphasis on writing. Students read and write about the  course texts both for the lecture course and in their linked section  of Writing the Essay (EXPOS-UA 1).         Cultures and Contexts      Cultures and Contexts: Islamic  Societies   MAP-UA 502 Offered every year. 4  points.   Examines the common base and regional  variations of Islamic societies. An \"Islamic society\" is here  understood as one that shares, either as operative present or  historical past, that common religious base called Islam. For  Muslims, Islam is not simply a set of beliefs or observances, but  also includes a history; its study is thus by nature historical,  topical, and regional. The emphasis in the premodern period is first  on the Quran and then on law, political theory, theology, and  mysticism. For the more recent period, the stress is on the search  for religious identity. Throughout, students are exposed to Islamic  societies in the words of their own writings.      Cultures and Contexts: Africa   MAP-UA 505 Offered every year. 4  points.   Key concepts related to understanding  sub-Saharan African cultures and societies, concentrating in  particular on teaching students how to think critically and consult  sources sensibly when studying non-Western cultures. Topics include  problems in the interpretation of African literature, African  history, gender issues, the question of whether African thought and  values constitute a unique system of thinking, the impact of the  slave trade and colonialism on African societies and culture, and the  difficulties of and means for translating and interpreting the system  of thought and behavior in an African traditional society into terms  meaningful to Westerners. Among the readings are novels, current  philosophical theory, and feminist interpretations of black and white  accounts of African societies and the place of women in them. Issues  are approached with the use of analyses from history, anthropology,  sociology, literary theory, and philosophy.      Cultures and Contexts: The Chinese and  Japanese Traditions   MAP-UA 506 Offered every other year. 4  points.   Essential aspects of Asian  culture\u2014Confucianism, Taoism, Buddhism, and Shintoism\u2014studied  through careful reading of major works of philosophy and literature.  A roughly equal division between Chinese and Japanese works is meant  to give a basic understanding of the broad similarities and the less  obvious, but all-important, differences among the cultures of  Confucian Asia. One reading is a Vietnamese adaptation of a Chinese  legend. The last two readings, modern novellas from Japan and China,  show the reaction of the traditional cultures to the Western  invasions.      Cultures and Contexts: Japan\u2014A  Cultural History   MAP-UA 507 Offered every other year. 4  points.   A consideration of the prehistory to  Japan's modernist transformation through an analysis of key  literary, religious, and artistic texts. Concentrates on the  historical experiences that produced elements of a national culture  before there was a nation and on the consciousness of being Japanese  before there was a \"Japan.\" Examines how key cultural elements  were used to make a modern nation-state.      Cultures and Contexts: The Pacific  Islands   MAP-UA 508 Offered occasionally. 4  points.   The Pacific Island region sweeps from  Easter Island in the East to Papua New Guinea in the West, a vast  \"sea of islands\" that has been a crucial space of exchange: of  perspectives, materials, people, and ideas. What can we learn from  the study of this region, a set of islands with both commonalities  and differences that is often imagined as one \"place\"? We examine  the cultures of the Pacific Islands, moving from the first migrations  of indigenous navigators through the age of European exploration and  colonialism, to the local experience of World War II and contemporary  engagements with globalization. We also study the area's unique  cultural configurations of ritual practice, cosmology, and society.  Along the way, we engage directly with the voices of Pacific  islanders, from those who participated in the voyages of Captain  Cook, to indigenous artists who reflect on these complex and  entangled histories. Other primary sources include museum  collections, film, painting, and other visual representations. This  comparative approach enables us to understand debates about colonial  encounter, primitivism, cannibalism, cargo cults, nuclear testing,  resource extraction, and the morality of diet, from a Pacific  perspective.      Cultures and Contexts: Middle Eastern  Societies   MAP-UA 511 Offered every other year. 4  points.   The popular American picture of the  Middle East as a place of violence, veiled women, and oil wealth  portrays none of the richness or complexity of most people's lives  in the region. How can we make sense of these seemingly unfamiliar  societies and think critically about Western images of the  unfamiliar? Questions examined in depth include the following: What  variety of sources do people in the Middle East draw on to define  their sense of who they are\u2014as members of particular households,  regions, nations, or religious communities? How do women and men  construct their gender identity? In what ways are village, town, and  city lives being transformed? Do people of the Middle East experience  their region's politics the way it is portrayed in the West? What  are some of the causes of political repression, armed struggle, or  terror? How did European colonialism reshape the lives of people in  the region, and how do they today encounter the cultural and economic  power of the United States and Europe? Readings are drawn from  history, anthropology, political economy, and the contemporary  literature of the region.      Cultures and Contexts: China   MAP-UA 512 Offered every other year. 4  points.   Fundamental concepts and practices of  Chinese society and culture, examined using primary sources in  translation whenever possible. By studying the social, political,  religious, ideological, ritual, economic, and cultural life of the  Chinese, students gain a sense of the core values and issues of  Chinese civilization and how these have affected and continue to have  an impact on the way people think and live.      Cultures and Contexts: Ancient Israel   MAP-UA 514 Offered every semester. 4  points.   The culture of the ancient Israelite  societies of biblical times, covering the period from about 1200  B.C.E. to the conquests of Alexander the Great, in the fourth century  B.C.E. Topics include the achievements of these societies in the  areas of law and social organization, prophetic movements, Israelite  religion, and ancient Hebrew literature. The Hebrew Bible preserves  much of the creativity of the ancient Israelites, but archaeological  excavations in Israel and neighboring lands, as well as the discovery  of ancient writings in Hebrew and related languages, have added  greatly to our knowledge of life as it was lived in biblical times.  The civilizations of Egypt and Syria-Mesopotamia also shed light on  Israelite culture. Of particular interest is the early development of  Israelite monotheism, which, in time, emerged as ancient Judaism, the  mother religion of Christianity and Islam.      Cultures and Contexts: Latin America   MAP-UA 515 Offered every other year. 4  points.   Explores the cultural, social, and  political organization of indigenous people before the period of  European colonization. Studies the dynamics of the colonial  encounter, focusing on such themes as indigenous responses to  European rule, the formation of \"Indian\" society, and the  interaction of Europeans, Africans, and indigenous people. Considers  postcolonial Latin America, focusing on themes such as political  culture, competing ideologies of economics and social development,  and the construction of collective identities based on region, race,  ethnicity, gender, and class. Readings consist mostly of primary  sources and allow students to hear diverse voices within Latin  American society. Works by European conquerors, Inca and Aztec  descendants in the colonial period, and African and creole slaves are  studied. Novels, short stories, films, photographs, and music are  also included.      Cultures and Contexts: India   MAP-UA 516 Offered every other year. 4  points.   Considers the paradoxes of modern  India: ancient religious ideas coexisting with material progress,  hierarchical caste society with parliamentary democracy, and urban  shantytowns with palatial high-rises. Integrates research on India's  cultural values with social-scientific perspectives on their  contemporary relevance. Examines problems such as protective  discrimination for lower castes and cultural nationalism. Shows how  democracy involves difficult choices among competing, often opposed,  ancient and modern cultural values.      Cultures and Contexts: Contemporary  Latino Cultures   MAP-UA 529 Offered every year. 4  points.   Examines the growth and development of  \"Latino\" as a distinct category of identity out of the highly  diverse populations of Latin American background in the United  States, paying particular attention to the social processes shaping  its emergence. Provides a detailed examination of the processes of  cultural creation behind the rising growth of transnational cultures  and identities worldwide, and of the forces that are fueling their  development. Begins by exploring the immigration of Latin American  peoples to U.S. cities, then turns to three case studies of emerging  Latino communities, and ends by examining contemporary issues  involving Latinos in urban centers such as New York.      Cultures and Contexts: The African  Diaspora   MAP-UA 532 Offered every year. 4  points.   The dispersal of Africans to various  parts of the world and over time, examining their experiences and  those of their descendants. Regions of special interest include the  Americas and the Islamic world, centering on questions of slavery and  freedom while emphasizing the emergence of cultural forms and their  relationship to both African and non-African influences.      Cultures and Contexts: Indigenous  Australia   MAP-UA 536 Offered every other year. 4  points.   The indigenous people of Australia have  long been the subject of interest and imagination by outsiders for  their cultural formulations of kinship, ritual, art, gender, and  politics, and they have entered into representations as distinctively  \"other\"\u2014whether in negative or positive formulations of the  \"primitive.\" These representations\u2014in feature films about them  such as Walkabout and Rabbit-Proof Fence, in New Age literature, or  in museum exhibitions\u2014are now also in dialogue with their own forms  of cultural production. At the same time, Aboriginal people have  struggled to reproduce themselves and their traditions in their own  terms, asserting their right to forms of cultural autonomy and  self-determination. We explore the historical and geographical range  of Aboriginal Australian forms of social being through ethnographic  texts, art, novels, autobiographies, film, and other media, and  consider the ways in which identity is being challenged and  constructed.      Cultures and Contexts: Modern Israel   MAP-UA 537 Offered every year. 4  points.   Despite its small size and population,  Israel is a diverse, dynamic, and complex society. To understand its  ethnic, religious, and political divisions, the different ethnic  origins of the Jewish population over the last 150 years are  examined, and the growing role of the Arab population (approaching 20  percent) in Israeli society is discussed. The special role of  religion in the secular state, the development of Hebrew-speaking  culture, the political system, the settlement movement and the peace  movement, gender issues, and the role of the army in everyday life  are all addressed, concluding with a survey of the debate on whether  Israel is a Jewish state or a state of all its citizens. Although the  controversial issues that keep Israel in the headlines are touched  on, the focus is on the character of Israeli society and the impact  on everyday life of living in the international limelight.      Cultures and Contexts:  Asian/Pacific/American Cultures   MAP-UA 539 Offered every year. 4  points.   Major issues in the historical and  contemporary experiences of Asian Pacific Americans, including  migration, modernization, racial formation, community-building, and  political mobilization. Asian Pacific America encompasses a complex,  diverse, and rapidly changing population of people. Particular  attention is given to Asian Americans' use of cultural productions  (films, literature, art, media, and popular culture) as an expression  and reflection of their cultural identities, historical conditions,  and political efforts.      Cultures and Contexts: New World  Encounters   MAP-UA 541 Offered every year. 4  points.   What was America before it was called  America? How did indigenous cultures understand and document their  first encounters with Europeans? We focus on peoples, events, and  cultural expressions associated with the conquest and colonization of  the Americas, concentrating on three key areas: central Mexico, home  to several pre-Columbian societies, most notably the Aztec Empire,  and later the seat of Spanish power in northern Latin America (the  Viceroyalty of New Spain); the central Andes, home of the Incas and  later the site of Spanish power in southern Latin America (the  Viceroyalty of Peru); and finally, early plantation societies of the  Caribbean, where the violent history of enslaved Africans in the new  world unfolded. On one hand, we explore how those subjugated by  conquest and colonialism interpreted, resisted, and recorded their  experience. On the other, we ask what new cultural forms emerged from  these violent encounters, and consider their role in the foundation  of \"Latin American\" cultures. Readings balance a range of primary  documents and art created during the \"age of encounter,\"  including maps, letters, paintings, and testimonials, along with  historical and theoretical texts.      Cultures and Contexts: Egypt of the  Pharaohs   MAP-UA 545 Offered every year. 4  points.   The archaeology, literature, and art of  ancient Egypt all offer insights into its culture. Subjects of  special interest are ancient Egyptian religious experiences and  ethics, as well as constructions of gender, class, and ethnicity.  Settlements that are particularly well documented through both  archaeological and textual remains\u2014such as Kahun and Deir  el-Medina\u2014yield extensive information about the varieties of social  experience in these societies. Lives differed tremendously based on  gender, profession, and locality (both spatial and temporal).  Likewise, we explore how Egyptians, regardless of social standing,  attempted to alter their socio-political circumstances through  avenues such as concerted political action, magic, revolt, or the  construction of well-crafted satire. Primary sources include letters,  wisdom literature, love poetry, ancient house plans, tomb scenes, and  physical anthropology.        Cultures and Contexts: Global Asia   MAP-UA 546 Offered every other year. 4  points.   Explores the expansive transformation  of Asian cultures from ancient times to the present, focusing on  networks of mobility, interaction, social order, and exchange that  form the particularity of Asian cultures through entanglements with  others. Beginning in the days of Alexander the Great and the  formation of the Afro-Eurasian ecumene, follows the tracks of  Buddhist, Confucian, Hindu, and Muslim expansion and then turns to  the age of early modern landed empires,  Ottoman-Safavid-Mughal-Ming/Ching, and their interactions with  seaborne European expansion. Studies truly global formations of  culture in the flow of goods, ideas, and people among world regions,  during the age of modern empires and nationalism, including the rise  of the nation as a cultural norm, capitalism in Asia, and Japanese  expansion around the Pacific Rim. Concludes by considering cultural  change attending globalization since the 1950s, focusing on  entanglements of Asian cultures with the globalizing culture of the  market, consumerism, and wage labor, and transnational labor  migration, as well as Asian cultural spaces in and around New York  City, including our nearby Chinatown.      Cultures and Contexts: Globalizing the  Americas   MAP-UA 550 Offered every other year. 4  points.   The idea of \"America\" has long been  dissected and reconstituted by a number of ideologues, theorists,  policymakers, artists, activists, and ordinary people. Each has  sought to craft a new existence that distinguished itself from \"Old  World\" tyranny and tensions, significantly through the creation of  imagined communities of identity and belonging, based on various  cultural, political-economic, and social criteria. We focus on  studies of selected communities (e.g., the concept and experience of  race in Brazil, homophobia in the West Indies) and historical events  (e.g., 19th- and 20th-century migrations of Asians to Central  America) and explore how global visions and international movements  as, for example, Negritude, Pan-Americanism, Pan-Africanism,  cosmopolitanism, and mestizaje/cr\u00e9olit\u00e9 emerge from local currents  and practices.      Cultures and Contexts: Immigrant  America in the 19th Century   MAP-UA 551 Offered occasionally. 4  points.   The \"long nineteenth century,\" from  the 1820s through the 1920s, saw the arrival of no fewer than 50  million immigrants to the United States. Coming primarily, although  not exclusively, from Europe, their migrations not only transformed  the places they left, but profoundly altered American society. These  migrations, all of which involved a high degree of choice on the part  of their participants, took place within the context of family and  communal decision making, which in turn impacted significantly on the  women and men who made these journeys, allowing\u2014or forcing\u2014them  to create new kinds of identities, institutions, and cultures.  Indeed, as a result of their migrations, they became new people. They  became \"ethnic,\" as they had to redefine themselves both in terms  of what they left, what they \"brought\" with them, and what they  encountered in America. We explore how their journeys led to the  creation of a set of ethnic communities in America, which we can see  as specific and unique and yet resembling each other in notable ways,  focusing on three seemingly very different 19th-century groups:  Irish, Italian, and Jewish immigrants, and the ethnic cultures they  created.      Cultures &amp; Contexts: Topics\u2014Empires  and Political Imagination   MAP-UA 552 Offered every other year. 4  points.   Comparative study of empires, from the  Romans to the present, and the ways that empires have inspired and  constrained their subjects' ideas of rights, belonging, and power.  Throughout history, few people lived for very long in a state that  consisted entirely or even mainly of people with whom they shared a  language and culture. Empires\u2014polities that maintained social and  cultural distinction even as they incorporated different people\u2014have  been one of the most common and durable forms of political  organization. An examination of the variety of human cultures must   take account of how people lived in  empires\u2014sometimes seeking higher degrees of autonomy, sometimes  accommodating to rulers' authority, sometimes trying to extend  their own power over others. The study of empire expands our ideas of  citizenship and challenges the notion that the nation-state is  natural and necessary. We investigate how empires were held  together\u2014and where they were weak\u2014from perspectives that focus on  political and economic connections over long distances and long time  periods. We also explore how scholars have approached the topic of  empires, examining their methods and their interpretations. Readings  include historical scholarship on the Roman, Chinese, Mongol,  Spanish, Russian, French, British, and American empires, as well as  primary sources produced by people living in these and other imperial  polities.         Societies and the Social Sciences      Note that the prerequisite for all  Societies and the Social Sciences courses is completion of Texts and  Ideas (MAP-UA 4XX) and Cultures and Contexts (MAP-UA 5XX), as well as  completion of (or exemption from) Writing the Essay (EXPOS-UA 1),   Writing II (WRI-UF 2002), or International Writing Workshop II (EXPOS-UA 9).      Societies and the Social Sciences:  Topics in Interdisciplinary Perspective   MAP-UA 600 Offered occasionally. 4  points.   Examines social phenomena that cross  the boundaries among the various social-scientific disciplines.  Topics vary each term and may include, for example, human migration,  religion, fascism, or colonialism. By considering the methodologies  appropriate to the study of these topics, students learn to  appreciate the characteristic approaches of the social sciences,  their power to help us understand such phenomena, and their  limitations.         Expressive Culture      Note that the prerequisite for all  Expressive Culture courses is completion of Texts and Ideas (MAP-UA  4XX) and Cultures and Contexts (MAP-UA 5XX), as well as completion of  (or exemption from) Writing the Essay (EXPOS-UA 1), Writing II (WRI-UF 2002), or International Writing Workshop II (EXPOS-UA 9).      Expressive Culture: Words   MAP-UA 710 Offered occasionally. 4  points.   What is literature or the literary? Is  there a literary language that works differently from ordinary  language? What is literary style and form? What is the position of  the writer or artist in relation to society, and what is the function  of the reader? Is literature a mirror of the world that it describes,  an attempt to influence a reader's ideas or opinions, an expression  of the identity of the writer, or none of these?      Expressive Culture: The Graphic Novel   MAP-UA 711 Offered occasionally. 4  points.   Examines the interplay between words  and images in the graphic novel, a hybrid medium with a system of  communication reminiscent of prose fiction, animation, and film. What  is the connection between text and art? How are internal psychology,  time, and action conveyed in a static series of words and pictures?  What can the graphic novel convey that other media cannot? Authors  include Alan Moore, Art Spiegelman, Peter Milligan, Charles Burns,  and Carla Speed McNeil.      Expressive Culture: Images   MAP-UA 720 Offered occasionally. 4  points.   What is the place of art in an  image-saturated world? We begin by considering the power and taboo of  images and the ways in which individuals and institutions that  constitute \"the art world\" classify some of these images as works  of art; turn to explore the visual and conceptual challenges  presented by major works of sculpture, architecture, and painting;  and conclude with a selection of problems raised by art today.  Students develop the vocabulary to both appreciate and question the  artistic \"gestures\" of society in various places and times.      Expressive Culture: Painting and  Sculpture in New York Field Study   MAP-UA 721 Offered every spring. 4  points.   New York's public art collections  contain important examples of painting and sculpture from almost  every phase of the past, as well as some of the world's foremost  works of contemporary art. Meets once a week for an extended period  and combines on-campus lectures with group excursions to the museums  or other locations where these works are exhibited.      Expressive Culture: Architecture in New  York Field Study   MAP-UA 722 Offered every fall. 4  points.   New York's rich architectural  heritage offers a unique opportunity for firsthand consideration of  the concepts and styles of modern urban architecture, as well as its  social, financial, and cultural contexts. Meets once a week for an  extended period and combines on-campus lectures with group excursions  to prominent buildings. Consideration is given both to individual  buildings as examples of 19th- and 20th-century architecture, as well  as to phenomena such as the development of the skyscraper and the  adaptation of older buildings to new uses.      Expressive Culture: Sounds   MAP-UA 730 Offered every semester. 4  points.   Our lives pulsate with patterns of  sounds that we call music. We encounter these sounds in our homes,  cars, stores, and exercise salons; they accompany us to the grocery  store, the dentist's office, and the movies. Yet we rarely think  consciously about what they mean. Through a series of specific case  studies, we investigate the function and significance of music and  the musician in human life. We raise basic questions about how music  has been created, produced, perceived, and evaluated at diverse  historical moments, in a variety of geographical locations, and among  different cultural groups. Through aural explorations and discussion  of how these vivid worlds \"sound\" in time and space, we assess  the value of music in human experience.      Expressive Culture: Performance   MAP-UA 740 Offered occasionally. 4  points.   Examines \"performance\" both as a  practice and as a theoretical tool with which to understand today's  world. The broad spectrum of live performance is explored by means of  lectures, discussions, and field trips. Students look at theatre and  dance, performance in everyday life, rituals, popular entertainments,  and intercultural performance. On the theoretical level, students are  introduced to \"speech acts,\" \"restored behavior,\" \"ritual  process,\" and \"play.\" Students see a broad variety of  performances, such as Native American powwow, Indian Hindu ritual  drama, off-Broadway theatre and dance, African American gospel,  street performers, and courtroom trials.      Expressive Culture: Film   MAP-UA 750 Offered every semester. 4  points.   Film is a medium that combines a number  of arts. It lies at the intersection of art and technology and of art  and mass culture, and at the boundaries of the national and the  global. Film is also a medium that coincides with and contributes to  the invention of modern life. By exploring the expressive and  representational achievements of cinema in the context of modernity  and mass culture, students learn the concepts to grasp the different  ways in which films create meaning, achieve their emotional impact,  and respond in complex ways to the historical contexts in which they  are made.

Richard Olivier, 1989), presented by Brent Edwards (Columbia University)   Presented by the Colloquium for Unpopular Culture     \u201cI\u2019m sad because I\u2019m schizophrenic, torn between many passions, desires and lovers. I\u2019m sad because I know the bottom line. I know what is going to happen to this world.\u201d     \u201cI\u2019m an orphan. And Ostend? That\u2019s my orphanage.\u201d     By 1981 Marvin Gaye was pretty much washed up. Heavily in debt, on the run from the I.R.S., in the middle of protracted divorces from Motown and from his wife, overing up mini-mountains of cocaine each day, abusive to his many partners, and, prone to dropping references to Nostradamus and Revelations, increasingly convinced that Apocalypse was imminent. He ended up in Ostend, a Belgian seafront town where, largely ignored by locals (\u201cWhere are you from? Paraguay?\u201d), he gazed at the grey skies, ran across lonely beaches and played darts badly in family cafes. He called it \u201ca beat back in tempo\u201d. It was a time of drift, reflection, expansion. A time of taking stock and recharging. Some kind of analogue to David Bowie\u2019s stay in Berlin at the end of the 1970s. Some kind of interregnum before the international but short-lived success of Sexual Healing and his violent death at the hands of his preacher father in 1984.     TRANSIT OSTEND is a moody, sometimes funny and quietly unforgettable portrait of the troubled singer that has long enjoyed a word-of-mouth reputation among filmmakers (Paul Kelly cited it as an influence on Lawrence Of Belgravia, his documentary about Lawrence from Felt), has inspired a song by the Band of Holy Joy (as well as a long-running comic routine by Reeves and Mortimer), but has rarely been seen.     BRENT EDWARDS, who will present Transit Ostend, is a Professor in the Department of English and Comparative Literature and the Center for Jazz Studies at Columbia University. His books include The Practice of Diaspora (2003), Uptown Conversation: The New Jazz Studies (2004), and the forthcoming Epistrophies: Jazz and the Literary Imagination. His current projects include the restoration of Sweet Willie Rollbar\u2019s Orientation (an experimental film made by Julius Hemphill and members of the Black Artists Group in 1972), and a translation of Michel Leiris\u2019s 1934 classic Phantom Africa.

Burnham (Middlebury College)   Presented by the Medieval Virtual Seminar, a collaboration of the University of Bristol, The University of Oslo, Middlebury College, and New York University. A series of lectures on topics in medieval studies, one hosted by each institution, to take place during the 2014-15 academic year.     In 1329, Limoux N\u00e8gre was burned at the stake as an unrepentant heretic who claimed mystical inspiration for what he called his \"subtlety\" and his \"philosophy.\" The beliefs he professed were unlike any the inquisitors of Carcassonne had ever heard: skeptical and materialist, but also blasphemous, fantastical, and difficult for inquisitors and scholars alike to untangle. In this paper, I will argue that his mystical revelations bloomed on an alchemical substrate and that his most outrageous assertions regarding Jesus's death and resurrection were based on the science of the Pseudo-Llullian Testamentum.   Location: 3 Washington Square Village, Suite 1M (Ground Floor), Conference Room 104            ,           Book Talk: In Conversation with Daniel Schulman   Presented by the Tamiment Library and the John Brademas Center     Please join us for an upcoming book talk, \"In Conversation with Daniel Schulman\" on February 18th (6:00 PM) at the Tamiment Library.

While the observation that this fiction is a project in writing the nation may have grown to be something of a commonplace, what is less generally recognized is its inflection by elite ideologies of rule. I am interested in tracking the anxiety, rivalry, and ambivalence that surround the precariousness of elite authority on the national scene. In successive chapters of the book I seek out the internal contradictions and external threats that destabilize the status and assumptions of this historical ruling class. This paper identifies the connections, affective and historical, that a post-Independence-born generation of authors and their protagonists variously develop with their nationalist fathers in the process of inheriting the nation.      Rajeswari Sunder Rajan is Global Distinguished Professor in the Department of English at New York University, and has taught earlier at the universities of Delhi and Oxford.

Reception to follow   RSVP by February 13, 2015.   Location: Hemmerdinger Hall, Silver Center of Arts and Science            ,               Legacy in the Dust: The Four Aces Story, presented by Vivien Goldman   Few clubs in Britain can claim to have a history as illustrious as The Four Aces in Dalston, north-east London. Set up by Jamaican-born Newton Dunbar in 1967 to play blue beat, rocksteady and ska, it soon became a mecca not just for the capital's growing Caribbean population but for all Londoners bored of the sifted, soulless sounds they were hearing on mainstream radio. The club was a place to dance, but also a community centre, a para-academic space, a retreat from the increasingly militarised, stop-and-frisk streetscapes outside. Musicians such as Bob Marley, Joe Strummer, Stevie Wonder and even Bob Dylan made a beeline there. It played a pivotal role in the development of lover's rock, acid house, jungle and happy hardcore. But it was hated by local politicians and property speculators who demonised it as a gangster hang-out and Yardie-run drug hole before colluding to money-maim it into a block of luxury apartments. LEGACY IN THE DUST unearths rare archival material, talks to pioneering musicians such as Bunny Lee and Dennis Bovell, and tells - with love and with sadness - the rich history of a remarkable club.     LEGACY IN THE DUST will be presented by writer, broadcaster and post-punk musician VIVIEN GOLDMAN who spent many halcyon nights at The Four Aces. As well as recording a number of classic records, both solo and in Chantage, she has written for the likes of The Flying Lizards, Massive Attack and Ryuichi Sakamoto. She is an Adjunct Professor at NYU's Clive Davis Institute of Recorded Music, Tisch School of the Arts where she teaches punk, Fela Kuti and reggae. Her five books include two on Bob Marley, most recently The Book of Exodus: The Making & Meaning of Marley's Album of the Century (Three Rivers Press). A Londoner, she now resides in Jackson Heights, Queens.     LEGACY IN THE DUST is the first screening in History Is Made At Night , an occasional series that gets its name from Neil Gordon-Orr's blog devoted to the politics of dancing and musicking.

Henry V and the Use of Languages,\u201d Malcolm Vale (Emeritus Research Fellow of History, St. John\u2019s College)   The reign of Henry V (1413-1422) was not only concerned with military victories. It also witnessed the emergence of the English language as an idiom and medium of government, politics and administration. For the first time since the Anglo-Saxon era, English was formally accepted as a language in which the ruler addressed his correspondents, officers and subjects. His promotion of English was part of an increasing \u2018personalisation\u2019 of kingship, and, paradoxically, its furtherance owed something to the continental ambitions of the English crown. We hear much about the rise of an English literary vernacular; less about its everyday use as a language of government, administration and business. The lecture will try to redress the balance.

Beginning with a consideration of the distinct places of affect in aesthetic theory and in critical reading practices, it makes a case for Martin Heidegger\u2019s understanding of Stimmung (which could also be translated as attunement) as a critical concept that helps us to read for the historicity and potentially political effects of aesthetic practices. To give an example of \u201creading for mood,\u201d I turn to the film Finally Got the News (1970), which the League of Revolutionary Black Workers made in collaboration with the Newsreel collective. I read this film as an attempt by the League to engage in the project of sustaining the revolutionary mood that had been awakened by the Dodge Revolutionary Union Movement in 1968: how can such a mood, once awakened, be maintained? How does a politically active collective sustain and refresh itself?     The Performance Studies Lecture Series is a series of evening events featuring preeminent scholars and practitioners in the fields of art and performance. The events are presented on weekday evenings in the department's studio space, and are designed to create an informal and intimate setting for intellectual exchange among artists, students and scholars.

Location: Room 222, 19 University Place            , -           \"Modernity, world literature, and early modernisms in India,\" Supriya Chaudhuri (Jadavpur University)   Professor Chaudhuri\u2019s paper will examine the contested notion of world literature in the context of Bengali and other Indian modernisms in early twentieth century India. It has been argued that the idea of a world literature is tied in with the global reach of capital and its production of what Fredric Jameson calls a \u2018singular modernity\u2019 as well as what Franco Moretti describes as \u2018the world literary system\u2019. On such a view modernist literary communities in Calcutta or Buenos Aires are peripheral to the core modernist projects developed in Europe and America. This paper will posit instead the existence of a set of distributed, often resistant centers, whose members experience, as immediately as their European counterparts, the trauma, violence, and \u2018loss of history\u2019 that the process of modernization involves, and who struggle for a form of aesthetic recourse. How do early Indian modernisms negotiate with the world and with a notion of world literature? To understand this, Professor Chaudhuri will examine Rabindranath Tagore\u2019s essays on \u2018World Literature\u2019 (1907) and \u2018Modern Poetry\u2019 (1931) and his differences with the modernists; at rifts within early modernist groups; and at political radicalism and cosmopolitan friendships in the 1930s.   Location: The Event Space, 244 Greene St.            , -               MARC Distinguished Lecture Series: \u201cTelling Tales: Piero di Cosimo, Renaissance Painter of Faith and Fantasy,\u201d Dennis Geronimus (NYU Art History)   Occasioned by the first-ever museum exhibition of Piero di Cosimo (1462-1522) painting career, now on view at the National Gallery of Art, Washington, this talk will introduce us to the most spellbinding storyteller of Renaissance Florence. A contemporary of Botticelli and Leonardo, Piero was esteemed in his day as a creative spirit of rare imagination, his visual poems rivaling the verses of the ancient poets whose myths and allegories he set out to transform in a wonderfully strange language all his own.     As his impressive list of patrons attests, Piero used his creative license to great advantage, devising elaborate fables the meanings of which continue to beguile us. But fantasy was not Piero\u2019s only domain. Equally compelling was his versatility as a master of many different styles, moods and subjects, sacred and profane. The common thread throughout is Piero\u2019s appeal to magical thinking.

Location: The Event Space, 244 Greene St.            ,               Surrounding One\u2019s Self with the Beauty of Life: Historicizing Nineteenth-Century Latina/o Writing   What distinguishes literature from other forms of writing? For example, Latina/o literary historians have uncovered only a handful of novels written by U.S. Latinas/os in the nineteenth century. And yet, the nineteenth-century Latina/o archive is chock-full of writing, both in manuscript-form and printed documents. How can these other documents contribute to our understanding of Latina/o literary history, and how might they force us to get at the root of what literature is supposed to offer? In 1850s San Antonio, Texas, Florencia Leal, a teenager attending the first girls\u2019 school, kept a beautiful journal where she transcribed letters to friends, wrote poems, copied lessons from school, and included sketches. My talk will address these questions by paying close attention to her journal, the earliest document written by a Texas-Mexican woman that I have been able to find in the course of fifteen years of archival research.     Ra\u00fal Coronado is an Associate Professor of Ethnic Studies at UC Berkeley. Prior to Berkeley, Coronado was an associate professor in the English Department at the University of Chicago. Coronado's research focuses on Latina/o literary and intellectual history, from the colonial period to the 1940s. His first book A World Not to Come: A History of Latino Writing and Print Culture (Harvard 2013) won numerous awards, including the Modern Language Association Prize for a First Book and the Sixteenth Annual Susanne M. Glasscock Humanities Book Prize for Interdisciplinary Scholarship. This event is free and open to the public.   Location: 20 Cooper Square, 4th Floor            ,               Medieval Forum Two-Part Event: \"Containing Texts: Literature in One, Two, and Three Dimensions,\" Thomas A. Bredehoft   Tom Bredehoft's talk examines the literary implications of textual materiality, specifically the literary effects and uses of the three-dimensional objects we call books or codexes. In asking whether the shape of the physical container affects or constrains the shapes of the texts it contains, Bredehoft opens the door for a new understanding of textual dimensionality, including a clarification of whether verse is to be understood as one-dimensional or two. Consider examples ranging from Anglo-Saxon poems to the contemporary comics of Chris Ware, Bredehoft argues that two- and three-dimensional texts give us crucial insight into both the unconscious habits of typographic print textuality and the promises and challenges of digital text.   Location: The Event Space, 244 Greene St.            ,           Poetry Reading: Theo Dorgan reads from Nine Bright Shiners   Cork-born Theo Dorgan is a novelist, translator, editor, sailor and poet whose most recent collection of poems, Nine Bright Shiners (Dedalus Press, 2014) was an Irish Times notable book of the year. He has also won the O'Shaughnessy Award for Irish Poetry and Listowel Prize for Poetry.     Theo Dorgan will read from Nine Bright Shiners , a sequence of elegies that reflect on early and recent deaths, from the loss of his infant sister to that of a contemporary by suicide. The book is unflinching in facing up to death and the poet\u2019s own mortality, but these dark meditations are framed by, subsumed into, whole-hearted celebrations of love, life, art and voyaging.     A former Director of Poetry Ireland/\u00c9igse \u00c9ireann, Theo has worked extensively as a broadcaster of literary programs on both radio and television. His other poetry collections include The Ordinary House of Love and Rosa Mundi (reprinted together as What This Earth Cost Us ), as well as, in Italian, La Case ai Margini del Mundo . He has edited several volumes.     Introduction by Luke Gibbons of Maynooth University, Ireland, Visiting Professor at NYU for Spring 2015.

Location: TBA            ,               The Presence of the Past: Histories of the 18th-Century Transatlantic Book Trade in the Digital Age (Molly Hardy)   The digitization of early modern texts offers an encounter with temporal dislocation as new and old media meet. The presence of the past in objects that have been retained and remediated is at once foregrounded and elided in the digital moment. With examples from the eighteenth-century transatlantic book trade as represented in library catalogs and content databases, Molly O'Hagan Hardy will examine time's traces in the archives and how such traces can be re-conceived or eclipsed in digital humanities projects, ultimately asking how dueling temporalities define scholarly practices of research on archival materials in the digital age.     Molly Hardy manages the Isaiah Thomas Broadside Ballads digital project, the Database of the Early American Book Trades, and the Digital Antiquarian initiative. She has recently completed a digital edition of A Narrative of the Proceedings of the Black People, During the Late Awful Calamity in Philadelphia (1794). She received her in PhD in English from the University of Texas Austin, and her scholarship on archival research has appeared in The New Centennial Review and Book History .

Joyce\u2019s stylistic innovations are haunted by memory that slips its moorings in inner life, and circulates through the silences and shadows of a colonial counter-public sphere.     Luke Gibbons is professor of Irish literary and cultural studies at Maynooth University, Ireland, and the author of several books. He is Visiting Professor at NYU for Spring 2015.

But this sort of re-thinking has rarely been retrospective. A \"pre-history\" of postcolonial ideas is evident in the great internationalist movement of Third-Worldism that took place in the wake of decolonization after WWII. In this paper, Professor Srivastava compares postcolonial receptions of Frantz Fanon with earlier, Third-Worldist and anti-colonial receptions in the Italian context, with discussions of his role in influencing Italian psychiatry and renovating European Marxism. By examining 1960s and 1970s Italian editions and translations of his texts, she argues that historicizing this major anti-colonial thinker can lead to a re-reading of Fanon's theoretical body of work and his significance to the field.

The struggle for a comprehensive \u201cpermission to perform,\u201d which serves as a reminder of the disparity in power between the occupier and the occupied, characterizes the relationship between the Palestinian theatre artists and the state of Israel. I define \u201cpermission to perform\u201d as the guaranteed ability to legally, physically, literally, and publicly perform the experience of the oppressed under a systematically oppressive structure. By presenting three stories from the 1960s, 1970s, and the 1980s, I show that the Israeli censors\u2019 performance permit did not necessarily offer Palestinians the ability to perform freely. But in the struggle for such permission, these artists and their supporters created an inspiring model for cultural resistance.     Dr. Al-Saber is a Mellon Postdoctoral Fellow in the Department of Theatre at Davidson College. His teaching and scholarship focus on the intersections of cultural production and political conflict.

Continuing this semester's focus on Marxist urban theory, we'll be looking at two essays from Edward Soja's Postmodern Geographies (chapters 3 and 4, attached). The first contains core concepts in Soja's reading of Henri Lefebvre, and frames the subfield of Marxist geography as it emerged in the 1970s. The second comprises Soja's formulation of uneven geographical development via David Harvey and Ernest Mandel. This makes for a good transition from our last session on Harvey and should provide a useful point of entry into Soja's work. And yet it misses much, notably leaving out his clearest postmodern commitments and famous case studies of Los Angeles (chapters 7, 8 and 9), his foray into ontology and critique of Heidegger (chapter 5), as well as his useful tour of developments in the spatial imaginary of critical social theory (chapters 1 and 2). I hope we'll get to briefly discuss these other bits, and if you get the chance, take a look at the last two chapters in particular.

On tiny pieces of paper sewn together into books, they composed an intricate saga of conquest and colonisation by a group of European discoverers. In the same year, the philosophical radical and occasional rake, Edward Gibbon Wakefield imagined a colony in Australia in his newspaper serial, \u2018Letter From Sydney\u2019. Wakefield\u2019s theory of colonisation, \u2018systematic colonisation\u2019, influenced some of the most important thinkers of his day, and shaped British colonial policy throughout the middle decades of the century -- surprisingly, perhaps, given that he wrote the \u2018Letter\u2019 while in Newgate prison, serving a sentence for a sexual crime, and had never been to Australia. Bront\u00eb\u2019s juvenile stories and Wakefield\u2019s text are different in style, scale, and intent, yet they share some intriguing preoccupations and contexts. Taken together they provide some commentary on this important phase of transcontinental migrations of the nineteenth century. In this paper I consider their parallel disquisitions on mobility, transportation (in relation to migration, punishment, and the imagination), individual freedom, and the capture of property and persons.

Texts and Ideas   In addition to the traditional  lecture/recitation format, selected sections of Texts and Ideas are  also offered in writing-intensive versions in conjunction with   Writing the Essay (EXPOS-UA 1). Consult the MAP website for each  year's schedule.   Texts and Ideas: Topics   MAP-UA 400 Offered every semester. 4  points.   Recent topics include: Objectivity,  Liberation, the Deliberating Citizen, Animal Humans, Utopias and  Distopias, Freedom and Opression, and Literature in Wonderland.  Consult the MAP website for descriptions of each term's offerings.      Texts and Ideas: Antiquity and the  Middle Ages   MAP-UA 401 Offered occasionally. 4  points.   Readings: Hebrew Scriptures and  Christian New Testament, ancient Greek drama and philosophy, Vergil,  and Augustine. Continues with Dante's Inferno, selections from  Paradiso, and other texts from the Middle Ages.      Texts and Ideas: Antiquity and the  Renaissance   MAP-UA 402 Offered every semester. 4  points.   Readings: Hebrew Scriptures and  Christian New Testament, ancient Greek drama and philosophy, Vergil,  and Augustine. Continues with Machiavelli's Prince, a Shakespearean  play or Milton's Samson Agonistes, and other texts from the  Renaissance.      Texts and Ideas: Antiquity and the  Enlightenment   MAP-UA 403 Offered every semester. 4  points.   Readings: Hebrew Scriptures and  Christian New Testament, ancient Greek drama and philosophy, Vergil,  and Augustine. Continues with Pascal's Pens\u00e9es, Rousseau's  Confessions, and other texts from the Enlightenment.        Texts and Ideas: Antiquity and the 19th  Century   MAP-UA 404 Offered every semester. 4  points. Readings: Hebrew Scriptures and  Christian New Testament, ancient Greek drama and philosophy, Vergil,  and Augustine. Continues with Marx and Engels' Communist Manifesto,  selections from Darwin, Nietzsche's Genealogy of Morality, or  Freud's Civilization and Its Discontents, and other texts from the  19th and early 20th centuries.    Texts and Ideas: Antiquity and the   Renaissance\u2014Writing Intensive   MAP-UA 412 Offered in the fall. 4  points.   The same as MAP-UA 402, but with  additional emphasis on writing. Students read and write about the  course texts both for the lecture course and in their linked section  of Writing the Essay (EXPOS-UA 1).      Texts and Ideas: Antiquity and the 19th  Century\u2014Writing Intensive   MAP-UA 414 Offered in the fall. 4  points.   The same as MAP-UA 404, but with  additional emphasis on writing. Students read and write about the  course texts both for the lecture course and in their linked section  of Writing the Essay (EXPOS-UA 1).         Cultures and Contexts      Cultures and Contexts: Islamic  Societies   MAP-UA 502 Offered every year. 4  points.   Examines the common base and regional  variations of Islamic societies. An \"Islamic society\" is here  understood as one that shares, either as operative present or  historical past, that common religious base called Islam. For  Muslims, Islam is not simply a set of beliefs or observances, but  also includes a history; its study is thus by nature historical,  topical, and regional. The emphasis in the premodern period is first  on the Quran and then on law, political theory, theology, and  mysticism. For the more recent period, the stress is on the search  for religious identity. Throughout, students are exposed to Islamic  societies in the words of their own writings.      Cultures and Contexts: Africa   MAP-UA 505 Offered every year. 4  points.   Key concepts related to understanding  sub-Saharan African cultures and societies, concentrating in  particular on teaching students how to think critically and consult  sources sensibly when studying non-Western cultures. Topics include  problems in the interpretation of African literature, African  history, gender issues, the question of whether African thought and  values constitute a unique system of thinking, the impact of the  slave trade and colonialism on African societies and culture, and the  difficulties of and means for translating and interpreting the system  of thought and behavior in an African traditional society into terms  meaningful to Westerners. Among the readings are novels, current  philosophical theory, and feminist interpretations of black and white  accounts of African societies and the place of women in them. Issues  are approached with the use of analyses from history, anthropology,  sociology, literary theory, and philosophy.      Cultures and Contexts: The Chinese and  Japanese Traditions   MAP-UA 506 Offered every other year. 4  points.   Essential aspects of Asian  culture\u2014Confucianism, Taoism, Buddhism, and Shintoism\u2014studied  through careful reading of major works of philosophy and literature.  A roughly equal division between Chinese and Japanese works is meant  to give a basic understanding of the broad similarities and the less  obvious, but all-important, differences among the cultures of  Confucian Asia. One reading is a Vietnamese adaptation of a Chinese  legend. The last two readings, modern novellas from Japan and China,  show the reaction of the traditional cultures to the Western  invasions.      Cultures and Contexts: Japan\u2014A  Cultural History   MAP-UA 507 Offered every other year. 4  points.   A consideration of the prehistory to  Japan's modernist transformation through an analysis of key  literary, religious, and artistic texts. Concentrates on the  historical experiences that produced elements of a national culture  before there was a nation and on the consciousness of being Japanese  before there was a \"Japan.\" Examines how key cultural elements  were used to make a modern nation-state.      Cultures and Contexts: The Pacific  Islands   MAP-UA 508 Offered occasionally. 4  points.   The Pacific Island region sweeps from  Easter Island in the East to Papua New Guinea in the West, a vast  \"sea of islands\" that has been a crucial space of exchange: of  perspectives, materials, people, and ideas. What can we learn from  the study of this region, a set of islands with both commonalities  and differences that is often imagined as one \"place\"? We examine  the cultures of the Pacific Islands, moving from the first migrations  of indigenous navigators through the age of European exploration and  colonialism, to the local experience of World War II and contemporary  engagements with globalization. We also study the area's unique  cultural configurations of ritual practice, cosmology, and society.  Along the way, we engage directly with the voices of Pacific  islanders, from those who participated in the voyages of Captain  Cook, to indigenous artists who reflect on these complex and  entangled histories. Other primary sources include museum  collections, film, painting, and other visual representations. This  comparative approach enables us to understand debates about colonial  encounter, primitivism, cannibalism, cargo cults, nuclear testing,  resource extraction, and the morality of diet, from a Pacific  perspective.      Cultures and Contexts: Middle Eastern  Societies   MAP-UA 511 Offered every other year. 4  points.   The popular American picture of the  Middle East as a place of violence, veiled women, and oil wealth  portrays none of the richness or complexity of most people's lives  in the region. How can we make sense of these seemingly unfamiliar  societies and think critically about Western images of the  unfamiliar? Questions examined in depth include the following: What  variety of sources do people in the Middle East draw on to define  their sense of who they are\u2014as members of particular households,  regions, nations, or religious communities? How do women and men  construct their gender identity? In what ways are village, town, and  city lives being transformed? Do people of the Middle East experience  their region's politics the way it is portrayed in the West? What  are some of the causes of political repression, armed struggle, or  terror? How did European colonialism reshape the lives of people in  the region, and how do they today encounter the cultural and economic  power of the United States and Europe? Readings are drawn from  history, anthropology, political economy, and the contemporary  literature of the region.      Cultures and Contexts: China   MAP-UA 512 Offered every other year. 4  points.   Fundamental concepts and practices of  Chinese society and culture, examined using primary sources in  translation whenever possible. By studying the social, political,  religious, ideological, ritual, economic, and cultural life of the  Chinese, students gain a sense of the core values and issues of  Chinese civilization and how these have affected and continue to have  an impact on the way people think and live.      Cultures and Contexts: Ancient Israel   MAP-UA 514 Offered every semester. 4  points.   The culture of the ancient Israelite  societies of biblical times, covering the period from about 1200  B.C.E. to the conquests of Alexander the Great, in the fourth century  B.C.E. Topics include the achievements of these societies in the  areas of law and social organization, prophetic movements, Israelite  religion, and ancient Hebrew literature. The Hebrew Bible preserves  much of the creativity of the ancient Israelites, but archaeological  excavations in Israel and neighboring lands, as well as the discovery  of ancient writings in Hebrew and related languages, have added  greatly to our knowledge of life as it was lived in biblical times.  The civilizations of Egypt and Syria-Mesopotamia also shed light on  Israelite culture. Of particular interest is the early development of  Israelite monotheism, which, in time, emerged as ancient Judaism, the  mother religion of Christianity and Islam.      Cultures and Contexts: Latin America   MAP-UA 515 Offered every other year. 4  points.   Explores the cultural, social, and  political organization of indigenous people before the period of  European colonization. Studies the dynamics of the colonial  encounter, focusing on such themes as indigenous responses to  European rule, the formation of \"Indian\" society, and the  interaction of Europeans, Africans, and indigenous people. Considers  postcolonial Latin America, focusing on themes such as political  culture, competing ideologies of economics and social development,  and the construction of collective identities based on region, race,  ethnicity, gender, and class. Readings consist mostly of primary  sources and allow students to hear diverse voices within Latin  American society. Works by European conquerors, Inca and Aztec  descendants in the colonial period, and African and creole slaves are  studied. Novels, short stories, films, photographs, and music are  also included.      Cultures and Contexts: India   MAP-UA 516 Offered every other year. 4  points.   Considers the paradoxes of modern  India: ancient religious ideas coexisting with material progress,  hierarchical caste society with parliamentary democracy, and urban  shantytowns with palatial high-rises. Integrates research on India's  cultural values with social-scientific perspectives on their  contemporary relevance. Examines problems such as protective  discrimination for lower castes and cultural nationalism. Shows how  democracy involves difficult choices among competing, often opposed,  ancient and modern cultural values.      Cultures and Contexts: Contemporary  Latino Cultures   MAP-UA 529 Offered every year. 4  points.   Examines the growth and development of  \"Latino\" as a distinct category of identity out of the highly  diverse populations of Latin American background in the United  States, paying particular attention to the social processes shaping  its emergence. Provides a detailed examination of the processes of  cultural creation behind the rising growth of transnational cultures  and identities worldwide, and of the forces that are fueling their  development. Begins by exploring the immigration of Latin American  peoples to U.S. cities, then turns to three case studies of emerging  Latino communities, and ends by examining contemporary issues  involving Latinos in urban centers such as New York.      Cultures and Contexts: The African  Diaspora   MAP-UA 532 Offered every year. 4  points.   The dispersal of Africans to various  parts of the world and over time, examining their experiences and  those of their descendants. Regions of special interest include the  Americas and the Islamic world, centering on questions of slavery and  freedom while emphasizing the emergence of cultural forms and their  relationship to both African and non-African influences.      Cultures and Contexts: Indigenous  Australia   MAP-UA 536 Offered every other year. 4  points.   The indigenous people of Australia have  long been the subject of interest and imagination by outsiders for  their cultural formulations of kinship, ritual, art, gender, and  politics, and they have entered into representations as distinctively  \"other\"\u2014whether in negative or positive formulations of the  \"primitive.\" These representations\u2014in feature films about them  such as Walkabout and Rabbit-Proof Fence, in New Age literature, or  in museum exhibitions\u2014are now also in dialogue with their own forms  of cultural production. At the same time, Aboriginal people have  struggled to reproduce themselves and their traditions in their own  terms, asserting their right to forms of cultural autonomy and  self-determination. We explore the historical and geographical range  of Aboriginal Australian forms of social being through ethnographic  texts, art, novels, autobiographies, film, and other media, and  consider the ways in which identity is being challenged and  constructed.      Cultures and Contexts: Modern Israel   MAP-UA 537 Offered every year. 4  points.   Despite its small size and population,  Israel is a diverse, dynamic, and complex society. To understand its  ethnic, religious, and political divisions, the different ethnic  origins of the Jewish population over the last 150 years are  examined, and the growing role of the Arab population (approaching 20  percent) in Israeli society is discussed. The special role of  religion in the secular state, the development of Hebrew-speaking  culture, the political system, the settlement movement and the peace  movement, gender issues, and the role of the army in everyday life  are all addressed, concluding with a survey of the debate on whether  Israel is a Jewish state or a state of all its citizens. Although the  controversial issues that keep Israel in the headlines are touched  on, the focus is on the character of Israeli society and the impact  on everyday life of living in the international limelight.      Cultures and Contexts:  Asian/Pacific/American Cultures   MAP-UA 539 Offered every year. 4  points.   Major issues in the historical and  contemporary experiences of Asian Pacific Americans, including  migration, modernization, racial formation, community-building, and  political mobilization. Asian Pacific America encompasses a complex,  diverse, and rapidly changing population of people. Particular  attention is given to Asian Americans' use of cultural productions  (films, literature, art, media, and popular culture) as an expression  and reflection of their cultural identities, historical conditions,  and political efforts.      Cultures and Contexts: New World  Encounters   MAP-UA 541 Offered every year. 4  points.   What was America before it was called  America? How did indigenous cultures understand and document their  first encounters with Europeans? We focus on peoples, events, and  cultural expressions associated with the conquest and colonization of  the Americas, concentrating on three key areas: central Mexico, home  to several pre-Columbian societies, most notably the Aztec Empire,  and later the seat of Spanish power in northern Latin America (the  Viceroyalty of New Spain); the central Andes, home of the Incas and  later the site of Spanish power in southern Latin America (the  Viceroyalty of Peru); and finally, early plantation societies of the  Caribbean, where the violent history of enslaved Africans in the new  world unfolded. On one hand, we explore how those subjugated by  conquest and colonialism interpreted, resisted, and recorded their  experience. On the other, we ask what new cultural forms emerged from  these violent encounters, and consider their role in the foundation  of \"Latin American\" cultures. Readings balance a range of primary  documents and art created during the \"age of encounter,\"  including maps, letters, paintings, and testimonials, along with  historical and theoretical texts.      Cultures and Contexts: Egypt of the  Pharaohs   MAP-UA 545 Offered every year. 4  points.   The archaeology, literature, and art of  ancient Egypt all offer insights into its culture. Subjects of  special interest are ancient Egyptian religious experiences and  ethics, as well as constructions of gender, class, and ethnicity.  Settlements that are particularly well documented through both  archaeological and textual remains\u2014such as Kahun and Deir  el-Medina\u2014yield extensive information about the varieties of social  experience in these societies. Lives differed tremendously based on  gender, profession, and locality (both spatial and temporal).  Likewise, we explore how Egyptians, regardless of social standing,  attempted to alter their socio-political circumstances through  avenues such as concerted political action, magic, revolt, or the  construction of well-crafted satire. Primary sources include letters,  wisdom literature, love poetry, ancient house plans, tomb scenes, and  physical anthropology.        Cultures and Contexts: Global Asia   MAP-UA 546 Offered every other year. 4  points.   Explores the expansive transformation  of Asian cultures from ancient times to the present, focusing on  networks of mobility, interaction, social order, and exchange that  form the particularity of Asian cultures through entanglements with  others. Beginning in the days of Alexander the Great and the  formation of the Afro-Eurasian ecumene, follows the tracks of  Buddhist, Confucian, Hindu, and Muslim expansion and then turns to  the age of early modern landed empires,  Ottoman-Safavid-Mughal-Ming/Ching, and their interactions with  seaborne European expansion. Studies truly global formations of  culture in the flow of goods, ideas, and people among world regions,  during the age of modern empires and nationalism, including the rise  of the nation as a cultural norm, capitalism in Asia, and Japanese  expansion around the Pacific Rim. Concludes by considering cultural  change attending globalization since the 1950s, focusing on  entanglements of Asian cultures with the globalizing culture of the  market, consumerism, and wage labor, and transnational labor  migration, as well as Asian cultural spaces in and around New York  City, including our nearby Chinatown.      Cultures and Contexts: Globalizing the  Americas   MAP-UA 550 Offered every other year. 4  points.   The idea of \"America\" has long been  dissected and reconstituted by a number of ideologues, theorists,  policymakers, artists, activists, and ordinary people. Each has  sought to craft a new existence that distinguished itself from \"Old  World\" tyranny and tensions, significantly through the creation of  imagined communities of identity and belonging, based on various  cultural, political-economic, and social criteria. We focus on  studies of selected communities (e.g., the concept and experience of  race in Brazil, homophobia in the West Indies) and historical events  (e.g., 19th- and 20th-century migrations of Asians to Central  America) and explore how global visions and international movements  as, for example, Negritude, Pan-Americanism, Pan-Africanism,  cosmopolitanism, and mestizaje/cr\u00e9olit\u00e9 emerge from local currents  and practices.      Cultures and Contexts: Immigrant  America in the 19th Century   MAP-UA 551 Offered occasionally. 4  points.   The \"long nineteenth century,\" from  the 1820s through the 1920s, saw the arrival of no fewer than 50  million immigrants to the United States. Coming primarily, although  not exclusively, from Europe, their migrations not only transformed  the places they left, but profoundly altered American society. These  migrations, all of which involved a high degree of choice on the part  of their participants, took place within the context of family and  communal decision making, which in turn impacted significantly on the  women and men who made these journeys, allowing\u2014or forcing\u2014them  to create new kinds of identities, institutions, and cultures.  Indeed, as a result of their migrations, they became new people. They  became \"ethnic,\" as they had to redefine themselves both in terms  of what they left, what they \"brought\" with them, and what they  encountered in America. We explore how their journeys led to the  creation of a set of ethnic communities in America, which we can see  as specific and unique and yet resembling each other in notable ways,  focusing on three seemingly very different 19th-century groups:  Irish, Italian, and Jewish immigrants, and the ethnic cultures they  created.      Cultures &amp; Contexts: Topics\u2014Empires  and Political Imagination   MAP-UA 552 Offered every other year. 4  points.   Comparative study of empires, from the  Romans to the present, and the ways that empires have inspired and  constrained their subjects' ideas of rights, belonging, and power.  Throughout history, few people lived for very long in a state that  consisted entirely or even mainly of people with whom they shared a  language and culture. Empires\u2014polities that maintained social and  cultural distinction even as they incorporated different people\u2014have  been one of the most common and durable forms of political  organization. An examination of the variety of human cultures must   take account of how people lived in  empires\u2014sometimes seeking higher degrees of autonomy, sometimes  accommodating to rulers' authority, sometimes trying to extend  their own power over others. The study of empire expands our ideas of  citizenship and challenges the notion that the nation-state is  natural and necessary. We investigate how empires were held  together\u2014and where they were weak\u2014from perspectives that focus on  political and economic connections over long distances and long time  periods. We also explore how scholars have approached the topic of  empires, examining their methods and their interpretations. Readings  include historical scholarship on the Roman, Chinese, Mongol,  Spanish, Russian, French, British, and American empires, as well as  primary sources produced by people living in these and other imperial  polities.         Societies and the Social Sciences      Note that the prerequisite for all  Societies and the Social Sciences courses is completion of Texts and  Ideas (MAP-UA 4XX) and Cultures and Contexts (MAP-UA 5XX), as well as  completion of (or exemption from) Writing the Essay (EXPOS-UA 1),   Writing II (WRI-UF 2002), or International Writing Workshop II (EXPOS-UA 9).      Societies and the Social Sciences:  Topics in Interdisciplinary Perspective   MAP-UA 600 Offered occasionally. 4  points.   Examines social phenomena that cross  the boundaries among the various social-scientific disciplines.  Topics vary each term and may include, for example, human migration,  religion, fascism, or colonialism. By considering the methodologies  appropriate to the study of these topics, students learn to  appreciate the characteristic approaches of the social sciences,  their power to help us understand such phenomena, and their  limitations.         Expressive Culture      Note that the prerequisite for all  Expressive Culture courses is completion of Texts and Ideas (MAP-UA  4XX) and Cultures and Contexts (MAP-UA 5XX), as well as completion of  (or exemption from) Writing the Essay (EXPOS-UA 1), Writing II (WRI-UF 2002), or International Writing Workshop II (EXPOS-UA 9).      Expressive Culture: Words   MAP-UA 710 Offered occasionally. 4  points.   What is literature or the literary? Is  there a literary language that works differently from ordinary  language? What is literary style and form? What is the position of  the writer or artist in relation to society, and what is the function  of the reader? Is literature a mirror of the world that it describes,  an attempt to influence a reader's ideas or opinions, an expression  of the identity of the writer, or none of these?      Expressive Culture: The Graphic Novel   MAP-UA 711 Offered occasionally. 4  points.   Examines the interplay between words  and images in the graphic novel, a hybrid medium with a system of  communication reminiscent of prose fiction, animation, and film. What  is the connection between text and art? How are internal psychology,  time, and action conveyed in a static series of words and pictures?  What can the graphic novel convey that other media cannot? Authors  include Alan Moore, Art Spiegelman, Peter Milligan, Charles Burns,  and Carla Speed McNeil.      Expressive Culture: Images   MAP-UA 720 Offered occasionally. 4  points.   What is the place of art in an  image-saturated world? We begin by considering the power and taboo of  images and the ways in which individuals and institutions that  constitute \"the art world\" classify some of these images as works  of art; turn to explore the visual and conceptual challenges  presented by major works of sculpture, architecture, and painting;  and conclude with a selection of problems raised by art today.  Students develop the vocabulary to both appreciate and question the  artistic \"gestures\" of society in various places and times.      Expressive Culture: Painting and  Sculpture in New York Field Study   MAP-UA 721 Offered every spring. 4  points.   New York's public art collections  contain important examples of painting and sculpture from almost  every phase of the past, as well as some of the world's foremost  works of contemporary art. Meets once a week for an extended period  and combines on-campus lectures with group excursions to the museums  or other locations where these works are exhibited.      Expressive Culture: Architecture in New  York Field Study   MAP-UA 722 Offered every fall. 4  points.   New York's rich architectural  heritage offers a unique opportunity for firsthand consideration of  the concepts and styles of modern urban architecture, as well as its  social, financial, and cultural contexts. Meets once a week for an  extended period and combines on-campus lectures with group excursions  to prominent buildings. Consideration is given both to individual  buildings as examples of 19th- and 20th-century architecture, as well  as to phenomena such as the development of the skyscraper and the  adaptation of older buildings to new uses.      Expressive Culture: Sounds   MAP-UA 730 Offered every semester. 4  points.   Our lives pulsate with patterns of  sounds that we call music. We encounter these sounds in our homes,  cars, stores, and exercise salons; they accompany us to the grocery  store, the dentist's office, and the movies. Yet we rarely think  consciously about what they mean. Through a series of specific case  studies, we investigate the function and significance of music and  the musician in human life. We raise basic questions about how music  has been created, produced, perceived, and evaluated at diverse  historical moments, in a variety of geographical locations, and among  different cultural groups. Through aural explorations and discussion  of how these vivid worlds \"sound\" in time and space, we assess  the value of music in human experience.      Expressive Culture: Performance   MAP-UA 740 Offered occasionally. 4  points.   Examines \"performance\" both as a  practice and as a theoretical tool with which to understand today's  world. The broad spectrum of live performance is explored by means of  lectures, discussions, and field trips. Students look at theatre and  dance, performance in everyday life, rituals, popular entertainments,  and intercultural performance.

Expressive Culture: Film   MAP-UA 750 Offered every semester. 4  points.   Film is a medium that combines a number  of arts. It lies at the intersection of art and technology and of art  and mass culture, and at the boundaries of the national and the  global. Film is also a medium that coincides with and contributes to  the invention of modern life. By exploring the expressive and  representational achievements of cinema in the context of modernity  and mass culture, students learn the concepts to grasp the different  ways in which films create meaning, achieve their emotional impact,  and respond in complex ways to the historical contexts in which they  are made.

Within in a comparative perspective we will consider the diverse sources & modes of representation, including American travelers\u2019 exoticizing accounts of the \u201cHoly Land,\u201d early Zionist utopianist narratives, Palestinian documentarist photography & contemporary historicizing anthologies of past images. We will study the ways images of maps, landscapes, archeological sites, villages, cities, houses, & communities have come to constitute a kind of visual archive that both document the past & serves as \u201cevidence\u201d for specific historical narratives. In recent photographic anthologies, historical texts, tourist guidebooks, memoirs, novels, as well as in documentary & fictional films, such visual material prior to the partition of Palestine has played an important role in the battle over representation. In context of partition & displacement, we will argue, dominant & counter media also play in defining national identity & communal belonging. Rather than taking for granted such notions as \u201cseeing is believing\u201d & \u201cimages do not lie,\u201d we will address the complex relationship between image & word, & between text & context. The seminar will be organized around key concepts & questions having to do with the orientalist imaginary, national allegory, & diasporic narratives.

The aim of this particular course is to chart the history of how consumerism has been theorized since the nineteenth century, & to make clear the connections between the literature on consumerism/consumption & the literature on visual consumption & the relationship of modernity & visuality. The course will thus trace an arc from the literature on nineteenth century practices of visual consumption & the rise of consumer society to contemporary debates about the relationship of consumerism to philanthropy, neoliberalism & global capitalism, & theories of cultural resistance in the context of new media practices.

More particularly, the course will consider the ways that the modern category \u201cinformation\u201d has emerged in relation to different media & different genres. What are the social, material, institutional, & semantic conditions that have worked to align communication with truth or authenticity? What routes can be discerned between a history of media & a history of objectivity? Significant attention will be paid to the elaboration of key terms & concepts as well as to different disciplinary & interdisciplinary resources that shape such an inquiry.

We begin with an overview of cybernetics, information theory, systems theory, distributed communications networks, & theories of postmodernity. Next, we examine the rise of immaterial labor in the service economies & the extension of codified labor practices into the realm of daily life. The seminar will also consider the ramifications of informatic capture & the formation of coded objects & bodies. Finally, we explore networked struggle &, through it, a political theory of the present moment. The course will favor both close readings of specific technologies as well as social & cultural claims about the information age.

This class offers a counterpoint by examining the legacies of these experiences in visual & cultural studies. It suggests a different history of the present than is usually told, with particular regard to visuality in film, art & performance. Each participant will undertake a research project using materials in the Tamiment Library (& elsewhere if needed) & will present the results in a mini-conference at the end of the semester.

From e-mail to texting, from online gaming to online banking, from You Tube to Hulu, from DoS attacks to Second Life sit-ins, nearly every traditional aspect of our lives has found a new expression in its digital proxy. In order to understand the cultural, social, political & economic consequences of this development, we must look to the origins of today\u2019s cyberculture, in the futuristic visions (both dystonian & utopian) that shaped the development of today\u2019s networked technologies. We will trace the genealogy of these visions, as they developed in tandem with the growing digital communications infrastructure over the past three quarters of a century, & evolved into new forms that even the most forward-thinking of visionaries could not have predicted. Ultimately, one can argue the the Internet has both exceeded & fallen short of the hype that surrounded its birth & development, & by comparing the myth to the reality, we may better understand what aspects of the human condition are likely to persist regardless of technological development.

It will center on understanding how cultural hegemony is attained, but how established norms are subverted & challenged, particularly along political & cultural fronts. Examples will be drawn from the contemporary United States, France & other countries, including global social justice movements. A variety of media formats will be reviewed, from film & print media, to social media, to protest & occupation.

We will examine a range of forms of mediated production & consumption understood broadly in relation to political, economic, & cultural power, & situate these forms in relation to contemporary theorizing about global cultural convergence, divergence, & hybridity.      Course Page               40    4            MCC-GE 2381            Topics in Globalization: Global Consumer Culture           Consumer culture by its nature is intensely local & inevitably global. Its locality is tied up with the intimacy of food, clothing, & shelter, & the elasticity of the relationship between bodies & things, between needs & desires, yet its meanings & messages are globally circulated & produced. This course explores critical approaches to the globalization of consumer culture by examining how bodies & things shape each other through long histories (colonial, postcolonial, global) of production, distribution, & fashion. Students will study the social world of global consumers as an analytic entry point into the complex networks of cultural practice which mediate the perennial tension between habituation & novelty.
