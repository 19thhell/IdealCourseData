We focus on the foundations of choreography through better understanding use of space, control, aesthetics, alignment, musicality, development of learning strategies within a duet/group context, as well as personal and artistic expression. Each student will make solos, duets, and collaborative group work as well as present their work to an audience at the end of the semester.  Check Albert for course schedule.
