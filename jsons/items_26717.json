Dishonored , the second American Dietrich-Sternberg film, is one of the least familiar (and least appreciated) of their seven films together. Dietrich's acting was improving steadily, and while the film was still deliberately slowly paced, there was a discipline and an order to the slowness which had been lacking in Morocco . As with most Sternberg films, the characters and situations are absurd (although the larger-than-life climax is far more poignant and affecting than the lugubrious sentiment of the similar ending to Garbo's &quot;Meta Hari&quot;), but the sheer bravura style, the sets, the camerawork, the decor, the dialogue, all more than make up for any lack of logic. Actually, if Victor McLaglen were more convincing as a master spy, and the Dietrich-McLaglen relationship was developed to a point where one could believe that their attraction was mutual and not mere sparring, Dishonored might well have had a far more solid dramatic foundation than most of the Sternbergs. But, regardless, it's a gorgeous piece of cinematic hoke, and pictorially a dazzler. Incidentally, most of the wartime action scenes during the montages are lifted from (primarily) Hotel Imperial , with, curiously, a shot or two bought from All Quiet on the Western Front too.                          - Intermission -           THE SHANGHAI GESTURE (LTA, 1941) Presented by Arnold Pressburger; directed by Josef von Sternberg;    Associate Producer, Albert de Courville;     photographed by Paul Ivano; sets by Boris Leven; music    composed and     conducted by Richard Hageman; adapted by Josef von Sternberg, Geza     Herczeg,    Karl Vollmoeller and Jules Furthman from the play by John     Colton; 9 reels      With Gene T ierney, Victor Mature, Walter Huston, Ona Munson, Phyllis Brooks, Albert Basserman, Maria Ouspenskaya, Eric Blore, Mike Mazurki, Ivan Lebedeff, Clyde Fillmore, Rex Evans, Grayce Hampton, Michael Delmatoff, Marcel Dalio, Mikhail Rassumny, John Abbott.           Though hardly top-bracket von Sternberg, The Shanghai Gesture was nevertheless the last authentic, vintage film from this colorful director. He may have been satisfied with his much later Anatahan but few of his admirers were, and his last American films - Macao and Jet Pilot , regardless of interference and re-shooting by other directors, showed little of the old von Sternberg. For The Shanghai Gesture , a good deal of credit should go to producer Arnold Pressburger, who in the early 40's had the wit and courage to give directors like von Sternberg, Rene Clair and Fritz Lang their heads in decidedly off-beat material. A notorious play, and a watered-down silent film, The Shanghai Gesture ran into inevitable scripting problems which von Sternberg side-stepped rather neatly. It may be a compromise of sorts to change Mother God-Damn to Mother Gin Sling, and to disguise a brothel as a gambling front, but it's not hard to read between the frames, and as a fascinating study in corruption and decadence, the film is still pretty hard-hitting stuff. And for 1941, when     this kind of fare was temporarily quite alien to the screen, it was exceptionally strong meat. (Incidentally, the character of Dr. Omar was a useful invention of Sternberg's!) Pictorially the film, dominated by its marvellous gambling casino set, is always interesting; Ona Munson's makeup inevitably recalls Dietrich, the supporting players are well-cast (though some characters, such as a bartender burdened with Sternbergian philosophies and humor, fall a trifle flat), and Gene Tierney was never photographed better -- nor did she ever again give such a good performance.

The intensive period of collaboration between the actress and the director--seven films within six years--represents a complete cycle within the director's oeuvre; the films made between 1929-1935 repay close analysis because of their high degree of organization, density of meaning and subtle experimentation and exploration of the medium. An essential constituent of Sternberg's vision is the figure of Dietrich; her \"presence\" is required for the fulfillment of the director's projects.    Chapter One is an investigation of the distinct ways in which Sternberg utilizes the frame: to reveal and conceal views from the spectator and as a means of interrogating the authenticity and meaning of the two-dimensional film image. In Chapter Two the special properties of Sternberg's mise-en-scene are elaborated. These include the remarkable depth of intensity of the mise-en-scene as a mode of expression and also its capability of situating the depicted world in a delicate juncture between the \"real\" and the \"imaginary.\" Performance style is the subject of Chapter Three. The extreme regulation of each element of the performance, the theatrical stylization and exaggeration, the abundance and mutability of role-playing within a single role, the self-referential and allusive properties of the acting, present a particularly useful and interesting case for the study of film acting and one in which the director both confronts and utilizes the artifice of acting. Chapter Four is an exploration of the ways Sternberg's various strategies coalesce to create the figure of Dietrich. Through the particular use of costume, light, space, body position and fragmentation, Dietrich becomes an icon. Sternberg's representation of the actress is compared to the paintings of medieval icon-makers; both the director and the painters sought to endow their subjects with a non-specificity that would locate them between the \"abstract\" and the \"real.\" Dietrich is empowered with an enduring aura of mystery; it is a major objective of this dissertation to account for the ways in which the mystery is established.

There is a conspicuous lack of attention given to revolutionary films among film scholars and theorists, a lack which is all the more surprising when one considers that the revolutionary genre presents a number of general theoretical questions concerning narrative, history, the revolutionary event, and the political importance of aesthetic works. We hope to fill this absence by focusing on films presenting diverse revolutionary moments, in various geographical and historical settings. This spatial and temporal diversity will bring together a series of films that chose different ways to negotiate the inherent ambiguities of revolution as a historical phenomenon, as well as the formal difficulties of cinematically representing it. Each film will be presented by an invited speaker. Unless otherwise noted, all screenings will take place at 19 University Place, room 102 at 5:00PM Organized by the Italian, French, Comparative Literature, Psychology, and International Relations Departments.
