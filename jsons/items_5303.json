Too many sang along and marched in step... Tine Kindermann has blown the dust off these songs and made them alive, fresh, good as new. With her musicians, she has put them in an unusual contemporary intercultural context. \" (From the booklet of schamlos sch\u00f6n , Tine Kindermann's acclaimed CD, Oriente Berlin, 2008).
