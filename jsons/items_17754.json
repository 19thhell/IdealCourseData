Federal Budget Reform: Lessons from State and Local Governments. Pathways to Fiscal Reform in the United States, pp. 135-162. John W. Diamond and George R. Zodrow (Eds.). The MIT Press. View Publication    Abstract    As \u201claboratories of democracy,\u201d U.S. state and local governments have experimented with a wide variety of fiscal institutions designed to constrain public expenditures and indebtedness, yielding a myriad of institutional arrangements the federal government might consider \u2014 or is already considering \u2014 adopting to improve its long-term fiscal outlook. A large empirical literature exploits this institutional variation within and across state and local governments to estimate the effects of fiscal constraints on spending, taxes, deficits, and debt. This paper, which draws heavily on Rose (2010), synthesizes the literature, summarizing lessons for the federal government about the effectiveness of various institutions in promoting fiscal sustainability.       2013      Smith, Daniel L. and Yilin Hou. 2013.  Balanced Budget Requirements and State Spending: A Long-Panel Study. Public Budgeting &amp; Finance 33(2): 1-18. View Publication    Abstract    This study tests the effects of balanced budget requirements on three measures of state expenditure using data on 48 states for the years 1950 to 2004. We find that the following rules are effective in constraining expenditures: 1) requiring that the governor submit a balanced budget; 2) placing controls on supplemental appropriations; and 3) prohibiting the carry-over of a deficit from one fiscal year or biennium into the next. The latter two rules exert larger individual effects than the first. All else equal, states can best improve their prospects of reigning in spending by instituting technical rules that govern budgetary outcomes, as opposed to political rules that dictate how the budget is assembled and approved.

View Publication    Abstract    This paper employs panel estimators with data on the 50 American states for the years 1963 to 2006 to test the relationship between Unemployment Insurance (UI) trust fund solvency and UI benefit generosity. We find that both average and maximum weekly UI benefit amounts, as ratios to the average weekly wage, are higher in states and in years with more highly solvent trust funds. This result holds after controlling for state-level unemployment rate, Gross Domestic Product (GDP), population growth, legislative political ideology, partisan control of the executive and legislative branches, and gubernatorial election year across multiple specifications, including fixed-effects and dynamic panel estimators. We propose a theory of moderate coupling as the causal mechanism, whereby UI program benefits and financing are directly related but are not as tightly linked as in other social insurance programs, such as Medicaid. The findings have important policy implications for the funding of states\u2019 UI systems. As a consequence of moderate coupling, the countercyclicality of the UI program is dampened.       2012      Finkler, Steven A., Robert M. Purtell, Thad D. Calabrese, and Daniel L. Smith. 2012.

Budget Slack, Institutions, and Transparency. Public Administration Review 72(2): 187-95 View Publication    Abstract    Economic theory suggests that it is optimal for governments to use precautionary saving as a countercyclical tool. However, the availability of surplus funds often triggers political pressure for tax cuts and spending increases. Mechanisms for alleviating that pressure include limiting the transparency of slack resources and limiting politicians' discretion to use slack resources for purposes other than stabilization. This article investigates the extent to which these two mechanisms are substitutes. In particular, the authors examine whether the widespread adoption of budget stabilization funds (BSFs) in the U.S. states over the past several decades has been accompanied by a decline in conservative revenue forecast bias. Using panel data from 47 states over a 22-year period, they find that the adoption of a BSF reduces revenue underestimation by approximately two-thirds; however, the size of the effect depends in part on how much a state saves in the BSF and the rules governing BSF deposits and withdrawals. The results suggest that BSFs have the unintended effect of increasing fiscal transparency.            Smith, Daniel L. 2012.  An Empirical Framework for Public Finance and Financial Management.

View Publication    Abstract    Strong property tax growth and proactive policies - including beginning the recession with a substantial surplus of $5.3 billion (9 percent of revenues) - offset a severe contraction in income tax receipts, protecting the City's budget such that it never contracted in absolute terms during or immediately following the Great Recession. Policymakers increased property and sales tax rates, utilized fund balances, cut agency budgets repeatedly, and re-appropriated retiree health benefits in response to the fiscal challenges brought about by the Great Recession. Whether one attributes it to compliance with a strong, state-mandated, balanced budget rule or adept leadership, New York City certainly appears to be dealing effectively with the Great Recession's impact on its budget. However, City leaders have asked lower income residents to bear a substantial portion of the burden by favoring more regressive tax policies and by cutting the social service agency's budget substantially. With forecast budget gaps of $3 billion and $4 billion in FY 2012 and FY 2013, the long-term impact of the Great Recession on New York City's budget remains an open question.

Journal of Public Administration Research and Theory 21(S1): i113-i124. View Publication    Abstract    Public administration and management (PAM) scholars have long recognized that financial resources are the lifeblood of public organizations. Less appreciated is how the study of public financial management (PFM) can inform the theory, research, and practice of PAM broadly. In this article, we argue that PFM research brings a variety of conceptual, analytical, and empirical insights to bear on some of public administration and management's timeless questions. To illustrate this claim, we synthesize findings from a variety of research across the PFM subfield.       2010      Marlowe, Justin and Daniel L. Smith. 2010.

View Publication    Abstract    Questions of how public organizations control and manage resources have been relegated to an insular subfield of contemporary public management. This is both unfortunate and unnatural because insights from the study of budgeting and financial management have traditionally been a driving force of public management's conceptual and empirical development. In this paper we seek to address this problem by reconnecting contemporary findings from the budgeting and financial management subfield to broader concerns in public management. We focus our discussion on the centrality of management technique in contemporary public management, and we argue that research in select areas of contemporary public budgeting and financial management has and will continue to illuminate the implications of reform and innovation in management technique, particularly in our current environment of amorphous institutional arrangements and diffuse, shared power.

View Publication    Abstract    Balanced budget requirements (BBRs) affect all aspects of financial operations. Previous studies relied on characterizations that highlight a constitutional-statutory distinction. Hou and Smith (Public Budgeting &amp; Finance 26(3):22\u201345, 2006 ) instead propose a political-technical construct. This article uses probit estimation, six measures of balance, and long panels to test which framework offers more explanatory power. The findings suggest that BBRs matter to varying degrees. Technical requirements exert bigger effects than political ones, the effects are more obvious on narrower than broader measures of balance and in the later phases of the budget cycle, and the political-technical construct offers more explanatory power than the constitutional-statutory distinction.            Hou, Yilin and Daniel L. Smith. 2010.  Informal Norms as a Bridge between Formal Rules and Outcomes of Government Financial Operations: Evidence from State Balanced Budget Requirements. Journal of Public Administration Research and Theory 20(3): 655-78. View Publication    Abstract    Both formal rules and informal norms guide government operations; formal rules often function through informal norms. Balanced budget requirements (BBRs) are formal rules, but they are implemented via the intermediary of informal norms\u2014interpretation of BBRs by state officials. This article examines the fiscal implications of informal norms that govern budgetary balance. We propose that informal norms have substantive implications in policy making and implementation. To test the proposition, we obtain state self-reported, time-varying data on balanced budget provisions as observations of informal norms, compare them against formal, codified balanced budget requirements from recent research to identify gaps between rules and norms, and decompose the gaps using two categories\u2014\u201cinterpretations\u201d and \u201creverse interpretations\u201d of formal balanced budget requirements. We then conduct probit estimation to obtain the effects of informal norms as well as the interpretations and reverse interpretations on two measures of budgetary balance. Results show that informal norms do affect outcomes of government financial operations; the two-step decomposition of the gaps between formal rules and informal norms provides further information on the locus of these effects. The article identifies the interpretation of formal rules as a new research area, thus contributing to the budgetary institutions and policy implementation literatures.       2008      Smith, Daniel L. 2008.  The Global Public Service: Taking on the Challenges of the 21st Century.  View Publication    Abstract    This paper's first goal is to evaluate the evolution and state of scholarship in public administration. It begins with a question: How far have public administration theory and research advanced since 1940, when the self-aware study of public administration, as a field if not a discipline, took root in the United States? This paper argues that scholars of public administration in the U.S. and abroad continuously advance the scientific rigor of research and are cognizant of the real-world challenges faced by policymakers and public servants of all sorts. Nonetheless, it is further argued, there remains room for improving our scientific understanding of the public service in the twenty-first century. Turning to practice, the second section identifies how we might better link our scientific findings to the lessons we provide in the classroom. Finally, the paper concludes with a discussion on preparing the public service of the twenty-first century and beyond to manage some of the considerable challenges it will encounter.       2007      Smith, Daniel L. 2007.

View Publication    Abstract    Studies of state fiscal and budgetary policies often use balanced budget requirements (BBRs) as explanatory variables. While current measures laid the crucial groundwork for a basic understanding of state BBRs, their lack of comprehensiveness threatens the validity of empirical work. Based on comprehensive legal research, this article offers a framework for analyzing state requirements: each state's BBRs form a coherent system for achieving budget balance through budget cycles; a fully developed BBR system offers a three-line construct against imbalance; and the more complete, developed, and explicit a BBR system is, the more stringent it will be in achieving budgetary balance.            Justice, Jonathan B., James Melitski, and Daniel L. Smith. 2006.  E-Government as an Instrument of Fiscal Accountability and Responsiveness: Do the best practitioners employ the best practices? The American Review of Public Administration 36(3): 301-22. View Publication    Abstract    Fiscal transparency and citizen participation in budgeting processes are widely promoted as means toward the ends of democratic accountability and responsiveness in the allocation and use of public funds. In the past decade, academics and practitioners enthusiastic about e-government have emphasized the potential for using information technology to enhance democratic governance. Putting these two streams of public administration theory and practice together, the authors developed criteria for assessing e-budgeting efforts and applied them to a sample of Web sites operated by state and local governments. Although practitioners are ahead of academics in exploring the potential of e-government for improving fiscal accountability and responsiveness, practice lags behind the relevant basic recommendations of the Government Finance Officers Association. This finding leads to research and practice agendas aimed at enhancing the use of e-government to enhance fiscal transparency and participation.

The following is a list of 25 questions  that I believe every valuation analyst has struggled with at some point in  time or the other and my answers to them. As the heading should make clear,  I do not believe that I have the final word on any of them. So feel free to  disagree, and let me know that you do. Maybe we can muddle through to the right  answer. Cheers!        Question    Answer        All valuations begin with an estimate   of free cashflow . The   free cashflow to the firm is computed to be:   After-tax    Operating Income     -   (Capital Expenditures - Depreciation)     -           Change in working capital     = FCFF     Netting out cashflows to and    from debt (subtract out interest and principal payments and add back  cash inflows from new debt) yields the free cashflow to equity (FCFE)           1.          Operating income is defined to be    revenues less operating expenses and should be before financial expenses    (interest expenses, for example) and capital expenses (which create    benefits over multiple periods). Specify at least two items that    currently affect operating income that fail this definitional test    and explain what you would do to adjust for their effects.     Answer         2.          Operating income     can be volatile both as a result of the normal ebb and flow of     business and as a result of accounting transactions (one time income     and expenses). Should you smooth or normalize operating income     and if so how do you do it?     Answer            3. In    computing the tax on the operating income, there are three choices    that you can use - effective tax rate (about 29% for the average    US company in 2003), marginal tax rate (35-40% for most US companies)   and actual taxes paid.      a. Which one would you choose?       b.          What happens        if you are a multinational and are in several countries    with very different tax rates?         c. What happens if you are reporting   an operating loss?        Answer         4.          Many companies     grow through acquisitions, some of which they pay for with cash     and some with stock. In computing capital expenditures, should     you include any of the acquisitions, only acquisitions funded with     cash or all acquisitions?     Answer        5.    Depreciation and amortization includes a number of different items.    Some of them are tax deductible (like conventional depreciation on    assets) but some are not (like amortization of goodwill). In computing    depreciation, should you include all depreciation and amortization    or only tax-deductible depreciation and amortization?       Answer        6.    The conventional accounting definition of working capital is current    assets minus current liabilities and includes cash and marketable securities    in current assets and short term debt in current liabilities.      a.        Should you consider   all cash, operating cash or no cash at all when you compute working capital?    b. Should you consider short term  debt as part of current liabilities?    Answer        Estimating growth is   where your valuation and guessing skills come most into play. While you   can estimate growth by looking at the past or at what analysts are forecasting,  you should consider the fundamentals.         7.    Most of us have seen the equations for sustainable growth. In particular,    the growth in earnings per share = (1 - payout ratio) * Return on    equity.     a.          Can you use the    same equation to compute growth in operating income?      b.             Under what assumptions    will this sustainable growth rate also be equal to your expected    growth rate?      c. Increasing the amount you reinvest back    into the business (reduce the payout ratio or increase the reinvestment    rate) will increase the growth rate for any company that is prfitable.    Will it also increase value?      Answer        8. How    long can high growth last?    Answer        Now let's consider the big enchilada - terminal    value - at the end of the high growth phase. There are three    ways in which terminal value can be estimated - liquidation value for    the assets, a multiple of earnings or revenues in the terminal year    or by assuming that cashflows grow at a constant rate forever after  your terminal year.            9. How do   you decide which approach to use to estimate terminal value?    Answer        10.        Assuming that you use the perpetual growth model, can the stable growth   rate be negative?     Answer        11.        What effect will increasing the growth rate in perpetuity have on terminal   value?    Answer        Moving below the line, let us talk about the discount    rate to use in valuation. If the cashflows being discounted    are cashflows to the firm, the discount rate is a weighted average    of the cost of equity and the cost of debt, weighted by the market  values of each component.         12.        Debt can be defined in many ways - total liabilities, total debt or long   term debt. What would you include in debt?    Answer         13.          Why do we use     market value weights to come up with a cost of capital instead     of book value weights?     Answer        14.    In private businesses, neither debt nor equity is traded. In most publicly    traded firms, equity has a market value but a significant portion (or    often all) of the debt is not publicly traded.    a.          How do you get    market value of debt when all or even some of your firm's debt is    bank debt and not publicly traded? How would you compute an updated    cost of debt for an unrated company with bank debt?     b.          How do you      get a market value of equity for a private business?      Answer         15.          Can the weights     change from year to year in computing the cost of capital?     Answer         16.          There are a number     of different risk and return models in finance used to compute     the cost of equity but they all assume that the marginal investor     is well diversified. If you use these models to estimate costs     of equity for private or closely held firms, are you likely to     under or over estimate the cost of equity? How would you fix the     bias?     Answer         17.          Multinationals     now operate and trade in different markets and different currencies.     Which riskfree rate should you use to value a company (Nestle,     for instance)?     Answer         18.          Most analysts     estimate risk premiums by looking at historical data in the United     States. What are the perils of historical premiums?     Answer        19.    Increasingly, we are called upon to value companies in emerging markets    in Asia and Latin America and we have to estimate risk premiums there.      a. Should   there be an additional country risk premium for investing in a Brazilian   or a Chinese company?        b.          If yes, how would    you go about estimating it?      c.          Once you estimate    the country risk premium, should the same premium be added on for all    companies in that country? If you don't think so, how would you go    about estimating a company's exposure to country risk?          Answer        Getting from the DCF value to the value of equity   can be a messy process. You have to consider what you have not valued  yet and what other claims there might be on the equity of a firm.        20.          An alternate approach to discounted   cashflow valuation is the adjusted present value approach, where you   value the firm with no debt (unlevered firm) first and then consider   the value effects of debt. What is the fundamental difference between   the cost of capital approach and the APV approach and why might they   give you different answers?      Answer         21.          Discounted cashflow     valuations are usually based upon the assumption that your firm     will survive as a going concern. If you are valuing a young firm     or a distressed firm where there is a significant likelihood that     the firm will not make it as a going concern, how do you reflect     that in your valuation?     Answer         22.          What have you     not valued yet? (In other words, what do you need to add on to     the present value?)     Answer         23.          What do you need     to subtract from firm value to get to the value of equity?     Answer         24.          It is common     practice in valuation to add a premium for control this value or     subtract out a discount (minority, marketability, private company     etc.). Is this a reasonable practice?     Answer         25.          How do you get     from the value of equity to the value of equity per share?     Answer"}]},

Federal Budget Reform: Lessons from State and Local Governments. Pathways to Fiscal Reform in the United States, pp. 135-162. John W. Diamond and George R. Zodrow (Eds.). The MIT Press. View Publication    Abstract    As \u201claboratories of democracy,\u201d U.S. state and local governments have experimented with a wide variety of fiscal institutions designed to constrain public expenditures and indebtedness, yielding a myriad of institutional arrangements the federal government might consider \u2014 or is already considering \u2014 adopting to improve its long-term fiscal outlook. A large empirical literature exploits this institutional variation within and across state and local governments to estimate the effects of fiscal constraints on spending, taxes, deficits, and debt. This paper, which draws heavily on Rose (2010), synthesizes the literature, summarizing lessons for the federal government about the effectiveness of various institutions in promoting fiscal sustainability.       2013      Smith, Daniel L. and Yilin Hou. 2013.  Balanced Budget Requirements and State Spending: A Long-Panel Study. Public Budgeting &amp; Finance 33(2): 1-18. View Publication    Abstract    This study tests the effects of balanced budget requirements on three measures of state expenditure using data on 48 states for the years 1950 to 2004. We find that the following rules are effective in constraining expenditures: 1) requiring that the governor submit a balanced budget; 2) placing controls on supplemental appropriations; and 3) prohibiting the carry-over of a deficit from one fiscal year or biennium into the next. The latter two rules exert larger individual effects than the first. All else equal, states can best improve their prospects of reigning in spending by instituting technical rules that govern budgetary outcomes, as opposed to political rules that dictate how the budget is assembled and approved.

View Publication    Abstract    This paper employs panel estimators with data on the 50 American states for the years 1963 to 2006 to test the relationship between Unemployment Insurance (UI) trust fund solvency and UI benefit generosity. We find that both average and maximum weekly UI benefit amounts, as ratios to the average weekly wage, are higher in states and in years with more highly solvent trust funds. This result holds after controlling for state-level unemployment rate, Gross Domestic Product (GDP), population growth, legislative political ideology, partisan control of the executive and legislative branches, and gubernatorial election year across multiple specifications, including fixed-effects and dynamic panel estimators. We propose a theory of moderate coupling as the causal mechanism, whereby UI program benefits and financing are directly related but are not as tightly linked as in other social insurance programs, such as Medicaid. The findings have important policy implications for the funding of states\u2019 UI systems. As a consequence of moderate coupling, the countercyclicality of the UI program is dampened.       2012      Finkler, Steven A., Robert M. Purtell, Thad D. Calabrese, and Daniel L. Smith. 2012.

Budget Slack, Institutions, and Transparency. Public Administration Review 72(2): 187-95 View Publication    Abstract    Economic theory suggests that it is optimal for governments to use precautionary saving as a countercyclical tool. However, the availability of surplus funds often triggers political pressure for tax cuts and spending increases. Mechanisms for alleviating that pressure include limiting the transparency of slack resources and limiting politicians' discretion to use slack resources for purposes other than stabilization. This article investigates the extent to which these two mechanisms are substitutes. In particular, the authors examine whether the widespread adoption of budget stabilization funds (BSFs) in the U.S. states over the past several decades has been accompanied by a decline in conservative revenue forecast bias. Using panel data from 47 states over a 22-year period, they find that the adoption of a BSF reduces revenue underestimation by approximately two-thirds; however, the size of the effect depends in part on how much a state saves in the BSF and the rules governing BSF deposits and withdrawals. The results suggest that BSFs have the unintended effect of increasing fiscal transparency.            Smith, Daniel L. 2012.  An Empirical Framework for Public Finance and Financial Management.

View Publication    Abstract    Strong property tax growth and proactive policies - including beginning the recession with a substantial surplus of $5.3 billion (9 percent of revenues) - offset a severe contraction in income tax receipts, protecting the City's budget such that it never contracted in absolute terms during or immediately following the Great Recession. Policymakers increased property and sales tax rates, utilized fund balances, cut agency budgets repeatedly, and re-appropriated retiree health benefits in response to the fiscal challenges brought about by the Great Recession. Whether one attributes it to compliance with a strong, state-mandated, balanced budget rule or adept leadership, New York City certainly appears to be dealing effectively with the Great Recession's impact on its budget. However, City leaders have asked lower income residents to bear a substantial portion of the burden by favoring more regressive tax policies and by cutting the social service agency's budget substantially. With forecast budget gaps of $3 billion and $4 billion in FY 2012 and FY 2013, the long-term impact of the Great Recession on New York City's budget remains an open question.

Journal of Public Administration Research and Theory 21(S1): i113-i124. View Publication    Abstract    Public administration and management (PAM) scholars have long recognized that financial resources are the lifeblood of public organizations. Less appreciated is how the study of public financial management (PFM) can inform the theory, research, and practice of PAM broadly.

To illustrate this claim, we synthesize findings from a variety of research across the PFM subfield.       2010      Marlowe, Justin and Daniel L. Smith. 2010.

View Publication    Abstract    Questions of how public organizations control and manage resources have been relegated to an insular subfield of contemporary public management. This is both unfortunate and unnatural because insights from the study of budgeting and financial management have traditionally been a driving force of public management's conceptual and empirical development. In this paper we seek to address this problem by reconnecting contemporary findings from the budgeting and financial management subfield to broader concerns in public management. We focus our discussion on the centrality of management technique in contemporary public management, and we argue that research in select areas of contemporary public budgeting and financial management has and will continue to illuminate the implications of reform and innovation in management technique, particularly in our current environment of amorphous institutional arrangements and diffuse, shared power.

View Publication    Abstract    Balanced budget requirements (BBRs) affect all aspects of financial operations. Previous studies relied on characterizations that highlight a constitutional-statutory distinction. Hou and Smith (Public Budgeting &amp; Finance 26(3):22\u201345, 2006 ) instead propose a political-technical construct. This article uses probit estimation, six measures of balance, and long panels to test which framework offers more explanatory power. The findings suggest that BBRs matter to varying degrees. Technical requirements exert bigger effects than political ones, the effects are more obvious on narrower than broader measures of balance and in the later phases of the budget cycle, and the political-technical construct offers more explanatory power than the constitutional-statutory distinction.            Hou, Yilin and Daniel L. Smith. 2010.  Informal Norms as a Bridge between Formal Rules and Outcomes of Government Financial Operations: Evidence from State Balanced Budget Requirements. Journal of Public Administration Research and Theory 20(3): 655-78. View Publication    Abstract    Both formal rules and informal norms guide government operations; formal rules often function through informal norms. Balanced budget requirements (BBRs) are formal rules, but they are implemented via the intermediary of informal norms\u2014interpretation of BBRs by state officials. This article examines the fiscal implications of informal norms that govern budgetary balance. We propose that informal norms have substantive implications in policy making and implementation. To test the proposition, we obtain state self-reported, time-varying data on balanced budget provisions as observations of informal norms, compare them against formal, codified balanced budget requirements from recent research to identify gaps between rules and norms, and decompose the gaps using two categories\u2014\u201cinterpretations\u201d and \u201creverse interpretations\u201d of formal balanced budget requirements. We then conduct probit estimation to obtain the effects of informal norms as well as the interpretations and reverse interpretations on two measures of budgetary balance. Results show that informal norms do affect outcomes of government financial operations; the two-step decomposition of the gaps between formal rules and informal norms provides further information on the locus of these effects. The article identifies the interpretation of formal rules as a new research area, thus contributing to the budgetary institutions and policy implementation literatures.       2008      Smith, Daniel L. 2008.  The Global Public Service: Taking on the Challenges of the 21st Century.  View Publication    Abstract    This paper's first goal is to evaluate the evolution and state of scholarship in public administration. It begins with a question: How far have public administration theory and research advanced since 1940, when the self-aware study of public administration, as a field if not a discipline, took root in the United States? This paper argues that scholars of public administration in the U.S. and abroad continuously advance the scientific rigor of research and are cognizant of the real-world challenges faced by policymakers and public servants of all sorts. Nonetheless, it is further argued, there remains room for improving our scientific understanding of the public service in the twenty-first century. Turning to practice, the second section identifies how we might better link our scientific findings to the lessons we provide in the classroom. Finally, the paper concludes with a discussion on preparing the public service of the twenty-first century and beyond to manage some of the considerable challenges it will encounter.       2007      Smith, Daniel L. 2007.

View Publication    Abstract    Studies of state fiscal and budgetary policies often use balanced budget requirements (BBRs) as explanatory variables. While current measures laid the crucial groundwork for a basic understanding of state BBRs, their lack of comprehensiveness threatens the validity of empirical work. Based on comprehensive legal research, this article offers a framework for analyzing state requirements: each state's BBRs form a coherent system for achieving budget balance through budget cycles; a fully developed BBR system offers a three-line construct against imbalance; and the more complete, developed, and explicit a BBR system is, the more stringent it will be in achieving budgetary balance.

The American Review of Public Administration 36(3): 301-22. View Publication    Abstract    Fiscal transparency and citizen participation in budgeting processes are widely promoted as means toward the ends of democratic accountability and responsiveness in the allocation and use of public funds. In the past decade, academics and practitioners enthusiastic about e-government have emphasized the potential for using information technology to enhance democratic governance. Putting these two streams of public administration theory and practice together, the authors developed criteria for assessing e-budgeting efforts and applied them to a sample of Web sites operated by state and local governments. Although practitioners are ahead of academics in exploring the potential of e-government for improving fiscal accountability and responsiveness, practice lags behind the relevant basic recommendations of the Government Finance Officers Association. This finding leads to research and practice agendas aimed at enhancing the use of e-government to enhance fiscal transparency and participation.

The following is a list of 25 questions  that I believe every valuation analyst has struggled with at some point in  time or the other and my answers to them. As the heading should make clear,  I do not believe that I have the final word on any of them. So feel free to  disagree, and let me know that you do. Maybe we can muddle through to the right  answer. Cheers!        Question    Answer        All valuations begin with an estimate   of free cashflow . The   free cashflow to the firm is computed to be:   After-tax    Operating Income     -   (Capital Expenditures - Depreciation)     -           Change in working capital     = FCFF     Netting out cashflows to and    from debt (subtract out interest and principal payments and add back  cash inflows from new debt) yields the free cashflow to equity (FCFE)           1.          Operating income is defined to be    revenues less operating expenses and should be before financial expenses    (interest expenses, for example) and capital expenses (which create    benefits over multiple periods). Specify at least two items that    currently affect operating income that fail this definitional test    and explain what you would do to adjust for their effects.     Answer         2.          Operating income     can be volatile both as a result of the normal ebb and flow of     business and as a result of accounting transactions (one time income     and expenses). Should you smooth or normalize operating income     and if so how do you do it?     Answer            3. In    computing the tax on the operating income, there are three choices    that you can use - effective tax rate (about 29% for the average    US company in 2003), marginal tax rate (35-40% for most US companies)   and actual taxes paid.      a. Which one would you choose?       b.          What happens        if you are a multinational and are in several countries    with very different tax rates?         c. What happens if you are reporting   an operating loss?        Answer         4.          Many companies     grow through acquisitions, some of which they pay for with cash     and some with stock. In computing capital expenditures, should     you include any of the acquisitions, only acquisitions funded with     cash or all acquisitions?     Answer        5.    Depreciation and amortization includes a number of different items.    Some of them are tax deductible (like conventional depreciation on    assets) but some are not (like amortization of goodwill). In computing    depreciation, should you include all depreciation and amortization    or only tax-deductible depreciation and amortization?       Answer        6.    The conventional accounting definition of working capital is current    assets minus current liabilities and includes cash and marketable securities    in current assets and short term debt in current liabilities.      a.        Should you consider   all cash, operating cash or no cash at all when you compute working capital?    b. Should you consider short term  debt as part of current liabilities?    Answer        Estimating growth is   where your valuation and guessing skills come most into play. While you   can estimate growth by looking at the past or at what analysts are forecasting,  you should consider the fundamentals.         7.    Most of us have seen the equations for sustainable growth. In particular,    the growth in earnings per share = (1 - payout ratio) * Return on    equity.     a.          Can you use the    same equation to compute growth in operating income?      b.             Under what assumptions    will this sustainable growth rate also be equal to your expected    growth rate?      c. Increasing the amount you reinvest back    into the business (reduce the payout ratio or increase the reinvestment    rate) will increase the growth rate for any company that is prfitable.    Will it also increase value?      Answer        8. How    long can high growth last?    Answer        Now let's consider the big enchilada - terminal    value - at the end of the high growth phase. There are three    ways in which terminal value can be estimated - liquidation value for    the assets, a multiple of earnings or revenues in the terminal year    or by assuming that cashflows grow at a constant rate forever after  your terminal year.            9. How do   you decide which approach to use to estimate terminal value?    Answer        10.        Assuming that you use the perpetual growth model, can the stable growth   rate be negative?     Answer        11.        What effect will increasing the growth rate in perpetuity have on terminal   value?    Answer        Moving below the line, let us talk about the discount    rate to use in valuation. If the cashflows being discounted    are cashflows to the firm, the discount rate is a weighted average    of the cost of equity and the cost of debt, weighted by the market  values of each component.         12.        Debt can be defined in many ways - total liabilities, total debt or long   term debt. What would you include in debt?    Answer         13.          Why do we use     market value weights to come up with a cost of capital instead     of book value weights?     Answer        14.    In private businesses, neither debt nor equity is traded. In most publicly    traded firms, equity has a market value but a significant portion (or    often all) of the debt is not publicly traded.    a.          How do you get    market value of debt when all or even some of your firm's debt is    bank debt and not publicly traded? How would you compute an updated    cost of debt for an unrated company with bank debt?     b.          How do you      get a market value of equity for a private business?      Answer         15.          Can the weights     change from year to year in computing the cost of capital?     Answer         16.          There are a number     of different risk and return models in finance used to compute     the cost of equity but they all assume that the marginal investor     is well diversified. If you use these models to estimate costs     of equity for private or closely held firms, are you likely to     under or over estimate the cost of equity? How would you fix the     bias?     Answer         17.          Multinationals     now operate and trade in different markets and different currencies.     Which riskfree rate should you use to value a company (Nestle,     for instance)?     Answer         18.          Most analysts     estimate risk premiums by looking at historical data in the United     States. What are the perils of historical premiums?     Answer        19.    Increasingly, we are called upon to value companies in emerging markets    in Asia and Latin America and we have to estimate risk premiums there.      a. Should   there be an additional country risk premium for investing in a Brazilian   or a Chinese company?        b.          If yes, how would    you go about estimating it?      c.          Once you estimate    the country risk premium, should the same premium be added on for all    companies in that country? If you don't think so, how would you go    about estimating a company's exposure to country risk?          Answer        Getting from the DCF value to the value of equity   can be a messy process. You have to consider what you have not valued  yet and what other claims there might be on the equity of a firm.        20.          An alternate approach to discounted   cashflow valuation is the adjusted present value approach, where you   value the firm with no debt (unlevered firm) first and then consider   the value effects of debt. What is the fundamental difference between   the cost of capital approach and the APV approach and why might they   give you different answers?      Answer         21.          Discounted cashflow     valuations are usually based upon the assumption that your firm     will survive as a going concern. If you are valuing a young firm     or a distressed firm where there is a significant likelihood that     the firm will not make it as a going concern, how do you reflect     that in your valuation?
