The multi-user facilities are   operated and maintained by skilled technicians and staff scientists,   who train new users, develop user communities, maintain and upgrade   equipment, develop new characterization methods and applications, and   develop user fee schedules to cover the cost of laboratory operations   and equipment maintenance according to University and Federal   guidelines. These facilities are available to NYU investigators as well   as external academic scientists and the industrial sector. In most cases   time can be reserved through the internet and data collection with   certain equipment can be monitored remotely. Moreover, users of shared   facilities will be encouraged to contribute up-to-date information,   helpful tips, and useful protocols to facility sites in a \"Wiki\" format,   based on the engine that drives Wikipedia. Wiki content includes   details on equipment operation, sample preparation, useful links,   on-line manuals, vendors for equipment and expendable supplies, and   safety information. Overall, the facilities are operated under the   premise that they naturally create an environment for stimulating   collaborative interactions among individuals from numerous sectors.                           Existing facilities        MRSEC investigators share access to the newly created CSMR and MDI laboratories    (totaling 30,000 sq. ft.), which contain (i) a Malvern Mastersizer S   and a Malvern Zetasizer Nano ZS for characterizing colloidal particles,   (ii) rheometers for measuring complex fluids viscoelastic properties,   (iii) optical micromanipulation capabilities provided by three   state-of-the-art dynamic holographic optical trapping systems, including   a turnkey BioRyx 200 System, (iv) fast-scan confocal, deconvolution,   bright-field, dark-field, DIC and holographic contrast microscopes, (v)   ultra-small-angle static and dynamic light scattering, as well as   variable angle light scattering, (vi) UV-VIS and infrared spectrometers,   including ATR and Seagull external multi-angle reflection accessories,   (vii) microcalorimeters, (viii) five atomic force microscopes with three   configured especially for single molecule force spectroscopy, (ix)   optical microscopes with a temperature-controlled stages, (x)   Langmuir-Blodgett troughs, (xi) a differential scanning calorimeter,   (xiv) gel permeation chromatography, (xiii) gas chromatographs,   including one for chiral separations, and (iv) the \u201celectric bottle\u201d   microscope invented by Chaikin (see IRG 1).

Regional facilities        The MRSEC also benefits from its partnership in the New York Structural Biology Center ,   which houses state-of-the-art high-field NMR spectrometers and cryo-TEM   microscopes, the latter particularly germane to the MRSEC research   program. The NYSBC is equipped with (i) a JEOL 3200FSC cryoelectron   microscope, (ii) a JEOL 2100F cryoelectron microscope, (iii) a Tecnai G2   F20 cryoelectron microscope, and (iv) a JEOL 1230 electron microscope.   The TEM facility is directed by Dr. David Stokes (NYU Skirball   Institute) and is operated by expert staff members. The facility   provides training and hands-on access to registered research   investigators. The MRSEC also benefits from its proximity with   nanofabrication facilities at IBM, and the scattering capabilities at Brookhaven National Laboratory .                      National Laboratory Facilities        Through its connection with CINT at Sandia (see the Industrial Partnerships Page ),   the NYU MRSEC has the opportunity to capitalize on state-of-the-art   capabilities housed in approximately 100,000 sq ft of clean room space, a   state-of-the-art CMOS microelectronics foundry, e-beam writing, a   focused ion beam, ion implanters, and high-resolution transmission   electron microscopy. The CINT Core Facility offers capabilities of   particular utility to the research program in this proposal, including   low vibration sites for sensitive characterization, chemical/biological   synthesis labs, and a fully equipped clean room for device integration.   CINT also provides access to nanomaterials and microfabrication   facilities through the existing Integrated Materials Research Laboratory   (IMRL) at Sandia, and the CINT Gateway to Los Alamos provides   additional support in biosciences and nanomaterials.              CINT also provides a conduit to neutron scattering   at the Los Alamos Neutron Science Center (LANSCE), and high magnetic   field techniques at the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory (NHMFL).   In addition, several MRSEC investigators are members of the Brookhaven   user community as well as the Stanford Synchrotron Research Laboratory   (SSRL) user group.                       Anticipated MRSEC acquisitions        MRSEC funds in Year 1 will be used to acquire a 3-D   printer for fabricating solid objects (e.g. photonic quasicrystals) and a   mask aligner. A confocal microscope will be purchased in Year 2. The   Executive Committee will determine acquisitions in successive years.
