He has written numerous books and articles about the history of Eastern Europe, and his most well-known work, Inventing Eastern Europe (1994), posed the question of how people first came to think of Europe divided into an East and a West, and the ways in which that distinction was constructed and artificial rather than natural or inherent. He was also one of the first scholars, after the end of the Cold War, to draw attention to the imbalance in the way that the history of Europe was being presented in American education, at every level from grade school to graduate school (see \u201cTeaching \u2018Eastern Europe\u2019 without the Iron Curtain,\u201d in the AHA Perspectives, January 1993). Now twenty years after the fall of the Iron Curtain, and especially after the European Union expansions of 2004 and 2007, we are all still rethinking European history in search of more comprehensive understanding that encompasses the full breadth of the continent. For that reason a summer seminar on this subject would be not only intellectually challenging and interesting, but also pedagogically useful for teaching European history and European studies at every educational level.    We will take advantage of the great number of diversely engaged scholars in New York to invite several visitors for the enhancement of our seminar. With our guest presentations we hope to give participants a sense of how scholars are attempting to integrate Eastern Europe and Western Europe in their academic work.    During the first week we will invite Professor Stefanos Geroulanos of the NYU history department to make a short presentation. Professor Geroulanos will focus on issues of twentieth-century philosophy and how their elaboration has bound together East and West in Europe. His field of expertise is the history of European philosophy in the twentieth century, and he considers how philosophical ideas circulated and developed across the European continent with particular emphasis on French intellectual history. He is the author of An Atheism that Is Not Humanist Emerges in French Thought, published by Stanford University Press in 2010.    During the second week we will have, as a visitor, Professor Michael Beckerman of the music department at NYU. Professor Beckerman will speak about Czech classical music in relation to European music as a whole. A widely published scholar and music critic, Professor Beckerman is the author of New Worlds of Dvorak: Searching in America for the Composer\u2019s Inner Life, published by Norton in 2003.    During the third week of the seminar we will have, as our visitor, Professor Emily Greble of the history department at the City University of New York. Professor Greble will speak about the city of Sarajevo and the nature of multi-religious urban society\u2014 the encounter between Islam and Christianity\u2014 in Eastern Europe. Professor Greble is the author of the book Sarajevo 1941-1945: Muslims, Christians, and Jews in Hitler\u2019s Europe, published by Cornell University Press in 2011.
