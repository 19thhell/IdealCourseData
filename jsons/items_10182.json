I am currently working on a book entitled \"Deep Refrains: Sound and Music Beyond the Linguistic Turn.\" It narrates a history of six themes in twentieth-century musical thought: 1) tones 2) constellations 3) inconsistencies 4) rhythm 5) vocality 6) recollections and teleologies. The project is based in a revision of my dissertation that compared diverging habits of speculative thought among the musically-minded figures of continental philosophy (Bloch, Adorno, Jank\u00e9l\u00e9vitch, and Deleuze). I am also interested in formalism, modernism, and critical thought in musical practices that do not make use of traditional notation. In this vein, my second book will focus on vernacular practices of experimentation across semi-literate, popular, and electronically-minded musical practices since WWII. As a musician I have worked in a variety of genres from new music and free improvisation to rock and electronic dance music. In 2010, I began working with Sierra Leonean singer Janka Nabay, and collaborated with him on a full length album that was released by David Byrne's label Luaka Bop in 2012.
