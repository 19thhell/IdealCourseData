Yet distinct assumptions, work styles, and disciplinary backgrounds of actors in each domain make collaborative work difficult, particularly when leaders do not have the skills and competencies to connect in ways that bridge the gap. Incorporating literature, cases, guest speakers and problem-based learning exercises, the course offers a structure for sustained cycles of dialogue around examples of formal collaborations between the public, nonprofit and private sectors from several countries around the world. The course encourages students to consider the assumptions of stakeholders from each sector, to clarify and challenge their own assumptions and to explore the opportunities and challenges associated with cross-sector collaboration through the lens of evidence-based knowledge of this phenomenon.
