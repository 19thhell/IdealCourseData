It is driven by a passion for discovering previously unseen connections between premodern and postmodern thinking, both conscious and unconscious, and the conflicts and desires that help to shape it. Increasingly I have also become interested in how the Middle Ages are literally in the middle between antique culture and that of modernity. I have written on courtly literature as poised between antique logic and the logic of psychoanalysis, and on didactic poetry as illuminated both by scholastic views of universality and singularity, and by their postmodern re-articulations. My current work on medieval bestiaries is inspired equally by contemporary animal studies and by antique and medieval natural philosophy. At the heart of my inquiry is the material reality of the parchment pages on which almost all bestiaries were copied. Made from animal skin, parchment closely resembles human skin, and this ambiguity both affects the meaning of texts in which humans are invited to learn from other animals, and interferes in the experience of reading them.

FREN-UA 865 (conducted in English )                  Topics in French Culture: Haiti -- History, Society and Culture Prof. J. Michael Dash TR, 2:00pm \u2013 3:15pm Silver 508 #11594 The   past two hundred years have taken Haiti from pariah state to failed   state. Haiti is loved or despised because it is seen as absolutely   different. Haiti is indeed different but its difference is historical   and not inherent. Its revolutionary origins so challenged the prejudices   of its time that Haiti has been conspicuously consigned to the margins   of modern history. This course is an introduction to key issues in   Haitian society, history and culture and provides an overview of the   political changes that have made a relatively isolated, national culture   increasingly diasporic and transnational.

CROSS-LISTED COURSES  FREN-UA 868.002 (discussion conducted in English) Topics in French Literature: Arthur Rimbaud Prof. Kristin Ross T, 11:00am \u2013 1:00pm 19 University Place, room 305 #19847 A   seminar sponsored by the Department of Comparative Literature devoted   to the poetry, cultural, and political context of Arthur Rimbaud.   Students must have some reading knowledge of French (there will surely   be differing levels of familiarity with French in the group) and a good   French dictionary.

FREN-UA 868.003 (course sponsored by the Medieval &amp; Renaissance Center) Topics in French Literature: The Image and Role of Gawain in Medieval Arthurian Romance Prof. Jessica Quinlan TR 2:05pm \u2013 3:15pm 244 Greene St., room 306 #23890 We   may know him as Gauvain, Gawan, Gawain, Walewein or Calvano; the brave   and gallant nephew of King Arthur is a constant in Arthurian romance   throughout Medieval Europe. In the verse tradition, Gawain is   immediately recognizable by virtue of his loyalty to the needs of the   Arthurian court and an endearing weakness for the fair sex. He is also   often associated with a certain reluctance to engage in adventure,   however, a quality undoubtedly linked to his role in the earlier   romances as second fiddle to a hero who will ultimately succeed in   transcending the Arthurian realm. These fundamental traits give rise to   deliberation regarding the concept of the perfect knight and to no end   of comic variation on the fate of the eternal bachelor, but they also   prompt narrative experimentation on the profile and tasks of the primary   hero \u2013 a series of considerations which could perhaps be said to   culminate in the Middle English Sir Gawain and the Green Knight with the   question of the role of human weakness as a constitutive feature of   heroism. All the while, however, the prose tradition develops the flower   of chivalric perfection in a completely different direction,   exasperating Gawain\u2019s limitations to the point of depicting him as a   ruthlessly vengeful knight who willfully abandons Christian morals. The   primary reading for this course will draw on a number of literary   traditions to trace the development of a character central to Arthurian   romance from a pan-European perspective.
