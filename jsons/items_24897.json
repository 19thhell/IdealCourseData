Office Address:   Puck Building, Room 4144, 295 Lafayette Street New York, NY 10012   Office Hours:   By Appointment   Email:     manza@nyu.edu     Phone:   (212) 998-8935         Areas of Research/Interest:   Social inequality, political sociology, and public policy.     Research Description:   Jeff Manza (Ph.D University of California \u2013 Berkeley, 1995) is Professor of Sociology, and the former Chair (2009-12) of the Department of Sociology at New York University. Before coming to NYU, he taught at Penn State (1996-98) and Northwestern (1998-2007). His teaching and research interests lay at the intersection of inequality, political sociology, and public policy. His research has examined how different types of social identities and inequalities influence political processes such as voting behavior, partisanship, and public opinion (at both the macro and micro level). In collaboration with Christopher Uggen, he has been involved in a long-term project that has examined the causes and consequences of felon disenfranchisement in the United States; their book Locked Out: Felon Disenfranchisement and American Democracy (Oxford University Press 2006) is the standard work on the topic. Manza is the co-author of three books with Clem Brooks (of Indiana University): Social Cleavages and Political Change (Oxford University Press, 1999), a study of the changing social demography of the American electorate and its partisan consequences; an analysis of the comparative impact of public opinion on welfare state effort in the OECD democracies entitled Why Welfare States Persist (University of Chicago Press, 2007); and most recently Whose Rights?: Counterterrorism and the Dark Side of American Public Opinion (Russell Sage Foundation Press, 2013), an examination of the sources and persistence of public support for harsh counterterrorism policies that highlights the role of American national identity in shaping individual attitudes. In addition to his books, Manza\u2019s work has appeared in numerous scientific journals in several disciplines, including the American Sociological Review , the American Journal of Sociology, Social Forces, Sociological Theory, Public Opinion Quarterly, and the Journal of Politics , as well as newspapers and general interest magazines. He is currently completing a book (with Clem Brooks) that interrogates the surprisingly limited impact of rising inequality on the attitudes and policy preferences of Americans, and they are also working on a series of papers drawing from survey experiments they designed and implemented to better understand the role of national identity in shaping attitudes towards racial and ethnic outgroups.       In addition to scholarship and teaching, Manza has served in a variety of administrative posts. Before coming to NYU, he served as the Associate Director and Acting Director of the Institute for Policy Research at Northwestern University, a major social science and policy research center at that institution. At NYU, he chaired the Department of Sociology from 2009 to 2012. During this time, he helped make a number of major faculty appointments, created a new MA program in Applied Quantitative Research (which will begin in the fall of 2013), and led the Department through an extensive curricular reform of the graduate program after a review of the best practices elsewhere. His most ambitious administrative project to date, however, was to launch The Sociology Project: An Introduction to the Sociological Imagination (Pearson 2012), and The Sociology Project 2.0 (Pearson 2015), a unique joint venture of the Department which seeks to develop a new model for the introductory textbook, with individual chapters authored by a faculty member who teaches and writes on that topic. The book is also unique in that profits will be reinvested in the graduate and undergraduate sociology programs at NYU.

Research Description:   Jeff Manza (Ph.D University of California \u2013 Berkeley, 1995) is Professor of Sociology, and the former Chair (2009-12) of the Department of Sociology at New York University. Before coming to NYU, he taught at Penn State (1996-98) and Northwestern (1998-2007). His teaching and research interests lay at the intersection of inequality, political sociology, and public policy. His research has examined how different types of social identities and inequalities influence political processes such as voting behavior, partisanship, and public opinion (at both the macro and micro level). In collaboration with Christopher Uggen, he has been involved in a long-term project that has examined the causes and consequences of felon disenfranchisement in the United States; their book Locked Out: Felon Disenfranchisement and American Democracy (Oxford University Press 2006) is the standard work on the topic. Manza is the co-author of three books with Clem Brooks (of Indiana University): Social Cleavages and Political Change (Oxford University Press, 1999), a study of the changing social demography of the American electorate and its partisan consequences; an analysis of the comparative impact of public opinion on welfare state effort in the OECD democracies entitled Why Welfare States Persist (University of Chicago Press, 2007); and most recently Whose Rights?: Counterterrorism and the Dark Side of American Public Opinion (Russell Sage Foundation Press, 2013), an examination of the sources and persistence of public support for harsh counterterrorism policies that highlights the role of American national identity in shaping individual attitudes. In addition to his books, Manza\u2019s work has appeared in numerous scientific journals in several disciplines, including the American Sociological Review , the American Journal of Sociology, Social Forces, Sociological Theory, Public Opinion Quarterly, and the Journal of Politics , as well as newspapers and general interest magazines. He is currently completing a book (with Clem Brooks) that interrogates the surprisingly limited impact of rising inequality on the attitudes and policy preferences of Americans, and they are also working on a series of papers drawing from survey experiments they designed and implemented to better understand the role of national identity in shaping attitudes towards racial and ethnic outgroups.       In addition to scholarship and teaching, Manza has served in a variety of administrative posts. Before coming to NYU, he served as the Associate Director and Acting Director of the Institute for Policy Research at Northwestern University, a major social science and policy research center at that institution. At NYU, he chaired the Department of Sociology from 2009 to 2012. During this time, he helped make a number of major faculty appointments, created a new MA program in Applied Quantitative Research (which will begin in the fall of 2013), and led the Department through an extensive curricular reform of the graduate program after a review of the best practices elsewhere. His most ambitious administrative project to date, however, was to launch The Sociology Project: An Introduction to the Sociological Imagination (Pearson 2012), and The Sociology Project 2.0 (Pearson 2015), a unique joint venture of the Department which seeks to develop a new model for the introductory textbook, with individual chapters authored by a faculty member who teaches and writes on that topic. The book is also unique in that profits will be reinvested in the graduate and undergraduate sociology programs at NYU.
