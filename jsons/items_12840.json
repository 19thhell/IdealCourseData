Introduction   The Legislative and Regulatory Process Clinic is designed to introduce students to the roles and skills of the government lawyer. The clinic will provide practical experience with how lawyers support the development and implementation of public policy by assisting in defining the available options and identifying and resolving issues before they become the subject of legal contention or litigation. It will emphasize what lawyers do and what they need to know in the policy arena in order to provide effective legal counsel, sharpening such skills as analysis, writing, advocacy and problem solving. The clinic will provide an understanding of government decision-making that will be important for those students intending to seek positions in the government and it will offer those heading to the private sector greater insight into the workings of government that often significantly affect their clients. While the focus will be in Washington, DC, and hence the federal government, both the processes and the skills required are readily transferable to state or local government decision-making.   Course Description   Fieldwork   Each student will work five days a week in a federal agency or congressional office. The objective is to provide hands-on experience with how governmental entities approach policy issues, including determining the appropriate response to an issue via various possible administrative actions (e.g., rule-making, adjudication, negotiation, interpretation, policy statements, enforcement, or drafting legislation); compiling an adequate record to support the selected action; evaluating private interest advocacy in influencing decisions; and analyzing and assisting in shaping the competing strategies to achieve the desired objectives. Within federal agencies, placements will generally be in the Office of General Counsel of regulatory agencies or related positions; congressional placements will generally be in leadership offices, with committee staffs or non-partisan congressional agencies. Every effort will be made to assure placements that provide students with solid substantive work and adequate supervision. Placements will be dependent in part on a student\u2019s experiences and interests.   Seminar   On one day/evening a week, there will be a three-hour seminar that will provide an understanding of how the political institutions (Congress and the Executive Branch) work, and the roles and obligations of lawyers in influencing that process. For up to one hour of each class, one or more students will discuss (subject to confidentiality concerns) their experiences in their fieldwork, especially the governmental processes in which the students are participating and the government actors with whom they are interacting. In the remaining time, we will cover over the semester: the scope of Congress\u2019 constitutional authority; the Senate and House leadership and committee structure(s) and their powers; how a bill becomes a law, including the role of hearings and mark-ups, conference committees, and the development of statements of administration policy; the budget process, including the preparation of the President\u2019s budget by the Office of Management and Budget and Congress\u2019 review and enactment of the budget, with its work on appropriations, continuing resolutions and omnibus bills, as well as tax legislation; congressional oversight and the Executive Branch response, including the exercise of investigative powers and claims of executive and other privileges; and ethics (professional responsibility), including issues unique to government lawyers; and, more generally, the issues of the role of private interests as examined through direct and grassroots lobbying, recurring issues of conflict of interest, and campaign financing. There will also be occasional extended (several hours) working sessions with government officials as guest lecturers on a subject of current interest or controversy. In addition, each student will be expected to produce a serious research/analytical paper, with a minimum length of 35 pages, on a subject approved by the seminar professor(s) that focuses on the legislative and regulatory process, or on an issue with which government lawyers are currently grappling. The paper will be due no later than the beginning of Spring Break of the semester following the clinic.   Application Procedure   Students interested in applying for the clinic should submit the standard application, resume, and transcript online through CAMS by 5:00 PM on Monday, February 2, 2015. Members of the Fall 2014 LRP Clinic will host an information session about the clinic on January 29, 2015, from 6:00-7:30 PM in FH 608. Preference will be given to those with 2L courses in advanced administrative law (either process \u2013 e.g., advanced administrative law -- or substance \u2013 e.g., environmental law) and demonstrated motivation to engage in the work of the agencies or Congress. If a student has taken a year-long clinic in his or her second year of law school and has already received 6 credits of fieldwork, then 2 of the fieldwork credits from this clinic will not count toward graduation because 12 is the maximum number of fieldwork credits that can be counted toward graduation. The application process includes at least one interview with the Professors. Interviews will be conducted on select days between February 5-11, 2015, and notifications will be made by February 17, 2015. Note that students who are offered and accept a position in the Fall 2015 LRP Clinic will not be eligible to apply for additional clinics offered in the 2015-16 academic year. If you have questions regarding the application procedure, please contact Susan Hodges or Sally Katzen .     * 14 credits includes 8 clinical (fieldwork) credits and 6 academic seminar credits for the semester.

Introduction   The Legislative and Regulatory Process Clinic is designed to introduce students to the roles and skills of the government lawyer. The clinic will provide practical experience with how lawyers support the development and implementation of public policy by assisting in defining the available options and identifying and resolving issues before they become the subject of legal contention or litigation. It will emphasize what lawyers do and what they need to know in the policy arena in order to provide effective legal counsel, sharpening such skills as analysis, writing, advocacy and problem solving. The clinic will provide an understanding of government decision-making that will be important for those students intending to seek positions in the government and it will offer those heading to the private sector greater insight into the workings of government that often significantly affect their clients. While the focus will be in Washington, DC, and hence the federal government, both the processes and the skills required are readily transferable to state or local government decision-making.   Course Description   Fieldwork   Each student will work five days a week in a federal agency or congressional office. The objective is to provide hands-on experience with how governmental entities approach policy issues, including determining the appropriate response to an issue via various possible administrative actions (e.g., rule-making, adjudication, negotiation, interpretation, policy statements, enforcement, or drafting legislation); compiling an adequate record to support the selected action; evaluating private interest advocacy in influencing decisions; and analyzing and assisting in shaping the competing strategies to achieve the desired objectives. Within federal agencies, placements will generally be in the Office of General Counsel of regulatory agencies or related positions; congressional placements will generally be in leadership offices, with committee staffs or non-partisan congressional agencies. Every effort will be made to assure placements that provide students with solid substantive work and adequate supervision. Placements will be dependent in part on a student\u2019s experiences and interests.   Seminar   On one day/evening a week, there will be a three-hour seminar that will provide an understanding of how the political institutions (Congress and the Executive Branch) work, and the roles and obligations of lawyers in influencing that process. For up to one hour of each class, one or more students will discuss (subject to confidentiality concerns) their experiences in their fieldwork, especially the governmental processes in which the students are participating and the government actors with whom they are interacting. In the remaining time, we will cover over the semester: the scope of Congress\u2019 constitutional authority; the Senate and House leadership and committee structure(s) and their powers; how a bill becomes a law, including the role of hearings and mark-ups, conference committees, and the development of statements of administration policy; the budget process, including the preparation of the President\u2019s budget by the Office of Management and Budget and Congress\u2019 review and enactment of the budget, with its work on appropriations, continuing resolutions and omnibus bills, as well as tax legislation; congressional oversight and the Executive Branch response, including the exercise of investigative powers and claims of executive and other privileges; and ethics (professional responsibility), including issues unique to government lawyers; and, more generally, the issues of the role of private interests as examined through direct and grassroots lobbying, recurring issues of conflict of interest, and campaign financing. There will also be occasional extended (several hours) working sessions with government officials as guest lecturers on a subject of current interest or controversy. In addition, each student will be expected to produce a serious research/analytical paper, with a minimum length of 35 pages, on a subject approved by the seminar professor(s) that focuses on the legislative and regulatory process, or on an issue with which government lawyers are currently grappling. The paper will be due no later than the beginning of Spring Break of the semester following the clinic.   Application Procedure   Students interested in applying for the clinic should submit the standard application, resume, and transcript online through CAMS by 5:00 PM on Monday, February 2, 2015. Members of the Fall 2014 LRP Clinic will host an information session about the clinic on January 29, 2015, from 6:00-7:30 PM in FH 608. Preference will be given to those with 2L courses in advanced administrative law (either process \u2013 e.g., advanced administrative law -- or substance \u2013 e.g., environmental law) and demonstrated motivation to engage in the work of the agencies or Congress. If a student has taken a year-long clinic in his or her second year of law school and has already received 6 credits of fieldwork, then 2 of the fieldwork credits from this clinic will not count toward graduation because 12 is the maximum number of fieldwork credits that can be counted toward graduation. The application process includes at least one interview with the Professors. Interviews will be conducted on select days between February 5-11, 2015, and notifications will be made by February 17, 2015. Note that students who are offered and accept a position in the Fall 2015 LRP Clinic will not be eligible to apply for additional clinics offered in the 2015-16 academic year. If you have questions regarding the application procedure, please contact Susan Hodges or Sally Katzen .     * 14 credits includes 8 clinical (fieldwork) credits and 6 academic seminar credits for the semester.

Introduction   The Legal Ethics Bureau at New York University School of Law will assist in investigating, researching and drafting for the Grievance Committee for the Southern District of New York, submit amicus briefs to high courts in a variety of public interest contexts, draft ethics opinions, and counsel lawyers in public interest matters on ethical issues. Emphasis will be on practical skills training, as described below .    Fieldwork   Students will work with the clinic director and with (i) the Grievance Committee of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, (ii) public interest lawyers in non-profit organizations and in law firms, and (iii) members of professional and judicial ethics committees. Assignments will involve investigating, researching and drafting opinions for grievance committee matters, and drafting amicus briefs to high courts, drafting ethics rules and opinions, and counseling lawyers. Emphasis throughout will be on practical skills training, including written and oral presentations.     Fieldwork projects will include: (a) researching and drafting amicus briefs to high courts --- including the U.S. Supreme Court if an appropriate case arises; (b) assisting the Grievance Committee for the Southern District of New York; (c) working with bar committees on ethics opinions and proposed changes to the rules governing lawyers and judges, and (d) counseling pro bono lawyers in law firms, non-profits, and NYU\u2019s own clinics. Committees that students will assist may include the Grievance Committee for the Southern District of New York, the ABA Standing Committee on Ethics and Professional Responsibility, the City Bar Professional and Judicial Ethics Committee, and the NYS Committee on Standards of Attorney Conduct. Students may meet with these committees and make presentations to them in connection with the fieldwork.     From time to time, the clinic will prepare amicus briefs in the Supreme Court or other high courts in conjunction with pro bono lawyers on significant questions of professional responsibility. In the clinic\u2019s first year, working with pro bono lawyers at a major law firm, students prepared an amicus brief to the New York Court of Appeals. The amicus brief argued the impropriety of prosecutorial questioning of unrepresented indigent persons while they are in custody and immediately before arraignment and appointment of counsel. Students also drafted an opinion on prosecutorial ethics for the American Bar Association\u2019s Standing Committee on Ethics and Professional Responsibility. Students attended the meeting where their draft was discussed (by conference call). The students\u2019 work was incorporated into ABA Formal Opinion 467, which became the catalyst for a webinar to be broadcast nationally in March 2015.   Seminar   Students will participate in a 2-hour seminar once each week. Using selected readings on professional responsibility and on leadership, current events, and peer critiques, students will discuss issues in professional responsibility that confront public interest lawyers and law firms and issues that arise in our fieldwork. Enrollment in the Legal Ethics Bureau for a semester will satisfy the professional responsibility requirement.   Application Procedure   Students should submit an application, resume, writing sample, and transcript online through CAMS. To arrange an interview, please use the CAMS system as well. If you have questions regarding the application procedure or the work of the clinic, please contact Adjunct Professor Barbara S. Gillers at barbara.gillers@nyu.edu or 212-992-7364.   The Legal Ethics Bureau also welcomes LL.M. enrollments, but does not specifically reserve space for them. The application period for LL.M. students is July 1-15, 2015. (Please note there is a separate application form for LL.M. students.)
