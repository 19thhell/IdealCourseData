We will begin with the problem of \"life-having,\" defined both in terms of private property (Lockean possessive individualism) and intersubjective, transhistorical relationality (telepathy, animism, elective affinities). Another topic: the challenge to individual authorship posed by writing collectives and joint or anonymously authored texts (as in, \u201cGuattareuze\u201d or the Italian collective Wu Hung's Manituana). The curatorial techniques of archiving and narrating a free-standing person or singular subject will be examined through its media: papers, photographs, recordings, film and video, testaments, hoarded possessions, bequests, legal obstacles to archival access posed by estate executors. We will analyze cases in which the border between \u201cwork\u201d and \u201clife\u201d is especially blurry. Through a reading of Barthes's seminar on La Pr\u00e9paration du roman, we will consider experiments with biographical form (including recent \"biographies\" of non-real persons [Job], genres [biography of a translation] or cities [Jerusalem]. Other topics may include: conceptual art and literature that deal with fake or what-if biography; the problems faced by archives in-the-making at IMEC, BNF, UC-Irvine, Fales etc. (Foucault, Derrida, Glissant); and finally, the way in which recent critical media theory (Samuel Weber, B\u00e9atrice Jongy) has analyzed posthumous life on internet domains and the transformation of the biographical medium. In their research projects for the course, students will be encouraged to experiment with the practice of critical archiving or new ways of writing biography.  Revisiting the Western Classics: Old Materialisms\u2014Matter and Gender in Classical Antiquity  Bianchi In the face of the rising popularity of \u201cnew materialisms\u201d in recent years, it is important to remember that the notion of \u201cmatter\u201d itself arose in a specific historical context in classical antiquity. Matter, from the Latin \u2018materia\u2019 (related to mater, mother) itself emerged from Aristotle\u2019s Greek innovation hul\u00ea (literally, wood). In this class we will undertake close readings of key ancient texts, including Plato\u2019s Timaeus, Aristotle\u2019s Physics, Metaphysics, and Generation of Animals, and Lucretius\u2019 De Rerum Natura, tracing the emergence of discourses of materiality alongside and in concert with tropes of sex and gender. To assist us in this endeavor we will draw on continental feminist readings including those of Kristeva, Irigaray, Butler, and Grosz, as well as critically engaging Bachofen\u2019s 19th century conception of Mutterrecht. Some background knowledge of psychoanalytic theory is advised as is knowledge of Greek, however all readings will be in translation. Special Topics in Theory: The Nature of Image  Iampolski This graduate course is designed as a questioning of the nature of the image and its role in human society and culture. We will start with the problem of appearance and expression in animals. In particular, we will use the work of Adolf Portmann and focus on skin and surfaces. We will finish our exploration with modern technologies, screens and interfaces (I am particularly interested in the work of Bill Viola). Two approaches will be explored: the first one is anthropological and the second is a phenomenological approach to image (Sartre, Merleau-Ponty and less know modern phenomenologists). We will use phenomenology to discuss film and newer technologies. The course hopefully will bring to discussion some little known theorists like Gustave Guillaume who claims that language is a spacialization of time and of the unrepresentable, i.e. creation of images. I am also interested in Gilbert Simondon\u2019s little known work on image and imagination. Topics in African Literature: The African Novel Sanders How has the novel evolved in Africa? How have African writers adapted and elaborated this literary form in response to specific African aesthetic, linguistic, ethical and political questions and imperatives? Tracing critical debates on African fiction, we will read classic texts of the post-independence period, by Achebe, Head and others, as well as more recent writing by Kourouma, Diop, and Mpe. Topics in Italian Literature: The Ethics of Pastoral  Tylus &amp; Wofford A team-taught seminar that will focus on some of the critical questions \u2013 aesthetic, ethical, mimetic - generated by pastoral, a literary form that has shown surprising resilience since its \"origins\" in Biblical texts and Theocritus\u2019s Idylls. Among the problems we\u2019ll be puzzling over: to what extent does the poet have the right to speak for the shepherd or peasant \u2013 those who \"cannot represent themselves\"? How does the space of the idyll or pastoral retreat come to mirror the space of literature itself? Why does early modernity engage with pastoral in so many forms \u2013 dramatic, poetic, the novel, painting, etc. \u2013 and what is the lasting legacy of that engagement? The course will also explore the role of the gods in pastoral, from erotic epiphanies to the invisible power of the transcendent. We will ask why the rural gods are so prominent from the earliest periods on in both pastoral poetry and performance. Do the gods lend authority to an alternative stance or social reality, or do they implicitly endorse a traditionalist ideology that sustains the authority of monarch and social order? Other concerns will include the pastoral topics of elegaic loss, erotic lament, the tension between exile and \"otium,\" and the presence of death in the pastoral arcadia. Profs. Wofford and Tylus will move from antiquity (Theocritus, Virgil) to contemporary versions of pastoral (Brokeback Mountain and Jerusalem), with special attention to early modern English, Italian, and Spanish works (Shakespeare, Spenser, Cervantes, Tasso, Andreini, among others). We will also consider the critical tradition that has taken up pastoral as a model for critical and ethical inquiry (William Empson, Harry Berger, John Berger, Gayatri Spivak, Erwin Panofsky, Paul Alpers).  Culture &amp; Critique: Documents and Documentary Modes in Literature, Film and Visual Culture  Vatulescu This course will explore representative works from key moments in the evolution of documentary\u2014the beginnings of the newsreel, literatura fakta, Soviet and Nazi propaganda, American depression documentary books, the cin\u00e9ma-v\u00e9rit\u00e9 movement, and the rise of autobiographical/personal documentary films. What accounts for the waxing and waning of the documentary through time, as evident in its recent popularity in American culture? What is the relationship between documentary modes and particular media and technologies\u2014print, photography, cinema, video, and digital? Other topics include the role of the artist, indexicality and representation, literature as historical document, \u201cfiction in the archives,\u201d false documents and forgery, collage, illustration, and other uses of the document in twentieth century art. Critical and theoretical readings by Eric Barnouw, Roland Barthes, Stella Bruzzi, Jane Gaines, Jacques Derrida, Giorgio Agamben, Barbara Johnson, Bill Nichols, Philip Rosen, Vivian Sobchack, Susan Sontag, Jacques Ranci\u00e8re, Edward Said, Alan Sekula, and others. This semester\u2019s special topics are 1) the archive, 2)word/image relations, and 3) fiction vs. document. Theoretical forays around and into the archive will be complemented by hands-on research in an archive of your choice.  Contemporary Critical Theory: Fredric Jameson Zhang   The task of this theory seminar is two-fold: To conduct a close and systematic reading of major works by a leading American theorist and critical thinker of global significance; and to revisit the central questions concerning contemporary theoretical discourse and socio-cultural interpretations through the prism of reading Jameson. In doing so, our interest is to rethink \u201ctheory\u201d against the grain of rhetorical excess and discursive decadence, as a historically defined zone of engagement and, as theory and practice in one, the energetic tip of deep-seated, successive waves of reflection and critique that constitute what is called by Hegel \u201cour times comprehended in thought.\u201d The voluminous corpus by Jameson (so far) is divided into three groups: 1) basic conceptual, methodological work, from The Prison House of Language and Marxism and Form to Valence of Dialectic and Reading Capital, including triumphant methodological demos either in articles (on metacommentary, on cognitive mapping, etc., or in book form (The Political Unconscious); 2) critical interventions in what has come to be a historical study of modernism and modernity, including but not limited to A Singular Modernity, Brecht and Method, and The Modernist Papers; and 3) a systematic interpretation of \u201cthe cultural logic of late capitalism\u201d known as postmodernism, but manifested also in technological, socio-spatial, economic, utopian/ideological, and class-and geo-political terms, all of which are elaborated in Signatures of the Visible, Geopolitical Aesthetics, Postmodernism, The Cultural Turn and Archeology of the Future. At the speed of roughly one book per week, the seminar will be as reading-intensive as discussion-based. The growing body of scholarship on Jameson will be consulted only secondarily in class, but the students will be encouraged to pay attention to how Jameson\u2019s work stands vis-\u00e0-vis other positions within the discursive space of theoretical position-taking (deconstruction, feminism, postcolonialism, to name a few); and to the reception of Jameson in different parts of the world (most notably Asia and Latin America, but increasingly in Europe as well, as indicated by the 2008 Holberg Prize).
