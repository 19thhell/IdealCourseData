Paris has an extraordinary history and is a city of intense national, global and cultural change. You'll acquire or improve your French language skills while exploring the media, art, literature, politics, and history of this world city.    Sample MCC courses at NYU Paris:       MCC-UE 9454 Global Media Seminar: France and Europe This course introduces students to the basic structures and practices of media in Europe and their relationship to everyday social life. It pays special attention to the common models and idioms of media in Europe, with an emphasis on national and regional variations. Specific case studies highlight current trends in the production, distribution, consumption, and regulation of media. Topics may include entertainment formats, advertising and publicity, news and information, content regulation, piracy and independent media, and innovations and emerging practices in digital media. Courses are conducted in English.    MCC-UE 9345 Fashion and Power This course examines fashion as a form of communication and culture. Through cultural and media studies theory, we will examine how fashion makes meaning, and how it has been valued through history, popular culture and media institutions, focusing on the relationship between fashion, visual self-presentation, and power. The course will situate fashion both in terms of its production and consumption, addressing its role in relation to identity and body politics (gender, race, sexuality, class), art and status, nationhood and the global economy, celebrity and Hollywood culture, youth cultures and subversive practices.       Spring Semester | NYU Prague    Prague stands at the crossroads of Europe, where East meets West and the past meets the present - a city of present-day political excitement and historical imagery. This is an exceptionally exciting time to study in Prague, as students from around the world are drawn to this vibrant and beautiful city to experience first hand its reemergence as one of the leading centers of culture and thought in Europe. Courses are taught by prominent professors from Europe and the United States, and include former leading dissidents, writers, foreign ambassadors, government ministers, artists and public intellectuals.    Sample MCC courses at NYU Prague:       MCC-UE 9453 Global Media Seminar: Post Communist Media Systems This course focuses on European media and the transformation of the Czechoslovakian media after the Velvet Revolution in 1989. Czechoslovakian media are considered alongside developments in a broad range of European perspectives in order to acquaint students with the basic features of the European landscape of print and electronic media.    MCC-UE 9014 Media and Cultural Analysis An introduction to approaches and practices used to criticize the content, structure, and context (including effects) of significant media in our society. Background readings, examination of current criticism, and beginning practice in media criticism are employed.    MCC-UE 9015 Advertising and Society This course will examine the emergence of advertising as a form of communication, its influence upon other forms of mediated communication and its impact upon culture and society.    MCC-UE 9032 Social Media Networking This course will examine &ldquo;social media&rdquo; from a cultural perspective, with a focus on how media technologies figure in practices of everyday life and in the construction of social relationships and identities. Although many of our readings will deal with Social Network Sites (SNSs), we will attempt to form an expansive definition of what constitutes &ldquo;social media.&rdquo; We will also work from an expansive definition of &ldquo;technology,&rdquo; considering the term in a cultural sense to include various practices and tools used to communicate in everyday life. Lastly, the course will also look at the impact of social media on journalism and activism, including a dissection of the recent debates on the power of social media to transform these fields.       Fall Semester | NYU Buenos Aires    Buenos Aires offers an exceptional opportunity to learn about the history and culture of Latin America while taking part in the lively activities of the day-to-day life of Argentina's capital city. With its distinct European-Latin American style, Buenos Aires, birthplace of the tango, is one of the largest port cities in the world and is considered the financial and cultural center of Argentina.    Sample MCC courses at NYU Buenos Aires:       MCC-UE 9455 Global Media Seminar: Latin America This course takes an historical and cultural approach to the development of the popular press, cinema, radio, television and the contemporary processes of the new media. There is a central question for the course: Is there any singularity in Latin American media? The answer assumes that there is a specific relation between tradition and modernity in Latin American societies with many consequences for mass culture and media.

MCC-UE 9014 / MCC-UE 0014 - Media and Cultural Analysis* (formerly titled Introduction to Media Criticism)   An introduction to the theoretical approaches and practices used to analyze the content, structure, and context of media in society. Students will explore factors shaping modern media texts, including: politics, economics, technology, and cultural traditions. The dominant critical perspectives that contribute to our understanding of media will be read, discussed, and employed. The course has three broad objectives: Develop a critical awareness of media environments, develop a familiarity with concepts, themes and theoretical approaches of media criticism, and the terms associated with these approaches, and develop an ability to adopt and adapt these frameworks in your own analyses of mediated communication. Students' active class participation is vital to this process. Active participation includes listening, building on what others say, asking questions, advancing reasoned arguments, identifying theories that are relevant to the discussion, and working collaboratively with others. Missing class and/or a record of lateness will negatively affect the final grade. An absence will be excused only in case of a medical emergency (or other extraordinary circumstance) which is justified with appropriate documentation.       * the new title for this course, Media and Cultural Analysis, will take effect as of Spring 2012.    sample syllabus          MCC-UE 9015 / MCC-UE 1015 - Advertising and Society (Prague)   The course examines the role of advertising not only as an economic force but also as a form of cultural representation with a focus on the social implications of the role of consumerism in contemporary society by following its various forms around the world. Students will read, watch, analyze and discuss a variety of text specific commercials. Attention will be devoted also to the impact of advertising on the post-communist world and to the ways by which cultural issues are framed and kept in mind in the media discourse. The main objective is to provide an introductory course that is meaningful and of practical importance to students. The course examines Advertising not only as an academic discipline, but also a way of perceiving and understanding our society.    sample syllabus          MCC-UE 9103 - Intro to Digital Media (Paris)   This course is an introduction to digital media, focusing on networks, computers, the Web, and video games. Theoretical topics include the formal qualities of new media, their political dimensions, as well as questions of genre, narrative, and history. Conducted in French.          MCC-UE 9140 / E59.1400099 - Communication & Cultural Contexts (London)   A review of theories and evidence of cultural and political transformations in culture underway in the era of media proliferation, multinational conglomerates, and cyberspace.

The course will situate fashion both in terms of its production and consumption, addressing its role in relation to identity and body politics (gender, race, sexuality, class), art and status, nationhood and the global economy, celebrity and Hollywood culture, youth cultures and subversive practices.          MCC-UE 9400 / E59.1400099 - Culture, Media and Globalization (formerly titled Communication & Cultural Contexts) - Prague   A veritable buzzword, globalization refers to several newly emerged phenomena. To study it means to delve into several areas in which it manifests itself. These are, to name just the three most visible ones, the economy, culture and politics. In any of these dimensions globalization, as it is discussed in the last twenty years, functions through the media. Media does not portray globalization, but it is its important part. A study of globalization is inherently diverse and eclectic. So is this course. Students will read, watch films, analyze and discuss them. In class discussions and short papers they are expected to engage questions, issues, themes and topics connected to globalization, culture and the media. Special attention will be devoted to the impact of globalization on the late communist and post-communist world, and also to the ways by which the globalization issues are framed and discussed in the media discourse. All assigned texts and films are mandatory. Students are required to follow current events in the media (cable TV, newspapers, Internet). Class participation is expected as it is part of the final grade.           MCC-UE 9451 / E59.1451099 - Global Media Seminar: Media in China (Shanghai)   This course is designed to introduce contemporary media industries in China, involving print, broadcasting, film, PR, advertising, and new media. This course reviews the structures, functions, and influences of various forms of media industries. Practical media work is emphasized. Additionally, it analyzes existing issues on these media industries from historical, regulatory, social, and technological perspectives.          MCC-UE 9452 / MCC-UE 1452 - Global Media Seminar: TV & Democracy in Italy (Florence)   The goal of this course is to present a thorough historical survey of fifty years of television in Italy, with a special emphasis on the relation between television broadcasting and democratic politics. The course will be structured in four parts: the early days of television in Italy, characterized by the monopoly of RAI and the political influence of the Christian Democrats; the political conflicts and policy-making choices of the 70s; the so-called &ldquo;far west&rdquo; of commercial broadcasting and the birth of the duopoly during the 80s; the change of political landscape during the 90s and the years 2000, with the increasing competition between RAI and Mediaset, the conflicts of interest of Berlusconi and the advent of pay per view and digital terrestrial television. Conducted in English.    sample syllabus          MCC-UE 9453 / E59.1453099 - Global Media Seminar: Post-Communist Media Systems (Prague)   The idea of the course is to inform students about European media in general, and about transformation of the Czech media after the Velvet revolution in 1989 in particular. Czech developments will be presented on the background of a wider European perspective in order to make students acquainted with the basic features of European landscape of print and electronic media. Due to the lack of literature and printed sources in English language on the subject, the course will extensively exploit internet sources related to the topics.          MCC-UE 9454 / E59.1454099 - Global Media Seminar: France & Europe (Paris)   This course introduces students to the basic structures and practices of media in Europe and their relationship to everyday social life. It pays special attention to the common models and idioms of media in Europe, with an emphasis on national and regional variations. Specific case studies highlight current trends in the production, distribution, consumption, and regulation of media. Topics may include: national or regional idioms in a range of media genres, from entertainment, to advertising and publicity, to news and information; legal norms regarding content and freedom of expression; pirate and independent media; and innovations and emerging practices in digital media. Conducted in English.          MCC-UE 9455 - Global Media Seminar: Latin America (Buenos Aires)   This course proposes a historical and cultural approach to the development of the popular press, cinema, radio, television and the contemporary processes of the new media. There is a central question for the course: Is there any singularity in Latin American media? The answer assumes that there is a specific relation between tradition and modernity in Latin American societies with many consequences for mass culture and media. The constitution of mass audiences in societies where literacy was not a universal value, made significant the development of audiovisual media. The course will focus on melodrama as a configuration that made possible the emergence of specific genres in Latin American cinema, radio and television. Particularly, the &ldquo;telenovela&rdquo; is simultaneously an aesthetic, industrial and audience phenomenon with local and global circulation. Finally, the course will discuss the role of media in dictatorship and democratic processes. Censorship and alternative media enabled many different practices for radio journalists, filmmakers or contemporary bloggers.    sample syllabus          MCC-UE 9456 Global Media Seminar: Australia and the Pacific Rim (Sydney)   This course brings together diverse issues and perspectives in rapidly evolving areas of international/global communication. Historical and theoretical frameworks will be provided to help students to approach the scope, disparity and complexity of current developments in our media landscape. Students will be encouraged to critically assess shifts in national, regional, and international media patterns of production, distribution, and consumption over time, leading to analysis of the tumultuous contemporary global communication environment. Key concepts associated with international communication will be examined, including a focus on trends in national and global media consolidation, cultural implications of globalisation, international broadcasting, information flows, international communication law and regulation, and trends in communication and information technologies. The focus of the course will be international, with a particular emphasis on Australia.          MCC-UE 9775 / E59.1775099 - Advertising Techniques: Media Industries in China (Shanghai)   \"The China market is real. The China opportunity is real. The promise of Chinese consumerism is real&hellip;but easy to squander.\" This course covers the critical importance of culture in shaping buyers&rsquo; decisions. The motivations of Chinese consumers, as influenced by history and culture, will be examined in terms of the growing middle class, the urban mass market and the expanding roles of men, women and youth. Carrying forth from such an in-depth look at this emerging power, students will be given important lessons and guidelines for success in Mainland China. &ldquo;Advertising Techniques: Media Industries in China&rdquo; will also offer tools to succeed in the Middle Kingdom. Learning from consumer insights, developing brand vision and creating a product portfolio are just a few of the key skills covered to establish sure footing in such a new a fast-growing market. These rules are drawn from a reflection on the successes and failures of the multinational corporations who entered the market.          MCC-UE 9993 - Introduction to Digital Media: Chinese Cyberculture (Shanghai)   This course introduces the philosophy of cybernetic machines with reference to the technological trends affecting contemporary China.
