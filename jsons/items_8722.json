My current research focusing on textile furnishings, portraits of the Egyptian desert fathers, and monastic dress in Late Antiquity, has led me to investigate social and ritual space, even as it has renewed my interest in developments of ancient traditions during Late Antiquity, and the reception of Late Antique art in modern times. I remain concerned with issues of craft and reuse, especially as they involve perception of the artwork, particular circumstances of commission and production and, more generally, art commerce all along the chronological continuum from Late Antiquity until the present day. My work in Eastern Christian art, especially, addresses the movement of materials, artworks, motifs, concepts, artisans, and consumers of art across diverse cultural territories. Although functionally technilliterate, expert assistance helps me as I continue to explore the growing utility of digital tools and resources for documentation, research, and the presentation of research.

Thomas      Associate Professor of Fine Arts    B.A. 1980, Bryn Mawr College; M.A. 1982, New York University; PhD 1990, New York University       I teach and conduct research across the fields of Late Antique, Byzantine, and Eastern Christian art. My current research focusing on textile furnishings, portraits of the Egyptian desert fathers, and monastic dress in Late Antiquity, has led me to investigate social and ritual space, even as it has renewed my interest in developments of ancient traditions during Late Antiquity, and the reception of Late Antique art in modern times. I remain concerned with issues of craft and reuse, especially as they involve perception of the artwork, particular circumstances of commission and production and, more generally, art commerce all along the chronological continuum from Late Antiquity until the present day. My work in Eastern Christian art, especially, addresses the movement of materials, artworks, motifs, concepts, artisans, and consumers of art across diverse cultural territories. Although functionally technilliterate, expert assistance helps me as I continue to explore the growing utility of digital tools and resources for documentation, research, and the presentation of research.
