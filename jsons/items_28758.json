[{"detail": [{"content": "Haiti                                                     Maya Deren and Haiti Maya Deren's fascination with New World African culture was an enduring leitmotif       of her artistic vision. She began her career with Katherine Dunham's dance troupe, which was famous for exploring the mythological roots of Caribbean ritual movement, and by 1942 she was publishing articles about Haitian religion       and dance. She focused on the spiritual implications of Vodou, which inspired her to spend years in Haiti, where she produced film footage, hundreds of photographic negatives, and a brilliant ethnographic book. Deren's initiation       into the practices of Vodou in the late 1940s and early 1950s was not, therefore, tangential to her avant-garde film work but central to it. Up until her premature and sudden death in 1961, this artist found nourishment in the       concepts of the metaphysical and the physical, of space and time, of life and death manifested in African-based religions, ritual, and dance. This is an especially important point to make when we consider that       Deren's work is most often viewed in the context of Surrealism. Like Claude Cahun, she was a friend of Andr Breton's. Deren, however, denied any connection with the movement's aesthetic aims. The Surrealist obsession with       dualitywith the lines separating the real and the imaginary, the rational and the irrational, the waking life and the dreamwas, in fact, diametrically opposed to Deren's fascination with the continuity of life and death,       the physical and the spiritual, and \"I\" and the \"non-I.\" Talking about her film Meshes of the  Afternoon , she stated that she was interested in the credibility of the unreal, not the incredibility of the unreal.       \"I am concerned,\" she wrote, \"with that point of contact between the real and the unreal, where the unreal manifests itself in reality.\" Her films were intended as imaginary arenas where this point of contact could be       visualizedwhere boundaries normally fixed could dissolve, or become wildly flexible; where protagonists could move freely between dreams and waking life without ever resolving the differences between the two; where nature and       culture, urban and rural environments could be separated (and linked) by a single step; where past and future selves could meet along the road, fracturing into clones moving along parallel paths of time and space. Her years in       Haiti, and her intense involvement with Vodou, can be seen as her quest to experience a living culture that gave &quot;credibility to the unreal,\" and thereby embody the vision she sought in her experimental films.        Maya Deren's most significant contribution to postmodern discourse might be her profound understanding of the ties that link the avant-garde and the \"primitive\" [sic],        the Western and the Other. She first went to Haiti on a Guggenheim Fellowship; her application stated that she intended to make a film about ritual and dance. Early into the project, however, she became aware that she could not separate the dance from the ritual; the ritual from the religion; the religion from the history and the local culture. She set aside the film project in order to study the organic wholeness of Vodou within the context of Haitian life. (Deren never finished the film, but her footage was posthumously edited by her husband Teiji Ito and his wife Cherel. Her experiences were most fully explored in her book        Divine Horsemen: The Living Gods of Haiti,        which was initially proposed and supported by the noted mythologist and folklorist Joseph Campbell.) Her initiation into the sacred mysteries of Vodou was her homage to a religious system based on the psychic phenomena of \"possession,\" when during a religious ritual the identity of a living        serviteur (worshipper) is temporarily displaced by the spirit of an ancestral lwa        (deity). The Haitian community's belief in the normality of such happenings reflects a cosmology with complex spiritual implications, where ritual practices have the power to unite mortal and immortal in a single dance. Possessed worshippers take on the attributes (the voice, the gestures, the costumes) that are characteristic of the        lwa in question; their physical transformation differentiates their mundane social identity from the identity of the spirit that temporarily inhabits their bodies. In \"becoming\" the ancestral deities, these serviteurs        transcend themselves, allow themselves to join forces with their history, with the supernatural archetypes of their race. Time and eternity, the living and the dead, become Oneand the relativistic universe proposed in Deren's films becomes manifest.       In the course of a Vodou ritual, therefore, the donning of costume elements signals the breakthrough of the \"unreal\" into the \"real,\" the emergence of the fantastic into the social body itself. Among Maya       Deren's Haitian photographs, a number document worshippers possessed by Gede, the spirit of the dead. Some of the worshippers are male, some female, but this gender difference becomes irrelevant when the individual is \"mounted\" by       the deity, that is, when the body is overtaken by energies stronger than those that mark us in the social world. The similarity of gesture, of body language, of the cigarette (Gede's attribute) among all who undergo this       transformation proffers a definition of \"masquerade\" that far exceeds the limited psychological or feminist frameworks common in twentieth century thought. Rather than a \"false\" identity hiding a \"real\" one, these shifts in       costume and persona propose in fact that the Self is not unitary; that it is as flexible, and as protean, as Deren herself in films like Meshes of the Afternoon, At Land, and Ritual in Transfigured Time; that it holds       within itself the capability of manifesting multiple facets of the collective history of the race, allowing all of us to transcend the limited gender, racial, historical, or cultural backgrounds into which we are born. Hardly a       nihilistic splintering of identity, such a vision is a massive expansion of the normal Western concept of the human experience, a restructuring of the individual along lines that suggest that we are, one and all, essentially       diverse.

Its purpose is to provide students, teachers, journalists and the general public with resources about Haiti. Please return often for further information and updates regarding the situation. Why? On January 12, 2010 a major earthquake of 7.0 on the Richter scale struck Haiti\u2019s capital city of Port-au-Prince and surrounding areas. Current counts estimate the affected at 3.5 million and the dead at perhaps 200,000 men, women, and children. In Port-au-Prince, major government buildings collapsed, as did the headquarters of the UN Peacekeeping Mission (MINUSTAH) and the headquarters of many NGOs and aid organizations active in the country. Major cultural sites collapsed too: churches, schools, universities, libraries, and archives. Outside Port-au-Prince, the cities of Carrefour, Leogane, and Jacmel have been almost leveled. A major relief effort was launched almost immediately, with participation of the United States and nations across the globe, as well as the United Nations and many international aid organizations. But efforts were hampered, on the one hand, by the massive damage to existing infrastructure and, according to groups such as Doctors without Borders, by an emphasis on security rather than relief. The crisis is still unfolding and will be for some time to come. With so much attention focused on Haiti, many people are asking similar questions: Why have the effects of the earthquake been so devastating? Why is Haiti so poor? Where is the Haitian state? Why was the UN already there and what was it doing? What is the history of democracy in Haiti? Where can I learn about Haitian culture? What is the history of the relationship between the United States and Haiti, and what is the role of the U.S. at this current critical juncture? What can we do to help? These pages provide resources that can be used to help people address those questions. The site contains suggestions for further readings, links to important sources of information, links to the best news coverage of Haiti, and information on events on Haiti at NYU and beyond.

That revolution, relatively little known today, transformed the Western World. In 1794, it produced the first large-scale abolition of slavery in the modern world. It led as well to the expansion of citizenship rights beyond racial barriers for the first time ever. As historian Laurent Dubois and others have argued, \u201cIf we live in a world in which democracy is meant to exclude no one, it is in no small part because of the actions of the enslaved of Saint-Domingue (Haiti) who insisted that human rights were theirs too.\u201d Books (in English) Dubois, Laurent.

It represented the dramatic victory of anti-slavery in an era in which slavery was expanding rapidly, for example, in the U.S. South, Cuba, and Brazil. Not surprisingly, then, the newly independent nation was isolated and shunned by the major world powers. The Catholic Church refused to recognize independent Haiti, a refusal that limited the new state\u2019s ability to provide education for its citizens. In 1825, France, its former colonial master, agreed to recognize Haiti on the condition that Haiti indemnify the French for the losses French citizens had sustained during the Haitian Revolution. Thus former slaves who had never received wages or compensation of any kind paid former masters for damages. Haiti was paying off the debt until 1925.
