About Kelsey S McLeod   Mail | More Posts (2)                              by Kelsey S McLeod             Uncategorized                    March 26, 2015           Consuming Surface and Space: Examining the Quotidian of Repurposed Structures               Creativity and invention can derive from states of deprivation and oppression (Levin and Brody 1974: 231-237). By training your perception to notice things that don\u2019t seem to be there, you open yourself to the actions performed with lesser awareness. Debord references two types of spatial fields, delimitated or vague. For this case I employed a vague spatial field, which is akin to a hunt. For instance, looking for similarities and differences as it relates to a specific structure or idea as it is expressed tangibly wherever you might happen upon it. There is taxonomy of seven forms of interaction with design (IDEO 2005). They are: reacting, responding, co-opting, exploiting, adapting, conforming, and signaling. These forms are loosely defined as:     Reacting &#8211; Automatic interaction with objects and spaces when we encounter them   Responding &#8211; Behaving in particular ways based on the features and qualities of a design   Co-opting &#8211; AKA appropriation   Exploiting &#8211; Taking advantage of the physical and mechanical qualities of a design that we understand   Adapting &#8211; Altering the purpose or context of a design from its intended use   Conforming &#8211; Learning patterns of behavior from others or a cultural group   Signaling &#8211; Conveying message and prompts to ourselves and others     These forms quickly become internalized and relegated to your subconscious. Presently, we all repurpose a structure or an object from its intended purpose. By doing so is evidence of our subconscious engagement with society and the structures, spaces, and objects which define it.     Reacting   Naturally, I took the streets to discover any instance I could of this first form. It did not take long to discover an instance of this in Prospect Park. At any point during the day you are bound to encounter joggers. They may be in different stages of the routine, warm-up stretching, steady run, or a cool-down stretch. Rarely does the jogger possess a plan. The jogger does however intend on stretching on any available surface or object. Here, I encountered an older gentleman who had taken the park bench and used the object as the place for his stretch. Not only had he been stretching, he had also used this bench as tool to secure his dogs whilst warming up. His use of the bench while intentional, displays his subconscious\u2019 engagement with this object.     \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 At one point or another we have all used the back of our chair as a coat hanger. Your chair\u2019s back is not a coat hanger, or is it? This is perhaps the most common thing; it\u2019s almost a natural response to place your coat on the back of your chair.   \u00a0   Adapting   The winter weather provides the perfect opportunity for smokers to use the top a snow filled trash receptacle ash an ashtray. While unconventional, whoever pioneered this use of the snow as an ashtray prompted those smokers who followed to follow suit.      \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 My friend has done some re-using with a bottle by turning it into a vase for her flowers. Bottles are typically just recycled after the contents are gone; a flower vase was never really intended for it. This was definitely deliberate, adapting the empty bottle to fit new needs. This improvisation is not only functional, making good use of resources, helpful to the environment but also really charming.     Thinking is what every person is driven to do. Perhaps, by analyzing one\u2019s immediate world for the feedback required to build a personal vision or reading into situations to anticipate unmet or unde\ufb01ned needs; the ability to escape functional fixedness and capture the world at a speed roughly parallel to our own thinking by turning observations into reflections or memories. The kinds of thoughts and feelings represented in these photographs accompany us everywhere we go making sense of our everyday encounters in general ways.     Comments:   Ultimately I would explore all the forms less superficially whilst employing the readings by De Certeau, Ong, and Calvino.    About Sarah A Dowding Human.

The app stresses themes of ephemerality and visual interaction through its user interface and design. As a result, Snapchat allows for a new type of interpersonal communication that deviates from that which results from traditional messaging programs.\u00a0In this paper, I will examine the way Snapchat changes individuals&#8217; senses of space and time to create an abstract community in which users share and consume images within the same digital space. In order to research, I will create a survey to gather information and look for overarching trends among Snapchat users.   Temporality &amp; Space Relations   The three main elements of the photo-communication process is the sender, the receiver, and the image.\u00a0The construction of Snaps is limited spatially by the frame of the mobile camera and temporally by the 10-second cap set forward by the application. This limitation brings forth a feeling of urgency and nervousness that comes with most forms of social media. Individuals subscribe to the condition of the present moment; the rate of image consumption is exponentially higher than before.   Similar to Powerpoint, the interface of the program dictates the interactions it conjures. Thus, I will utilize Gold&#8217;s reading to compare the two applications and how presentation changes with each interface. The survey will also affect this portion because the notions will depend on an analysis of social use trends. For example, one&#8217;s favorability of the ephemeral nature of Snapchat may speak to the modern desire for detachment from digital permanence.   Community Story Building   Social media platforms, such as Facebook and Twitter, instill an innate sense of omnipresence within individuals. Online profiles serve as absolute representations of the individual that can be accessed at any time and from anywhere. The idea of the self \u2013 the synthetic self \u2013 is extended beyond one\u2019s physical entity. With the proliferation of social media, the self is now a purposeful abstraction of the real. I will connect Ong&#8217;s reading to the role of visual communication in the presentation of the self.\u00a0How does the framing of the app facilitate the process of abstraction? In Snapchat, there are systems of localized discovery in place for instantaneous connection between strangers. The ability to location tag, for example, allows for collectivism among strangers by breaking down spatial barriers.    About Jia Ying Huang   Mail | More Posts (2)                              by Jessica Huang             Uncategorized                    March 26, 2015           \u2018The Lives of Others\u2019: The role of Architecture through Film               This paper will compare two cases of architecture in the film \u2018The Lives of Others\u2019. These examples are the homes of the two main characters. After analyzing these spaces within the film, it is important, too, to reference other spatial elements in the film that enhance or relate to these two dominating architectural opposites. By comparing the homes of these two characters, the internal and external physical setting, the light, color, composition, time, movement and perspective, of the space through the film, we are able to access how architecture transfers emotional responses in the viewer.     In fact, architecture within a film is crucial in the translation of meaning, story and emotion. It enables the viewer to respond in a specific way, intended by the creators. The architecture of a film is both the physical set but also the role and \u2018voice\u2019 of the camera and screen. The barrier between reality and film are bridged by architecture and space. The creative process of film accesses and enhances our emotional response through these factors. The film is set in Berlin in 1984 and recalls the extreme surveillance and secrecy behind the Eastern side of the Berlin Wall under the post-war GDR government. The first character, Gerd Wiesler \u2013 who, we find, is defined by the places he inhabits and the atmosphere of them \u2013 is a general in the GDR government who controls internal security and is a part of the secret police. He is ordered to spy on the second prominent character, a well-known playwright, Georg Dreyman, who he suspects of having sympathies for West Germany and who may pose a risk to state security.      We initially see the first case, Wiesler\u2019s house, at night. Wiesler exits his boss\u2019 car and the camera pans up to two apartment blocks. The view is from below, we are, like Wiesler, alone and small, placed underneath the powerful yet anonymous, Brutalist style apartment building. The lighting in the film hits the facades of the buildings, leaving large areas of the image in shadow, increasing the sense of the unknown and emptiness in the space. The repetition of windows that are predominantly dark, and the flat, unornamented texture of the building emphasizes this sense of a place without character, definition or life, a scene which is designed to mimic the reality of the lives of the population of East Berlin in the period from 1961 to 1989 when their lives were cut-off and isolated. Upon entering his apartment, Wiesler takes of his coat and moves into the bathroom. The camera pans around his apartment. Without the subject movement within it, we are made more aware of the space and what is in it. Two small paintings hang on the wall. They are centrally placed and exacerbate the openness and emptiness of the walls. The use of mainly brown and beige creates a drab and dull atmosphere and the apartment is made to look like there is little trace of anyone living there, without personality or sense of home.      Wiesler stands in his small kitchen, his body cut in two by a shelf in the foreground. The shelf is bare. Rather than emptying the apartment, the production designer chooses to place ornaments and household items in the space, though, the cleanliness and sparseness gives the impression that they are never used. The use of grey is prominent in the kitchen scene. The figure\u2019s shirt, background wall and appliances are all a similar color. Even the food he eats is a pale grey, which is even more exaggerated by a bright red sauce he pours on it. The atmosphere is cold and still and his movements are slow. This sterile appearance displays the functionalism and mechanism of Wiesler that reflects his character. He represents a character that is all encompassed by the East Berlin style of living and mindset. Even the higher-ranking officials in the film are depicted as a less Socialist and less extremely loyal, for example, we later learn that Wiesler is only spying on Dreyman in order that the GDR official can move in on Dreyman\u2019s wife. In fact, everyone was seen as a suspect, within or without the government, creating a deliberately destabilizing effect to the film. Wiesler is a servant for the GDR and, as someone who uncovers Communist party opposition, he encompasses all of their ideals both in and out of his work environment. This work position means that this character is at a constant level of surveillance and suspicion. The East Berlin government attempted to control and repress individualism and non-conformity. They created a system in which people were unable to diverge from the common interest and the progression and development of the whole community. Wiesler\u2019s grey clothes, and almost forgettable features, as well as his characterless apartment effectively convey the repressed individualism under the GDR at this time.     In the following scene, the film moves on to the contrasting character and architectural space inhabited by the playwright, Dreyman. We see him playing football with children in the street, watched by Wiesler from across the road. The architecture of the buildings in the street, where this contrasting character lives, has layers and textures. Although the houses are uniform in style, the decorative projections and receding reliefs, create a more dynamic background. Furthermore, the camera movement enhances this with quick moving images that follow the mobility of the subjects. One shot is cut off on the left hand side by a wall, indicating the perspective of an onlooker that we assume to be Wiesler. The texture of the street gives character and invigorates the life of the scene. The color provided by the trees that line the street and the wooden box full of vegetables that Dreyman picks up all create a more natural and inhabited space. The role of the children, indicating a hope for the future, and mention of Dreyman\u2019s girlfriend, aid in creating an atmosphere of community and homeliness, family, comfort and safety that are void in the depiction of Wiesler. The film seeks to juxta-pose these two characters with these two scenes and spaces. Wiesler suspects the creative Dreyman from anti-state activities, and, as an audience we see his position from the other side of the road as the gulf that separates these two characters from the lives of each other.   This initial depiction of the first case, Wiesler\u2019s apartment is reminiscent of the themes found in David Nye\u2019s text, \u2018 Buildings and Skyscrapers: The geometric sublime\u2019 , in that it displays the modern aesthetic that comes with man\u2019s need to continue to develop and our constant need for new and better. Architecture is one of the most evident examples of the speed at which the spaces we inhabit have changed for what we consider to be the better. In the case of this film, the depiction of Wiesler\u2019s house nods towards the ultra modern style that defines the Brutalist architecture of the time. The use of concrete and expression of this material use, as well as the geometric forms of this style were useful in displaying strength of the building, as well as strength of the state. Rather than agreeing with the \u2018geometric sublime\u2019 discussed in Nye\u2019s text, this film almost displays the antithesis to his argument. Nye talks about the, \u201cnew historical relationship between humans and their environment\u201d through the subject of the skyscraper, the, \u201cfus[ing] nature and culture presents a historical vision of technological progress\u201d and the, \u201cnew organism emerges, built of materials wrested from nature\u201d [1] . Rather than an image of modern beauty and excellence, the modernism explored in the film brings to the forefront the lack of nature, and it\u2019s inaccessibility through the growing divide to the inhabitants. Wielser\u2019s life is devoid of natural growth and is based upon the display of progress and the strength of the men in power.   In the post-war years, there was a huge housing shortage due to the devastation of infrastructure. The GDR built quickly assembled, cheaply made and functional apartment buildings that housed many people in small spaces. These buildings were clustered around transportation links for efficiency and were built in sudden but short periods of time, in the 1950\u2019s, 1970\u2019s and 80\u2019s, as re-housing programs were instigated and the state suffered the effects of the cost of war. Today, many areas of Berlin have no indication of design for people. Tall tower blocks line main thoroughfares of the city leaving no space for pedestrian life on the street. Commercial properties on the lower floors of these towers cater for the passing cars, and the structures themselves enable large amounts of people to live comfortably for little money. These areas of Berlin are no-man\u2019s land. They have no life and no character. The need for progression that Nye discusses in his text is most prominently shown and started in Germany in the inter-war and post-war years. This was a time that the functionality of life was pushed to the extreme. The Frankfurt Kitchen [2] was developed, bringing the idea of efficiency in production for the country into the home space. Just as the skyscraper that Nye describes is a tool to promote \u201chopefulness\u201d at the time of the depression, at the same time, the Brutalist mass built public housing towers in Berlin is authentically and effectively shown through the film to induce a sense of hopelessness and the \u201cdehumanized community\u201d that Edmund Wilson in The New Republic argues [3] .   This is in direct contrast to the individually designed space of Dreyman\u2019s home. This house appears to be pre-war 1880\u2019s architecture in that the details of the building reflect the role of one specific architect. The entranceway displays wearing with time, the warm wood handrails and wide stone floors, the thick, wooden front door and glass panels, the tall ceilings and ceiling moldings all add a kind of historical significance and grandeur. The fixtures and decorative elements within the house are dark wood and brass and the windows and door between rooms have shutters and layers, giving an insulated and established atmosphere. The characters also move between the rooms, highlighting the diversity in space and quality of living. Each area has different purposes and is decorated in various ways, though maintains the sense of security and generous space. The busyness and textures here are created by color and light. The lighting is dim and warm, given from side lamps and standing lamps, rather than the central industrial white light that hits Wiesler from above when he stands in his kitchen. The presence of Dreyman\u2019s girlfriend also increases the atmosphere or sensuality and contact. The two characters are often in close contact and, as the first scene within the apartment is Dreyman\u2019s birthday party, the atmosphere of the place is primarily attractive, warm, full, lively and comfortable. The presence of books, paintings, a piano and sculptures on the mantelpieces also allude to a kind of cultural and artistic awareness that is missing in Wiesler\u2019s home. Objects without function that were for pure pleasure or beauty were regarded as enabling freethinking. The idea that the individual had freedom of expression and power of choice was a threat to the state and was greatly frowned upon. The utilitarianism within Wielser is mirrored in his apartment. Suspicion from the authorities would impact greatly on his career, indicating the severity of the austerity of life in East Berlin at this time. Wiesler\u2019s apartment has cheaply made metal and steel window frames, cupboards and door handles. His front door is small and the entrance way is tight and bare, with only a coat hangar that Wiesler automatically hangs his coat upon. The lack of space is evident, as is the need for minimal functional features. Rather than individually designed, this space is one of the many quickly designed and cheaply made modern living spaces.   It is interesting to reference a third house in this film that provides an extremity of disorder and chaos. This is seen when Dreyman goes to visit a friend Albert Jerska. Jerska is out of work as a director, due to anti-socialist sentiments and has been \u2018black listed\u2019 and therefore lives in poorer conditions. Like Dreyman\u2019s house, the walls are lined with books and papers are scattered across his desk. On the other hand, the floor space is hard to see and, although the two characters are seated, the corners of their seats, as well as the corners of the scenes are cut off by the clutter of books and objects. Among these objects are bottles of alcohol and glasses. White lace curtains cover the windows, giving the interior space a dusty, yellow light. The piles of books create walls and obstacles themselves metaphorically mirroring the obstacles and blocks in Jerska\u2019s life. He is overwhelmed with creative inspiration, typified by the dominance and focus of our attention in the space of a large contemporary artwork hung on the wall yet he has no outlet and, without work, says he is useless. The small room and amount of clutter, as well as the dark, dusty light all combine to create a chaotic and cramped atmosphere, yet the main character is calm and composed. This contrast in surroundings and character depiction gives an indication of the hopelessness of this character and lack of connection to his surroundings, and metaphorically to reality and later in the film we hear that he has committed suicide. Again the medium of cinema encapsulates through architectural tools, the confusion faced by the individual characters. From the form, layout and scale of Wiesler\u2019s apartment that is sterile and devoid of culture or character, to Jerska\u2019s apartment that seems to be overloaded with creative influence that is physically bursting out of the interior space and off the edges of the screen, to that of Dreyman\u2019s apartment that seems to be a balance between the two that we recognize as a comfortable norm. We have the feeling that Dreyman\u2019s character too, is battling between the extremes of the Minister of Culture and the socialist control over the plays he writes, and his more non-conformist radical friends who feel oppressed by the regime and betrayed by sympathizers. As the architecture indicates and enhances, Dreyman is constantly being pulled by both sides and poses as the balance between all of the characters around him.   The architecture in this film plays a major role in showing the theme of the spectator, the speculator and the surveyor. This is a key element in the plot of the film as well as an authentic representation of the kind of fear of denouncement and accusation that happened ever present in the lives of East Berliners at this time. The idea that neighbors were seen as disloyal unless they informed on each other, resulted in family members being constantly threatened for information not just on family members but also on neighbors and colleagues alike. This continued throughout the period from the years after the war until the fall of the Berlin Wall, providing a backdrop and an atmosphere of repression, fear and disillusionment. Although the war was over, many people of East Berlin were forced to live under a regime they did not previously believe in, and had to comply with the state to such an extent that even jokes about the state were causes for unemployed or even imprisonment. This references Walter Ong\u2019s text about oral and literary cultures. He explores the impact that the transfer of knowledge through writing has, and describes it in his text:   \u201cfor an oral culture learning or knowing means achieving close empathetic communal identification with the known\u2026 Writing separates the knower from the known and thus sets up conditions for objectivity\u201d [4]   In his essay, Ong discusses the relevance of time and objectivity in the way that written text gives the sense of timelessness and permanence. It gives authority to the text and to the author. It also allows the author a level of disassociation with what is written that spoken word does not allow for. This idea that the medium by which information is transferred affects the authenticity of knowledge is key in this film. The way that officers of the state were able to imprison or accuse someone of disloyalty to the party without signs of sympathy was perhaps enabled by the same idea of disassociation with the transfer of information. We see this as Wiesler and a team of men set up microphones in Dreyman\u2019s apartment. They then install tables of machinery and recording devices in the attic to listen in and record the events within Dreyman\u2019s apartment below. Just as Ong discusses the ingenuity and sense of modernism and progression associated with writing as a development from oral traditions, machinery in the film represents a similar display of the modernism of the state as well as its replacement for human, moral and principled responses.      Alternately, role of speech in the film is the catalyst for the change in the character of Wiesler, a turning point in the plot. We first see this when, in an elevator, a small child accidently denounces his own father to Wiesler. Wiesler\u2019s reaction is to ask for the father\u2019s name, though he stops himself. This tension shows the battle between information and truth, and how much of Wiesler\u2019s behavior is out of his own control, and in the hands of the state. The film reveals the arbitrary positions of power and control and the way that someone\u2019s whole life rests on the transfer and report of information. The space in the attic of Dreyman\u2019s house shifts the focus from the center of action within the apartment below, to a kind of layering of the same space above. One scene depicts Weisler drawing the blue print plan of Dreyman\u2019s apartment on the attic floor. This gives us an even more visual indication of the recreation of the space below, into the space above. The white lines of the to-scale plan on the floor create a skeletal image that acts to emphasize the emptiness and lack of reality of the attic space, and of the spaces inhabited by Wiesler. Again, the attic is grey, dark and, with his somber face, grey hair and dark grey, uniform-like jacket, Wiesler blends with his background, shadow-like, a subtle nod toward his function to be unnoticed, and his role as a spy. Bizarrely, as Wiesler continues his surveillance undetected, he begins to inhabit, in this two dimensional attic plan, the same space as the man he is spying upon in his apartment two floors below, and although now tantalizingly close in proximity, he remains unable to occupy physically, politically or emotionally the same space.      The breakdown in transfer of information is displayed physically through the architecture of the film as Wiesler enters into Dreyman\u2019s home for the very first time. These later scenes in the film are amongst the most dramatic as, perhaps for the first time this agent of the state is seen as entering into a different world. His reaction to this experience is moving as the film shows the intensely powerful impact that the meaning of space can have on an individual, in this case, causing Wiesler to begin to reassess the meaning of his life and to contemplate for the first time the legitimacy of a regime he has loyally supported all his life. First he borrows and later reads one of Dreyman\u2019s book, and subsequently as a twist in the story, he enters the apartment to save Dreyman from being discovered as untrustworthy by the GDR officers. We also see the connection between the two spaces as Wiesler is moved by Dreyman\u2019s piano playing through the microphones and headphones. We start to see the emotional responses that Wiesler has to the cultural and artistic influences of Dreyman. These two characters are connected through space alone yet this connection proves to be the most crucial element to the plot, as well as the historical accuracy of the film. The atmosphere and space created stems from the connection and disconnection of two people, both in character representations and physical space within the film. Wiesler\u2019s experiences yet inability to access Dreyman\u2019s life allows the audience to completely alter their perception of this character. Something people who have experienced the physical division of Germany still are unable to come to terms with. It is interesting to note how the division of Berlin and the fall of the wall in the film represent the breakdown and collapse of the systems that keep Wiesler living. The systems of surveillance and paranoia for the success of the state are revealed as arbitrary with the fall of the Wall. The film demonstrates how the physicality of the Berlin Wall itself is an ideological boundary, mirroring the division between the lives of these two men, and the transformation of the hero, Wiesler.   The overall atmosphere created in this film has been praised as extremely authentic to the architecture and spaces of East Berlin [5] . There is a muted calmness to the sets in the whole film and there are quiet hints of differences between places. Atmosphere, aesthetic and the almost subconscious reaction we feel when confronted with the scenes of these different homes, perfectly conveys the crushingly oppressive nature of the regime and lack of individuality under the GDR at this time. The film is recognized for it\u2019s high level of authenticity that is often lost through film. Films are unable to create real life interaction with spaces. The viewer must allow for certain amounts of creative and imaginative responses to film. The film must recreate the impact of smell, atmosphere and a personal connection to a space through sound and visuals only. Films provide a compression of cultural context and architecture is the primal example for enabling the transfer of this to the viewer [6] . Transporting the observer entirely convincingly, to a time and place that no longer exist. In the case of this recent historical film, this effect is crucial to the role of the film. It recreates a perspective on what life had been like and alters our own historical knowledge and understanding. It is a politically heavy and has the ability to alter our own perceptions today. This idea is explored in Rich Gold\u2019s \u2018Reading the Powerpoint\u2019 as he explores the role of the visual image in translating information. Today, the amount of visual stimuli we receive everyday has impact the speed and translation of information we need in order to maintain focus and attention. The role of the visual is therefore stronger than the written word now more than ever. We rely on the speed and diversity of information given to us, which is most effective through sight and sound in film. Furthermore, the screen unifies the audience and makes the experience of the film more authentic as it is seen and understood by all, rather than just the individual [7] . This supports the impact that films, particularly historical films, have on our own understanding of reality. Finally, the atmosphere of the film, created by the space and architecture, transfers the emotional response that can be accessed by the individual as the screen also allows for an autonomous experience. Gold\u2019s explanation for the success of the PowerPoint in the transfer of information supports the power of film as a medium.   By contrasting the two architectural examples of space within the film \u2018The Lives of Others\u2019, we can see how crucial the role of architecture has in the viewer\u2019s understanding of the characters, as well as catalysts for the plot. Architecture in this film enables us, as viewers, to understand fully the intentions of the director, to engage with the realities of the time that is portrayed. The ability of \u2018The Lives of Others\u2019 to transport the viewer displays the power of film and its ability to alter our own perspectives on historical truths. The architecture of Dreyman and Wiesler\u2019s houses show the contrasting characters as well as the contrasting ideologies at the time. The space of the attic displays how the film plays on the breakdown in the transfer of information and the role of technology as well as the physical realities of life in Berlin. It is interesting to note how the opening of the Berlin Wall was made by miscommunication of the Communist bureaucrat, Gunter Schabowski on live television and the surreal connection between information and reality and the physical consequences [8] .

Within this space the expressive intentions of the designer and the spirit of the age all seems to come together when the collection is presented. Simultaneously, executives have created a spectacle around these shows not so much as to increase the fashion house\u2019s sales, but as a marketing/public relations initiative. Today the most important fashion shows in the industry are staged on a biannual basis in New York, London, Milan, and Paris, which respectively host a week of what is known as Fashion Month. Each designer that presents, engages the industry in different ways, pushing at the structure and rituals of fashion, while paradoxically, building on tradition. While the need to see the dress in motion was what initially gave birth to the catwalk, today behind the spectacle that encapsulates the month, each city, and each event, the fashion show is a polysemous space where a circuit of exchange takes place between the various elements that make up the event space.   The fashion show is a relatively modern phenomenon that emerged as early as the 1850\u2019s and became well established by 1910. In The Mechanical Smile, fashion historian, Caroline Evans argues that since its inception there exist a \u201cFordist aesthetic to the fashion show.\u201d This duality between mass production and mass consumption, which started with Charles Worth\u2019s predesigned collection, continued to dictate the evolution of the runway and is deeply embedded in fashion shows today. Despite its reputation of being a \u2018one of a kind\u2019 luxury trade, the French haute couture system profited immensely from selling their top-end designs and the right to reproduce them to American importers who simplified and mass reproduced them.   Fashion modelling was intended to sell garments to both types of clientele, nevertheless, French couture houses were \u201cunwilling to publicise their trade link [and] preferred instead to use the cachet of the individual clients to promote their reputation.\u201d True business men, fashion couturiers like Worth, did not only set precedents for the standardisation of fashion, but also to use modelling events to both sell and market their garment collection. David Nye highlights a similar approach taken by businessmen who sought to erect skyscrapers as a symbol of themselves and their company. \u201cPerpetual advertisement,\u201d these buildings were in the publics eye. On the contrary, modelling salons and sales rooms were for private clients and buyers respectfully. This was part of the couturiers\u2019 marketing tactic which sought to \u201ccraft the romanticism of the average viewer\u201d not through a direct view, but through the use of their imagination. In forcing people to envision shows and conjure the elegance of both the event and of the high life of its attendees, fashion designers were able to both impress the cultural elite, bringing in new clients, and proclaimed the importance of their house to the general public, two contradictory goals that the builders of the skyscrapers struggled to achieve in their own right.   The importance of being able to showcase the movement of the dress increased the significance of the mannequins as their body gestures were the key element to give life to the dresses. The body in motion is also able to \u201cestablishing a set of relationships and networks\u201d that creates space. The role of the model is similar to Heidegger\u2019s example of the bridge, which: \u201cdoes not first come to a location to stand in it; rather a location comes into existence only by virtue of the bridge.\u201d Thus the mannequin not only gives life to the dress, but to the location because her presence institutes it as a modelling show. The moving body, similar to the bridge, not only is able to \u201cfound space, but also has the ability to join them.\u201d \u00a0 As such the body of the model becomes a site for the preservation of the fourfold. Understanding this crucial relationship between body and space, Lucile, or Lady Duff Gordon formally, created the fashion show and both styled and trained her handpicked models. While the show was still reserved for the elite, its display had slowly begun to resemble the catwalks of today in that \u201cseveral mannequins modelled either together or one after the another.\u201d However, other key points of what makes the fashion show so fascinating was not yet present in the initial parades. While at present it is very important for the collection to speak for itself, previously, it was important to be explicit and thus \u201csales woman or couturier acted as a guide, talking customer through the dresses that were presented.\u201d Similarly, there is a big difference between the 20 minute fashion shows of today and Lucile\u2019s shows, which \u201coften lasting an hour and a half or more as clients would wait while the mannequins\u2019 hair and clothing was changed.\u201d Despite the slow pace of Lucile\u2019s early prototype, her shows were known to cause such sensation that both French couturier\u2019s started implementing the same elements and department stores started holding their own fashion shows.\u00a0   \u00a0 Having a naturally strong links to society, fashion has the ability to encompass not only shifting patterns of consumerism, but also has the power to act as a barometer of a changing world. This duality is best exemplified by Charles Worth\u2019s creation of the simple muslin dresses that were the basis of his quasi-industrial model, but also were designed to capture the \u201cprinciple movements of the body.\u201d Movement became a consideration in design not only for Worth, but also for other couturiers as a reaction of the 20th century. As both a reflection and an engine of modernism, \u201cfashion parades were a manifestation of the standardised presentation of the body\u201d in the context of the everyday life. Adapting to women\u2019s increasing role in both the working world as well as leisure activities, in which garments could no longer constrained the body, designers responded by becoming more attentive to the movement.   Fashion not only is capable of reflecting an era through the vision and inventiveness of the designer, but also has the power to condition and inform through the setting it is presented within. When the tango craze came to fashion, couturiers not only embraced the changes in design, but also showcased \u201cdresses in dance movements rather than customary walk.\u201d This change in setting demonstrates that designers were capable of recognising that fashion could be understood spatially, and conversely how this characteristic could be used as a mechanism to increase the brand\u2019s publicity. The couturier\u2019s ability to capture the setting parallels the skill with which Louis the XIV mathematically engineered the gardens of Versailles. Despite the fact that modelling occurred, and still occurs, in a semi-fixed space, the mathematical relations that gives both order and harmony to the gardens also dictated the fashion show\u2019s decor and the spacial relationship between the models and their audience. Therefore the \u00a0 mathematical sublime is essential in legitimizing the individuals employing the space. Couturiers, both in the past and present, seek to trade on the luxurious or the exotic and as such fashion shows are engineered to manipulate the senses. In early fashion shows, \u00a0 Mannequins modelled \u201cin a principle room that in turn led off to a suite of four or five linked rooms\u201d\u2026 ornamented in styles reminiscent to previous eras with both elegant furniture and lavish drapery. \u201cBy the late 1920s stage equipment with powerful lights, [artfully positioned mirrors, and stages ] that had been pioneered by Beer and Lucile in the 1900 were commonplace. \u00a0 The use of these lights allowed clients to see clothes in the setting they would be in, and consequently, creates an environment of possibilities. Thus the lighting allows the body and the mind to be open to the fantasies the fashion parade presents with beautifully designed garments. Once again vision, as an integral part in the construction of our consciousness, was targeted as models entered the room and their image was reflected as an illusion of what could be into the clients line of vision from multiple angles. Similar to the gardens, the spacial arrangements of the fashion show depicted a reality and did not \u201cassert truths but assumed and circulated them\u201d and did so by blurring the lines between reflection and reality.   By turning the fashion show into a spectacle, the space is able to \u201cencourage and discourage certain social processes.\u201d The power of design found in fashion shows is achieved because the spectacle is a ritual through which a metamorphosis of seeing and being seen takes place, it allows for the social agents of the fashion industry to become a second nature in the audience\u2019s formation. Even thought the purpose of fashion shows is to display the creative output of the designer, the audience themselves and their interaction with both the collection and each other are what governs modern fashion shows. As such the guest at these fashion shows are both the actors and the audience of society\u2019s everyday spectacle. This double role is best demonstrated by a series of elements that form the fashion shows as we know them today. An invitation only event, guest are carefully selected by the fashion house PR team. The seating arrangement is also key, it is through this distribution of bodies in and through \u00a0 space that the dominant discourse silently creates a hierarchical organization of those present. The \u2018front row\u2019 not only determines the importance of the fashion show, but also its outcome. It is reserved for the editors of fashion magazines, the elite fashionista, and more recently celebrity guests. Their presence not only gives them status within the industry, but also affirms the prestige of designer and his/her collection. More importantly, to the designer prestige is the gestures that the front row audience makes when the models come on to the catwalk. These nonverbal expressions determine if a collection will be praised or condemned by the industry, the press, and consequently the public.   Although creativity has been fashion\u2019s driving force, business men have been responsible for installing the industry\u2019s dominance over our daily life. Nevertheless, as the point of convergence between function and aesthetic, fashion is a representation of a changing world, thus its sublime nature does not lie on the end product, rather it is found in fashion\u2019s ability to function and communicate on different levels. The fashion show is where the numerous levels of meaning come together and are expressed. The show has this ability because its semi-fixed nature allows the elements of the fashion show to interact on a case by case basis. Constructed by a set of elements that define the event space, a runway; an audience; the models, each show is unique because of how elements are arranged in respect to one another and how they interact with one another.

Massive, megalomaniac structures built of cold granite littered Hitler\u2019s plans for the refashioning of Germany, emphasizing both his authoritarian power and the supremacy of Germany as a country. When Hitler came into power as Reich Chancellor of Germany in 1933, such plans were not yet officially underway, but by the time of his suicide in 1945, they would have been put into motion and partly constructed by Hitler\u2019s prized chief architect of the Reich, Albert Speer. With the goal of controlling the German peoples and spreading Nazi ideology, Hitler and Speer set out to transform the city of Berlin as well as the country into the most architecturally impressive center the world had ever seen.   Speer, who joined the Nazi Party in 1931, was appointed as the official architect for the Party as well as designer of rallies for Hitler. He was trusted by Hitler and devoted to him. By 1942, he was appointed minister of armaments and munitions. From his perspective, Speer displays how crucial and essential architecture was to the Nazi project: it was at the heart of Hitler\u2019s vision for Nazi Germany, with his ideas dating as prior to the war as the 1920s. Together, they sought to \u201ccreat[e] power through monumental spatial forms\u201d and exercise the party\u2019s \u201ccontrol of mobility via the architectural capture of mobility\u201d (Gordillo 2014). By constructing architecture that would act as such, the German people would be awed into submissiveness while the world would watch on in paralleled awe and, most essentially, fear.    Speer and Hitler (Gordillo 2014, Web)   Throughout Germany, several key designs stand as testament to Hitler\u2019s wishes of capturing the Nazi spirit through architecture. The most well known construction of Hitler\u2019s, the People\u2019s Hall or Volkshalle , was the centerpiece of his citywide creation. Meant to be a dome to house public events, the Volkshalle would have been 950 feet high with an occupancy of 180,000 people \u2013 it would have surpassed both the Roman Pantheon as well as the capitol building in Washington D.C. (Gordillo 2014). A second project was that of the Nuremberg stadium or party rally grounds, some of them still standing today as reminders of Hitler\u2019s search for control over the individual and the masses. Lastly, the New Reich Chancellery, dedicated officially in January 1939 with its marble gallery, pillars, and ballrooms, was meant as a final symbol for Hitler\u2019s power and the power of the state.   Structures such as the ones Hitler and Speer developed in Germany invoke questions that interweave politics and the influence it has on architecture. Similarly, when architecture and politics are so intimately related, how does this affect the masses and those who experience the architecture on a daily basis? Analysis of Hitler\u2019s architectural designs opens up a context for these questions, and in looking at specific characteristics of Nazi Germany structures there is hope for answering them. The imitation of classicism in the buildings\u2019 designs, the theories of weaponized architecture that shaped their planning, and the presence of political speech in architecture all culminate in the physical effects the buildings have on the body, creating an environment for discussion and for analysis.   While it has been seventy years since the close of World War II as well as Hitler\u2019s suicide, several of the architectures constructed during the Nazi era surpassed the lifespan of the war. Thus, a few questions to keep in mind while examining the structures of Nazi Germany include the intent of a building and how long that intent shapes the experience of it. How are contemporary and future generations affected by a building when its main function as a political tool has been nullified throughout the years? Does original intent exist beyond the forces that shaped a structure, or will the message conform to modern perceptions?   Imitation of Classicism   For Hitler, it was imperative that his buildings invoked awe. This, he felt, was best accomplished by their massive, colossal size and their resemblance to Greek and Roman ruins. The echoing of ancient civilizations in Nazi architecture was far from random, but was greatly influenced by Hitler\u2019s admiration of the civilizations whose buildings now stood in ruins. In his book, \u201cHitler\u2019s State Architecture: The Impact of Classical Antiquity\u201d, Alex Scobie describes Hitler\u2019s admiration of the Spartans as rooted in their ideologies of racial purity and militarism (Scobie 1990, 14). He equally viewed the Romans as the source of Aryan nations and correlated their scale and size of their powerful empire to the scale and size of their massive state buildings [Scobie 1990, 20-1]. Their military expertise and discipline would, as a result, add to Hitler\u2019s reverence of ancient Roman civilization and culture.    Comparisons between Greek Parthenon and the Volkshalle (Gordillo 2014, Web; Scobie 1990, 23)   Yet, while he may have agreed with their ideologies, he also worshipped them due to their encapsulation of authority through architecture. Particularly, Hitler loved the Parthenon and the encapsulation of personalities within it, such as Perikles, the architect Iktinos, and the sculptor Phidias [Scobie 1990, 16]. It was notably the Parthenon that led Hitler to believing that all great civilizations demonstrated their authority through colossal structures of frightening proportions. Thus, Greek architecture of Doric style became the inspiration for much of Nazi architecture. Also significant were the ways such structures impacted their audiences and the masses. For instance, the Nuremberg party rally grounds were largely based upon the Roman amphitheater, where \u201cas [the people] swayed backward and forward, [they] would feel themselves to be a single unity with one spirit\u201d (Scobie 1990, 19). This theme of uniting the peoples in one place under Hitler\u2019s dominion would run through all of Nazi architecture; the imposing and enormous size was just one tactic used to achieve this.   With such civilizations as inspiration, Speer produced what would become known as the \u2018Theory of Ruin Value\u2019 and went on to apply it to the buildings he designed. The theory was based upon the Roman and Greek structures and how their appearance as ruins today caused for feelings of awe and respect for the civilization (Macdonald 2006, 90). Essentially, if architecture decayed and left behind ruins, it only benefitted the civilization in question whose structures they were; as ruins, the buildings stood as reminders of the civilization\u2019s strength and durability. In this sense, Speer saw architecture\u2019s ability to \u2018speak\u2019 to generations. From excerpts from his written account of his position as chief architect, Speer writes that, \u201cUltimately all that remained to remind men of the great epochs of history was their monumental architecture\u2026Periods of weakness are bound to occur in the history of nations, but at their lowest ebb, their architecture will speak to them of former power\u201d (Speer 1970, 100-101). The ability of a building to speak and spread the messages behind their design was therefore consistently at the heart of Speer\u2019s theory. Like Perikles and the Parthenon, he wished to embody the \u2018great epoch\u2019 of Nazi Germany in the architecture he would leave behind: in the never constructed Volkshalle , the Nuremberg party rally grounds, the New Reich Chancellery, and many other projects that were to never be finished.   Weaponized Architecture   A civilization of monumental buildings converted into strategic weapons were precisely what Hitler imagined when he and Speer set out to reconstruct Germany: a city and weaponry becoming one. There would be no separation between the two, but interwoven into the culture of the city would be militaristic aims and weaponry in service of the Nazi party. As Friedrich Kittler states in his piece, \u201cThe City Is a Medium\u201d that through command centers, \u201cpower thus means occupying at the right moment the channels for technological data processing,\u201d there exists a connection between Hitler\u2019s command of Nazi architecture and the messages he wished these structures to convey. Because the structures of the Nazi Party were meant to encapsulate and convey Nazi supremacy and authority, he was therefore in control of the transference of messages from the state to the audience. In essence, Hitler can be described as the author of the Nazi ideology using architecture as the medium and the masses as its readers.   Here, the line is blurred between the cities of Germany, or at the least their architecture, and a weapon used at the Nazi Party\u2019s disposal. Prior to the Nazi architecture projects, it was thought to be that skyscrapers stood as the most distinctive affective weapon of capitalism, only forwarding the fact that as New York City skylines appeared, symbolic of the capitalistic and competitive nature, it was felt necessary that the Nazi Party should combat capitalistic America with architecture of a like aura (Gordillo 2014). Specifically for Speer and Hitler, their interests in weaponized architecture revolved around that of an \u2018apparatus of affective capture\u2019 nature \u2013 they desired for their structures and environments to \u201cexert pre-discursive, not fully conscious pressures on the body\u201d (Gordillo 2014). Rather than controlling and channeling the movement of bodies within a space, otherwise known as apparatuses of kinetic capture, they preferred to \u201cinculcate affective intensities on the bodies contemplating it\u201d (Gordillo 2014). There was less emphasis on the surveillance and control of the people and more upon the individual experience the person should have. Captivating his audiences was seen as just a different method of acquiring control over them. In this sense, it could be said that the war was fought on a very different front, that even the architecture of a city was considered as weaponry for the cause of war, as it would not only assist in acquiring followers and support, but would also intimidate those fighting against the Nazi Party.   Political Rhetoric   Hitler\u2019s speeches themselves were considered to reflect his architecture. His preferences were of \u201cexorbitant size and bombast in architecture to a general megalomania\u201d, equating his designs and speeches to \u201cboundless egotism and vanity\u201d (Stuart 1973, 255). Consequently, architecture became not just a weapon for the Nazi cause, but also a tool of rhetoric. Complementing his speeches, Hitler\u2019s structures were \u201chuge, hammeringly repetitious, banal, but filled with an inescapable, machine-like force\u2026with no perceptible sense of proportion, interval, space or even ornament\u201d (Stuart 1973, 255). It is probably no coincidence then that studies show had the Volkshalle been built, it would have caused for the ground underneath of it to give way (find source). Regardless, the designs Hitler and Speer constructed were all about presentation and spectacle, much like the rhetoric tools used.   \u201cStone slogans\u201d is how Hitler\u2019s architecture is often described: the buildings communicated with the audience Hitler\u2019s message possibly even more than his speeches and rallies did. In this light, the audience thus becomes the reader, and Hitler the author. What was so effective about utilization of architecture was its ability to reach all peoples. Unlike other forms of communication, it did not depend upon certain limitations, like literacy or accessibility, for example. Anyone who attended his rallies or witnessed the buildings could be affected and mesmerized by their immensity, their strength, and the power that Hitler desired to be conveyed.    Cathedral of Light and Zeppelinfeld Rally (RPH, Web)   Out of all of Speer\u2019s architectural plans, one of the most extravagant that Hitler utilized during his speeches was the infamous Lichtdom , or \u2018Cathedral of Light\u2019, a visual effect composed of 130 five-mile high searchlights at the Zeppelinfeld, a rally complex within the Nuremberg rally grounds (RHP). The lights themselves shot upwards and formed a series of vertical bars, effectively surrounding the audience and creating the illusion that they were locked within. This Cathedral of Light serves was as one of the many architectural devices Hitler used throughout his time as F\u00fchrer to command his audiences. With the Cathedral especially, a sacred and solemn environment was created with Hitler, by no coincidence, in the middle at a podium that was \u201cseen to be sent by Providence as a national savior\u201d (Documentation, Web). As the masses stood and listened to his impenetrable speeches, they felt imprisoned yet awed by the appearance of the lights and by the sheer size of Zeppelinfeld \u2013 tricks of Hitler\u2019s to ensue compliance.   \u00a0 Effects on the Body   These characteristics of Nazi architecture \u2013 their intended imitation of classicism, their dual-utilization as weaponry, and their role as enhancing political rhetoric \u2013 served as means to an end of effecting the human body of its observers and audiences. Most of all, through means of architecture, the goal was to \u201cdecrease the body\u2019s capacity for action by overwhelming it, stunning it, numbing it, making it malleable and, in short, politically passive \u201c (Gordillo 2014, Web). On this topic, Speer considers Nazi architecture as \u201cviolating the human scale\u201d; he argues that it was not so much their size that dominated the audience, for people had adapted to large structures such as skyscrapers, but it was rather their abnormal qualities of \u201cdwarfing the individual, and subsuming individual identity to the collective project\u201d (MacDonald 2006, 111). Essentially, one could not maintain his or her identity in the midst of such architecture. You became part of the collective, losing yourself to the awesomeness and fascination. This is not so difficult to imagine when taking a glimpse at any of the designs or standing buildings left today. They are imposing, awe-inspiring, and fear inducing \u2013 in other words, precisely what Hitler wanted his structures to do.   Emotionally, too, were the masses affected by the architecture. By melting the individual into the whole, it was supposed to stir up emotions of enthusiasm, awe, fascination and excitement (MacDonald 2006, 111). Such spontaneous and non-cognitive reactions were what helped to make party rallies so successful: mass hysteria ensued. However, it deserves to be mentioned that the resulting hysteria was \u201ccarefully controlled and channeled\u201d, because the \u201chard lines and strong axiality\u201d of the structures only permitted for so much room and freedom of movement, thus limiting the masses to only strict choreography (MacDonald 2006,112). Similarly to how Nazi architecture reflected Hitler\u2019s speeches and rallies, as depicted here, it also controlled the physical environment and numbed its audiences.   It is moreover striking that under this impression of architecture\u2019s ability to physically affect the masses, there was very little voluntariness involved. With Nazi ideology as the message and architecture as the medium, one in the audience could not simply turn away from the effects. They were very nearly impulsive, spontaneous, and instinctive. It would be almost impossible to be within the crowd but without participating or without feeling the effects of the buildings enclosing around you. Their numbing effect as well as their tendency to make audiences politically passive worked together to mold Hitler\u2019s readers into receptive, eager audiences.   Conclusion: Where does intent lie today?   The history of Nazi Germany is key when one considers the Party\u2019s architecture: Hitler felt in constant competition with the architecture of the Soviet Union, the Spanish, and the Americans to prove that the German state was the strongest. Accordingly, his Volkshalle was meant to combat the Palace of the Soviets, the Empire State Building, and the Spanish pavilion (Gordillo 2014, Web). Yet, out of this context, the intent of Nazi architecture evokes questioning. Do the remaining buildings, like the Zeppelinfeld Stadium ruins, inspire the same reactions they did seventy-five years ago, or is there a different sort of reaction today?    Zeppelinfeld Stadium then and now (Jennifer 2012, Web)   When architecture is constructed with a very specific goal in mind, it is worth wondering what occurs within the relationship between its audiences and its intent once the latter has been rendered irrelevant. With the Zeppelinfeld Stadium in particular, its intended use is no longer valid. Yet, such symbolism is carried within the structure: one cannot view the Zeppelinfeld remains without remembering their historical significance and utilization. We see here a shift in a structure\u2019s impact: where once the stadium was employed as a rhetoric tool and a weapon, it has now blended into the landscape as a vessel for its expired and purpose.

About Jaclyn A Shultz   Mail | More Posts (1)                              by Jaclyn A             cases    Uncategorized                    March 26, 2015           Work Spaces: The Cognitive Effects               The occupation of space is a familiar concept that arises when it is put into terms regarding where people are located, what they occupy, and why they reside in said capacities. Often, space is referred to in geographical terms. For example, it is commonly discussed in reference to an animal\u2019s territory or home (\u201cStudies in Personal Space,\u201d Robert Sommer, 1). However, when applied to the humans, the term \u201cspace\u201d is intertwined with the idea of \u201cpersonal space.\u201d This personalization of the physical world becomes a natural place where a person can become oriented with himself, and extend from the center outwards. This case will focus on the particular spaces people find themselves oriented in while working\u2014whether in more traditional environments such as libraries/office spaces or more nonconventional spaces such as coffee shops, we will study how these spaces affect the productivity of these people.     Traditional Spaces: The Office   Looking towards organizational theory as a foundation for understanding how structure and design can affect productivity, we can see how the design of workplaces are created to maximize work creativity and alleviate stress. In Organizational Theory: A Strategic Approch , B.J. Hodge states that \u201cSome theorists suggest that structure results from choices about technology; others suggest that structure is developed in response to environmental conditions that the organization faces; still others say that structure is the result of specific strategies (i.e. goals) that the organization seeks to pursue. Whichever view one subscribes to, the first step is to understand the concept of structure and the elements of which it is composed\u201d ( Organization Theory: A Strategic Approach, B.J. Hodge, 30).   The ideas of structure and design can be defined as such: structure , referring to the \u201csum total of the ways in which an organization divides its labor into distinct tasks and then coordinates them,\u201d and design , \u201cthe appearance of the organization\u201d (Hodge, 30). Although these two concepts are closely related, structure consists of two key elements: differentiation and integration. Differentiation refers to the different tasks that break up a work, and integration refers to, as the name suggest, the coordination of these tasks to make sure overall goals of an organization are achieved. Design, however, includes \u201cunit grouping, unit size, planning, and control systems, behavioral rules, policies, and procedures, decision-making, and centralization-decentralization issues\u201d (31). It is important to note that organizational theory demonstrates internal structure of an organization as its own entity in order to prescribe a certain environment that creates a work atmosphere. Different structural organizations create different climates and, as a result, the climate of the office. Below is a formal organizational chart:      Figure 1: Formal Organizational Chart   (Click Here for clearer picture of this, I can&#8217;t figure out why my image isn&#8217;t\u00a0transferring onto the site)   \u00a0   This chart depicts a top-down organization, controlled by the president. In an organizational context, the president would make the majority of the decisions at a work place regarding employee salary and benefits. John Vogel, professor of business administration at Dartmouth University, claims, \u201cthey [CEO or senior management team] assume that every employee wants more space and better views. The nicest space gets allocated to the most senior officers, and the balance gets distributed based on some kind of hierarchical process. Even in office environments that are designed to be egalitarian and where senior managers occupy cubicles or work at trading desks, the decision about the office layout still tends to be made at the top with little input from the employees\u201d (\u201cIs the Corner Office Worth It?,\u201d John Vogel, 1). Interestingly enough, when put into context, the top-down decision-making assumption that employees are equally productive in cubicles, desks, or private offices seems to be a bit ungrounded, as research indicates that there is a relationship between the quality of space and productivity.   In a revealing experiment by Tom DeMarco and Timothy Lister in Peopleware: Productive Projects and Teams , the researchers took 600 software developers at 92 different companies to complete a series of coding and testing tasks called the \u201cCoding War Games.\u201d Each participant worked on an exercise on his or her own and kept a log of the amount of time they spent. This was designed so companies could see how their programmers would compare to those at other companies.      Figure 2: Productivity Variation Among Individuals in the Coding Wars   \u00a0   The results (taken from DeMarco and Lister\u2019s book) demonstrated that the best programmers outperformed the worst in a 10 to 1 ratio, with an average of 2.5 times more productivity than median performers. Surprisingly, DeMarco and Lister did not find any correlation between years of experience and superior performance. Although \u201cthe data presented above does not exactly prove that a better workplace will help people perform better,\u201d the questionnaire DeMarco and Lister gave to those in the top quartile and bottom quartile reveal that those in the top had more positive experiences with their workplaces than those in the bottom (50).        Figure 3: Top Quartile vs. Bottom Quartile Workplace Questionnaire   Though the study might \u201cindicate that people who perform better tend to gravitate toward organizations that provide a better workplace,\u201d there is something to be said about the customization of the workplace in regards to the work that is being done. Because each work environment, and the contents of that work differ from office to office, maybe it is time for organizations to turn their attention to the space their workers are in in relation to the work that they are doing. In the hopes of increasing productivity, it might just be time to do something about this.     The Nonconventional Workplace   \u201cIt was a pleasant caf\u00e9, warm and clean and friendly, and I hung up my old waterproof\u00a0 on the coat rack to dry and put my worn and weathered felt hat on the rack above the\u00a0 bench and ordered a caf\u00e9 au lait. The waiter brought it and I took out a notebook from the pocket of the coat and a pencil and started to write.\u201d   \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 - A Moveable Feast by Ernest Hemingway     Perhaps the Lost Generation was up to something when they moved to Europe to escape the woes of American decay, but there is something promising in their decadence that still survives today: the modern caf\u00e9. Today, nonconventional work places such as coffeehouses or small cafes have become the hotspot for students, writers, and workers alike.   Internet use in public spaces is beginning to gain traction as many cafes now offer Wi-Fi, inviting customers to come by and do work. As Internet access becomes ubiquitous, coffee houses, as public spaces of work, play an increasing role in becoming representations of an evolution for workspaces.   In an interview conducted by The Guardian, author, journalist, and speaker, Malcolm Gladwell describes working in a caf\u00e9 as \u201cthe right kind of distraction.\u201d Though he has an office with the New Yorker magazine, he feels that it isolates himself from the social scene. \u201cIt\u2019s one of those modern skyscrapers where the core of the tower is all the guts of the building and office spaces around the edges which feels completely wrong because in a social space, people congregate in the middle. I felt like I was an exile when I was in the New Yorker Offices. I missed being connected\u201d (\u201cMy Workspace,\u201d 1).   So what\u2019s with all the talk about noise? In a study done by University of Chicago, researchers found that \u201ca moderate level of ambient noise is likely to induce processing disfluency or processing difficulty, which activates abstract cognition and consequently enhances creative performance\u201d (\u201cIs Noise Always Bad? Exploring the Effects of Ambient Noise on Creative Cognition,\u201d 758). That\u2019s not to say that a high level of noise can\u2019t cause distress; however, a healthy amount can contribute to one\u2019s creativity. Furthermore, in the study, researchers found that ambient noise was an important factor that affects creative cognition.   For example, in an experiment, researchers sought the beneficial effects of moderate vs. low levels of noise, and asked participants of the study to list as many creative uses of a brick they could conjure. The participants finished the task shortly after the background noise began to play, or after a delay. To measure arousal level, the researchers took two physiological measures, heart rate and blood pressure. Upon analysis, it was revealed that under moderate-noise conditions, heart rate was significantly higher when taken after the experiment began, than after a delay. Similar results were found for blood-pressure measurements. As a result, researchers found that moderate noise levels induced higher arousal (indicated by heart rate and blood pressure increases). In correlation with the amount of ideas generated, this led them to conclude that moderate noise levels induced higher creativity, as shown below in Figure 4.      Figure 4: Creativity Measure of Idea Generation in Relation to Noise Level     In an interview conducted with an NYU student who primarily does her work in caf\u00e9s, I asked sophomore, Emily Ho, about her work experiences at caf\u00e9s versus more traditional spots such as libraries or offices. Inquiring Emily about the kinesthetic energy of caf\u00e9s, I noticed how she brought up keywords such as \u201catmosphere\u201d and \u201cenergy\u201d that seem integral to the study of ambient noise and its affects on productivity. To Emily, the noise and movement in a coffee shop affects her work positively because \u201coften times, [she] finds people productively chatting and working and [she] likes the energy of a coffee shop to do homework in. There\u2019s also a subconscious association of a coffee shop of a certain style with productivity\u201d (E. Ho, personal communication, March 23, 2015). Regarding traditional work places, she asserted that \u201cpersonally [she didn\u2019t] like doing work in completely quiet spaces like libraries, and offices [gave her] more negative emotional responses.\u201d   The idea of emotional productivity came up once again when I asked her to compare her experiences working in coffee shops versus office environments. She stated, \u201cHonestly, it\u2019s really an emotional thing. I feel like the more \u2018freelance and entrepreneurial friendly\u2019 energy of a coffees shop suits my style of work and content of work most of the time. I think I feed positively off the \u2018productive\u2019 energy around me, regardless whether the people around me are doing work. There\u2019s a sense of focusing and taking time for yourself, or taking time to break and meet with others.\u201d She also mentioned that she generally felt at ease, relaxed, inspired, and more energized when working at coffee shops, and though silent libraries and study lounges made her feel more productive, these spaces came off as more daunting and more depressing.   \u00a0   Conclusion   Calling back the question of whether work spaces affect productivity, after some digging up, it is fair to say that positively or negatively, the spaces people work in generally affect the work they produce. Whether it is an empirical response such as Coding Wars in Peopleware , or an emotional attachment, there seems to be a correlation between the amounts of work a person produces and where they are creating the product.     \u00a0   Notes:     I would like to incorporate technology in this paper. I know there are some readings about technology and interiority coming up in class readings, so I am going to look through those documents and incorporate them into this piece.   Still need to incorporate pieces of class readings into my paper (which is why the above note is necessary).   I also am thinking of incorporating new kinds of office spaces that promote productivity (i.e. places like Google or Huge Inc. that have nonconventional offices to help their employees generate ideas and stay creative)                                     Works Cited   Deeble, Sandra. &#8220;My Work Space.&#8221; The Guardian .

About Tammy Hsu   Mail | More Posts (2)                              by Tammy Hsu             cases                    March 26, 2015           The Passage and the Canvas: New York City Transit               The various forms of transportation and how it has changed since it\u2019s beginning indicate just how important it is to mankind. Although the specific forms vary between different countries, it is nonetheless a quality that we all have in common. Since it\u2019s very beginning, there has been an urban shift in most countries where these forms of transportations have altered to fit the society\u2019s development. The transportations\u2019 shifts is analogous to urbanization where a population goes from rural to urban areas and are provided with innovative progress.   \u00a0The subway of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority\u00a0is New York City\u2019s biggest urban shift since it\u2019s first operation in 1904. The subway is not only a form of transportation but is also a sense of unity, comfort and cultural remembrance. With over 1.71 billion commuters relying on the system, the MTA connects the people in New York City and is entrusted to safely guide these individuals to their destinations. Regardless of background, the people of New York City are unified in that they have abided to the unspoken rule of the subways. The buried passage that the MTA provides, intertwines and connects them all together. This \u201cpassage\u201d almost defines the concept of subways as a whole. The word \u201cpassage\u201d can have several meanings, the most literal being the act or process of moving under something on the way from one place to another. However, passage can also mean the process of transition from one to another. And in another form, it could even be used as an episode in a longer activity. The MTA\u2019s passage is all of the above but most specifically the latter two.   One of the earliest NYC subway cars was named the Composite as it derived its name for being built as a \u201c protected wooden car.\u201d Although its frame was made of steel, the body itself was made from wood with a layer of copper skin that acts as a shield from potential fires in the subway. This subway car\u2019s seating was designed \u201cManhattan Style\u201d with eight seats in the center of the car and longitudinal benches down the rest of the car while there were no seats towards the end for entrance/exit. The lack of doors often created a mess and this design was altered various times to better accommodate the society\u2019s needs. Fast-forward to the 21 st century and there are now train cars made from stainless steel, benches all facing one another and boasts 4 doors on each side. This new design allows for easier access in both directions and more standing room. Despite the change in the design of the cars, the passage has nonetheless remained the same It acts as a time machine, almost as if it\u2019s teleporting one through the city. Upon entering the train cart, passengers are zipped away into darkness and within minutes reappear in another part of the city. This is an archetype of the transition that the passage allows from one to another. This transition is concealed unlike that of the subway\u2019s counterpart- the railroads. The railroads are exposed above ground, take up the space of potential occupants and allow an individual to witness the transition from one area to another. However, the subways maneuvers underground, causes little disruption to the above environment and is safely tucked away in a tunnel.   However, subways are not just a form of transportation but have begun morphing itself into an artwork, allowing the many strokes of culture to dress its canvas. Subway art allows passengers to create a visual image of the area before one exits the station and effectively describes the culture of the area. The use of this area to create murals and sculptures also creates a sense of familiarity by pinpointing a specific location and allowing passengers to be \u201cknowing.\u201d The array of artworks are formed not only to cater to the people\u2019s aesthetic diversion but also for promoting the culture and uplifts the success of the city. This art transforms the cold, dull and musky subway space to one that is welcoming and temporarily distracting. With the subway stopping at many locations throughout the city, each location has its own unique culture that the subway art brings out.   The Bryant Park station has one of the largest subway art pieces by Samm Kunce titled Under Bryant Park . Above ground is the location of the Main Library and Bryant Park, which is directly reflected in this artwork. The work acts as a foreshadowing of what is to come when these passengers reach the top of the stairs, leading to the ground level of the city. This artwork contains rock outcroppings, tree roots, and quotes making it an equal balance of the two main sites. In Broadway/Lafayette station, the work of Leo Villareal\u2019 titled Hive is a huge compilation of hexagon neon lights which boasts a fluent transition of warm and cool color palettes attracting the passenger\u2019s eyes. The artwork reflects the high-speed life that occurs above and through the station. The Wavewall of the New York Aquarium station is filled with curves and drops that emulate the nearby Cyclone roller coaster. As one walks by, they are prone to feeling like the walls and the stairways are dipping and swaying, similar to how one would feel on the Cyclone.   Even the abandoned Myrtle Avenue subway station has an artwork by Bill Brand titled Masstransiscope . The massive 300 feet long artwork resembles that of a giant zoetrope that garnered much popularity in New York during the 19 th century. There are fluorescent lights installed within, allowing passengers on the Q/B trains to view the changing artwork. This work utilizes the trains\u2019 fast speed to bring the art to life. Other abandoned stations are represented through their build up of graffiti that covers the majority of its walls. Graffiti in these areas have come to symbolize abandonment and declining service.   Subways are not only a form of transportation but also provide cultural space. Each artwork gives a space its own identity and allows the city opportunities to flaunt its uniqueness. The many types of arts involved from sculptures to paintings helps link the subway space to the ground level of the city. The artworks maximize the space and ensure that culture is preserved and spread. The passage allows passengers to experience cultural remembrance as they transition through various scenes of the New York City culture. Each station is a snippet of the whole, likewise, an \u201cepisode\u201d of the longer activity.    About Amanda Yang   Mail | More Posts (1)                              by Amanda Yang             Uncategorized                    March 26, 2015           Irving Place: Its Days and Nights               A TRANSITIONAL SPACE   During daytime, Irving Place is trapped under a constant gaze, a gaze coming from the statue of Edwin Booth in Gramercy Park that overlooks the place from afar. An ever-changing flow of pedestrians walks by Irving Place on a daily basis. Yet for most of them, Irving Place serves as a transitional space rather than a destination. Whether it is the people walking to Union Square for work in early morning, young crowds buying drinks at bars at night, or those residents who return home after a long day of tedious chores, the outside physical space of Irving Place, namely, the streets, is used for the mere purpose of transportation. As people walk into their destinations and close the door behind them, they unconsciously draw a line between the spaces: an inside space and an outside space. The history of Irving Space, the gaze of Edwin Booth, along with every physical entity on the street are excluded from the inside; only subtle noise of vehicles passing by could remind them of the outside world. While sundry events take place within the buildings, the physical space outside the buildings has always been quiet and remains undisturbed. However, everything on Irving Place changes when dusk arrives. The gaze from Edwin Booth is no longer visible as the light gets dim; Irving Place has become a place for gathering. People start sitting at the outdoor dining tables of by the restaurants and bars, chatting away a day\u2019s worth of triviality. Eager music lovers start lining up at the side of the Irving Place Theatre at East 15 th Street, waiting for an eventful night. Although the nighttime crowds break the tranquility of the daytime, Irving Place is still able to maintain its stillness, and therefore offers a place for a getaway from the tumultuous city life.   Upon entering Irving Place, the pedestrians have officially entered an undiscovered realm of the City; the noises of car honks are subdued, and a new world has unfolded itself in front of them. Sandwiched between Third Avenue and Park Avenue, enclosed between Gramercy Park and Union Square, Irving Place rests in a protected zone that is excluded from the clamor. It is a segmented avenue and it encompasses Irving Place Historic District that stretches from East 14 th Street to East 17 th Street. Irving Place may not be as alluring as Union Square or as mysterious as the Gramercy Park, yet its sunlight-filled streets with beautifully designed buildings that never fail to manifest their unique charm. As a transitional space, Irving Place successfully functions as a junction that links two distinct neighborhoods and enables a smooth transition from one place to another. My first encounter with Irving Place was in a warm spring afternoon, when I walked from Midtown to Union Square. I chose to take an unusual routine to walk toward Gramercy Park from Lexington Avenue. After going around the park, I had my first glimpse at Irving Place. I saw a district with a mix of residential buildings, restaurants and bars, all of which were bathed under gentle sunlight. Few pedestrians walked past multi-story stone brick buildings with burgundy and dusty beige colors; as one of the pedestrians that happened to walk by, I was amazed by the unfamiliar. The beautiful apartment tower at 81 Irving Place, Pete\u2019s Tavern, Friends Of A Farmer Caf\u00e9, Bedford Cheese Shop, Irving Place Theatre and Washington Irving High School, the buildings of different architectural styles combined altogether formed a view that was aesthetically pleasing to the eyes. Yet the very moment of stepping out of Irving Place, I was facing the tumultuous crowds in Union Square. There were cars and taxies rushing by, fast-paced walkers with anxiety to get to their destinations, and the penetrating smell of street cart food brought me back to reality. I would be convinced if anyone told me that my stay at Irving Place was a dream; nonetheless it left so much trace on my memory.   MEMORY AND OBLIVION   The layout of Irving Place is like any other New York City district with vertical streets ascending in numerical order, and such orderliness establishes a clean geometrical space, as French historian Michel de Certeau argues, a space that serves as a foundation for things to be built upon (100). De Certeau also asserts that the act of walking actualizes the space and \u201cthe walkers transforms each spatial element\u201d (97-98). Yet in Irving Place, the pedestrians are not granted as much power as the space brings itself to the frontal view. With the relative scarcity of human presence, Irving Place\u2019s orderliness and openness are accentuated due to its exclusion from the city crowds. Italo Calvino\u2019s novel Invisible Cities describes imaginary cities that do not exist on the planet. Under the subchapter of Cities &amp; Memory, he describes Zora as a city that \u201chas the quality of remaining in your memory point by point, in its succession of streets, of houses along the streets\u2026though nothing in them possesses a special beauty or rarity\u201d (15). My impression of Irving Place resonates with the description of Zora. As one of the most depicted cities in the movies, New York City owns countless beautiful places. The buildings on Irving Place are beautiful, but they are by no means rare or special or architecturally unique when being compared with other buildings in the City. Oddly, the atmosphere of Irving Place has been lingering on my mind since my first visit, and I have been compelled by an urge to visit it over and over again. It is a hidden place, but it is not engulfed and overwhelmed by the intimidating city noises or crowds. It is a place of its own. It is undisturbed. Most importantly, it is real despite the fact that it has been shielded from the clamor. Calvino states that Zora has disappeared and obliterated as it remained still (16), similarly, Irving Place\u2019s tranquility and stillness also makes it vulnerable to oblivion. Nonetheless, the tranquility also enabled people to appreciate its beauty and historical charm, leisurely gazing over the details without feeling rushed by fast-walking pedestrians. To enter Irving Place from 14 th Street, pedestrians need to enter through the space between the tower of Con Edison Company building and the Zeckendorf Towers. As they enter, the clock on the Con Edison tower, which constantly reminds pedestrians of the elapsing time, has disappeared from their sight. Therefore the pedestrians are freed from the constraints of being urged and the need to combat with time.   DAYTIME   As mentioned before, Irving Place differs in day and night. Without bar crowds and music lovers, the buildings on the street appear to be more solemn and are able to emit their historical aura. The buildings on Irving Space clash in their texture and pattern, yet when juxtaposed altogether, it almost seems like they are composed into a symphony with harmonious rhythmic flow. Walking from East 14 th street to East 17 th Street, the buildings are mostly for administrative, corporative and educational purposes. It does not take long for pedestrians to notice the ubiquity of columns of the buildings on those streets. Starting from the entrance of Con Edison tower, six marble cylinder columns were erected to form equidistant space in the entry porch. As pedestrians keep walking, they encounter New York Sports club, Washington Irving High School and N.Y.C. Human Resources Administration that also utilize column to form their official entrances. The use of columns is significant not only because of its aesthetic, magnificent appeal, but also due to the fact that it establishes the rhythm of the space. Columns create symmetry, linearity and orderliness in a geometrical space; they help to establish a sense of solemnity and sublimity, as if the act of entering a building has become a formalized ritual. At the same time, such solemnity repulses the outsiders and unauthorized people from entering. The columns obstruct space by dividing it, forming a barrier between the inside and the outside. De Certeau brings up the discourse of \u201cheight\u201d both in an architectural sense and in the notion of power dynamics. He argues that corporative powers that locate on high-rise buildings exert their power over the pedestrians who are on the ground level (91-92). Although the concept of \u201cheight\u201d does not apply on Irving Place, it is interesting to note that besides the mere height, the entrance level of buildings themselves could also intensify a distancing effect, as the buildings are designed to assert authority. Washington Irving High School, a gigantic symmetrical brick building that takes up an entire block between East 16 th Street and East 17 th Street, utilizes columns for its entrance porch to establish solemnity that is appropriate for an academic environment. Without noticing the fence and the gate, it is easy to mistake the school for a residential apartment. Yet when examined carefully, people start to see the icon bust statue of whom the school was named after, Washington Irving, on the corner of East 17 th Street. The fa\u00e7ade of the building is symmetrical with an American flag on the top of the building, and the most eye-catching feature, the two-story-tall entrance gate is located in the center with front stairs. The four columns are the most conspicuous features; the lunette above the columns forms a concavity that adds more depth and dimension to the building. The engraving of \u201cWashington Irving High School\u201d is right above the lunette as a statement to enter the intellectual world, a sacred place to gain knowledge. The design is enhanced by the use of dark red gate with hollowed out decorative patterns. The contrast between the red gate and the ivory fa\u00e7ade creates a visual contrast that accentuates classic. Despite its beauty, the magnificence of the entrance gate labels an protected zone that is not for transgression.   Walking past the corporative buildings to enter the historical area, at the intersection between East 17 th Street and Irving Place, the three-story high building at 49 Irving Place captures every pedestrian\u2019s attention. Its vivid red color stands out among other buildings. In the Irving Historic District designation report by Gale Harris and Jay Shockley in 1998, it is stated that majority of the buildings on Irving Place were built in early 19 th Century and they were designated in Greek Revival style and Italiante style (3). Moreover, Harris and Shockley argue that the building at 49 Irving Place \u201cis the most architecturally distinctive in the historic district because of its canopied porch, intricate entranceway, and cast ironwork, added after the original Greek Revival house was enlarged and remodelled\u201d (4). Located right next to the N.Y.C. Human Resources Administration building, which is an ivory high-rise with column-supported entrance porch, 49 Irving Place in comparison looks small yet still charming in its own way. The cast ironwork and canopied porch are highlights of the building; the red bricks are simple and classic, yet the ironwork and porch are creative twists within the simplicity, adding elaborate touches to the design. Moreover, East 17 th street is occupied by row houses with similar architectural style. Like the columns, the row houses also help to reinforce the rhythm flow of the space. When facing a street with row houses, pedestrians see a linear, impeccable arrangement that is pleasing to the eyes. A space with too many architecturally identical buildings could be monotonous and unexciting; with a balanced combination of uniform row houses and individually unique buildings, pedestrians are constantly attracted by details as they walk past different buildings. From East 18 th Street and above, there are various restaurants and bars from classical American style to Japanese sushi restaurants that serve to enrich people\u2019s nightlife.   \u00a0 NIGHT   The arrival of the night vivifies Irving Place. Besides the transitional nature of Irving Place, it has also become a place that transforms from day to night, unleashing different sides of itself. As the darkness blurs the details of the buildings along with their history, Irving Place has transformed into a space that is for entertainment purposes. Its historical past has been obscured but not completely eliminated; it connects to the present to influence people\u2019s cultural practices. After work, people start arriving at bars, restaurants, music venue and shops, occupying the once tranquil space. While most activities take place inside the buildings, the outside space also starts to become lively as the streetlights are lit, and the overlapping chatting voice of people who sit at outside dining tables warms up the space. Pete\u2019s Tavern, the alleged oldest operating bar in New York City and a to-go bar for O. Henry, locates in the corner of East 18 th Street. Decorated in black and gold and having EST. 1864 under its name, Pete\u2019s Tavern certainly takes pride in its rich history. (to be finished)     NOTES:   My plan is to visit the site a couple more times (during both day and night) to make more detailed observations of the architectural design of the buildings, as well as how pedestrians utilize the space and their relationship with the buildings. I will go into at least one of the restaurants to observe their space design, and most importantly, to gain a more in-depth insight regarding social and cultural practices that take place at Irving Place.     Questions to be answered:   How does people\u2019s social and cultural practices differ from day and night at Irving Place?   What role does the history of Irving Place play in terms of influencing people\u2019s way of engaging with it?

About Yi Ting   Mail | More Posts (2)                              by Yi Ting             Uncategorized                    March 26, 2015           Utilizing Architecture and Space as Advertisement               New York City is constantly saturated with noises, images, and people. In the midst of it all are the\u00a0advertisements. Billboards, subways, bus stops &#8211; these are just a few of the places where advertisements are strategically placed. While they might not be paid much attention to or ultimately remembered, New York City is a city that receives heavy traffic due to the sheer amount of people that drive and walk (mostly the latter). Some locations, such as Times Square, are undoubtedly targeted for overt advertisement with their flashy lights and advertisements pasted everywhere. Other places are more subtle, but all of Manhattan is being used.   Times Square is the synecdoche of New York. Tourists flock to Times Square at a terrifying pace and quantity. Residents of the city have learned to avoid directly walking through Times Square if at all possible, but some of the important buildings reside there. This is an area that truly never seems to sleep &#8211; and if it does, it is not for long. What should be an open space seems suffocatingly small due to the sheer mass of people that pass by every day. Tall, thick shopping buildings and familiar chain restaurants are located there. Advertisements of all kinds are posted on walls, flashing on screens right and left, and rise high in the air on billboards. Usually the products/brands that are being advertised also have their stores in the vicinity. When people are lost in crowded places like Times Square, their instinct is to look up. And what do they see when they crane their gazes upwards in hopes to catch a glimpse of a street sign? An advertisement is always in their background.   As previously mentioned, there are more subtle ways that advertisements are being placed around the city to subliminally reach to the pedestrians. In a city where most of its residents walk or take public transportation, posters of advertisements are placed strategically where they would linger. Bus stops have posters on both the outside and inside. Subways have mini-billboards on top of their subway stop signs that is advertising one thing or another, and it doesn&#8217;t stop there. Once a pedestrian is forced to stop moving and remain in one spot, there are more ads to see within their compartment. Underground, advertisements are stuck and defaced on the subway walls, and that extends to inside the subway train as well. Buses also carry ads on the inside and outside, giving both its riders and the outside viewers advertisements to look at.   Question: How does New York City utilize its space and buildings to showcase advertisements?   I narrowed it down to:   Using physical buildings/walls\u00a0   Using transportation (mobility) such as taxis, subways, etc.   Using specific location   Using space (air), such as billboards   &#8230; with the intent of using the works of de Certeau, Nye, Calvino, and Ong to discuss how this redefines space. Are they creating new definitions of space by using advertisements that rise high up in the air that would otherwise be unoccupied? Why do they place advertisements in places that they do now? Or is the architecture around us directing people on how to perceive and place advertisements?
