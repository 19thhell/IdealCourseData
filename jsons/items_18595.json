Innovations in X-ray detector technology, particularly two-dimensional area detectors, have played an important role in expanding the utility of X-ray diffraction. The Bruker/NYU Diffraction Workshop and its accompanying Master Class will span two days at New York University, with lectures as well as hands-on training on a state-of-the art Bruker GADDS microdiffractometer and other Bruker X-ray instruments. The Workshop will include lectures from various academic, government, and industrial organizations with a wide range of experience in X-ray diffraction and its applications. The hands-on Master Class will be taught by Bruker scientists and NYU personnel. Faculty, undergraduate and graduate students, postdocs, and industrial scientists are invited to register. Attendees are encouraged to bring samples of interest to the workshop for the hands-on training Master Class, and scientific problems to the round-table discussion.

(You may click here to browse the old webpage.)    The X-Ray Diffraction Facility (XDF) is dedicated to materials identification and characterization through Single-crystal and Powder X-Ray Diffraction (SXRD and PXRD) analysis. Researchers may have analysis done by the facility specialist or perform the work by themselves after training (certain restrictions may apply to external users).    The Bruker AXS SMART APEXII Single Crystal Diffractometer was acquired through the support of the Molecular Design Institute in the Department of Chemistry at New York University. The Bruker AXS D8 DISCOVER GADDS X-Ray Microdiffractometer was acquired through the support of the National Science Foundation CRIF Program under Award Number CHE-0840277 and the NSF MRSEC Program under Award Number DMR-0820341 .
