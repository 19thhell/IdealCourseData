Most of what we    do, think and feel depends on our understanding of what it means to be    male or female, and on the different expectations people have for men and    women. Every aspect of the institutions, opportunities, and ideas    around us are permeated by gender differences. Our goal is to make    sense of this. Some of the questions we address are:             What do we mean by gender inequality? How does it arise?     Why does it take different forms? Why do some societies have    greater equality than others? How do the various institutions    like the family, the economy and religion affect the social position of    women and men? How do the direct relations between women and    men--as friends, brother and sister, lovers, spouses, parent and child,    colleagues, boss and employee--depend on or affect the social positions    of women and men? Why and when does sex inequality change?             On completing the course, students will know how to assess the major    social and intellectual questions raised by the issue of sex inequality.    Through intensive reading and discussion, this course will give    students the intellectual tools needed to understand and talk about sex    inequality knowledgeably and perceptively. This course also    promotes the growth of general skills in theoretical criticism and social    analysis.         Requirements:         All students must attend class consistently and punctually, join in    class discussion, write brief papers, prepare a \"gender social biography\"    term paper, take quizzes, and take a final exam.         All students should take part in class discussion and those who do an    outstanding job will receive extra credit.         Each student will write a \"gender social biography\" for a term paper.    This paper will try to show how your identity and experiences have    been shaped in conformity with gender expectations and how they have    defied or ignored them. The paper will take into account the various    kinds of social influences and experiences studied in this class.    During the semester, students will write brief gender biography    \"chapters\" for each section of the course, relating the subject of that    section to their gender biography. These will then be incorporated and    revised into the final term paper. Details about the gender social    biography are on another page .    No late papers will be accepted under any conditions.         A final examination will take place in class and cover all of the    course material. This examination will focus on the main ideas of    the materials we read and discuss in class.         Expectations:         A class is a collective learning enterprise. We must all act    responsibly and with decorum or the enterprise fails. We must each try to    avoid making the class less pleasant for others. This means we come    to class on time, pay attention, and avoid disruptive actions such as    talking to those in adjoining seats, eating noisily, and the like.     We will have a lot of discussion, some among all in class, some in    groups. Everyone is always free to disagree with other people's    ideas, but we should all treat everyone else and their ideas    respectfully. Plagiarism or academic dishonesty of any kind will    not be tolerated.

Study Questions                   What do people commonly mean by the distinction between     \u201cgender\u201d and \u201csex?\u201d          Why do people studying gender inequality stress a     distinction between \u201cgender inequality\u201d and \u201cgender     differences?\u201d          While making sense of gender inequality, why do we need to     keep in mind other forms of inequality within a society?          What is the difference between status inequality and     positional inequality?          Why do some authors suggest that the rise of women\u2019s status     over the past two centuries might be considered a paradox while     others suggest that the persistence of gender inequality in recent     decades might be viewed as a paradox?          In what ways has gender inequality declined over the past     150 years?          What are principal ways that gender inequality persists in     the U.S. and similar \u201cmodern\u201d nations according to our sources?          What does Jackson mean when he says that \u201ctwo kinds of     social conflict fueled the decline of gender     inequality\u201d?          What do we mean when we say women and men are     unequal?          What do we mean by saying that women and men have competing     ideologies or myths about gender?          What is the difference between distributional differences     and categorical differences when we are comparing the characteristics     of two groups?          What is problematic about the common cultural explanations     of \u201cdeceptive distinctions\u201d between women and men?          How does \u201cframing\u201d work in Ridgeway\u2019s     analysis?                             II. How is gender inequality symbolized and reproduced in    everyday life?

How does gender inequality in modern society influence the power     most men feel they have?          What do people mean when they say institutions are gendered?          Why might some argue that Freud\u2019s theory attributed key gender     differences to biology while others argue that it did not?          How is it possible that gender identity (whether we are male or     female and what it means to be either) is learned (not inherent or     biological), but that we experience it as natural and     unchangeable?          What did Gilligan claim about the relationship between gender and     ethics, and why has the claim been controversial?          How would you explain the term \u201csex roles?\u201d          How does Dozier\u2019s study raise questions about standard ways of     distinguishing \u201csex\u201d from \u201cgender\u201d or claims that gender is socially     constructed by people \u201cdoing gender\u201d in interactions?          What is the \u201cgender similarities hypothesis\u201d and how do research     findings support or not support it?          According to Ridgeway, how are gender stereotypes related to a     general problem of coordinating social interactions? (And can     you identify any serious problems with Ridgeway's argument about this     proposed relationship? This part is very high difficulty.)          How, according to Ridgeway might the existence of framing lead to     social inequality?          According to Ridgeway what is the difference between specific     status beliefs and diffuse status beliefs?                             III.

How has the popularity of     biological explanations varied across historical periods and     cultures?          How is the work of evolutionary psychologists relevant to     the study of gender inequality, and what limits the value of its     contribution?          What seems to be the historical pattern of motives behind     brain research and hormonal research concerned with gender (and     sexuality) differences, and the results they find?          What was the influential argument that Margaret Mead     presented in 1935 book Sex and Temperament in Three Primitive     Societies?          Why are those who study gender inequality so concerned with     the division of labor?          When comparing across societies, what are some of the     conditions that seem to correlate with or indicate high levels of     gender inequality?          What do we know about the relationship between testosterone     levels and violent behavior?          According to Herdt, what is the significance of \u201ccoming     out\u201d rituals?          How does it make sense to think about the role of biology     in the origins of gender inequality?

Study Questions                   Summarize important changes in women\u2019s economic     participation over the past 150 years. Among other things, it is     useful to consider differences by period, by type of women, and by     type of job.          How does the movement of women into traditionally male jobs     compare to the movement of men into traditionally female jobs?          How does employment potentially serve as a source of pride,     obligation, resources, negative identity for men and for women?      The goal here is to think through the reasons that women and men seek     and hold jobs and the effects that having (or not having) those jobs     have upon them.          What contributes to the wage/income differential between     women and men?          Explain the \u201cglass ceiling.\u201d          How did goverment policies, laws, and actions influence     women's changing employment in the twentieth century?          According to Ridgeway, how have framing processes     influenced the jobs into which women are hired, women\u2019s promotions,     and women\u2019s wages/salaries?          Why is the analysis of \u201ctokenism\u201d important for     understanding changes in women\u2019s economic participation?          What seem to be the causes and the effects of sexual     harassment?          How can we explain how women\u2019s economic participation has     changed over the long term? Consider the motives and the     actions of women, ordinary men, and powerful men. Also consider     the difference between women\u2019s movement into low-status jobs and     their movement into high-status jobs.          According to Reskin, what causes women\u2019s wages or income to     be lower than that of men, and how does that argument relate to the     ideas present in other readings this week?          How have different kinds of discrimination influenced     women\u2019s experiences in the economy?                             IX. Political processes and individual action.

Why do we want to distinguish between ordinary and powerful men while explaining the     persistence and decline of gender inequality?          Responding to changing circumstances, women and men sometimes      adopted new strategies or changed their typical behavior in ways      that contributed to gender inequality\u2019s decline over time.      However, even as they contributed to gender inequality's decline,      they typically did not seek to reduce gender inequality, commonly      did not favor a change in gender expectations, and often did not      even recognize that their actions could or would affect gender      inequality. So, how do we explain this pattern?          Why has men\u2019s defense of gender inequality declined over the past     150 years?          How have the goals of feminist movements been compatible      with (the effects and requirements of) long-term structural      changes in the U.S. and other modern societies? And in what      ways have their goals been in conflict with that long-term      trajectory          Assess the reasoning behind these two claims: \u201cmen have probably     sustained their gender advantages more through competition with other     men than through efforts to keep women from enjoying similar     opportunities or status\u201d; \u201cmen resisting women\u2019s advance      [typically] understood themselves to be fulfilling their      obligations or protecting well-earned rights\u201d.          How did both ordinary men\u2019s interests in opposing improvements in     women\u2019s status and their capacity to do so change over     time?           Writers have suggested that men long opposed women\u2019s movement     into high-status jobs (and women\u2019s access to higher education that     would prepare them for such jobs) because adding women would increase the     competition men would face for promotions and the like. Why is this a     strong or weak argument?          Why are culturally derived beliefs and rational calculations both     important for understanding changes over time in men\u2019s typical     actions that affected gender inequality? (Note that the same question     can be asked about women\u2019s typical actions.)          If most men in positions of organizational power share a     discriminatory attitude towards women, why do we expect any men with     similar organizational power who do not share these discriminatory     biases still to act (in their jobs) largely like their discriminatory     colleagues? (Note this question relates to the general problem of why     people conform, but in this question focuses on the causes specific     to the context of organizational power.)          What do analysts mean by the \u201cmale rebellion\u201d against marriage in     the second half of the twentieth century, and why might it have     occurred?           Why did men in government think differently about the woman     suffrage issue than ordinary male voters? How does this compare     to differences between the ways that employers\u2019 thought about hiring     women and the ways that male workers thought about it?          How do we explain women\u2019s difficulties at achieving economic     power through entrepreneurial success, rising through organizational     ranks, or inheriting wealth?          How do we explain women\u2019s difficulties at achieving political     power, both as individuals and collectively?          How have feminist efforts contributed to the reduction in gender     inequality, and how have those efforts fallen short?                             X.

Cancian                       Study Questions                   What do we mean by institutional     individualism?           How does the impact on family organization made by the rise     of modern education compare to the impact of the rise of modern     industry?           What are the highlights of women\u2019s changing educational     opportunities in the U.S. over the past 150 years?          With respect to the U.S. experience, in what ways is it     likely that the education offered to women and men (at various     levels) influenced gender inequality over the past 150     years?          What were the major influences responsible for the rise of     meritocratic ideas and their increasing     influence?           Why does Ridgeway stress it is important not only that we     hold stereotypical beliefs about gender, but that we can take it for     granted that others hold them as well?          According to Ridgeway, what are the most basic, shared     beliefs about differences between women and men in our culture (we     are concerned with the content of the beliefs, not the     terminology)?          What, according to Ridgeway, decides which gender     stereotypes are embodied in popular beliefs about the differences     between women and men?          Why do people who privately hold \"alternative\" gender     beliefs seemingly still commonly act on the basis of the dominant     beliefs, particularly in their \u201cpublic\u201d     lives?           Why did the ideologies of female domesticity change over     time?          If men did not impose the content of the successive     ideologies of female domesticity, what     did?           What common characteristics of the otherwise diverse ideals     of female domesticity made them seem to work for both women and men     and for the acceptability of gender inequality to     both?          With respect to the determination of dominant ideologies,     what is the relevant common underlying idea in the Marxist concept of     \u201cdetermination within limits\u201d, the Weberian idea of \u201celective     affinity\u201d, and Merton\u2019s concept of \u201cfunctional     alternatives?\u201d          What does Cancian mean when she says, \u201cPart of the reason     that men seem so much less loving than women is that their behavior     is measured with a feminine ruler\u201d?

Most of what we    do, think and feel depends on our understanding of what it means to be    male or female, and on the different expectations people have for men and    women. Every aspect of the institutions, opportunities, and ideas    around us are permeated by gender differences. Our goal is to make    sense of this. Some of the questions we address are:             What do we mean by gender inequality? How does it arise?     Why does it take different forms? Why do some societies have    greater equality than others? How do the various institutions    like the family, the economy and religion affect the social position of    women and men? How do the direct relations between women and    men--as friends, brother and sister, lovers, spouses, parent and child,    colleagues, boss and employee--depend on or affect the social positions    of women and men? Why and when does sex inequality change?             On completing the course, students will know how to assess the major    social and intellectual questions raised by the issue of sex inequality.    Through intensive reading and discussion, this course will give    students the intellectual tools needed to understand and talk about sex    inequality knowledgeably and perceptively. This course also    promotes the growth of general skills in theoretical criticism and social    analysis.         Requirements:         All students must attend class consistently and punctually, join in    class discussion, write brief papers, prepare a \"gender social biography\"    term paper, take quizzes, and take a final exam.         All students should take part in class discussion and those who do an    outstanding job will receive extra credit.         Each student will write a \"gender social biography\" for a term paper.    This paper will try to show how your identity and experiences have    been shaped in conformity with gender expectations and how they have    defied or ignored them. The paper will take into account the various    kinds of social influences and experiences studied in this class.    During the semester, students will write brief gender biography    \"chapters\" for each section of the course, relating the subject of that    section to their gender biography. These will then be incorporated and    revised into the final term paper. Details about the gender social    biography are on another page .    No late papers will be accepted under any conditions.         A final examination will take place in class and cover all of the    course material. This examination will focus on the main ideas of    the materials we read and discuss in class.         Expectations:         A class is a collective learning enterprise. We must all act    responsibly and with decorum or the enterprise fails. We must each try to    avoid making the class less pleasant for others. This means we come    to class on time, pay attention, and avoid disruptive actions such as    talking to those in adjoining seats, eating noisily, and the like.     We will have a lot of discussion, some among all in class, some in    groups. Everyone is always free to disagree with other people's    ideas, but we should all treat everyone else and their ideas    respectfully. Plagiarism or academic dishonesty of any kind will    not be tolerated.

How does gender inequality in modern society influence the power     most men feel they have?          What do people mean when they say institutions are gendered?          Why might some argue that Freud\u2019s theory attributed key gender     differences to biology while others argue that it did not?          How is it possible that gender identity (whether we are male or     female and what it means to be either) is learned (not inherent or     biological), but that we experience it as natural and     unchangeable?

What is the \u201cgender similarities hypothesis\u201d and how do research     findings support or not support it?          According to Ridgeway, how are gender stereotypes related to a     general problem of coordinating social interactions? (And can     you identify any serious problems with Ridgeway's argument about this     proposed relationship? This part is very high difficulty.)          How, according to Ridgeway might the existence of framing lead to     social inequality?

Study Questions                   Summarize important changes in women\u2019s economic     participation over the past 150 years. Among other things, it is     useful to consider differences by period, by type of women, and by     type of job.          How does the movement of women into traditionally male jobs     compare to the movement of men into traditionally female jobs?          How does employment potentially serve as a source of pride,     obligation, resources, negative identity for men and for women?      The goal here is to think through the reasons that women and men seek     and hold jobs and the effects that having (or not having) those jobs     have upon them.          What contributes to the wage/income differential between     women and men?          Explain the \u201cglass ceiling.\u201d          How did goverment policies, laws, and actions influence     women's changing employment in the twentieth century?          According to Ridgeway, how have framing processes     influenced the jobs into which women are hired, women\u2019s promotions,     and women\u2019s wages/salaries?          Why is the analysis of \u201ctokenism\u201d important for     understanding changes in women\u2019s economic participation?          What seem to be the causes and the effects of sexual     harassment?          How can we explain how women\u2019s economic participation has     changed over the long term? Consider the motives and the     actions of women, ordinary men, and powerful men. Also consider     the difference between women\u2019s movement into low-status jobs and     their movement into high-status jobs.          According to Reskin, what causes women\u2019s wages or income to     be lower than that of men, and how does that argument relate to the     ideas present in other readings this week?          How have different kinds of discrimination influenced     women\u2019s experiences in the economy?                             IX. Political processes and individual action.

Why do we want to distinguish between ordinary and powerful men while explaining the     persistence and decline of gender inequality?          Responding to changing circumstances, women and men sometimes      adopted new strategies or changed their typical behavior in ways      that contributed to gender inequality\u2019s decline over time.      However, even as they contributed to gender inequality's decline,      they typically did not seek to reduce gender inequality, commonly      did not favor a change in gender expectations, and often did not      even recognize that their actions could or would affect gender      inequality. So, how do we explain this pattern?          Why has men\u2019s defense of gender inequality declined over the past     150 years?          How have the goals of feminist movements been compatible      with (the effects and requirements of) long-term structural      changes in the U.S. and other modern societies? And in what      ways have their goals been in conflict with that long-term      trajectory          Assess the reasoning behind these two claims: \u201cmen have probably     sustained their gender advantages more through competition with other     men than through efforts to keep women from enjoying similar     opportunities or status\u201d; \u201cmen resisting women\u2019s advance      [typically] understood themselves to be fulfilling their      obligations or protecting well-earned rights\u201d.          How did both ordinary men\u2019s interests in opposing improvements in     women\u2019s status and their capacity to do so change over     time?           Writers have suggested that men long opposed women\u2019s movement     into high-status jobs (and women\u2019s access to higher education that     would prepare them for such jobs) because adding women would increase the     competition men would face for promotions and the like. Why is this a     strong or weak argument?          Why are culturally derived beliefs and rational calculations both     important for understanding changes over time in men\u2019s typical     actions that affected gender inequality? (Note that the same question     can be asked about women\u2019s typical actions.)          If most men in positions of organizational power share a     discriminatory attitude towards women, why do we expect any men with     similar organizational power who do not share these discriminatory     biases still to act (in their jobs) largely like their discriminatory     colleagues? (Note this question relates to the general problem of why     people conform, but in this question focuses on the causes specific     to the context of organizational power.)          What do analysts mean by the \u201cmale rebellion\u201d against marriage in     the second half of the twentieth century, and why might it have     occurred?           Why did men in government think differently about the woman     suffrage issue than ordinary male voters? How does this compare     to differences between the ways that employers\u2019 thought about hiring     women and the ways that male workers thought about it?          How do we explain women\u2019s difficulties at achieving economic     power through entrepreneurial success, rising through organizational     ranks, or inheriting wealth?          How do we explain women\u2019s difficulties at achieving political     power, both as individuals and collectively?          How have feminist efforts contributed to the reduction in gender     inequality, and how have those efforts fallen short?                             X.

How does the impact on family organization made by the rise     of modern education compare to the impact of the rise of modern     industry?           What are the highlights of women\u2019s changing educational     opportunities in the U.S. over the past 150 years?          With respect to the U.S. experience, in what ways is it     likely that the education offered to women and men (at various     levels) influenced gender inequality over the past 150     years?          What were the major influences responsible for the rise of     meritocratic ideas and their increasing     influence?           Why does Ridgeway stress it is important not only that we     hold stereotypical beliefs about gender, but that we can take it for     granted that others hold them as well?          According to Ridgeway, what are the most basic, shared     beliefs about differences between women and men in our culture (we     are concerned with the content of the beliefs, not the     terminology)?          What, according to Ridgeway, decides which gender     stereotypes are embodied in popular beliefs about the differences     between women and men?          Why do people who privately hold \"alternative\" gender     beliefs seemingly still commonly act on the basis of the dominant     beliefs, particularly in their \u201cpublic\u201d     lives?           Why did the ideologies of female domesticity change over     time?          If men did not impose the content of the successive     ideologies of female domesticity, what     did?           What common characteristics of the otherwise diverse ideals     of female domesticity made them seem to work for both women and men     and for the acceptability of gender inequality to     both?          With respect to the determination of dominant ideologies,     what is the relevant common underlying idea in the Marxist concept of     \u201cdetermination within limits\u201d, the Weberian idea of \u201celective     affinity\u201d, and Merton\u2019s concept of \u201cfunctional     alternatives?\u201d          What does Cancian mean when she says, \u201cPart of the reason     that men seem so much less loving than women is that their behavior     is measured with a feminine ruler\u201d?

{"detail": [{"content": "Sociology of Sex &amp; Gender - Robert Max Jackson                                                                                                                          25 January 2015    (rev 1/27/15)                  (Sociology of) Sex and    Gender         SOC-UA 21 \u2013 Spring 2015         Robert Max    Jackson                                 Assisting: Jessie Ford                 http://www.nyu.edu/classes/jackson/sex.and.gender                            Description:         This course will stress explaining inequalities between women and men    and interpreting what they mean for people's lives. Most of what we    do, think and feel depends on our understanding of what it means to be    male or female, and on the different expectations people have for men and    women. Every aspect of the institutions, opportunities, and ideas    around us are permeated by gender differences. Our goal is to make    sense of this. Some of the questions we address are:             What do we mean by gender inequality? How does it arise?     Why does it take different forms? Why do some societies have    greater equality than others? How do the various institutions    like the family, the economy and religion affect the social position of    women and men? How do the direct relations between women and    men--as friends, brother and sister, lovers, spouses, parent and child,    colleagues, boss and employee--depend on or affect the social positions    of women and men? Why and when does sex inequality change?             On completing the course, students will know how to assess the major    social and intellectual questions raised by the issue of sex inequality.    Through intensive reading and discussion, this course will give    students the intellectual tools needed to understand and talk about sex    inequality knowledgeably and perceptively. This course also    promotes the growth of general skills in theoretical criticism and social    analysis.         Requirements:         All students must attend class consistently and punctually, join in    class discussion, write brief papers, prepare a \"gender social biography\"    term paper, take quizzes, and take a final exam.         All students should take part in class discussion and those who do an    outstanding job will receive extra credit.         Each student will write a \"gender social biography\" for a term paper.    This paper will try to show how your identity and experiences have    been shaped in conformity with gender expectations and how they have    defied or ignored them. The paper will take into account the various    kinds of social influences and experiences studied in this class.    During the semester, students will write brief gender biography    \"chapters\" for each section of the course, relating the subject of that    section to their gender biography. These will then be incorporated and    revised into the final term paper. Details about the gender social    biography are on another page .    No late papers will be accepted under any conditions.         A final examination will take place in class and cover all of the    course material. This examination will focus on the main ideas of    the materials we read and discuss in class.         Expectations:         A class is a collective learning enterprise. We must all act    responsibly and with decorum or the enterprise fails. We must each try to    avoid making the class less pleasant for others. This means we come    to class on time, pay attention, and avoid disruptive actions such as    talking to those in adjoining seats, eating noisily, and the like.     We will have a lot of discussion, some among all in class, some in    groups. Everyone is always free to disagree with other people's    ideas, but we should all treat everyone else and their ideas    respectfully. Plagiarism or academic dishonesty of any kind will    not be tolerated.

Study Questions                   What do people commonly mean by the distinction between     \u201cgender\u201d and \u201csex?\u201d          Why do people studying gender inequality stress a     distinction between \u201cgender inequality\u201d and \u201cgender     differences?\u201d          While making sense of gender inequality, why do we need to     keep in mind other forms of inequality within a society?          What is the difference between status inequality and     positional inequality?          Why do some authors suggest that the rise of women\u2019s status     over the past two centuries might be considered a paradox while     others suggest that the persistence of gender inequality in recent     decades might be viewed as a paradox?          In what ways has gender inequality declined over the past     150 years?          What are principal ways that gender inequality persists in     the U.S. and similar \u201cmodern\u201d nations according to our sources?          What does Jackson mean when he says that \u201ctwo kinds of     social conflict fueled the decline of gender     inequality\u201d?          What do we mean when we say women and men are     unequal?          What do we mean by saying that women and men have competing     ideologies or myths about gender?          What is the difference between distributional differences     and categorical differences when we are comparing the characteristics     of two groups?          What is problematic about the common cultural explanations     of \u201cdeceptive distinctions\u201d between women and men?          How does \u201cframing\u201d work in Ridgeway\u2019s     analysis?                             II. How is gender inequality symbolized and reproduced in    everyday life?

How does gender inequality in modern society influence the power     most men feel they have?          What do people mean when they say institutions are gendered?          Why might some argue that Freud\u2019s theory attributed key gender     differences to biology while others argue that it did not?          How is it possible that gender identity (whether we are male or     female and what it means to be either) is learned (not inherent or     biological), but that we experience it as natural and     unchangeable?          What did Gilligan claim about the relationship between gender and     ethics, and why has the claim been controversial?          How would you explain the term \u201csex roles?\u201d          How does Dozier\u2019s study raise questions about standard ways of     distinguishing \u201csex\u201d from \u201cgender\u201d or claims that gender is socially     constructed by people \u201cdoing gender\u201d in interactions?          What is the \u201cgender similarities hypothesis\u201d and how do research     findings support or not support it?          According to Ridgeway, how are gender stereotypes related to a     general problem of coordinating social interactions? (And can     you identify any serious problems with Ridgeway's argument about this     proposed relationship? This part is very high difficulty.)          How, according to Ridgeway might the existence of framing lead to     social inequality?          According to Ridgeway what is the difference between specific     status beliefs and diffuse status beliefs?                             III.

How has the popularity of     biological explanations varied across historical periods and     cultures?          How is the work of evolutionary psychologists relevant to     the study of gender inequality, and what limits the value of its     contribution?          What seems to be the historical pattern of motives behind     brain research and hormonal research concerned with gender (and     sexuality) differences, and the results they find?          What was the influential argument that Margaret Mead     presented in 1935 book Sex and Temperament in Three Primitive     Societies?          Why are those who study gender inequality so concerned with     the division of labor?          When comparing across societies, what are some of the     conditions that seem to correlate with or indicate high levels of     gender inequality?          What do we know about the relationship between testosterone     levels and violent behavior?          According to Herdt, what is the significance of \u201ccoming     out\u201d rituals?          How does it make sense to think about the role of biology     in the origins of gender inequality?          How and why do we distinguish explaining the origins of     gender inequality from the persistence of gender     inequality?                             IV.

Study Questions                   Summarize important changes in women\u2019s economic     participation over the past 150 years. Among other things, it is     useful to consider differences by period, by type of women, and by     type of job.          How does the movement of women into traditionally male jobs     compare to the movement of men into traditionally female jobs?          How does employment potentially serve as a source of pride,     obligation, resources, negative identity for men and for women?      The goal here is to think through the reasons that women and men seek     and hold jobs and the effects that having (or not having) those jobs     have upon them.          What contributes to the wage/income differential between     women and men?          Explain the \u201cglass ceiling.\u201d          How did goverment policies, laws, and actions influence     women's changing employment in the twentieth century?          According to Ridgeway, how have framing processes     influenced the jobs into which women are hired, women\u2019s promotions,     and women\u2019s wages/salaries?          Why is the analysis of \u201ctokenism\u201d important for     understanding changes in women\u2019s economic participation?          What seem to be the causes and the effects of sexual     harassment?          How can we explain how women\u2019s economic participation has     changed over the long term? Consider the motives and the     actions of women, ordinary men, and powerful men. Also consider     the difference between women\u2019s movement into low-status jobs and     their movement into high-status jobs.          According to Reskin, what causes women\u2019s wages or income to     be lower than that of men, and how does that argument relate to the     ideas present in other readings this week?          How have different kinds of discrimination influenced     women\u2019s experiences in the economy?                             IX. Political processes and individual action.

Why do we want to distinguish between ordinary and powerful men while explaining the     persistence and decline of gender inequality?          Responding to changing circumstances, women and men sometimes      adopted new strategies or changed their typical behavior in ways      that contributed to gender inequality\u2019s decline over time.      However, even as they contributed to gender inequality's decline,      they typically did not seek to reduce gender inequality, commonly      did not favor a change in gender expectations, and often did not      even recognize that their actions could or would affect gender      inequality. So, how do we explain this pattern?          Why has men\u2019s defense of gender inequality declined over the past     150 years?          How have the goals of feminist movements been compatible      with (the effects and requirements of) long-term structural      changes in the U.S. and other modern societies? And in what      ways have their goals been in conflict with that long-term      trajectory          Assess the reasoning behind these two claims: \u201cmen have probably     sustained their gender advantages more through competition with other     men than through efforts to keep women from enjoying similar     opportunities or status\u201d; \u201cmen resisting women\u2019s advance      [typically] understood themselves to be fulfilling their      obligations or protecting well-earned rights\u201d.          How did both ordinary men\u2019s interests in opposing improvements in     women\u2019s status and their capacity to do so change over     time?           Writers have suggested that men long opposed women\u2019s movement     into high-status jobs (and women\u2019s access to higher education that     would prepare them for such jobs) because adding women would increase the     competition men would face for promotions and the like. Why is this a     strong or weak argument?          Why are culturally derived beliefs and rational calculations both     important for understanding changes over time in men\u2019s typical     actions that affected gender inequality? (Note that the same question     can be asked about women\u2019s typical actions.)          If most men in positions of organizational power share a     discriminatory attitude towards women, why do we expect any men with     similar organizational power who do not share these discriminatory     biases still to act (in their jobs) largely like their discriminatory     colleagues? (Note this question relates to the general problem of why     people conform, but in this question focuses on the causes specific     to the context of organizational power.)          What do analysts mean by the \u201cmale rebellion\u201d against marriage in     the second half of the twentieth century, and why might it have     occurred?           Why did men in government think differently about the woman     suffrage issue than ordinary male voters? How does this compare     to differences between the ways that employers\u2019 thought about hiring     women and the ways that male workers thought about it?          How do we explain women\u2019s difficulties at achieving economic     power through entrepreneurial success, rising through organizational     ranks, or inheriting wealth?          How do we explain women\u2019s difficulties at achieving political     power, both as individuals and collectively?          How have feminist efforts contributed to the reduction in gender     inequality, and how have those efforts fallen short?                             X. What role does ideology play in determining the relations    between men and women?

Cancian                       Study Questions                   What do we mean by institutional     individualism?           How does the impact on family organization made by the rise     of modern education compare to the impact of the rise of modern     industry?           What are the highlights of women\u2019s changing educational     opportunities in the U.S. over the past 150 years?          With respect to the U.S. experience, in what ways is it     likely that the education offered to women and men (at various     levels) influenced gender inequality over the past 150     years?          What were the major influences responsible for the rise of     meritocratic ideas and their increasing     influence?           Why does Ridgeway stress it is important not only that we     hold stereotypical beliefs about gender, but that we can take it for     granted that others hold them as well?          According to Ridgeway, what are the most basic, shared     beliefs about differences between women and men in our culture (we     are concerned with the content of the beliefs, not the     terminology)?          What, according to Ridgeway, decides which gender     stereotypes are embodied in popular beliefs about the differences     between women and men?          Why do people who privately hold \"alternative\" gender     beliefs seemingly still commonly act on the basis of the dominant     beliefs, particularly in their \u201cpublic\u201d     lives?           Why did the ideologies of female domesticity change over     time?          If men did not impose the content of the successive     ideologies of female domesticity, what     did?           What common characteristics of the otherwise diverse ideals     of female domesticity made them seem to work for both women and men     and for the acceptability of gender inequality to     both?          With respect to the determination of dominant ideologies,     what is the relevant common underlying idea in the Marxist concept of     \u201cdetermination within limits\u201d, the Weberian idea of \u201celective     affinity\u201d, and Merton\u2019s concept of \u201cfunctional     alternatives?\u201d          What does Cancian mean when she says, \u201cPart of the reason     that men seem so much less loving than women is that their behavior     is measured with a feminine ruler\u201d?

According to Ridgeway, what are the key conditions that are     obstructing, and could even reverse, the shifts toward gender     equality?          According to Ridgeway, why do gender stereotypes survive     disconfirming evidence?          How does Ridgeway use the idea of \"cultural lag?\"          According to Jackson, what are the principal causes of gender     inequality's decline?          According to Jackson, what are the main components of arguments     that the movement toward gender inequality is severely     threatened?          What, according to Jackson, are the principal defects in     arguments contending that our movement toward greater gender equality     may be stopped or even turned back?          How have interests affecting gender inequality changed over time     for important categories of men, women, and organizations? Are there     important relevant interests that have not changed much?

Through a series of conferences, site visits, and seminars, the course examines four key moments or themes as a means of apprehending the density of French cultural, social, and political life. Starting with French republicanism, past, present, and future, we consider how France, at once the preeminent site of experiments in democratic liberty, is also plagued by institutional entrenchments of class stratification and the dual specters of colonialism and post-colonialism. Turning to Paris, the \u201ccapital of modernity,\u201d we reflect on its 19th century emergence as a locus of phantasmagoria, mystery, and seduction, and the emergent capitalist forces that were shaping the urban landscape. We consider the early 20th century avant-garde, among the most important and radical artistic and political movements of our time, that opened new spaces in which to imagine the very terms of \u201cart\u201d and \u201cpolitics,\u201d to finish with a consideration of France in the contemporary moment, wrestling with global transformations, the crisis of the welfare state, and a tension between the reproduction of elites and a political commitment to equality that increasingly troubles the country\u2019s educational system, politics, and cultural life.     Interdisciplinary and \u201cinter-textual\u201d in scope, the course fuses expert lectures, textual analysis, and out of the classroom experience, to bring together the artistic, the literary, and the social scientific, against the backdrop of global transformation.   Class organization and assignments     This is a required course for all students at NYUParis. Students meet in assigned groups according to their language level; students with an advanced level of French may do their coursework in French. Students are expected to attend all conferences and site visits, to do the assigned readings and to participate in class discussions.

In this course we will read poetry out loud in order to show how poetry is founded on rhythm and the repetition of phonetic and syntactic elements. This pragmatic approach will not only allow students to improve their pronunciation, but also to understand the poetic genre, the quality of poets\u2019 language, their interest in etymology, metaphor, imagery, etc. Close readings, paraphrase and translations will allow students to considerably improve their mastery of the French language so that they in turn will be able to produce poetry of their own. This course will help them to integrate the phonic, rhythmic and musical dimensions of poetry, as well as learn about its various uses, from the intimate to historical testimonies.

Beginning with the grandeur of Paris during the Belle Epoque and the Exposition Universelle of 1900, and moving to the violence and tragedy of World Wars I and II, this course examines the French modernist art movements of the first part of the 20th century. After identifying the origins of modernism in the late 19th century with Impressionism and Post-Impressionism, we will consider the ways in which Fauvism, Cubism, Expressionism, and Primitivism redefined modernism for the 20th century. Working with Dada and Surrealist art works, we will evaluate the relationship between humor, critique, and cultural and political dissension in artistic production. Finally, we will examine the trans-Atlantic currents of Abstraction, looking at Abstract Expressionism, L\u2019Art Informel, and the Nouveau Realistes. Throughout this exploration, we will interrogate how social history, shaped by politics, gender, and race, informed the construction of an artistic modernism in the 20th century.

London on the Thames takes close runner-up position. But more than mythic, popular-culture stage sets, these two great European capitals operate as spectacular rival models in face of real-life, 21st-century dramas. Our course concentrates on a sequence of case studies targeting the evolving architecture and urban plan of Paris. We focus on current thematic debates crucial to its identity, survival and future\u2014tradition contra innovation, continuity contra rupture, preservation contra demolition, obsolescence contra revitalization. We investigate controversies over the low- and high-density city; legislation on building heights, protection of skyline and riverbanks; the interface between historic and experimental building types; the balance between public and private space, residential and mixed-economy neighbourhoods, inner-city rehabilitation and suburban sprawl; intra- and extra-muros transportation systems (road, rail, river, air). As a foil and finale to our Paris studies, we conclude with a critical comparative analysis of contemporary London to illuminate fundamental differences between these two global cities: the rational French model largely tempered by state control against the exuberant English model predominantly driven by ultra-liberal policies. Will the third millennium ideal city emerge as a polymorphic combination of the two approaches? Conducted in English .

Our course explores the dramatic evolution of French art across 200 tumultuous years, from its classical origins under Louis XIII and Louis XIV's Old Regime, through its transformations across the Enlightenment period, to its radical Neo-Classical revision during the French Revolution, and Romantic reconstruction at the demise of the Napoleonic era and Bourbon Restoration, ending with the 1830 Revolution. Through analysis of the reciprocity between artists and the political-cultural institutions of Paris, we examine the ways by which art \u2015painting, architecture, popular prints, caricatures\u2015operates as a potent discursive programme within French society. Its role as a dense symbolic language of communication and persuasion, and/or as a critique of social and moral values dominates our investigation. It also serves as a model to investigate the role of contemporary electronic and print media and their influence on our perceptions of society and the representation of power in the global world.

Experimental Theatre Workshop - FREN-UA 9868 - 4 points                               This course is designed to allow students to analyze and reenact excerpts from Moli\u00e8re\u2019s plays. We will discover the playwright Moli\u00e8re (1622-1673) who was also an actor, troupe leader, and the author of numerous plays which remain to this day the most frequently staged plays in France. The recurring themes in his plays will be discussed, particularly in relation to the time period during which the plays were written. We will also touch on the role of farce in the work of this playwright who was nicknamed in the 17th century \u201cthe foremost joker in France.\u201d Dramatic analysis of the plays chosen will require a comparative study of texts in French and in English.   We will read and analyze these texts out loud. Certain excerpts will need to be memorized. We will analyze the ideas expressed as well as the importance of certain words, of the images evoked, and of the punctuation used in order to bring to life the rhythm and musicality of the phrases. The ultimate objective of this course will be to arouse the creativity of each student with regard to the many possibilities for modern interpretation, notably in reimagining d\u00e9cor, costumes, and Moli\u00e8re\u2019s stances.   T he texts studied will be excerpts from the following Moli\u00e8re plays: Tartuffe, The Misanthrope, The Miser, The Bourgeois Gentleman, The Doctor in Spite of Himself, and Don Juan . The students will also be required to read three plays of their choice in their entirety.   Conducted in English.                                                                      Literary Classics: French, British, and Post-Colonial Perspectives - FREN-UA 9868 - 4 points - under development                               This course can count toward the cultural specialization or elective within the major requirements in Comparative Literature. However, it is recommended that Comparative Literature majors check with their  DUGS to have this course approved for their individual specialization. This course CANNOT be counted as a core comparative literature course.      In this course we focus on four contemporary novels in which the world of the character, the narrator, or the author, is read through the lens of a literary classic. In each case, the reading and rewriting of the primary text involves temporal and spatial displacements (from the 18th to the 20th century, from Europe to the Carribean and to the South Pacific) that generate shifting perspectives and a constant reshuffling of centre and periphery. Between a reverential affiliation to the past and a creative misreading and rewriting of it, these intertextual encounters with \u00ab great \u00bb Western literary works insistently raise the questions of identity, originality, and \u201cwriting back\u201d. Exploring these questions will therefore also involve drawing on comparative, translation, and postcolonial studies.

The French Revolution &amp; Napoleon - HIST-UA 9143 - 4 points                               Lift your eyes as you walk down any street in Paris and you'll soon see a building adorned with the tricolore and the words Libert\u00e9, Egalit\u00e9, Fraternit\u00e9. Turn a corner and in the distance you'll see the Arc de Triomphe built to the glory of Napoleon's army or the Eiffel tower erected for the centennial of the fall of the Bastille. Even the metro stops, Concorde, Nation, R\u00e9publique, Austerlitz, I\u00e9na, echo with the memory of the years of the French Revolution and the First Empire.  But what historic reality does all this evoke? What led some French people to overthrow their age old Monarchy, turn their backs on the Church and launch into a new era of Republican government? What caused others to resist such changes with all their might? And why did the experiment end within 10 years, giving way to military dictatorship and an Empire which spread French rule across Europe.  This semester we shall explore these issues and others pertaining to the Age of the French Revolution &amp; Napoleon through lectures, readings, discussions and site visits in and around the city of Paris.

Through our study of a wide variety of genres and disciplines, we examine both the theoretical discourses and artistic and literary representations of the human-animal relation. Authors include Montaigne, contemporary novelist Marie Darrieussecq, the fabulist La Fontaine and the filmmaker Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut. Drawing from a wide selection of texts and media we explore the multiple forms this relation has taken and the extent to which it touches areas about which we humans, \u201crational animals,\u201d remain particularly sensitive.

Paris of the 19th and early 20th centuries developed into a major urban center, in part because of the promise of liberty that drew people there following the upheavals of the Revolution. The urban renewal that occurred under the Second Empire in the mid-19th century in particular transformed the capital into a modern city of innovation and spectacle. While the official arts reflected the tastes and priorities of successive governments and the emergent bourgeoisie, it was the avant-garde that most marked the city as a site of resistance and daring. In this course we study these different art movements as they relate to the city of Paris, studying the sites, movements, and transformations that helped shape the modern arts. Conducted in French.

Their versions, indeed, serve as the basis for the French Revolution of 1789. A long and difficult process, democracy needed nearly a century before establishing itself in France. Drawing on numerous examples from 19th and 20th century history, we will try to understand why the great contributions of democracy, such as universal suffrage and the concept of individual liberty, were so difficult to put into operation. We will also consider why these &quot;givens&quot; are still fragile. Conducted in French.

The first half of the course focuses on the political, socio-economic, and cultural history of France in the modern period, from roughly 1870 to the 1980. The second half of the course looks more closely at the contemporary period, focusing on the various \u2018crises\u2019 and transitions that have marked France during the past 20 years. Topics include the challenges of the post-colonial period (immigration, la francophonie, questions of identity), France in and of the European Union, France and globalization, and social issues in current events (the status of women, la banlieue, social exclusion).

The course will offer insights and analyses on the different roles which are played by France and the United States on the issues of youth, women, and Modern Islam in the Arab World and on how their soft power is perceived by the Arab countries and their populations. By addressing the foreign policies that have been articulated in the region, we will also bring into light the dichotomy between the \u201cold\u201d and the \u201cnew\u201d diplomacy.

In this course, we study the great works of French theatre, from the classics to the very  contemporary, through readings, performances, and visits in and around Paris to the lieux  de m\u00e9moire of the theatre world. Through the study of works by Corneille, Moli\u00e8re, Hugo,  Feydeau, Ionesco, Beckett, Sartre, and others, we consider how Paris has been integral to and  shaped by the world of French theatre. Visits include such prestigious venues as the Com\u00e9die  Fran\u00e7aise, the grands boulevards where Parisians discovered Shakespeare in the age of Sarah  Bernhardt, the remains of the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Marais where Corneille performed his plays, or  Versailles where Moli\u00e8re helped lead the grand spectacle that was life under Louis XIV.

Writing Workshop: Writing Paris - FREN-UA 9968 - 2 points                               Given in the form of a workshop, this course allows students to improve their written expression through the study and practice of a variety of literary registers, mostly drawn from contemporary literature. The workshop associates literary creation and French language instruction with the firm belief that creative writing in French is possible for students at all levels. Its primary objective is the reinforcement of students\u2019 written competencies in French, accomplished through intensive writing sessions with the common theme of Paris. Students are invited to appropriate Paris through various writing activities, inspired by writers such as Baudelaire, Perec, or Modiano, designed to help students capture the city through its movements, its images, and its different facets. The regular practice of creative writing as well as systematic re-writing of all work will allow students to reinforce grammatical structures while expanding vocabulary. Conducted in French.

Each dreams of one day becoming a \u201cgreen\u201d city. Danger also exists in both of these cities, amplified by rumor and fantasy. In this course we will study these phenomena through the analysis of novels, films, television series, artwork, and architecture, to ask how various representations of the city have changed and been managed over time, by diverse social actors and observers.
