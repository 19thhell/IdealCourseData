The field encourages students to explore the social, cultural, and political meanings and uses of gender constructs and to challenge traditional narratives about men and women across history. Our field draws its strength from our faculty\u2019s commitment to investigating the history of women and gender, and from a long tradition of feminist scholarship.    Our field brings together faculty and graduate students from a wide range of geographical, chronological, and thematic fields, and is strengthened by departmental fields in African Diaspora and Atlantic World . NYU also has a strong Center for the Study of Gender and Sexuality , and our graduate students are encouraged to take courses with scholars of gender in other university departments. Admission to the program is highly selective.    Earning an MA degree in the History of Women and Gender field prepares students for a variety of careers, including working in museums, historical societies, and historic houses; working with archives and historical papers; working in film and television; and preparation for teaching at the secondary-school level. The degree can also serve as a foundation for graduate study at the PhD level.
