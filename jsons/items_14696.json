En un XIXe si\u00e8cle o\u00f9 se modifient les normes et les pratiques de l\u2019institution, le roman explore les r\u00e8gles, les enjeux, les dessous de cartes de celle-ci, et, misant sur la dynamique de la m\u00eamet\u00e9 et de l\u2019alt\u00e9rit\u00e9 qui assure le renouvellement domestique et g\u00e9n\u00e9alogique, en fait jouer les possibles. Le Jeu des familles se penche d\u2019abord, avec Balzac puis Paul Bourget, sur les nostalgies patriarcales, qui exaltent les valeurs de la filiation et de la transmission, vecteurs de la m\u00eamet\u00e9. Il se tourne ensuite, avec Balzac, les Goncourt et Zola, vers les atouts et les handicaps du familialisme bourgeois moderne, qui privil\u00e9gie les pr\u00e9f\u00e9rences individuelles et l\u2019alliance, point d\u2019insertion de l\u2019\u00ab autre \u00bb. Il examine l\u2019utopie d\u2019une r\u00e9demption fraternitaire propos\u00e9e par George Sand et Eug\u00e8ne Sue, qui r\u00eavent de faire de la famille la matrice de la cohabitation des classes et de la r\u00e9conciliation des sexes. Il suit enfin, chez Edmond de Goncourt, Barbey d\u2019Aurevilly et El\u00e9mir Bourges, la d\u00e9cadence des lignages et des maisonn\u00e9es fin de si\u00e8cle, dans lesquelles se brouillent d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9ment les cartes.

Les deux volumes  de communications r\u00e9unissent donc une diversit\u00e9 f\u00e9conde de points de vues et  d\u2019approches m\u00e9thodologiques, couvrant une large mosa\u00efque th\u00e9matique, situ\u00e9e \u00e0  tous les niveaux de la pratique litt\u00e9raire, depuis sa gen\u00e8se jusqu\u2019\u00e0 sa r\u00e9ception.

The eighteenth century seeks to   separate the good ideas from the bad, sort the wheat from the chaff, and   dreams about the concision of a \u201cbook-library\u201d. What motivates this   desire to refine the archive and reduce the multiple to the singular in   the form of a book which will summarise all others? Read   more from Classiques Garnier            Eug\u00e8ne Guillevic, trans. Richard Sieburth     Guillevic wrote Geometries (Euclidiennes in French) in the early   sixties, after his friend, the poet Andr\u00e9 Frenaud, recognizing in his   poetry an inclination toward mathematics, and more specifically   geometry, encouraged him to pursue this direction. Guillevic places a   series of geometrical figures before our eyes, as they might appear in a   schoolchild's primer, paired with poems that let us hear how these   forms might speak. These talking circles, squares and angles\u2014these   articulations of space\u2014are in turn meant to remind us of our own figures   of speech. Guillevic's Geometries fits into the 1960s return to   emblems, signs, and playful constraints both in art (Robert Indiana,   Jasper Johns, Robert Rauschenberg and even Andy Warhol) and in writing   (the Noigandres poets, Oulipo, Eugen Gomringer, the Robert Creeley of   Pieces). But at the same time, the Euclidean world of forms here   explored remains as timeless as the stones of Guillevic's own Carnac.

Beginning in the thirteenth century, works of verse narrative   from the early Middle Ages were recast in prose, as if prose had become   the literary norm. Instead of dying out, however, verse took on new   vitality. In France verse texts were produced, in both French and   Occitan, with the explicit intention of transmitting encyclopedic,   political, philosophical, moral, historical, and other forms of   knowledge. In Knowing Poetry, Adrian Armstrong and Sarah Kay   explore why and how verse continued to be used to transmit and shape   knowledge in France. They cover the period between Jean de Meun's Roman   de la rose (c. 1270) and the major work of Jean Bouchet, the last of the   grands rh\u00e9toriqueurs (c. 1530). The authors find that the advent of   prose led to a new relationship between poetry and knowledge in which   poetry serves as a medium for serious reflection and self-reflection on   subjectivity, embodiment, and time. They propose that three major   works\u2014the Roman de la rose, the Ovide moralis\u00e9, and Boethius'   Consolation of Philosophy\u2014form a single influential matrix linking   poetry and intellectual inquiry, metaphysical insights, and eroticized   knowledge. The trio of thought-world-contingency, poetically represented   by Philosophy, Nature, and Fortune, grounds poetic exploration of   reality, poetry, and community.

Des ann\u00e9es plus tard, ce grand d\u00e9part, transform\u00e9 en  exil, le pousse \u00e0 entreprendre un projet ambitieux : traverser  mentalement l'Atlantique, suivre les m\u00e9andres de sa m\u00e9moire pour  raconter ce pays de naufrages, de neige et de brouillard, et trouver  dans l'\u00e9criture les reliefs oubli\u00e9s de son univers.

Mais l'esth\u00e9tique du mouvement est-elle   concevable sans porter en creux une immobilit\u00e9 dont elle semble   s'affranchir? Qu'il s'agisse de l'utilisation de l'arr\u00eat sur image, de   longs plans fixes, du figement des acteurs, ou bien du filmage de   tableaux et de photographies, l'histoire du cin\u00e9ma se d\u00e9roule au fil   d'un d\u00e9sir de mouvement qui se double, selon les \u00e9poques et les   r\u00e9alisateurs, d'une nostalgie de l'immobilit\u00e9. L'arr\u00eat sur image a-t-il   une fonction politique? Quelle diff\u00e9rence y a-t-il entre le figement, le   repos et l'inertie? Pourquoi sommes-nous assis immobiles face \u00e0   l'\u00e9cran? Quel est le rapport de l'immobilit\u00e9 au sacr\u00e9? Quelle conception   du temps certains films opposent-ils \u00e0 un monde satur\u00e9 d'images en   mouvement? Telles sont quelques-unes des questions auxquelles ce livre   se propose de r\u00e9pondre selon trois axes: l'esth\u00e9tique, la critique   id\u00e9ologique et la r\u00e9ception.            Ezra Pound, ed. Richard Sieburth     This newly revised and greatly expanded edition of Ezra Pound's   Selected Poems is intended to articulate Pound for the twenty-first   century. Gone are many of the \"stale creampuffs\" (as Pound called them)   of the 1949 edition. Instead, new emphasis has been laid on the   interpenetration of original composition and translation within Pound's   career. New features of this edition include the complete \"Homage to   Sextus Propertius\" in its original lineation, early translations from   Cavalcanti, Heine, and the troubadours, as well as late translations of   Sophocles, and the Confucian Odes. As a lifelong expatriate, Pound   parceled out his work to a variety of journals in England, America,   France, and Italy. This new edition takes account of this complex   publishing history by giving the poems in the chronological order of   their original magazine publication. We can observe Pound as he first   emerged onto the literary scene in the pages of Ford Madox Ford's   English Review and Harriet Monroe's Chicago-based Poetry, and then as an   agent provocateur for the avant-garde Little Review, Blast, and The   Dial. Unlike all previous selections, this volume provides annotation to   all the early poems as well as a running commentary on the later Cantos   \u2013 indispensable to any reader wanting to follow Pound on his epic   odyssey through ancient China, medieval Provence, the Italian   Renaissance, the early American Republic, and the darkness of the   twentieth century. The editor, Richard Sieburth, provides a chronology   of Pound's life, a new preface, and an informative afterword, \"Selecting   Pound.\" Also included in the appendix are T. S. Eliot's and John   Berryman's original introductions to Pound's Selected Poems. Read more from New Directions            St\u00e9phane Gerson           We all know the name   Nostradamus , but who was he really? Why did his predictions  become so influential in Renaissance Europe and then keep resurfacing  for nearly five centuries? And what does Nostradamus\u2019s endurance in  the West say about us and our own world?         In Nostradamus:  How an Obscure Renaissance Astrologer Became the Modern Prophet of  Doom , historian St\u00e9phane Gerson takes readers on a journey back  in time to explore the life and afterlife of Michel de Nostredame,  the astrologer whose Prophecies have been interpreted, adopted  by successive media, and eventually transformed into the Gospel of  Doom for the modern age. Whenever we seem to enter a new era,  whenever the premises of our worldview are questioned or imperiled,  Nostradamus offers certainty and solace. In 1666, guests at posh  English dinner parties discussed his quatrain about the Great Fire of  London. In 1942, the Jewish writer Ir\u00e8ne N\u00e9mirovsky latched her  hopes for survival to Nostradamus\u2019 prediction that the war would  soon end. And on September 12, 2001, teenagers proclaimed on the  streets of Brooklyn that \u201cthis guy, Nostradamus\u201d had seen the  9/11 attacks coming.         Through prodigious  research in European and American archives, Gerson shows that  Nostradamus \u2014 a creature of the modern West rather than a vestige  from some antediluvian era \u2014 tells us more about our past and our  present than about our future. In chronicling the life of this  mystifying figure and the lasting fascination with his predictions,  Gerson\u2019s book becomes a historical biography of a belief: the faith  that we can know tomorrow and master our anxieties through the powers  of an extraordinary but ever more elusive seer. Read more from MacMillan             St\u00e9phane Gerson     The mysterious quatrains of the sixteenth-century French   astrologer Nostradamus have long proved captivating for their   predictions. Nostradamus has been credited with anticipating the Great   Fire of London, the rise of Adolf Hitler, and the September 11 terrorist   attacks. Today, as the world grapples with financial meltdowns, global   terrorism, and environmental disasters\u2014as well as the Mayan prediction   of the apocalypse on December 21, 2012\u2014his prophecies of doom have   assumed heightened relevance. How has The Prophecies   outlasted most books from the Renaissance? This edition considers its   legacy in terms of the poetics of the quatrains, published here in a   brilliant new translation and with introductory material and notes   mapping the cultural, political, and historical forces that resonate   throughout Nostradamus's epic, giving it its visionary power. Read more from Penguin Classics  Praise for the new translation of The Prophecies : \u201cA vigorous, wry, alert new translation . . . A richer, more wrangling   read than any other English translator has managed or even attempted . .   . [It] offers English readers the experience of reading the   [prophecies] steadily and sequentially, rather than piecemeal, and with   the original French on facing pages, making it possible to read the   prophecies as acts of writing rather than riddles. . . . In keeping   faith with the strangeness of these verses Sieburth has succeeded   brilliantly in making them at last readable, in all their weird, cruel   beauty, their jagged brilliance and spasmodic dash.\u201d \u2014 London Review of Books \u201cRichard Sieburth\u2019s translation of the Prophecies of Nostradamus   proves once again that Sieburth ranks first and foremost among the   translators of today. Sieburth\u2019s artful work demonstrates a keen   understanding of Nostradamus that few possess. Accompanied by a masterly   introduction by St\u00e9phane Gerson, this translation is one for the ages.\u201d   \u2014Lawrence D. Kritzman, John D. Willard Professor of French and Comparative Literature, Dartmouth College            Sarah Kay     The love songs of Occitan troubadours inspired a rich body of courtly   lyric by poets working in neighboring languages. For Sarah Kay, these   poets were nightingales, composing verse that is recognizable yet   original. But troubadour poetry also circulated across Europe in a form   that is less well known but was more transformative. Writers outside   Occitania quoted troubadour songs word for word in their original   language, then commented upon these excerpts as linguistic or poetic   examples, as guides to conduct, and even as sources of theological   insight. If troubadours and their poetic imitators were nightingales,   these quotation artists were parrots, and their practices of excerption   and repetition brought about changes in poetic subjectivity that would   deeply affect the European canon. The first sustained study of   the medieval tradition of troubadour quotation, Parrots and Nightingales   examines texts produced along the arc of the northern   Mediterranean\u2014from Catalonia through southern France to northern   Italy\u2014through the thirteenth century and the first half of the   fourteenth. Featuring extensive appendices of over a thousand troubadour   passages that have been quoted or anthologized, Parrots and   Nightingales traces how quotations influenced the works of grammarians,   short story writers, biographers, encyclopedists, and not least, other   poets including Dante and Petrarch. Kay explores the instability and   fluidity of medieval textuality, revealing how the art of quotation   affected the transmission of knowledge and transformed perceptions of   desire from the \"courtly love\" of the Middle Ages to the more learned   formulations that emerged in the Renaissance. Parrots and Nightingales   deftly restores the medieval tradition of lyric quotation to visibility,   persuasively arguing for its originality and influence as a literary   strategy.

Il raconte l\u2019odyss\u00e9e  du sujet masculin dans son rapport \u00e0 la langue, \u00e0 l\u2019art, \u00e0 la v\u00e9rit\u00e9, toutes  choses qui constituent au sein de la lutte des sexes, qu\u2019il dit ind\u00e9passable,  le destin du sujet postmoderne.   Centr\u00e9 autour du genre romanesque et des interrogations esth\u00e9tiques qui lui  sont li\u00e9es, cet ouvrage interpr\u00e8te l\u2019ensemble de l\u2019\u0153uvre de Sollers \u00e0 partir  des analyses de Barthes. La question \u00e9tant : comment cette \u00e9criture  \u00e9labore-t-elle des rapports in\u00e9dits entre roman et pens\u00e9e, philosophie et  modernit\u00e9  esth\u00e9tique ?

Richard Sieburth     First published as a sprawling feuilleton in the newspaper Le National in 1850, Les Faux Saulniers    was political and topical. With nods to Diderot and Sterne, this   protean digressive satire deals less with contraband salt smugglers and   more with questions of subversion, transgression, censorship, and   marginality. The Salt Smugglers is an unearthed pre-postmodern   gem. By writing a first-person narrative detailing his dizzying quest   for an elusive book holding the history of the Abb\u00e9 de Bucquoy, Nerval   was able to dance with the censors of the day who forbid fiction to   appear in newspaper serials while questioning and opening the borders   between fact and fiction.

Apr\u00e8s les premi\u00e8res exp\u00e9riences, rares mais foisonnantes, du XVI e    si\u00e8cle, et apr\u00e8s une \u00e9clipse de plus de cinquante ans, le th\u00e9\u00e2tre des   femmes prend son essor dans les ann\u00e9es 1650. Des animatrices de salons,   des po\u00e9tesses, des romanci\u00e8res, une religieuse m\u00eame voient leurs pi\u00e8ces   publi\u00e9es, recens\u00e9es dans les grands journaux, jou\u00e9es par des troupes   professionnelles \u00e0 l\u2019H\u00f4tel de Bourgogne, au th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Marais, \u00e0 la   Cour\u2026    Les neuf pi\u00e8ces rassembl\u00e9es ici, qui   s\u2019\u00e9chelonnent de 1655 \u00e0 1680, rel\u00e8vent de tous les genres alors   pratiqu\u00e9s : la com\u00e9die en un acte, la tragi-com\u00e9die, la com\u00e9die-ballet   et la trag\u00e9die. Elles sont l\u2019\u0153uvre de la Lyonnaise Fran\u00e7oise Pascal,   l\u2019une des dramaturges les plus prolifiques, qui donne un nouveau souffle   \u00e0 la \u00ab petite com\u00e9die \u00bb ; de Mme de Villedieu, adul\u00e9e dans les salons   pour son esprit et ses vers, pensionn\u00e9e par Louis XIV, qui questionne   sans rel\u00e2che l\u2019histoire, la politique, les r\u00f4les de sexe, tout en   adh\u00e9rant aux nouveaux codes du classicisme ; de la s\u0153ur de La Chapelle,   dont L\u2019Illustre philosophe ou l\u2019histoire de sainte Catherine d\u2019Alexandrie    montre une autre face du d\u00e9bat sur les femmes savantes ; d\u2019Anne de La   Roche-Guilhen, protestante r\u00e9fugi\u00e9e en Angleterre, qui fait jouer sa   com\u00e9die-ballet devant Charles II ; et enfin de la c\u00e9l\u00e8bre po\u00e9tesse   Mme Deshouli\u00e8res, qui sonne le glas de cette p\u00e9riode lumineuse et   galante avec une trag\u00e9die d\u2019un pessimisme in\u00e9dit.

Revenu en force dans les ann\u00e9es 1660, le   th\u00e9\u00e2tre f\u00e9minin se fraie de nouveaux chemins dans les quatre d\u00e9cennies   qui chevauchent le changement de si\u00e8cle. Alors que la Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise,   fond\u00e9e en 1680 comme th\u00e9\u00e2tre national, commence \u00e0 accueillir des   ouvrages de femmes, les nouvelles g\u00e9n\u00e9rations de dramaturges dialoguent   avec les auteurs canoniques ou s\u2019\u00e9cartent des mod\u00e8les convenus, tout en   participant au ferment id\u00e9ologique qui annonce l\u2019\u00c2ge des Lumi\u00e8res.    Les trag\u00e9dies de Catherine Bernard   explorent l\u2019amiti\u00e9 entre femmes et les obstacles que doit affronter une   souveraine comp\u00e9tente, en m\u00eame temps qu\u2019elles remettent en question   l\u2019h\u00e9ro\u00efsme romain et le fanatisme patriotique. Celles de marie-Anne   barbier discr\u00e9ditent la tyrannie et l\u2019incomp\u00e9tence des chefs masculins   en glorifiant le courage et l\u2019habilet\u00e9 politique des femmes fortes, de   m\u00eame que celles de Madeleine-Ang\u00e9lique de Gomez en exaltant la grandeur   d\u2019une reine guerri\u00e8re ou la dignit\u00e9 des princesses captives pers\u00e9cut\u00e9es.   Dans le domaine de la com\u00e9die, Mlle Barbier renouvelle l\u2019id\u00e9al de   l\u2019amour chevaleresque en accordant \u00e0 la femme le droit de choisir son   partenaire, alors que Mme Ulrich se moque du syst\u00e8me aristocratique des   mariages arrang\u00e9s, qui ravale l\u2019\u00e9pouse au rang de commodit\u00e9.

This co-written, multi-stranded book challenges assumptions about   Chr\u00e9tien as the author of a canon of works. In a series of lively   exchanges, its five authors reassess the relationship between lyric and   romance, between individuality and social conditions, and between   psychology and medieval philosophy. The idea of \"logical time\" is used   to open up such topics as adventure, memory, imagination, and textual   variation. Recent research on Troyes and on the political agency of   women leads to the reappraisal of subjectivity and gender. Throughout,   the medieval texts associated with the name of Chr\u00e9tien are highlighted   as sites where thought emerges; the implications of this thought are   historicized and further conceptualized with the help of recent   theoretical works, including those of Lacan.

Ne lui est conc\u00e9d\u00e9 qu'une \u00e9troite bande de mer (surnomm\u00e9e le \"tuyau de po\u00eale\") qui met sa survie en p\u00e9ril. Cette menace se profile d\u00e8s l'ouverture du livre en ce mois de juillet 1988 o\u00f9, revenu \u00e0 Saint-Pierre pour l'enterrement de son p\u00e8re, l'auteur-narrateur a apport\u00e9 avec lui le premier volume de L'Oeuvre des mers qui va para\u00eetre en m\u00e9tropole quelques semaines plus tard. Englobant deux autres s\u00e9jours dans l'archipel (en 1995 pour le tournage d'un film et en 2005 pour l'enterrement de son fr\u00e8re cadet) ainsi qu'un journal posthume r\u00e9dig\u00e9 par Monsieur, l'ancien instituteur qui se prenait pour Jacques Cartier, Les Eaux territoriales prolonge L'Oeuvre des mers \u00e0 la fa\u00e7on d'un Suppl\u00e9ment. Chronologiquement greff\u00e9 aux volumes pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents, mais formant un tout en soi, Les Eaux territoriales incorpore au r\u00e9cit des \u00e9pisodes li\u00e9s \u00e0 la r\u00e9ception de L'Oeuvre des mers et \u00e0 sa gen\u00e8se devenue une couche fertile de souvenirs. S'y multiplient des allusions litt\u00e9raires dont le narrateur semble se faire un rempart dans le territoire de son enfance qu'il reconna\u00eet de moins en moins.            Richard Sieburth     Louise Lab\u00e9, one of the most original poets of the French Renaissance, published her complete Works around the age of thirty and then disappeared from history. Rediscovered in the nineteenth century, her incandescent love sonnets were later translated into German by Rilke and appear here in a revelatory new English version by the award-winning translator Richard Sieburth.            Eug\u00e8ne Nicole     \u00c0 partir de titres d\u2019ouvrages sortis de l\u2019imagination de  son ami Manlio, et de quelques autres qui se sont jadis impos\u00e9s \u00e0 lui dans  l\u2019heure de midi, Borman, le capitaine du Pyjama , \u00e9crit des histoires.  Peut-\u00eatre veut-il ainsi oublier l\u2019interminable et futile croisi\u00e8re que  programme d\u2019un lieu inconnu son patron, l\u2019\u00e9nigmatique Jean Bellair, repr\u00e9sent\u00e9  sur le paquebot par son seul pyjama qu\u2019installe chaque soir dans une cabine  diff\u00e9rente une jeune fille tir\u00e9e au sort dans un groupe de ling\u00e8res  express\u00e9ment embauch\u00e9es pour ce service ? Il est vrai que, dans la  cabine 21, r\u00e9side Madame Ad\u00e9la\u00efde, l\u2019\u00e9pouse de Jean Bellair, qui ne semble  plus avoir toute sa t\u00eate, et que la 12, toujours ferm\u00e9e, abrite les Archives  pour servir \u00e0 l\u2019histoire du Bureau des Objets trouv\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019Op\u00e9ra-Comique .      Dans ce roman o\u00f9 il est tant question de titres, le d\u00e9mon  rassembleur figure-t-il la force coh\u00e9sive qui doit tant bien que mal faire  tenir ensemble tant de personnages (humains ou non), d\u2019objets h\u00e9t\u00e9roclites et  de mondes possibles ? Ce serait en somme Borman au travail. \u00c0 moins que ce  ne soit Borman lui-m\u00eame (auteur, narrateur et personnage) qu\u2019ait invent\u00e9, pour  ainsi dire en amont du r\u00e9cit, le d\u00e9mon rassembleur \u2013 si, par exemple, le  texte qu\u2019on va lire \u00e9tait la fusion d\u2019une s\u00e9rie de nouvelles d\u00e9j\u00e0  \u00e9crites ?                         Emily Apter     Against World Literature: On the Politics of Untranslatability argues for a rethinking of comparative literature focusing on the problems that emerge when large-scale paradigms of literary studies ignore the politics of the \u201cUntranslatable\u201d\u2014the realm of those words that are continually retranslated, mistranslated, transferred from language to language, or especially resistant to substitution. In the place of \u201cWorld Literature\u201d\u2014a dominant paradigm in the humanities, one grounded in market-driven notions of readability and universal appeal\u2014Apter proposes a plurality of \u201cworld literatures\u201d oriented around philosophical concepts and geopolitical pressure points. The history and theory of the language that constructs World Literature is critically examined with a special focus on Weltliteratur, literary world systems, narrative ecosystems, language borders and checkpoints, theologies of translation, and planetary devolution in a book set to revolutionize the discipline of comparative literature.             Phillip Usher     Epic Arts in Renaissance France studies the relationship between epic literature and other art forms such as painting, sculpture, and architecture. Why, the book asks, the epic heroes and themes so ubiquitous in French Renaissance art are widely celebrated whereas the same period's literary epics, frequently maligned, now go unread? To explore this paradox, the book investigates a number of epic building sites, i.e. specific situations in which literary epics either become the basis for realisations in other art forms or somehow contest or compete with them. Beginning with a detour about the appearance of epic heroes (Odysseus and Aeneas) on marriage chests in fifteenth-century Florence, the study traces how French communities of readers, writers, translators, and artists reinvent epic forms in their own\u2014or their patron's\u2014image. Following extended discussion of three galleries in different regions of France, which all depicted key scenes from the classical epics of Homer, Virgil, and Lucan, the book turns to epics written in the period. Chapters of Epic Arts focus on Etienne Dolet's Fata , which praise the victories (but also failures) of Fran\u00e7ois Ier in ways that make it both a continuum of Fontainebleau and a response to the celebration of French defeat in foreign paintings; on Ronsard's Franciade , whose muse was depicted on the fa\u00e7ade of the Louvre and whose story was eventually taken up in a long series of paintings by Toussaint Dubreuil; and on Agrippa d'Aubign\u00e9's Protestant Tragiques , which allude to, and frequently function as graffiti over, Catholic works of art in Paris and Rome. Situated at the frontier of literary criticism and art history, Epic Arts in Renaissance France is a compelling call for a revaluation of French epic literature and indeed of how we read.
