Through a series of conferences, site visits, and seminars, the course examines four key moments or themes as a means of apprehending the density of French cultural, social, and political life. Starting with French republicanism, past, present, and future, we consider how France, at once the preeminent site of experiments in democratic liberty, is also plagued by institutional entrenchments of class stratification and the dual specters of colonialism and post-colonialism. Turning to Paris, the \u201ccapital of modernity,\u201d we reflect on its 19th century emergence as a locus of phantasmagoria, mystery, and seduction, and the emergent capitalist forces that were shaping the urban landscape. We consider the early 20th century avant-garde, among the most important and radical artistic and political movements of our time, that opened new spaces in which to imagine the very terms of \u201cart\u201d and \u201cpolitics,\u201d to finish with a consideration of France in the contemporary moment, wrestling with global transformations, the crisis of the welfare state, and a tension between the reproduction of elites and a political commitment to equality that increasingly troubles the country\u2019s educational system, politics, and cultural life.     Interdisciplinary and \u201cinter-textual\u201d in scope, the course fuses expert lectures, textual analysis, and out of the classroom experience, to bring together the artistic, the literary, and the social scientific, against the backdrop of global transformation.   Class organization and assignments     This is a required course for all students at NYUParis. Students meet in assigned groups according to their language level; students with an advanced level of French may do their coursework in French. Students are expected to attend all conferences and site visits, to do the assigned readings and to participate in class discussions.

Beginning with the grandeur of Paris during the Belle Epoque and the Exposition Universelle of 1900, and moving to the violence and tragedy of World Wars I and II, this course examines the French modernist art movements of the first part of the 20th century. After identifying the origins of modernism in the late 19th century with Impressionism and Post-Impressionism, we will consider the ways in which Fauvism, Cubism, Expressionism, and Primitivism redefined modernism for the 20th century. Working with Dada and Surrealist art works, we will evaluate the relationship between humor, critique, and cultural and political dissension in artistic production. Finally, we will examine the trans-Atlantic currents of Abstraction, looking at Abstract Expressionism, L\u2019Art Informel, and the Nouveau Realistes. Throughout this exploration, we will interrogate how social history, shaped by politics, gender, and race, informed the construction of an artistic modernism in the 20th century. Conducted in English.

The works of important French artists working elsewhere will also be considered. Students will visit numerous sites in Paris, including the Louvre, the Mus\u00e9e des Invalides, the Musee Carnavalet, the Hotel de Soubise, and important churches, and study in addition many sites visiting distance from the capital, such as Chambord, Fontainebleau, Maisons-Lafitte, and Versailles. Painters discussed include the Clouet family, Georges de la Tour, Nicolas Poussin, Claude Lorrain, Charles LeBrun, Jean-Baptiste-Simeon Chardin, Antoine Watteau, Francois Boucher, and Jean-Honore Fragonard. Conducted in English.                                                                      Le Grand Paris, Present and Future - ARTH-UA 9850 - 4 points                               Paris by the Seine stars in more Hollywood films than any other city. London on the Thames takes close runner-up position. But more than mythic, popular-culture stage sets, these two great European capitals operate as spectacular rival models in face of real-life, 21st-century dramas. Our course concentrates on a sequence of case studies targeting the evolving architecture and urban plan of Paris. We focus on current thematic debates crucial to its identity, survival and future\u2014tradition contra innovation, continuity contra rupture, preservation contra demolition, obsolescence contra revitalization. We investigate controversies over the low- and high-density city; legislation on building heights, protection of skyline and riverbanks; the interface between historic and experimental building types; the balance between public and private space, residential and mixed-economy neighbourhoods, inner-city rehabilitation and suburban sprawl; intra- and extra-muros transportation systems (road, rail, river, air). As a foil and finale to our Paris studies, we conclude with a critical comparative analysis of contemporary London to illuminate fundamental differences between these two global cities: the rational French model largely tempered by state control against the exuberant English model predominantly driven by ultra-liberal policies. Will the third millennium ideal city emerge as a polymorphic combination of the two approaches? Conducted in English .   Sample Syllabus                                                                    European Society and Cinema - FREN-UA 9865 or\u00a0DRLIT-UA 9524 - 4 points                               This course examines the social, economic, and political role of cinema in Europe, with an emphasis on recent decades. It takes into consideration transformations in film as a narrative form and cultural product in the shift from national cinema traditions to global communications networks and media convergence. Films studied include popular, independent, and avant-garde films from a range of countries and cultures. The structures of production, distribution, and conservation are also considered through visits to exhibitions, archives and movie theatres. Conducted in English.

Students come into close contact with the daily life of the site at which they are studying through a two-semester experiential learning sequence, which is designed to contextualize the site's culture and give students internship or internship-like experiences in the community. The fall Experiential Learning I course begins the immersion experience with a variety of community-based projects and an advanced introduction to the site's cultural and social identity. The spring Experiential Learning II includes a 2-credit on-site component that emphasizes internships (or the equivalent) and a 2-credit Junior Independent Research Seminar (for which students will register separately), in which students work online with a GLS faculty member and students with similar interests at different sites to craft an independent research project, an important preparation for the senior thesis. Conducted in English.                                                                      Intro to the Parisian Contemporary Art Scene - FREN-UA 9865 - 4 points                               NYU Art History students: This course counts for Art History Elective credit.   This course aims to understand and appreciate the creativity and dynamism of the Parisian art scene today through an exploration of contemporary art in the capital. The course will focus on the diversity of resources provided by the city, with special attention to new artistic practices and loci of production, as well as the multiple actors involved, from artists themselves to private galleries to art critics and museum curators. Reference to major avant-garde art movements of the past such as dada, geometrical abstraction, surrealism and expressionism will also be made in order to better situate today\u2019s artistic concerns. Conducted in English.   Sample Syllabus                                                                    Ideal Society in Theory &amp; Practice, France Since the Middle Ages -\u00a0FREN-UA 9865 - 4 points                               An introduction to classic texts of French political and social philosophy. Consideration of the historical influences upon and the historical impact of French thinkers. Through close readings and analysis of selected passages from primary sources (in English translation), and those few seminal non-French works that inspired new directions in French thought, we will explore the intellectual framework and historical references that inform French debates on politics and society to the present day. Philosophers to be considered include St. Thomas Aquinas, Machiavelli, Montaigne, de la Fontaine, Descartes, Montesquieu, Rousseau, Napoleon Bonaparte, Saint-Simon, Prudhon, Marx, Jules Ferry, Zola, Fanon, Camus, and Sartre. Conducted in English.   Sample Syllabus                                                                    Experimental Theatre Workshop - FREN-UA 9868 - 4 points                               This course is designed to allow students to analyze and reenact excerpts from Moli\u00e8re\u2019s plays. We will discover the playwright Moli\u00e8re (1622-1673) who was also an actor, troupe leader, and the author of numerous plays which remain to this day the most frequently staged plays in France. The recurring themes in his plays will be discussed, particularly in relation to the time period during which the plays were written. We will also touch on the role of farce in the work of this playwright who was nicknamed in the 17th century \u201cthe foremost joker in France.\u201d Dramatic analysis of the plays chosen will require a comparative study of texts in French and in English.   We will read and analyze these texts out loud. Certain excerpts will need to be memorized. We will analyze the ideas expressed as well as the importance of certain words, of the images evoked, and of the punctuation used in order to bring to life the rhythm and musicality of the phrases. The ultimate objective of this course will be to arouse the creativity of each student with regard to the many possibilities for modern interpretation, notably in reimagining d\u00e9cor, costumes, and Moli\u00e8re\u2019s stances.   T he texts studied will be excerpts from the following Moli\u00e8re plays: Tartuffe, The Misanthrope, The Miser, The Bourgeois Gentleman, The Doctor in Spite of Himself, and Don Juan . The students will also be required to read three plays of their choice in their entirety.   Conducted in English.                                                                      Studies in Prose Genres: Post-Colonial Readings of Classic Texts - FREN-UA 9833 or COLIT-UA 9125 - 4 points                               In this course we focus on four contemporary novels in which the world of the character, the narrator, or the author, is read through the lens of a literary classic. In each case, the reading and rewriting of the primary text involves temporal and spatial displacements (from the 18th to the 20th century, from Europe to the Caribbean and to the South Pacific) that generate shifting perspectives and a constant reshuffling of center and periphery. Between a reverential affiliation to the past and a creative misreading and rewriting of it, these intertextual encounters with \u00ab great \u00bb Western literary works insistently raise the questions of identity, originality, and \u201cwriting back\u201d. Exploring these questions will therefore also involve drawing on comparative, translation, and postcolonial studies.                                                                      Power & Representation: Art from the Ancien R\u00e9gime to the Age of Revolution\u00a0-\u00a0FREN-UA 9865 - 4 points (may be counted for MCC credit)                               Please note that this course can be counted toward the NYU Media, Culture, &amp; Communication major. Should you choose to enroll in this course, please notify your MCC primary advisor. He or she will make sure this course is accurately reflected in your academic record.   Our course explores the dramatic evolution of French art across 200 tumultuous years, from its classical origins under Louis XIII and Louis XIV's Old Regime, through its transformations across the Enlightenment period, to its radical Neo-Classical revision during the French Revolution, and Romantic reconstruction at the demise of the Napoleonic era and Bourbon Restoration, ending with the 1830 Revolution. Through analysis of the reciprocity between artists and the political-cultural institutions of Paris, we examine the ways by which art \u2015painting, architecture, popular prints, caricatures\u2015operates as a potent discursive programme within French society. Its role as a dense symbolic language of communication and persuasion, and/or as a critique of social and moral values dominates our investigation. It also serves as a model to investigate the role of contemporary electronic and print media and their influence on our perceptions of society and the representation of power in the global world. Conducted in English.                                                                      French and Expatriate Literature - FREN-UA 9868 or SASEM-UG 9351 - 4 points                               In this course, we will explore the ways in which Paris plays a role in the representation of the subject. Through the study of novels and autobiographies by Breton, Hemingway, Stein, Duras, Modiano, de Beauvoir, and Baldwin, we will ask, what is the role of place in the imagining or invention of the self? How does the experience of a specific city, Paris, influence the formation of identity? How do these authors represent, or subvert, the notion of the \u2018real\u2019?

Turn a corner and in the distance you'll see the Arc de Triomphe built to the glory of Napoleon's army or the Eiffel tower erected for the centennial of the fall of the Bastille. Even the metro stops, Concorde, Nation, R\u00e9publique, Austerlitz, I\u00e9na, echo with the memory of the years of the French Revolution and the First Empire.  But what historic reality does all this evoke? What led some French people to overthrow their age old Monarchy, turn their backs on the Church and launch into a new era of Republican government? What caused others to resist such changes with all their might? And why did the experiment end within 10 years, giving way to military dictatorship and an Empire which spread French rule across Europe.  This semester we shall explore these issues and others pertaining to the Age of the French Revolution &amp; Napoleon through lectures, readings, discussions and site visits in and around the city of Paris.

Beginning with the epistemological and metaphysical debates that followed the rediscovery of Ancient philosophy and the Copernican revolution in the sciences, we will consider Montaigne\u2019s skepticism, Descartes\u2019 attempts at securing our knowledge of the soul, God, and the external world, and Condillac\u2019s empiricist critique of Descartes\u2019 theory of knowledge. We will then focus on major developments in French political philosophy in the 18th and 19th centuries, closely intertwined with political events in France at the time, including such figures as Rousseau, Proudhon, and Tocqueville. Finally, we will look at two of the major movements in French philosophy in the first half of the 20th century: Henri Bergson\u2019s attempts to understand the temporal duration conscious beings inhabit, and Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir\u2019s distinctive development of existentialism, a philosophy that grapples with the radical consequences of human freedom.

The technological, mediological, and digital worlds constitute a part of a shared material culture with profound implications for human experience. In this course, attempt to develop a critical heuristic which maps the topoi of the socio-eco-techno system. Drawing on mediology, ethics, and the French school of the anthropology of techniques, we explore such topoi as a form of \u201cdeep\u201d historical sediment and also to understand how our values are negotiated and transformed via our on-going rapport with the technological.

Paris of the 19th and early 20th centuries developed into a major urban center, in part because of the promise of liberty that drew people there following the upheavals of the Revolution. The urban renewal that occurred under the Second Empire in the mid-19th century in particular transformed the capital into a modern city of innovation and spectacle. While the official arts reflected the tastes and priorities of successive governments and the emergent bourgeoisie, it was the avant-garde that most marked the city as a site of resistance and daring. In this course we study these different art movements as they relate to the city of Paris, studying the sites, movements, and transformations that helped shape the modern arts. Conducted in French.   Sample Syllabus                                                                    The Birth of Democracy in Europe - FREN-UA 9091 or HIST-UA 9091 or POL-UA 9591 - 4 points                               We begin with a definition of the term &quot;democracy&quot; as developed by the Athenian City-State in the 5th century before Christ, before moving on to discuss its reappraisal by such theoreticians of the 17th century as Locke, or of the Enlightenment, such as Montesquieu and Rousseau. Their versions, indeed, serve as the basis for the French Revolution of 1789. A long and difficult process, democracy needed nearly a century before establishing itself in France. Drawing on numerous examples from 19th and 20th century history, we will try to understand why the great contributions of democracy, such as universal suffrage and the concept of individual liberty, were so difficult to put into operation. We will also consider why these &quot;givens&quot; are still fragile. Conducted in French.

The first half of the course focuses on the political, socio-economic, and cultural history of France in the modern period, from roughly 1870 to the 1980. The second half of the course looks more closely at the contemporary period, focusing on the various \u2018crises\u2019 and transitions that have marked France during the past 20 years. Topics include the challenges of the post-colonial period (immigration, la francophonie, questions of identity), France in and of the European Union, France and globalization, and social issues in current events (the status of women, la banlieue, social exclusion).

The course will offer insights and analyses on the different roles which are played by France and the United States on the issues of youth, women, and Modern Islam in the Arab World and on how their soft power is perceived by the Arab countries and their populations. By addressing the foreign policies that have been articulated in the region, we will also bring into light the dichotomy between the \u201cold\u201d and the \u201cnew\u201d diplomacy.

Paris, City of Theater - FREN-UA 9968 - 4 points                               Since the 17th century Paris has been as a city of and for the theatre, from the great sites and  events that have marked theatre history, to the spectacle and fantasy that the city imparts.  In this course, we study the great works of French theatre, from the classics to the very  contemporary, through readings, performances, and visits in and around Paris to the lieux  de m\u00e9moire of the theatre world. Through the study of works by Corneille, Moli\u00e8re, Hugo,  Feydeau, Ionesco, Beckett, Sartre, and others, we consider how Paris has been integral to and  shaped by the world of French theatre. Visits include such prestigious venues as the Com\u00e9die  Fran\u00e7aise, the grands boulevards where Parisians discovered Shakespeare in the age of Sarah  Bernhardt, the remains of the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Marais where Corneille performed his plays, or  Versailles where Moli\u00e8re helped lead the grand spectacle that was life under Louis XIV.

Each dreams of one day becoming a \u201cgreen\u201d city. Danger also exists in both of these cities, amplified by rumor and fantasy. In this course we will study these phenomena through the analysis of novels, films, television series, artwork, and architecture, to ask how various representations of the city have changed and been managed over time, by diverse social actors and observers.

Sample Syllabus                                                                     Internship Seminar Fieldwork - NODEP-UA 9982 or INDIV-UG 9350 - 4 points                               Enrollment by permission only. Application required.     This 4 credit course includes a weekly seminar and two full days and one half day (Monday-Friday) for their internship. Internship placements are made by EUSA, an organization partnering with NYU.     The seminar portion of the course explores many different aspects of your internship site. The goal is to finish the semester with an in-depth understanding of the company or organization, including its approach, its policies, and the context in which it operates. We will also discuss more generally the state of the contemporary workplace and ourselves as workers. Finally, you will use the seminar to reflect critically and analytically on the internship experience and as a way to refine your own personal and professional goals.

Direct Enrollment at French Partner Universities   NYUParis students may enroll in one or more courses offered at the University of Paris schools with which we have partner agreements (University of Paris I, III, VII, X), and at specialized schools (Institut d\u2019E\u0301tudes Politiques, otherwise known as Sciences Po).   Courses available in English are offered within the Departments of Anglo-American Studies and examine various aspects of culture and civilization of the English-speaking world.    Courses offered in French are selected from the following departments: French and Comparative Literature, History, Art History, Sociology, Studio Art, Cinema, Political Science. Students must either have taken or be currently enrolled in Written Contemporary French to take a course in French at the University of Paris. In addition, students complement their coursework in individualized tutorial sessions with a tutor at NYUParis.     Students may only take courses at the University in which they are administratively enrolled (with the exception of Sciences Po - see below). You will be asked to choose which university you prefer when filling out your visa questionnaire from the Office of Global Services.    Course offerings and schedules at the University of Paris are confirmed later than the in-house courses at NYUParis. Direct enrollment at the University of Paris is therefore handled after students\u2019 arrival in Paris. Further instructions, course offerings and schedules will be communicated during the orientation period in Paris.    Please read the information about each university\u2019s specialty areas below, keeping in mind that you will only be able to take courses at the university for which you are administratively enrolled (see above).

Prerequisite: Written Contemporary French or permission of the NYU Paris staff.   NYU Paris students with advanced French language skills may attend one to two lecture courses in French at the prestigious Institut d\u2019Etudes Politiques de Paris, more commonly known as Sciences Po. Students wishing to enroll at Sciences Po in Fall 2015 must first submit the following application form to NYU Paris by April 10th, 2015 indicating their year, major, French level (current or most recently completed French language course), and GPA. We will provide deadlines for future semesters at a later date. Students will also be asked to send a short personal statement (1-2 paragraphs) stating their motivations for studying at Sciences Po as part of their application. Upon successful review of their applications, students will be invited to apply to Sciences Po in late April or early May. Application materials for Sciences Po include a transcript, CV, and statement of purpose. Please note that NYU Paris students are not necessarily guaranteed a spot at Sciences Po, so it is in students' best interest to submit a strong application.   Once students are admitted to Sciences Po, they will be able to select their courses over the summer using the Sciences Po online student portal. NYU Paris strongly encourages students admitted to Sciences Po to take only courses in French, and to take no more than 2 courses during the semester (subject to approval). It is expected that most students will take only one course per semester at Sciences Po. In exceptional cases, students may take a course in English upon approval by NYU Paris. A selection of past lecture course offerings is listed below for reference.   Please note: students wishing to attend a course at Sciences Po should enroll administratively at the University of Paris (University of Paris I, III, or VII), but will need to apply separately to Sciences Po in order to take a course at Sciences Po.

Through a series of conferences, site visits, and seminars, the course examines four key moments or themes as a means of apprehending the density of French cultural, social, and political life. Starting with French republicanism, past, present, and future, we consider how France, at once the preeminent site of experiments in democratic liberty, is also plagued by institutional entrenchments of class stratification and the dual specters of colonialism and post-colonialism. Turning to Paris, the \u201ccapital of modernity,\u201d we reflect on its 19th century emergence as a locus of phantasmagoria, mystery, and seduction, and the emergent capitalist forces that were shaping the urban landscape. We consider the early 20th century avant-garde, among the most important and radical artistic and political movements of our time, that opened new spaces in which to imagine the very terms of \u201cart\u201d and \u201cpolitics,\u201d to finish with a consideration of France in the contemporary moment, wrestling with global transformations, the crisis of the welfare state, and a tension between the reproduction of elites and a political commitment to equality that increasingly troubles the country\u2019s educational system, politics, and cultural life.     Interdisciplinary and \u201cinter-textual\u201d in scope, the course fuses expert lectures, textual analysis, and out of the classroom experience, to bring together the artistic, the literary, and the social scientific, against the backdrop of global transformation.   Class organization and assignments     This is a required course for all students at NYUParis. Students meet in assigned groups according to their language level; students with an advanced level of French may do their coursework in French. Students are expected to attend all conferences and site visits, to do the assigned readings and to participate in class discussions.

Beginning with the grandeur of Paris during the Belle Epoque and the Exposition Universelle of 1900, and moving to the violence and tragedy of World Wars I and II, this course examines the French modernist art movements of the first part of the 20th century. After identifying the origins of modernism in the late 19th century with Impressionism and Post-Impressionism, we will consider the ways in which Fauvism, Cubism, Expressionism, and Primitivism redefined modernism for the 20th century. Working with Dada and Surrealist art works, we will evaluate the relationship between humor, critique, and cultural and political dissension in artistic production. Finally, we will examine the trans-Atlantic currents of Abstraction, looking at Abstract Expressionism, L\u2019Art Informel, and the Nouveau Realistes. Throughout this exploration, we will interrogate how social history, shaped by politics, gender, and race, informed the construction of an artistic modernism in the 20th century.

London on the Thames takes close runner-up position. But more than mythic, popular-culture stage sets, these two great European capitals operate as spectacular rival models in face of real-life, 21st-century dramas. Our course concentrates on a sequence of case studies targeting the evolving architecture and urban plan of Paris. We focus on current thematic debates crucial to its identity, survival and future\u2014tradition contra innovation, continuity contra rupture, preservation contra demolition, obsolescence contra revitalization. We investigate controversies over the low- and high-density city; legislation on building heights, protection of skyline and riverbanks; the interface between historic and experimental building types; the balance between public and private space, residential and mixed-economy neighbourhoods, inner-city rehabilitation and suburban sprawl; intra- and extra-muros transportation systems (road, rail, river, air). As a foil and finale to our Paris studies, we conclude with a critical comparative analysis of contemporary London to illuminate fundamental differences between these two global cities: the rational French model largely tempered by state control against the exuberant English model predominantly driven by ultra-liberal policies. Will the third millennium ideal city emerge as a polymorphic combination of the two approaches? Conducted in English .

Consideration of the historical influences upon and the historical impact of French thinkers. Through close readings and analysis of selected passages from primary sources (in English translation), and those few seminal non-French works that inspired new directions in French thought, we will explore the intellectual framework and historical references that inform French debates on politics and society to the present day. Philosophers to be considered include St. Thomas Aquinas, Machiavelli, Montaigne, de la Fontaine, Descartes, Montesquieu, Rousseau, Napoleon Bonaparte, Saint-Simon, Prudhon, Marx, Jules Ferry, Zola, Fanon, Camus, and Sartre.

We will discover the playwright Moli\u00e8re (1622-1673) who was also an actor, troupe leader, and the author of numerous plays which remain to this day the most frequently staged plays in France. The recurring themes in his plays will be discussed, particularly in relation to the time period during which the plays were written. We will also touch on the role of farce in the work of this playwright who was nicknamed in the 17th century \u201cthe foremost joker in France.\u201d Dramatic analysis of the plays chosen will require a comparative study of texts in French and in English.   We will read and analyze these texts out loud. Certain excerpts will need to be memorized. We will analyze the ideas expressed as well as the importance of certain words, of the images evoked, and of the punctuation used in order to bring to life the rhythm and musicality of the phrases. The ultimate objective of this course will be to arouse the creativity of each student with regard to the many possibilities for modern interpretation, notably in reimagining d\u00e9cor, costumes, and Moli\u00e8re\u2019s stances.   T he texts studied will be excerpts from the following Moli\u00e8re plays: Tartuffe, The Misanthrope, The Miser, The Bourgeois Gentleman, The Doctor in Spite of Himself, and Don Juan . The students will also be required to read three plays of their choice in their entirety.   Conducted in English.                                                                      Studies in Prose Genres: Post-Colonial Readings of Classic Texts - FREN-UA 9833 or COLIT-UA 9125 - 4 points                               In this course we focus on four contemporary novels in which the world of the character, the narrator, or the author, is read through the lens of a literary classic. In each case, the reading and rewriting of the primary text involves temporal and spatial displacements (from the 18th to the 20th century, from Europe to the Caribbean and to the South Pacific) that generate shifting perspectives and a constant reshuffling of center and periphery. Between a reverential affiliation to the past and a creative misreading and rewriting of it, these intertextual encounters with \u00ab great \u00bb Western literary works insistently raise the questions of identity, originality, and \u201cwriting back\u201d. Exploring these questions will therefore also involve drawing on comparative, translation, and postcolonial studies.

Our course explores the dramatic evolution of French art across 200 tumultuous years, from its classical origins under Louis XIII and Louis XIV's Old Regime, through its transformations across the Enlightenment period, to its radical Neo-Classical revision during the French Revolution, and Romantic reconstruction at the demise of the Napoleonic era and Bourbon Restoration, ending with the 1830 Revolution. Through analysis of the reciprocity between artists and the political-cultural institutions of Paris, we examine the ways by which art \u2015painting, architecture, popular prints, caricatures\u2015operates as a potent discursive programme within French society. Its role as a dense symbolic language of communication and persuasion, and/or as a critique of social and moral values dominates our investigation. It also serves as a model to investigate the role of contemporary electronic and print media and their influence on our perceptions of society and the representation of power in the global world.

Through the study of novels and autobiographies by Breton, Hemingway, Stein, Duras, Modiano, de Beauvoir, and Baldwin, we will ask, what is the role of place in the imagining or invention of the self? How does the experience of a specific city, Paris, influence the formation of identity? How do these authors represent, or subvert, the notion of the \u2018real\u2019? Although the focus of this course is literary, we will also engage with major political, cultural, and artistic movements of the period, exploring the ways in which our writers negotiate history through their writings.

Turn a corner and in the distance you'll see the Arc de Triomphe built to the glory of Napoleon's army or the Eiffel tower erected for the centennial of the fall of the Bastille. Even the metro stops, Concorde, Nation, R\u00e9publique, Austerlitz, I\u00e9na, echo with the memory of the years of the French Revolution and the First Empire.  But what historic reality does all this evoke? What led some French people to overthrow their age old Monarchy, turn their backs on the Church and launch into a new era of Republican government? What caused others to resist such changes with all their might? And why did the experiment end within 10 years, giving way to military dictatorship and an Empire which spread French rule across Europe.

Beginning with the epistemological and metaphysical debates that followed the rediscovery of Ancient philosophy and the Copernican revolution in the sciences, we will consider Montaigne\u2019s skepticism, Descartes\u2019 attempts at securing our knowledge of the soul, God, and the external world, and Condillac\u2019s empiricist critique of Descartes\u2019 theory of knowledge. We will then focus on major developments in French political philosophy in the 18th and 19th centuries, closely intertwined with political events in France at the time, including such figures as Rousseau, Proudhon, and Tocqueville. Finally, we will look at two of the major movements in French philosophy in the first half of the 20th century: Henri Bergson\u2019s attempts to understand the temporal duration conscious beings inhabit, and Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir\u2019s distinctive development of existentialism, a philosophy that grapples with the radical consequences of human freedom.

In this course we will read poetry out loud in order to show how poetry is founded on rhythm and the repetition of phonetic and syntactic elements. This pragmatic approach will not only allow students to improve their pronunciation, but also to understand the poetic genre, the quality of poets\u2019 language, their interest in etymology, metaphor, imagery, etc. Close readings, paraphrase and translations will allow students to considerably improve their mastery of the French language so that they in turn will be able to produce poetry of their own. This course will help them to integrate the phonic, rhythmic and musical dimensions of poetry, as well as learn about its various uses, from the intimate to historical testimonies.

Writing Workshop: Writing Paris - FREN-UA 9968 - 2 points                               Given in the form of a workshop, this course allows students to improve their written expression through the study and practice of a variety of literary registers, mostly drawn from contemporary literature. The workshop associates literary creation and French language instruction with the firm belief that creative writing in French is possible for students at all levels. Its primary objective is the reinforcement of students\u2019 written competencies in French, accomplished through intensive writing sessions with the common theme of Paris. Students are invited to appropriate Paris through various writing activities, inspired by writers such as Baudelaire, Perec, or Modiano, designed to help students capture the city through its movements, its images, and its different facets. The regular practice of creative writing as well as systematic re-writing of all work will allow students to reinforce grammatical structures while expanding vocabulary. Conducted in French.

Paris of the 19th and early 20th centuries developed into a major urban center, in part because of the promise of liberty that drew people there following the upheavals of the Revolution. The urban renewal that occurred under the Second Empire in the mid-19th century in particular transformed the capital into a modern city of innovation and spectacle. While the official arts reflected the tastes and priorities of successive governments and the emergent bourgeoisie, it was the avant-garde that most marked the city as a site of resistance and daring. In this course we study these different art movements as they relate to the city of Paris, studying the sites, movements, and transformations that helped shape the modern arts. Conducted in French.   Sample Syllabus                                                                    The Birth of Democracy in Europe - FREN-UA 9091 or HIST-UA 9091 or POL-UA 9591 - 4 points                               We begin with a definition of the term &quot;democracy&quot; as developed by the Athenian City-State in the 5th century before Christ, before moving on to discuss its reappraisal by such theoreticians of the 17th century as Locke, or of the Enlightenment, such as Montesquieu and Rousseau. Their versions, indeed, serve as the basis for the French Revolution of 1789. A long and difficult process, democracy needed nearly a century before establishing itself in France. Drawing on numerous examples from 19th and 20th century history, we will try to understand why the great contributions of democracy, such as universal suffrage and the concept of individual liberty, were so difficult to put into operation. We will also consider why these &quot;givens&quot; are still fragile. Conducted in French.

The first half of the course focuses on the political, socio-economic, and cultural history of France in the modern period, from roughly 1870 to the 1980. The second half of the course looks more closely at the contemporary period, focusing on the various \u2018crises\u2019 and transitions that have marked France during the past 20 years. Topics include the challenges of the post-colonial period (immigration, la francophonie, questions of identity), France in and of the European Union, France and globalization, and social issues in current events (the status of women, la banlieue, social exclusion).

The course will offer insights and analyses on the different roles which are played by France and the United States on the issues of youth, women, and Modern Islam in the Arab World and on how their soft power is perceived by the Arab countries and their populations. By addressing the foreign policies that have been articulated in the region, we will also bring into light the dichotomy between the \u201cold\u201d and the \u201cnew\u201d diplomacy.                                                                        Existentialism and the Absurd - FREN-UA 9767 - 4 points                               This course explores the main expressions of existential thought in the works of Jean-Paul Sartre, Simone de Beauvoir, and Albert Camus, as well as absurdist literature from the 1950s. In particular, we consider the French existentialists\u2019 concern for commitment in political and social affairs, and how this is reflected in \u201ctheatre of the absurd,\u201d in fiction, and in critical work of other contemporary French writers. Covers Ionesco, Beckett, Genet, Robbe-Grillet, and Barthes; precursors of the absurd such as Kafka and C\u00e9line; some consideration may be given in addition to practitioners of the absurd outside of France.

Paris, City of Theater - FREN-UA 9968 - 4 points                               Since the 17th century Paris has been as a city of and for the theatre, from the great sites and  events that have marked theatre history, to the spectacle and fantasy that the city imparts.  In this course, we study the great works of French theatre, from the classics to the very  contemporary, through readings, performances, and visits in and around Paris to the lieux  de m\u00e9moire of the theatre world. Through the study of works by Corneille, Moli\u00e8re, Hugo,  Feydeau, Ionesco, Beckett, Sartre, and others, we consider how Paris has been integral to and  shaped by the world of French theatre. Visits include such prestigious venues as the Com\u00e9die  Fran\u00e7aise, the grands boulevards where Parisians discovered Shakespeare in the age of Sarah  Bernhardt, the remains of the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Marais where Corneille performed his plays, or  Versailles where Moli\u00e8re helped lead the grand spectacle that was life under Louis XIV.

Beginning with an historical overview, we consider the category of \u2018woman\u2019 as it was defined from the Revolution to the founding of French feminism at the end of the 19th century. The second part of the course is devoted to an exploration of gender as a political issue during the past 20 years, through consideration of such topics as parit\u00e9, prostitution, colonialism, post-colonialism, and queer studies.

Between Fiction and Reality: New York and Paris - SOC-UA 9461 or SCA-UA 9624 - 4 points                                As major metropolises, Paris and New York are deeply engaged in processes of globalization: each has to stay competitive, to accumulate wealth, to hold on to its inhabitants as well as to attract tourists, business professionals, students, and immigrants. Each dreams of one day becoming a \u201cgreen\u201d city. Danger also exists in both of these cities, amplified by rumor and fantasy. In this course we will study these phenomena through the analysis of novels, films, television series, artwork, and architecture, to ask how various representations of the city have changed and been managed over time, by diverse social actors and observers.

Prerequisite: Written Contemporary French or permission of the NYU Paris staff.   NYU Paris students with advanced French language skills may attend one to two lecture courses in French at the prestigious Institut d\u2019Etudes Politiques de Paris, more commonly known as Sciences Po. Students wishing to enroll at Sciences Po in Fall 2015 must first submit the following application form to NYU Paris by April 10th, 2015 indicating their year, major, French level (current or most recently completed French language course), and GPA. We will provide deadlines for future semesters at a later date. Students will also be asked to send a short personal statement (1-2 paragraphs) stating their motivations for studying at Sciences Po as part of their application. Upon successful review of their applications, students will be invited to apply to Sciences Po in late April or early May. Application materials for Sciences Po include a transcript, CV, and statement of purpose. Please note that NYU Paris students are not necessarily guaranteed a spot at Sciences Po, so it is in students' best interest to submit a strong application.   Once students are admitted to Sciences Po, they will be able to select their courses over the summer using the Sciences Po online student portal. NYU Paris strongly encourages students admitted to Sciences Po to take only courses in French, and to take no more than 2 courses during the semester (subject to approval). It is expected that most students will take only one course per semester at Sciences Po. In exceptional cases, students may take a course in English upon approval by NYU Paris.

Prerequisite: History of Western Art II (ARTH-UA 2), or Renaissance and Baroque Art (ARTH-UA 5), or a score of 5 on the AP Art History exam. Offered periodically. 4 points.   Topics discussed include the development of landscape as a separate subject in art; the Reformation's effects on subject matter and aesthetics; what northerners learned from the classicizing Italians and what the Italians learned from northern realism; aspects of patronage and the art market; northern ideas about the nude and eroticism; the northern interest in peasant life and in the grotesque; the sociopolitical significance of dress; and the importance of printmaking. As modern nation-states coalesce, we see the development of artistic tendencies that can be called French, Netherlandish, and German. Among the artists to be discussed are the German artists Albrecht D\u00fcrer, Matthias Gr\u00fcnewald, Hans Holbein the Younger, and the Cranach family; the Netherlandish artists Hieronymus (Jerome) Bosch, Quentin Massys, Lucas van Leyden, Jan Gossaert, and Pieter Brueghel the Elder; and Jean and Fran\u00e7ois Clouet and other artists associated with the French court.

Painting and sculpture in Italy, 1580\u20131700. Highlights  major developments in the visual arts and the work of leading artists including Caravaggio, Carracci, Bernini, and Poussin. Focusing on the often paradoxical nature of Baroque art, the course examines the blurring of boundaries between the real and the imaginary, the instantaneous and the infinite, the imitative and the innovative. Special attention is paid to the creative process and the influences on it: the role of the patron, the logistics of site, and the artist's own thought process as revealed through preparatory drawings and sketches. The course is designed to help students develop the skills necessary to \"read\" works of art in all their rich complexity of form and meaning.    Dutch and Flemish Painting, 1600\u20131700    ARTH-UA 311 Identical to MEDI-UA 311.

In Antwerp, Rubens overturned all previous concepts of painting. The first to deserve the term \"Baroque,\" he dominated Flanders. Van Dyck, his pupil, took Rubens's style to England. Dutch painters, including Hals, Rembrandt, and Vermeer, moved in a different direction, addressing every aspect of their country and society: the peasant, the quiet life of the well-ordered household, the sea and landscape, views of the cities, and church interiors.    French Art: Renaissance to Rococo, 1520\u20131770    ARTH-UA 313 Identical to MEDI-UA 313.

Lectures on still life painting and polychrome wood sculpture are also included. The 18th century (the Tiepolo family, Mel\u00e9ndez) is then discussed. The focus then shifts to the art of Francisco de Goya and the projection of Spanish art into the modern era. This course also seeks to define Spain in the 16th and 17th century as a global power and thus emphasis is also placed on art in such New World centers as Mexico City and Lima in the colonial era.    Latin American Art: From Colonial to Modern    ARTH-UA 316 Identical to MEDI-UA 316 Prerequisite: History of Western Art II (ARTH-UA 2), or Renaissance and Baroque Art (ARTH-UA 5), or Modern Art (ARTH-UA 6), or a score of 5 on the AP Art History exam.

Not a traditional survey, this course opens with a brief consideration of the achievements of the great pre-Hispanic civilizations (Aztec, Maya, Inca, and others) prior to contact with the Iberian world. Major emphasis is given to colonial painting, sculpture, and architecture in Mexico and Central America, the Caribbean, and the Andes. Painting and sculpture of the 19th century and the secularization of Latin American art is then examined before a discussion of the establishment of modernism that comes about with the formation of academies and the travels of many artists from all parts of Latin America and the Caribbean to Europe and the U.S. from 1900 onward. Important modern artists such as the Mexican muralists, Frida Kahlo, Joaqu\u00edn Torres-Garc\u00eda, Tarsila do Amaral, Wifredo Lam, and the surrealists will bring the course up to approximately 1950.

Focusing on the creation of modern building types such as the bank, state capitol, museum, railroad station, and skyscraper, the course begins in the later 18th century with the idealistic designs of Ledoux and Boull\u00e9e. After considering the forms and meanings associated with neoclassicism, the course examines the Gothic revival and subsequent 19th-century movements (e.g., high Victorian Gothic, Second Empire, beaux-arts classicism) as efforts to find appropriate expressions for diverse building forms. Students consider changes resulting from the Industrial Revolution, including developments in technology, and the reforms of art nouveau and secession architecture. Works of Adam, Soane, Jefferson, Schinkel, Pugin, Richardson, and Sullivan; McKim, Mead, and White; Mackintosh, early Frank Lloyd Wright, and others.    Modern Architecture: 1914 to the Present    ARTH-UA 409 Prerequisite: History of Western Art II (ARTH-UA 2), or Modern Art (ARTH-UA 6), or Early Modern Architecture: 1776-1914 (ARTH-UA 408), or History of Architecture from Antiquity to the Present (ARTH-UA 601), or Expressive Culture: Architecture in New York Field Study (MAP-UA 722), or a score of 5 on the AP Art History exam.

Neoclassicism to Realism    ARTH-UA 411 Prerequisite: History of Western Art II (ARTH-UA 2), or Modern Art (ARTH-UA 6), or a score of 5 on the AP Art History exam. Offered every year. 4 points.   The Enlightenment shaped the visual arts in two seemingly antithetical ways. On the one hand, the period's valorization of cool rationalism contributed to the rise of neoclassicism as a dominant style during the 18th century. The other course of Enlightenment thinking, exemplified by the writings of J. J. Rousseau, celebrated emotion as the purest form of intellectual as well as spiritual expression. Romanticism, with its emphasis on subjectivity and intense emotionalism, is as much a product of the Enlightenment as neoclassicism. Following on the heels of romanticism, realism has been alternately described as a rejection of romanticism and as an extension of it. Focusing on these three stylistic movements, this course examines how late 18th- and early 19th-century artists negotiated not just the aesthetic ideas of the Enlightenment but its political consequences as well.    Impressionism to Expressionism    ARTH-UA 412 Prerequisite: History of Western Art II (ARTH-UA 2), or Modern Art (ARTH-UA 6), or a score of 5 on the AP Art History exam. Offered every year. 4 points.   Beginning by considering how impressionism refined and redirected the artistic aims of 19th-century realism, this course follows the development of progressive art to the brink of cubism and pure abstraction in the first years of the 20th century. Following impressionism and post-impressionism, close attention is paid to symbolism, aestheticism, art nouveau, the Arts and Crafts movement, fauvism, and expressionism. The aesthetic aims of these movements are analyzed in tandem with the social and cultural conditions that generated them.    Cubism to Abstract Expressionism    ARTH-UA 413 Prerequisite: History of Western Art II (ARTH-UA 2), or Modern Art (ARTH-UA 6), or a score of 5 on the AP Art History exam. Offered every year. 4 points.   After analyzing the invention of cubism by Picasso and Braque, this course examines its international reverberations, including Italian futurism, the later phases of German expressionism, the de Stijl movement in the Netherlands, and suprematism and constructivism in revolutionary Russia. The dada movement in the period during and after World War I is examined as a reaction to the apparent bankruptcy, cultural and artistic, of Western civilization. However, this nihilistic impulse is followed by a \"return to order\" in the 1920s. The course then examines the tensions in the multiple currents of surrealism: metamorphic, academic, and abject. Painting after World War II, from Pollock to Dubuffet, is analyzed as an extension and transformation of prewar trends.    Postmodern Art and Contemporary Art    ARTH-UA 414 Prerequisite: History of Western Art II (ARTH-UA 2), or Modern Art (ARTH-UA 6), or a score of 5 on the AP Art History exam. Offered every year. 4 points.   Surveys art in the postmodern era, ca. 1955 to the present. After examining the innovations of the neo-avant-garde generation (1955\u201375), our focus shifts from the radical innovations in mediums, materials, and techniques to the expanded field of critical engagement that contemporary art encompasses. Discrete \"early\" developments sometimes dubbed neo-dada, such as op, pop, and fluxus, but also minimalism, conceptual art, and arte povera, radically diversified the look of art and forced the dissolution of stylistic and formal categorization in favor of a classification based on a particular question, mediatic intervention, or mode of critique. If the late 20th century brought a new emphasis on gender, race, and a number of newly pressing political forces and motivations, as we enter the 21st century, post-studio (and perhaps also \"post-critical\") artistic practices increasingly tend to be reoriented toward technology and globalism, further complicating our idea of art's relationship with its own present.    Aesthetic History of Photography    ARTH-UA 431 Identical to PHTI-UT 1102. Prerequisite: History of Western Art II (ARTH-UA 2), or Modern Art (ARTH-UA 6), or a score of 5 on the AP Art History exam.

Chronicles the history of photography's complex and symbiotic relationship to the other visual arts: painting, sculpture, architecture, installation, and performance, among others. Beginning with the medium's invention and the early fights of its practitioners to establish themselves as fine artists, the course describes photographers' unique attempts to negotiate their relationships with both artistic movements and the media culture of which they are a part. Robinson, Cameron, Emerson, F. Holland Day, Stieglitz, Moholy-Nagy, Rodchenko, Weston, \u00c1lvarez Bravo, Lartigue, De Carava, Cahun, Robert Frank, Diane Arbus, and Cindy Sherman (among others) are seen within the context of their respective art worlds, so the impact of art movements, cultural attitudes, and new technologies on photographers during different historical periods can be assessed.    Social History of Photography    ARTH-UA 432 Identical to PHTI-UT 1101. Prerequisite: History of Western Art II (ARTH-UA 2), or Modern Art (ARTH-UA 6), or a score of 5 on the AP Art History exam.

An introductory survey of the arts in China, Japan, and Korea from approximately 1000 C.E. The course emphasizes an overall understanding of the development of art and culture, as well as mastery of specific works of art. East Asian Art I followed the development of the common cultural heritage of the Northeast Asia region. Part of this commonality is due to the extraordinary influence of an early-developing Chinese civilization on Japan and Korea. However, Japan and Korea also developed their own cultures and arts, developments that accelerated in the last millennia up to the present. Topics include Song landscape paintings, Edo \"floating world\" prints, Koryo celadons, and modern art.    South Asian Art I: Indus Valley to 1200    ARTH-UA 530 Offered periodically. 4 points.   An introductory survey of the history of South Asia from 2000 B.C.E. to 1200 C.E., with an emphasis on the Indian subcontinent. From the Indus Valley culture to the present day, artistic production has played a critical role in the transmission of religious beliefs and the development of cultural systems in and around South Asia. Diverse regions were linked by trade, politics, and cultural relationships, and interaction can be charted through the changing forms and functions of art. We consider the historical circumstances surrounding the production of South and Southeast Asian art, as well as the problems that art historians face when trying to interpret the surviving evidence. We look at art in a variety of media, including, but not limited to, architecture, urban form, sculpture, painting, and performance.    South Asian Art II: 1200 to Present    ARTH-UA 531 Offered periodically. 4 points.   An introductory survey of the history of South Asian art from ca. 1200 C.E. to the present.

It follows the cultivation of new tastes in the Mughal and Rajput courts through the vigorous interaction among Persian, Indic, and European artists and elites. Finally, it turns to the colonial and postcolonial artistic responses to South Asia's complex past(s). By looking at art in a range of media\u2014including, but not limited to, painting, sculpture, architecture, and photography\u2014this course considers the ways in which art actively served as expressions of political authority and cultural identity.    Art in the Islamic World I: From the Prophet to the Mongols    ARTH-UA 540 Offered periodically. 4 points.

The period saw the initial formation of an Arab empire stretching from the Atlantic Ocean to the Indian Ocean, a decline in centralized authority, and the rise to political prominence of various North African, Iranian, and Central Asian dynasties from the 10th century onward. These political developments are reflected in the increasingly heterogeneous nature of Islamic material culture over this time span.    Art in the Islamic World II: From the Mongols to Modernism    ARTH-UA 541 Offered periodically. 4 points.   An introduction to the arts of Islam during a period of dynamic cultural and political change in the Islamic world.

Six class sessions are devoted to thematic groupings of reviews\u2014on the skyscraper, the museum, urban planning, and more\u2014in order to compare critical language, approach, and taste, while also tracking changes in architectural style from 1900 to the present. These reviews are supplemented with readings in architectural theory that attempt to define the styles of the past and present century. Students also write three reviews themselves, including one on a building, shop, or urban plan of their choice.

Through a series of conferences, site visits, and seminars, the course examines four key moments or themes as a means of apprehending the density of French cultural, social, and political life. Starting with French republicanism, past, present, and future, we consider how France, at once the preeminent site of experiments in democratic liberty, is also plagued by institutional entrenchments of class stratification and the dual specters of colonialism and post-colonialism. Turning to Paris, the \u201ccapital of modernity,\u201d we reflect on its 19th century emergence as a locus of phantasmagoria, mystery, and seduction, and the emergent capitalist forces that were shaping the urban landscape. We consider the early 20th century avant-garde, among the most important and radical artistic and political movements of our time, that opened new spaces in which to imagine the very terms of \u201cart\u201d and \u201cpolitics,\u201d to finish with a consideration of France in the contemporary moment, wrestling with global transformations, the crisis of the welfare state, and a tension between the reproduction of elites and a political commitment to equality that increasingly troubles the country\u2019s educational system, politics, and cultural life.     Interdisciplinary and \u201cinter-textual\u201d in scope, the course fuses expert lectures, textual analysis, and out of the classroom experience, to bring together the artistic, the literary, and the social scientific, against the backdrop of global transformation.   Class organization and assignments     This is a required course for all students at NYUParis. Students meet in assigned groups according to their language level; students with an advanced level of French may do their coursework in French. Students are expected to attend all conferences and site visits, to do the assigned readings and to participate in class discussions.

Beginning with the grandeur of Paris during the Belle Epoque and the Exposition Universelle of 1900, and moving to the violence and tragedy of World Wars I and II, this course examines the French modernist art movements of the first part of the 20th century. After identifying the origins of modernism in the late 19th century with Impressionism and Post-Impressionism, we will consider the ways in which Fauvism, Cubism, Expressionism, and Primitivism redefined modernism for the 20th century. Working with Dada and Surrealist art works, we will evaluate the relationship between humor, critique, and cultural and political dissension in artistic production. Finally, we will examine the trans-Atlantic currents of Abstraction, looking at Abstract Expressionism, L\u2019Art Informel, and the Nouveau Realistes. Throughout this exploration, we will interrogate how social history, shaped by politics, gender, and race, informed the construction of an artistic modernism in the 20th century.

London on the Thames takes close runner-up position. But more than mythic, popular-culture stage sets, these two great European capitals operate as spectacular rival models in face of real-life, 21st-century dramas. Our course concentrates on a sequence of case studies targeting the evolving architecture and urban plan of Paris. We focus on current thematic debates crucial to its identity, survival and future\u2014tradition contra innovation, continuity contra rupture, preservation contra demolition, obsolescence contra revitalization. We investigate controversies over the low- and high-density city; legislation on building heights, protection of skyline and riverbanks; the interface between historic and experimental building types; the balance between public and private space, residential and mixed-economy neighbourhoods, inner-city rehabilitation and suburban sprawl; intra- and extra-muros transportation systems (road, rail, river, air). As a foil and finale to our Paris studies, we conclude with a critical comparative analysis of contemporary London to illuminate fundamental differences between these two global cities: the rational French model largely tempered by state control against the exuberant English model predominantly driven by ultra-liberal policies. Will the third millennium ideal city emerge as a polymorphic combination of the two approaches? Conducted in English .

Consideration of the historical influences upon and the historical impact of French thinkers. Through close readings and analysis of selected passages from primary sources (in English translation), and those few seminal non-French works that inspired new directions in French thought, we will explore the intellectual framework and historical references that inform French debates on politics and society to the present day.

We will discover the playwright Moli\u00e8re (1622-1673) who was also an actor, troupe leader, and the author of numerous plays which remain to this day the most frequently staged plays in France. The recurring themes in his plays will be discussed, particularly in relation to the time period during which the plays were written. We will also touch on the role of farce in the work of this playwright who was nicknamed in the 17th century \u201cthe foremost joker in France.\u201d Dramatic analysis of the plays chosen will require a comparative study of texts in French and in English.   We will read and analyze these texts out loud. Certain excerpts will need to be memorized. We will analyze the ideas expressed as well as the importance of certain words, of the images evoked, and of the punctuation used in order to bring to life the rhythm and musicality of the phrases. The ultimate objective of this course will be to arouse the creativity of each student with regard to the many possibilities for modern interpretation, notably in reimagining d\u00e9cor, costumes, and Moli\u00e8re\u2019s stances.   T he texts studied will be excerpts from the following Moli\u00e8re plays: Tartuffe, The Misanthrope, The Miser, The Bourgeois Gentleman, The Doctor in Spite of Himself, and Don Juan . The students will also be required to read three plays of their choice in their entirety.   Conducted in English.

In each case, the reading and rewriting of the primary text involves temporal and spatial displacements (from the 18th to the 20th century, from Europe to the Caribbean and to the South Pacific) that generate shifting perspectives and a constant reshuffling of center and periphery. Between a reverential affiliation to the past and a creative misreading and rewriting of it, these intertextual encounters with \u00ab great \u00bb Western literary works insistently raise the questions of identity, originality, and \u201cwriting back\u201d. Exploring these questions will therefore also involve drawing on comparative, translation, and postcolonial studies.

Our course explores the dramatic evolution of French art across 200 tumultuous years, from its classical origins under Louis XIII and Louis XIV's Old Regime, through its transformations across the Enlightenment period, to its radical Neo-Classical revision during the French Revolution, and Romantic reconstruction at the demise of the Napoleonic era and Bourbon Restoration, ending with the 1830 Revolution. Through analysis of the reciprocity between artists and the political-cultural institutions of Paris, we examine the ways by which art \u2015painting, architecture, popular prints, caricatures\u2015operates as a potent discursive programme within French society. Its role as a dense symbolic language of communication and persuasion, and/or as a critique of social and moral values dominates our investigation. It also serves as a model to investigate the role of contemporary electronic and print media and their influence on our perceptions of society and the representation of power in the global world.

Through the study of novels and autobiographies by Breton, Hemingway, Stein, Duras, Modiano, de Beauvoir, and Baldwin, we will ask, what is the role of place in the imagining or invention of the self? How does the experience of a specific city, Paris, influence the formation of identity? How do these authors represent, or subvert, the notion of the \u2018real\u2019? Although the focus of this course is literary, we will also engage with major political, cultural, and artistic movements of the period, exploring the ways in which our writers negotiate history through their writings.

Turn a corner and in the distance you'll see the Arc de Triomphe built to the glory of Napoleon's army or the Eiffel tower erected for the centennial of the fall of the Bastille. Even the metro stops, Concorde, Nation, R\u00e9publique, Austerlitz, I\u00e9na, echo with the memory of the years of the French Revolution and the First Empire.  But what historic reality does all this evoke? What led some French people to overthrow their age old Monarchy, turn their backs on the Church and launch into a new era of Republican government? What caused others to resist such changes with all their might? And why did the experiment end within 10 years, giving way to military dictatorship and an Empire which spread French rule across Europe.

Beginning with the epistemological and metaphysical debates that followed the rediscovery of Ancient philosophy and the Copernican revolution in the sciences, we will consider Montaigne\u2019s skepticism, Descartes\u2019 attempts at securing our knowledge of the soul, God, and the external world, and Condillac\u2019s empiricist critique of Descartes\u2019 theory of knowledge. We will then focus on major developments in French political philosophy in the 18th and 19th centuries, closely intertwined with political events in France at the time, including such figures as Rousseau, Proudhon, and Tocqueville. Finally, we will look at two of the major movements in French philosophy in the first half of the 20th century: Henri Bergson\u2019s attempts to understand the temporal duration conscious beings inhabit, and Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir\u2019s distinctive development of existentialism, a philosophy that grapples with the radical consequences of human freedom.

Conducted in French.                                                                          Paris through its Museums and Monuments -\u00a0ARTH-UA 9665 - 4 points                               NYU Art History students: This course counts for Art History elective credit.   Paris of the 19th and early 20th centuries developed into a major urban center, in part because of the promise of liberty that drew people there following the upheavals of the Revolution. The urban renewal that occurred under the Second Empire in the mid-19th century in particular transformed the capital into a modern city of innovation and spectacle. While the official arts reflected the tastes and priorities of successive governments and the emergent bourgeoisie, it was the avant-garde that most marked the city as a site of resistance and daring. In this course we study these different art movements as they relate to the city of Paris, studying the sites, movements, and transformations that helped shape the modern arts. Conducted in French.   Sample Syllabus                                                                    The Birth of Democracy in Europe - FREN-UA 9091 or HIST-UA 9091 or POL-UA 9591 - 4 points                               We begin with a definition of the term &quot;democracy&quot; as developed by the Athenian City-State in the 5th century before Christ, before moving on to discuss its reappraisal by such theoreticians of the 17th century as Locke, or of the Enlightenment, such as Montesquieu and Rousseau. Their versions, indeed, serve as the basis for the French Revolution of 1789. A long and difficult process, democracy needed nearly a century before establishing itself in France. Drawing on numerous examples from 19th and 20th century history, we will try to understand why the great contributions of democracy, such as universal suffrage and the concept of individual liberty, were so difficult to put into operation. We will also consider why these &quot;givens&quot; are still fragile. Conducted in French.   Sample Syllabus                                                                    Readings in French Literature II: The Modern Era -\u00a0FREN-UA 9121 - 4 points                               In this course students read masterpieces of French literature from the French Revolution to the end of the twentieth century. Works are considered from various historical, aesthetic and theoretical perspectives. Texts include: Le P\u00e8re Goriot (Balzac); Madame Bovary (Flaubert); Les Faux-Monnayeurs (Gide); La Naus\u00e9e (Sartre); Le Ravissement de Lol V. Stein (Duras), and Du c\u00f4t\u00e9 de chez Swan I (Proust), which will be the subject of a final essay. Conducted in French.

The first half of the course focuses on the political, socio-economic, and cultural history of France in the modern period, from roughly 1870 to the 1980. The second half of the course looks more closely at the contemporary period, focusing on the various \u2018crises\u2019 and transitions that have marked France during the past 20 years. Topics include the challenges of the post-colonial period (immigration, la francophonie, questions of identity), France in and of the European Union, France and globalization, and social issues in current events (the status of women, la banlieue, social exclusion). Conducted in French.

The course will offer insights and analyses on the different roles which are played by France and the United States on the issues of youth, women, and Modern Islam in the Arab World and on how their soft power is perceived by the Arab countries and their populations. By addressing the foreign policies that have been articulated in the region, we will also bring into light the dichotomy between the \u201cold\u201d and the \u201cnew\u201d diplomacy.                                                                        Existentialism and the Absurd - FREN-UA 9767 - 4 points                               This course explores the main expressions of existential thought in the works of Jean-Paul Sartre, Simone de Beauvoir, and Albert Camus, as well as absurdist literature from the 1950s. In particular, we consider the French existentialists\u2019 concern for commitment in political and social affairs, and how this is reflected in \u201ctheatre of the absurd,\u201d in fiction, and in critical work of other contemporary French writers. Covers Ionesco, Beckett, Genet, Robbe-Grillet, and Barthes; precursors of the absurd such as Kafka and C\u00e9line; some consideration may be given in addition to practitioners of the absurd outside of France. Conducted in French.                                                                      Paris, City of Theater - FREN-UA 9968 - 4 points                               Since the 17th century Paris has been as a city of and for the theatre, from the great sites and  events that have marked theatre history, to the spectacle and fantasy that the city imparts.  In this course, we study the great works of French theatre, from the classics to the very  contemporary, through readings, performances, and visits in and around Paris to the lieux  de m\u00e9moire of the theatre world. Through the study of works by Corneille, Moli\u00e8re, Hugo,  Feydeau, Ionesco, Beckett, Sartre, and others, we consider how Paris has been integral to and  shaped by the world of French theatre. Visits include such prestigious venues as the Com\u00e9die  Fran\u00e7aise, the grands boulevards where Parisians discovered Shakespeare in the age of Sarah  Bernhardt, the remains of the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Marais where Corneille performed his plays, or  Versailles where Moli\u00e8re helped lead the grand spectacle that was life under Louis XIV.

In this course, we consider the aesthetic and political choices faced by African filmmakers working in the post-Independence period. Questions concerning tradition and modernity, the search for a collective and/or national identity, emigration, exile and return, history and memory, will frame our approach. Conducted in French.                                                                      Gender &amp; Sexuality in France - FREN-UA 9965 - 4 points                               An introduction to the problems of gender as they have been expressed in France. Beginning with an historical overview, we consider the category of \u2018woman\u2019 as it was defined from the Revolution to the founding of French feminism at the end of the 19th century. The second part of the course is devoted to an exploration of gender as a political issue during the past 20 years, through consideration of such topics as parit\u00e9, prostitution, colonialism, post-colonialism, and queer studies. Conducted in French.

In this course we explore the contemporary arts in France in their historic and social context. Beginning with current trends, we attempt to situate what\u2019s new within a longer tradition of artistic production. Themes studied include the nature of the object, the monochrome, the body, the idea of nature, personal mythologies, the importance of light. The course includes visits to contemporary galleries and museums. Conducted in French.                                                                    Between Fiction and Reality: New York and Paris - SOC-UA 9461 or SCA-UA 9624 - 4 points                                As major metropolises, Paris and New York are deeply engaged in processes of globalization: each has to stay competitive, to accumulate wealth, to hold on to its inhabitants as well as to attract tourists, business professionals, students, and immigrants. Each dreams of one day becoming a \u201cgreen\u201d city. Danger also exists in both of these cities, amplified by rumor and fantasy. In this course we will study these phenomena through the analysis of novels, films, television series, artwork, and architecture, to ask how various representations of the city have changed and been managed over time, by diverse social actors and observers.

Prerequisite: Written Contemporary French or permission of the NYU Paris staff.   NYU Paris students with advanced French language skills may attend one to two lecture courses in French at the prestigious Institut d\u2019Etudes Politiques de Paris, more commonly known as Sciences Po. Students wishing to enroll at Sciences Po in Fall 2015 must first submit the following application form to NYU Paris by April 10th, 2015 indicating their year, major, French level (current or most recently completed French language course), and GPA. We will provide deadlines for future semesters at a later date. Students will also be asked to send a short personal statement (1-2 paragraphs) stating their motivations for studying at Sciences Po as part of their application. Upon successful review of their applications, students will be invited to apply to Sciences Po in late April or early May. Application materials for Sciences Po include a transcript, CV, and statement of purpose. Please note that NYU Paris students are not necessarily guaranteed a spot at Sciences Po, so it is in students' best interest to submit a strong application.   Once students are admitted to Sciences Po, they will be able to select their courses over the summer using the Sciences Po online student portal. NYU Paris strongly encourages students admitted to Sciences Po to take only courses in French, and to take no more than 2 courses during the semester (subject to approval). It is expected that most students will take only one course per semester at Sciences Po. In exceptional cases, students may take a course in English upon approval by NYU Paris.

Lectures on still life painting and polychrome wood sculpture are also included. The 18th century (the Tiepolo family, Mel\u00e9ndez) is then discussed. The focus then shifts to the art of Francisco de Goya and the projection of Spanish art into the modern era. This course also seeks to define Spain in the 16th and 17th century as a global power and thus emphasis is also placed on art in such New World centers as Mexico City and Lima in the colonial era.

Not a traditional survey, this course opens with a brief consideration of the achievements of the great pre-Hispanic civilizations (Aztec, Maya, Inca, and others) prior to contact with the Iberian world. Major emphasis is given to colonial painting, sculpture, and architecture in Mexico and Central America, the Caribbean, and the Andes. Painting and sculpture of the 19th century and the secularization of Latin American art is then examined before a discussion of the establishment of modernism that comes about with the formation of academies and the travels of many artists from all parts of Latin America and the Caribbean to Europe and the U.S. from 1900 onward. Important modern artists such as the Mexican muralists, Frida Kahlo, Joaqu\u00edn Torres-Garc\u00eda, Tarsila do Amaral, Wifredo Lam, and the surrealists will bring the course up to approximately 1950.

Focusing on the creation of modern building types such as the bank, state capitol, museum, railroad station, and skyscraper, the course begins in the later 18th century with the idealistic designs of Ledoux and Boull\u00e9e. After considering the forms and meanings associated with neoclassicism, the course examines the Gothic revival and subsequent 19th-century movements (e.g., high Victorian Gothic, Second Empire, beaux-arts classicism) as efforts to find appropriate expressions for diverse building forms. Students consider changes resulting from the Industrial Revolution, including developments in technology, and the reforms of art nouveau and secession architecture. Works of Adam, Soane, Jefferson, Schinkel, Pugin, Richardson, and Sullivan; McKim, Mead, and White; Mackintosh, early Frank Lloyd Wright, and others.    Modern Architecture: 1914 to the Present    ARTH-UA 409 Prerequisite: History of Western Art II (ARTH-UA 2), or Modern Art (ARTH-UA 6), or Early Modern Architecture: 1776-1914 (ARTH-UA 408), or History of Architecture from Antiquity to the Present (ARTH-UA 601), or Expressive Culture: Architecture in New York Field Study (MAP-UA 722), or a score of 5 on the AP Art History exam.

Neoclassicism to Realism    ARTH-UA 411 Prerequisite: History of Western Art II (ARTH-UA 2), or Modern Art (ARTH-UA 6), or a score of 5 on the AP Art History exam. Offered every year. 4 points.   The Enlightenment shaped the visual arts in two seemingly antithetical ways. On the one hand, the period's valorization of cool rationalism contributed to the rise of neoclassicism as a dominant style during the 18th century. The other course of Enlightenment thinking, exemplified by the writings of J. J. Rousseau, celebrated emotion as the purest form of intellectual as well as spiritual expression. Romanticism, with its emphasis on subjectivity and intense emotionalism, is as much a product of the Enlightenment as neoclassicism. Following on the heels of romanticism, realism has been alternately described as a rejection of romanticism and as an extension of it. Focusing on these three stylistic movements, this course examines how late 18th- and early 19th-century artists negotiated not just the aesthetic ideas of the Enlightenment but its political consequences as well.    Impressionism to Expressionism    ARTH-UA 412 Prerequisite: History of Western Art II (ARTH-UA 2), or Modern Art (ARTH-UA 6), or a score of 5 on the AP Art History exam. Offered every year. 4 points.   Beginning by considering how impressionism refined and redirected the artistic aims of 19th-century realism, this course follows the development of progressive art to the brink of cubism and pure abstraction in the first years of the 20th century. Following impressionism and post-impressionism, close attention is paid to symbolism, aestheticism, art nouveau, the Arts and Crafts movement, fauvism, and expressionism. The aesthetic aims of these movements are analyzed in tandem with the social and cultural conditions that generated them.    Cubism to Abstract Expressionism    ARTH-UA 413 Prerequisite: History of Western Art II (ARTH-UA 2), or Modern Art (ARTH-UA 6), or a score of 5 on the AP Art History exam. Offered every year. 4 points.   After analyzing the invention of cubism by Picasso and Braque, this course examines its international reverberations, including Italian futurism, the later phases of German expressionism, the de Stijl movement in the Netherlands, and suprematism and constructivism in revolutionary Russia. The dada movement in the period during and after World War I is examined as a reaction to the apparent bankruptcy, cultural and artistic, of Western civilization. However, this nihilistic impulse is followed by a \"return to order\" in the 1920s. The course then examines the tensions in the multiple currents of surrealism: metamorphic, academic, and abject. Painting after World War II, from Pollock to Dubuffet, is analyzed as an extension and transformation of prewar trends.    Postmodern Art and Contemporary Art    ARTH-UA 414 Prerequisite: History of Western Art II (ARTH-UA 2), or Modern Art (ARTH-UA 6), or a score of 5 on the AP Art History exam. Offered every year. 4 points.   Surveys art in the postmodern era, ca. 1955 to the present. After examining the innovations of the neo-avant-garde generation (1955\u201375), our focus shifts from the radical innovations in mediums, materials, and techniques to the expanded field of critical engagement that contemporary art encompasses. Discrete \"early\" developments sometimes dubbed neo-dada, such as op, pop, and fluxus, but also minimalism, conceptual art, and arte povera, radically diversified the look of art and forced the dissolution of stylistic and formal categorization in favor of a classification based on a particular question, mediatic intervention, or mode of critique. If the late 20th century brought a new emphasis on gender, race, and a number of newly pressing political forces and motivations, as we enter the 21st century, post-studio (and perhaps also \"post-critical\") artistic practices increasingly tend to be reoriented toward technology and globalism, further complicating our idea of art's relationship with its own present.    Aesthetic History of Photography    ARTH-UA 431 Identical to PHTI-UT 1102. Prerequisite: History of Western Art II (ARTH-UA 2), or Modern Art (ARTH-UA 6), or a score of 5 on the AP Art History exam.

Chronicles the history of photography's complex and symbiotic relationship to the other visual arts: painting, sculpture, architecture, installation, and performance, among others. Beginning with the medium's invention and the early fights of its practitioners to establish themselves as fine artists, the course describes photographers' unique attempts to negotiate their relationships with both artistic movements and the media culture of which they are a part. Robinson, Cameron, Emerson, F. Holland Day, Stieglitz, Moholy-Nagy, Rodchenko, Weston, \u00c1lvarez Bravo, Lartigue, De Carava, Cahun, Robert Frank, Diane Arbus, and Cindy Sherman (among others) are seen within the context of their respective art worlds, so the impact of art movements, cultural attitudes, and new technologies on photographers during different historical periods can be assessed.

An introductory survey of the arts in China, Japan, and Korea from approximately 1000 C.E. The course emphasizes an overall understanding of the development of art and culture, as well as mastery of specific works of art. East Asian Art I followed the development of the common cultural heritage of the Northeast Asia region. Part of this commonality is due to the extraordinary influence of an early-developing Chinese civilization on Japan and Korea. However, Japan and Korea also developed their own cultures and arts, developments that accelerated in the last millennia up to the present. Topics include Song landscape paintings, Edo \"floating world\" prints, Koryo celadons, and modern art.    South Asian Art I: Indus Valley to 1200    ARTH-UA 530 Offered periodically. 4 points.   An introductory survey of the history of South Asia from 2000 B.C.E. to 1200 C.E., with an emphasis on the Indian subcontinent. From the Indus Valley culture to the present day, artistic production has played a critical role in the transmission of religious beliefs and the development of cultural systems in and around South Asia. Diverse regions were linked by trade, politics, and cultural relationships, and interaction can be charted through the changing forms and functions of art. We consider the historical circumstances surrounding the production of South and Southeast Asian art, as well as the problems that art historians face when trying to interpret the surviving evidence. We look at art in a variety of media, including, but not limited to, architecture, urban form, sculpture, painting, and performance.

It follows the cultivation of new tastes in the Mughal and Rajput courts through the vigorous interaction among Persian, Indic, and European artists and elites. Finally, it turns to the colonial and postcolonial artistic responses to South Asia's complex past(s). By looking at art in a range of media\u2014including, but not limited to, painting, sculpture, architecture, and photography\u2014this course considers the ways in which art actively served as expressions of political authority and cultural identity.    Art in the Islamic World I: From the Prophet to the Mongols    ARTH-UA 540 Offered periodically. 4 points.

The period saw the initial formation of an Arab empire stretching from the Atlantic Ocean to the Indian Ocean, a decline in centralized authority, and the rise to political prominence of various North African, Iranian, and Central Asian dynasties from the 10th century onward. These political developments are reflected in the increasingly heterogeneous nature of Islamic material culture over this time span.    Art in the Islamic World II: From the Mongols to Modernism    ARTH-UA 541 Offered periodically. 4 points.   An introduction to the arts of Islam during a period of dynamic cultural and political change in the Islamic world.
