Civil resistance is not the same as opting out of society or having views that go against the grain. It is fundamentally about deciding not to conform with repressive regimes. It is also about choosing a mode of action that brings with it personal dangers even when, as is usual, it advocates non-violence. This course examines the nature and significance of civil resistance in Central and Eastern Europe in the 20th century. In studying resistance literature (including poetry and song), art and film, we will draw on ideas and arguments from the disciplines of history, political science, literature, art criticism, film studies and psychology.

It explores the tension and connection between creativity, independent thought, and building organizations and movements     In May, 2006 the internationally recognized writers, social commentators and activists Arundhati Roy ( India ) and Eduardo Galeano( Uruguay ) engaged in a public dialogue on art and activism at New York City \u2019s Town Hall. During the conversation Ms. Roy described the challenge of being a creative and independent thinker while working within the confines of mass organizations and movements which are often, by definition, if radical ideologically, conservative structurally by virtue of the need to find broad consensus and common ground as a basis for work. She said something to the effect that she often thinks she would be the first one to be kicked out of the group if they had a victory! There is built in tension between the process of creativity, making art, independent and daring thought; and that of creating structures within which numbers of people and organizations can unify across broad differences and work systematically to achieve social reform. These forces, the organizational and the creative, must co exist for change to take place, and beyond that, one could argue that real change cannot take place without the marriage between these currents, skills and processes.     Assignments will include creative work and writing essays, culminating in a presentation of students\u2019 work at the end of the semester. We will explore the form of public conversation. Students will bring to class examples of \u201clyrical resistance\u201d from blues to hip hop to poetry, personal non fiction, political essays, folk songs, etc.          This course will count toward general education requirements for TSOA students (Humanities). Students must be of Sophomore and above class standing to be eligible to take Art and Public Policy courses.
