Over the last forty years, the Disc Jockey has become a central figure in global popular music, transforming the sound of music and redefining the role of the creative music entrepreneur. From the DJ\u2019s role in \u2018breaking tracks\u2019 on commercial radio and dance floors, to supplying sounds for film scores and various recordings, to being the focus of the latest gaming trend (e.g. DJ Hero), the impact of the DJ in popular culture is significant. Many of today\u2019s most successful producers, like Dr. Dre and Mark Ronson, came from DJ backgrounds or have cultivated DJ-ing as part of their repertoire of skills. Increasingly, DJing has become a viable way for aspiring entrepreneurs in music to diversify and create success for themselves. In this class, taught by famed DJs, producer, curator and Basement Bhangra founder DJ Rekha, and 2009 DMC World Champion, DJ Shiftee, students will develop fundamental turntable technique and hone practical skills that every DJ needs to succeed in the modern music industry. Each class will be divided into Culture and Technique sections. In the Culture component students will discuss the history, culture and business aspects of DJing through reading and other course materials. The Technique section will consist of hands-on technical lessons in the DJ practice using fully equipped DJ stations. The lab component, held at the Dubspot DJ and Production facilities on 14th Street, will focus on beat matching, music programming and turntablist elements (i.e. scratching).
