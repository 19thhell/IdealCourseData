Housed at the Department of Cinema Studies, TSOA at   NYU, the AFMI is envisioned to be a multifaceted hub for teaching,   research, public outreach, and transnational networking related to both   historical and contemporary formations of Asian film and media. We   conceive Asia to comprise all countries east of Bosphorus, yet the   Initiative will also engage various trans-Asian interactions that   include the Asian-Pacific region and the Asian diaspora.

AFMI serves as a platform for connecting NYU   faculty and students interested in Asian film and media. We have a   strong commitment to curriculum development. In response to increasing   interest and demand in courses related to film and media in Asia and its   diaspora in the global context, AFMI offers an undergraduate minor open   to NYU students including those at NYUAD and NYUSH. AFMI is   committed to fostering innovative research agendas that are connected to   the contemporary film and media culture formations including their   historical conditions.

As a whole, the Initiative   will contribute to the consolidation and expansion of the community of   NYU faculty and students interested in Asian film and media on the   Washington Square campus and extending to NYUSH and NUYAD, as well as   other global sites. The minor is designed to provide an   interdisciplinary and comparative focus on the historical and   contemporary media forms of Asia and the Asian diaspora, as well in   depth study or particular regions and topics. Student\u2019s will   investigate the aesthetics forms of popular and art cinemas, the   political economy of the film and media industry, audiences, mass   culture, media activism, and experimental audiovisual arts in a variety   of media and formats. The audiovisual forms that this curriculum will   encompass include film (originally made on celluloid), video, anime, TV,   radio, and digital media. The minor will prepare students for advanced   studies in cinema and media studies, Asian studies, media journalism,   cultural policy, and other related disciplines, as well as professional   and career development. The program\u2019s core faculty include   full-time tenured and tenure-track faculty from TSOA, Steinhardt, CAS,   and Gallatin. More will join as the program evolves and grows. This   minor will also create a more pronounced academic connection with the   evolving Global Network University framework, including NYUAD and the   opening of NYU Shanghai in fall 2013. As the Initiative\u2019s research and   teaching agenda and community expand, we hope to engage various   trans-Asian interactions that include the Asian-Pacific region as well   as the Middle East in the future within the broad and mobile GNU   context. *International Visitor Program Each semester   or year, AFMI will host or sponsor 2-3 visiting fellows, either   academics, media practitioners and other professionals for short-term   stay during which they will give talks, screening works, organizing   workshops or offer a short-term intensive seminar. AFMI also welcomes   visitors who come with fellowships provided by their home institutions   or outside grants. It is hoped that these individuals will bring   cutting-edge knowledge and innovative methods in Asian film and media   studies, curating, archiving and preservation. *Events 2012-2013 Yousef Saeed, Screening of Khayal Darpan (A Mirror of Imagination, 2007), Sept. 25.

Asian Film and Media BA minor  In response to increasing interest and demand in courses related to film and media in Asia and its diaspora, the new minor allows students to focus on and pursue in depth studies of both historical and contemporary formations of Asian film and media. The current BA in Cinema Studies introduces students to the history, theory, and aesthetics of film and the moving image. Though the existing curriculum is generally international in scope, there is no identifiable focus on the Asia-Pacific region and the Asian diaspora. The new program will complement the existing Cinema Studies BA major and minor. There is no other school or department that currently offers a comparable program. By consolidating faculty resources and relevant course offerings in TSOA and NYU as a whole, the new minor will attract students from other schools and departments to gain exposure to cinema and media studies through a focused study of Asia and its diaspora. Cinema Studies majors may elect to focus on this area of studies as an informal concentration. The program, an integral part of the Asian Film and Media Initiative involving teaching, learning, research and public outreach, will contribute to the consolidation and expansion of the community of NYU faculty and students interested in Asian film and media. The program faculty include full-time tenured and tenure-track faculty from TSOA, Steinhardt, and CAS, and more will join as the program evolves and grows. Course requirements, sequencing, credits Four courses including one introductory film course (Language of Film, Expressive Culture: Film or Intro to Film) and one core Asian Film and Media course are required, 16 credits in total. The introductory film course is the prerequisite to all other courses. The core course should be taken the first year the minor is declared. Sample courses Asian Film History and Historiography (core); Asian Media and Popular Culture (core); Indian Cinemas; Korean Cinema; Asian-American Cinema; Chinese Cinemas Japanese Anime and New Media; South Asian Media Cultures.

By consolidating faculty resources and relevant course offerings in TSOA and NYU as a whole, the new minor will attract students from other schools and departments to gain exposure to cinema and media studies through a focused study of Asia and its diaspora. Cinema Studies majors may elect to focus on this area of studies as an informal concentration. The program, an integral part of the Asian Film and Media Initiative involving teaching, learning, research and public outreach, will contribute to the consolidation and expansion of the community of NYU faculty and students interested in Asian film and media. The program faculty include full-time tenured and tenure-track faculty from TSOA, Steinhardt, and CAS, and more will join as the program evolves and grows. Course requirements, sequencing, credits Four courses including one introductory film course (Language of Film, Expressive Culture: Film or Intro to Film) and one core Asian Film and Media course are required, 16 credits in total.
