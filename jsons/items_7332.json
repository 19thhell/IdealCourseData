Professors with niche areas of expertise, in different locations, couple to teach courses that are unique and interdisciplinary. NYU as a global network university (GNU) creates a call to action for global courses that are meaningful, interesting and multi-layered.   One of the current global courses is a joint class in New York, Shanghai, London and Abu Dhabi called Where The City Meets The Sea. The course uses technology to join together groups in  multiple locations into one simultaneous class. The curriculum combines publicly available geographic information system (GIS) data with student-collected data to examine how humans affect coastlines. Students benefit from the expertise of multiple instructors as well as a virtual amalgam of place. In addition to studying their own coastline, students compare their city with coastal cities around the world. Thanks to technology, students can participate in a paired course that feels like one class with the added benefit of multiple data layers and academic leaders.   Meeting the Need   Mary Killilea and John Burt, the course instructors, have responded to the GNU charge. From New York, Mary brings to the table an emphasis in GIS systems. She also teaches classes in biology and environmental studies and has done research in New York State for fifteen years, focusing on the environment. From Abu Dhabi, John contributes a history of research on climate change, coral reefs, coastal development and marine ecosystems. Their combined expertise allows them to lead students in a distinctive, cross-disciplinary course.   Through the class, students are observing similarities in New York, Shanghai, London and Abu Dhabi. What\u2019s happening in real time to the coastlines of Abu Dhabi can be compared to the historical data of New York City. In this manner, students use another city to better understand their own. The GIS technology focuses on relationships between different locations through space and time. With the technology, students find new ways of understanding, correlating, and presenting information. These skills are incredibly pertinent in the fields of ecology and environmental science, a boon for our students entering the job market after school.     Making It Work   Students use tablets to collect data on air quality, water quality and other biological collections in the field. NYU modified and customized the open-source software Open Data Kit to meet the needs of the class. This iteration of the software allows students to collect data onto tablets and deliver it in a form consumable by the leading GIS software.   GIS, as a data management system, is focused on spatial data and computer mapping. It allows us to not just store the data, but to do complex analysis of relationships between environments and social or economic systems in a spatial way. We can then visualize data in a fashion that elicits dramatic responses. The class uses a series of learning tools, which use spatial data that has been made available through public resources, private individuals, and government agencies. Students use this data to analyze issues related to coastal, urban interactions and as a baseline for developing their own data in GIS.   As you can imagine, this course could not have existed without the combined efforts of many people, including IT, library professionals, GIS specialists, scientists and students. With an eye toward the future, this course is currently spans three coastal cities, but will eventually expand to other coastal cities as well. And beyond cities and seas, because of the nature of the technology, these data layers could be used for other classes and disciplines. With each new data set, we add a layer to how we understand and conceptualize the world.

With sea level rise, storms and extreme rainfall events projected to become more frequent and intense, vulnerability to flooding is increasing in neighborhoods both on the waterfront and inland. Cities are responding to these heightened threats with an array of new design guidelines and engineering solutions for building smarter, stronger and/or higher infrastructure and protection systems. Yet, these efforts to adapt or \u201cclimate-proof\u201d tend to focus only on the short-term physical risks and solutions. Little consideration is given to the social vulnerability and resiliency of a city by policy and decision makers. This capstone will highlight the deep relationship between the social and physical city in the context of climate hazard resiliency. Students will work to determine the role social infrastructure - cultural and community-driven components, such as, community organizations, neighborhood identity and cohesion, informal networks, collective imaginary, risk perception, or access to resources - plays in determining a city\u2019s capacity to respond extreme weather disasters. Using New York City and the disastrous events of Hurricane Sandy as the primary case study, students will: \u2022 Design a typology analysis on the built/social environments to classify different urban polices/social characteristics \u2022 Determine how these attributes influence a community's capacity to cope with a natural disaster \u2022 Conduct site visits to map and carry out site analysis on strategic locations where both climate disasters and protection  interventions are re-shaping the built environment \u2022 Design and carry out original surveys to reach out to residents in affected neighborhoods to measure the shifting  influences that the physical environment, risk perceptions, community organizations and/or informal networks have on  coping capacity Themes and questions to be discussed: \u2022 How are flood hazards and disaster probabilities, including those associated with climate change, measured and mapped  by different tiers of government (FEMA, State, and City)? \u2022 What is the relationship between risk mapping and urban planning policies and development practices? \u2022 How can the seemingly subtle and incremental risks of climate change be communicated with the urgency and scale that  encourages public engagement and action? \u2022 How can public education about risk reduction and adaptation impact different communities and neighborhoods,  vulnerability and increasing a community\u2019s capacity to recover?

What\u2019s happening in real time to the coastlines of Abu Dhabi can be compared to the historical data of New York City. In this manner, students use another city to better understand their own. The GIS technology focuses on relationships between different locations through space and time. With the technology, students find new ways of understanding, correlating, and presenting information. These skills are incredibly pertinent in the fields of ecology and environmental science, a boon for our students entering the job market after school.     Making It Work   Students use tablets to collect data on air quality, water quality and other biological collections in the field. NYU modified and customized the open-source software Open Data Kit to meet the needs of the class. This iteration of the software allows students to collect data onto tablets and deliver it in a form consumable by the leading GIS software.   GIS, as a data management system, is focused on spatial data and computer mapping. It allows us to not just store the data, but to do complex analysis of relationships between environments and social or economic systems in a spatial way. We can then visualize data in a fashion that elicits dramatic responses. The class uses a series of learning tools, which use spatial data that has been made available through public resources, private individuals, and government agencies. Students use this data to analyze issues related to coastal, urban interactions and as a baseline for developing their own data in GIS.   As you can imagine, this course could not have existed without the combined efforts of many people, including IT, library professionals, GIS specialists, scientists and students. With an eye toward the future, this course is currently spans three coastal cities, but will eventually expand to other coastal cities as well. And beyond cities and seas, because of the nature of the technology, these data layers could be used for other classes and disciplines. With each new data set, we add a layer to how we understand and conceptualize the world.

With sea level rise, storms and extreme rainfall events projected to become more frequent and intense, vulnerability to flooding is increasing in neighborhoods both on the waterfront and inland. Cities are responding to these heightened threats with an array of new design guidelines and engineering solutions for building smarter, stronger and/or higher infrastructure and protection systems. Yet, these efforts to adapt or \u201cclimate-proof\u201d tend to focus only on the short-term physical risks and solutions. Little consideration is given to the social vulnerability and resiliency of a city by policy and decision makers. This capstone will highlight the deep relationship between the social and physical city in the context of climate hazard resiliency. Students will work to determine the role social infrastructure - cultural and community-driven components, such as, community organizations, neighborhood identity and cohesion, informal networks, collective imaginary, risk perception, or access to resources - plays in determining a city\u2019s capacity to respond extreme weather disasters.

Yet, these efforts to adapt or \u201cclimate-proof\u201d tend to focus only on the short-term1 physical risks and solutions. Little consideration is given to the social vulnerability and resiliency of a city by policy and decision makers. The purpose of this capstone project is to highlight the deep relationship between the social and physical city in the context of climate hazard resiliency. It aims to determine the role social infrastructure - cultural and community-driven components, such as, community organizations, neighborhood identity and cohesion, informal networks, collective imaginary, risk perception, or access to resources - plays in determining a city\u2019s capacity to respond extreme weather disasters. It draws on a variety of disciplines, including urban planning and design, sociology, public policy and environmental and climate science studies and builds off of a growing body of work that point to the need for both social connections and physical resources for communities to survive and thrive in the context of uncertain environmental conditions today and in the future. The objective of the capstone project is to develop a set of tools and frameworks that help measure, visualize and evaluate the social infrastructure of a city to help policy makers better identify, prioritize and support social resiliency measures. Using New York City and disastrous events of Hurricane Sandy (2012) as the primary case study, students will be asked to: \u2022 Design a typology analysis on the built environment to classify different urban polices, such as affordable housing, access to different modes of transportation, mixed commercial and residential land use designation and determine their influence (support or hinder) a community\u2019s capacity to cope to a natural disaster \u2022 Design a typology analysis on the social environment to classify different social characteristics, such as mixed income integration, informal networks, street life and activity, and determine their influence (support or hinder) a community\u2019s capacity to cope to a natural disaster \u2022 Conduct site visits to map and carry out site analysis on strategic locations where both climate disasters and protection interventions are re-shaping the built, natural landscape, and social environment \u2022 Design and carry out original surveys to reach out to residents in affected neighborhoods to measure the influence shifts to the physical environment, risk perceptions, community organizations and/or informal networks etc. have on coping capacity \u2022  Develop an evaluation framework for measuring and assessing social networks and cohesion \u2022 Conduct a literature review on survey methodology, evaluation frameworks, and the foundational principles of the course Potential themes and questions to be discussed: \u2022 How are flood hazards and disaster probabilities, including those associated with climate change, measured and mapped by different tiers of government (FEMA, State, and City)? How do they influence minimum building standards, land use, and development of different types of infrastructure? How are these maps understood and used by communities? What is the relationship between risk mapping and urban planning policies and development practices? \u2022 How do the increasing number of extreme weather and the ensuing large-scale devastation on communities fit into society\u2019s collective imaginary and understanding of \u201cnatural disasters\u201d? Are they considered interruption or exception to the norm? Or a part of a larger continuum that has come about from decades of social process, public policy, and urban development decisions? \u2022 How can the seemingly subtle and incremental risks of climate change be communicated with the urgency and scale that encourages public engagement and action? How can social processes and public policy decisions that determine settlement and development patters contribute to disasters the impact of natural disasters? (Gilbert White quote: \u201cFloods are an act of God, but flood loss are largely an act of man\u201d) \u2022 What are the political, regulatory, and bureaucratic cycles and incentives/disincentives for promoting enacting rigorous risk reduction interventions and policies? How can public education about risk reduction and adaptation impact different communities and neighborhoods, vulnerability and increasing a community\u2019s capacity to recover?
