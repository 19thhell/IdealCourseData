Joe Ippolito, Gender Reel Founder &amp; Executive Chair: genderreelfest@gmail.com  Chris Straayer, NYU Cinema Studies Professor &amp; Festival Co-Chair: acs1@nyu.edu The Department of Cinema Studies at New York University\u2019s Tisch School of the Arts welcomes Gender Reel for a two-day transgender film &amp; performance art festival on February 7-8, 2015. The festival will feature film/video/new media screenings, interactive discussions, and an evening of performance art. In addition, \u201c Show It Off \u201d will offer an impromptu opportunity for young media artists to preview and receive feedback on their work (see sidebar for submission guidelines). Film Screening sessions will address a variety of topics such as trans justice, alliance building, personal journeys, dating, youth and family, health, loveliness, and empowerment. \u201cOur department values independent filmmaking and looks forward to a wide-ranging trans-philic audience that includes university and community voices for the study and celebration of transgender art and activism,\u201d says Cinema Studies Professor Chris Straayer. Gender Reel , an annual coast-to-coast festival, was started in 2010 by a group of Philadelphia-based transgender activists in response to the lack of trans and gender non-conforming visibility at more mainstream festivals. Since then, the project has expanded in various ways to accommodate the needs of an ever-evolving group of people interested in learning about and seeing images of gender non-conforming and trans people on film and stage. To date, Gender Reel has established festival sites in Philadelphia, PA, Oakland, CA, Long Beach, CA, Portland, OR, Minneapolis, MN, Omaha, NE, and Durham, NC, as well as the University of Wisconsin-Parkside and New York University. The festival has also held mini film festivals at the Philadelphia Trans Health Conference and the Minnesota Trans Health Conference. Gender Reel is committed to three primary goals: a) empowering performance artists and filmmakers to create work that is reflective of a diversity of gender non-conforming and trans experiences, b) enhancing awareness and education about the lives and stories of gender non-conforming and trans people, and c) providing a safe, supportive space where all people, trans and non-trans alike, feel welcome. In 2015, Gender Reel celebrates its fifth anniversary with Gender Reel NYU as the kick off event. \"One of our objectives is to bring some of the films submitted to our annual festival to colleges and universities across the United States, \" says Gender Reel Founder and Executive Chair, Joe Ippolito. \u201c Gender Reel NYU is an exciting way to bring together one of the country\u2019s finest art schools and one of the country\u2019s most vibrant trans communities.\u201d If you are interested in being a co-sponsor of Gender Reel NYU, please contact Chris Straayer or Joe Ippolito at the above email addresses.
