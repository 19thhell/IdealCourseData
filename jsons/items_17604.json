Prerequisites: CS-UY 2134 and MA-UY 2034 3.00 Credits Human Computer Interaction CS-UY 4543 Designing a successful interactive experience or software system takes more than technical savvy and vision--it also requires a deep understanding of how to serve people&#039;s needs and desires through the experience of the system, and knowledge about how to weave this understanding into the development process. This course introduces key topics and methods for creating and evaluating human-computer interfaces/digital user experiences. Students apply these practices to a system of their choosing (I encourage application to prototype systems that students are currently working on in other contexts, at any stage of development). The course builds toward a final write-up and presentation in which students detail how they tackled HCI/user experience design and evaluation of their system, and results from their investigations. Some experience creating/participating in the production of interactive experiences/software is recommended. 3.00 Credits Game Design CS-UY 4553 This course is about experimental game design. Design in this context pertains to every aspect of the game, and these can be broadly characterized as the game system, control, visuals, audio, and resulting theme. We will explore these aspects through the creation of a few very focused game prototypes using a variety of contemporary game engines and frameworks, high-level programming languages, and physical materials. This will allow us to obtain a better understanding of what makes games appealing, and how game mechanics, systems, and a variety of player experiences can be designed and iteratively improved by means of rapid prototyping and play-testing. The course combines the technology, design, and philosophy in support of game creation, as well as the real-world implementation and design challenges faced by practicing game designers. Students will learn design guidelines and principles by which games can be conceived, prototyped, and fully developed within a one-semester course, and will create a game from start to finish. The course is a lot of (team)work, but it\u2019s also a lot of fun. Programming skills are helpful, but not a hard requirement. Artistic skills, or a willingness to learn them are a plus. Prerequisites: CS-UY 3113, CS-UY 4533, or CS-UY 4613 (C- or better) for CS students; OART-UT 1600 and OART-UT 1605 for Game Center MFA students.

And, how do we go about creating a machine (or computer) with those properties? To this end, researchers in the AI field have been trying to understand how seeing, learning, remembering, and reasoning could, or should be done. This course introduces students to the many concepts and techniques in artificial intelligence. Prerequisite: CS-UY 2134 3.00 Credits Information Systems Security Engineering and Management CS-UY 4763 The primary goal of this course is to present a system and management view of information security: what it is, what drives the requirements for information security, how to integrate it into the systems design process, and life cycle security management of information systems. This course will not be about the technologies of information security, but how those technologies are integrated into a system and managed. Corequisite: CS-UY 3933 3.00 Credits Penetration Testing and Vulnerability Analysis CS-UY 4773 The course will start off with an in-depth review of the exploitation mitigations introduced in modern operating systems. The instructors will demonstrate their limitations through simple examples and gradually develop the basic exploitation techniques into more complicated methods applicable to real-world exploitation. Unlike most other exploitation courses, we will focus on approaching exploitation as a creative problem-solving process rather than an exercise of applying cookbook techniques to common types of vulnerabilities. Most of the course will focus on the hands-on application of the material through exercises and leading the students through the development of reliable exploits for recently patched vulnerabilities in widely used software. Prerequisite: CS-UY 3933 3.00 Credits Applied Cryptography CS-UY 4783 This course examines Modern Cryptography from a both theoretical and applied perspective, with emphasis on \u201cprovable security\u201d and \u201capplication case studies\u201d. The course looks particularly at cryptographic primitives that are building blocks of various cryptographic applications. The course studies notions of security for a given cryptographic primitive, its various constructions and respective security analysis based on the security notion. The cryptographic primitives covered include pseudorandom functions, symmetric encryption (block ciphers), hash functions and random oracles, message authentication codes, asymmetric encryption, digital signatures and authenticated key exchange. The course covers how to build provably secure cryptographic protocols (e.g., secure message transmission, identification schemes, secure function evaluation, etc.), and various number-theoretic assumptions upon which cryptography is based. Also covered: implementation issues (e.g., key lengths, key management, standards, etc.) and, as application case studies, a number of real-life scenarios currently using solutions from modern cryptography. Prerequisite: CS-UY 1124 3.00 Credits Computer Networking CS-UY 4793 This course takes a top-down approach to computer networking.

Prerequisites: CS-UY 2134 and MA-UY 2034 3.00 Credits Human Computer Interaction CS-UY 4543 Designing a successful interactive experience or software system takes more than technical savvy and vision--it also requires a deep understanding of how to serve people&#039;s needs and desires through the experience of the system, and knowledge about how to weave this understanding into the development process. This course introduces key topics and methods for creating and evaluating human-computer interfaces/digital user experiences. Students apply these practices to a system of their choosing (I encourage application to prototype systems that students are currently working on in other contexts, at any stage of development). The course builds toward a final write-up and presentation in which students detail how they tackled HCI/user experience design and evaluation of their system, and results from their investigations. Some experience creating/participating in the production of interactive experiences/software is recommended. 3.00 Credits Game Design CS-UY 4553 This course is about experimental game design. Design in this context pertains to every aspect of the game, and these can be broadly characterized as the game system, control, visuals, audio, and resulting theme. We will explore these aspects through the creation of a few very focused game prototypes using a variety of contemporary game engines and frameworks, high-level programming languages, and physical materials. This will allow us to obtain a better understanding of what makes games appealing, and how game mechanics, systems, and a variety of player experiences can be designed and iteratively improved by means of rapid prototyping and play-testing. The course combines the technology, design, and philosophy in support of game creation, as well as the real-world implementation and design challenges faced by practicing game designers. Students will learn design guidelines and principles by which games can be conceived, prototyped, and fully developed within a one-semester course, and will create a game from start to finish. The course is a lot of (team)work, but it\u2019s also a lot of fun. Programming skills are helpful, but not a hard requirement. Artistic skills, or a willingness to learn them are a plus. Prerequisites: CS-UY 3113, CS-UY 4533, or CS-UY 4613 (C- or better) for CS students; OART-UT 1600 and OART-UT 1605 for Game Center MFA students. Instructor permission required otherwise. 3.00 Credits Artificial Intelligence CS-UY 4613 Artificial Intelligence (AI) is an important topic in computer science that has many diversified applications. It addresses one of the ultimate puzzles human are trying to solve \u2013 How is it possible for a slow, tiny brain, whether biological or electronic, to perceive, understand, predict, and manipulate a world far larger and more complicated than itself? And, how do we go about creating a machine (or computer) with those properties? To this end, researchers in the AI field have been trying to understand how seeing, learning, remembering, and reasoning could, or should be done. This course introduces students to the many concepts and techniques in artificial intelligence. Prerequisite: CS-UY 2134 3.00 Credits Information Systems Security Engineering and Management CS-UY 4763 The primary goal of this course is to present a system and management view of information security: what it is, what drives the requirements for information security, how to integrate it into the systems design process, and life cycle security management of information systems. This course will not be about the technologies of information security, but how those technologies are integrated into a system and managed. Corequisite: CS-UY 3933 3.00 Credits Penetration Testing and Vulnerability Analysis CS-UY 4773 The course will start off with an in-depth review of the exploitation mitigations introduced in modern operating systems. The instructors will demonstrate their limitations through simple examples and gradually develop the basic exploitation techniques into more complicated methods applicable to real-world exploitation. Unlike most other exploitation courses, we will focus on approaching exploitation as a creative problem-solving process rather than an exercise of applying cookbook techniques to common types of vulnerabilities. Most of the course will focus on the hands-on application of the material through exercises and leading the students through the development of reliable exploits for recently patched vulnerabilities in widely used software. Prerequisite: CS-UY 3933 3.00 Credits Applied Cryptography CS-UY 4783 This course examines Modern Cryptography from a both theoretical and applied perspective, with emphasis on \u201cprovable security\u201d and \u201capplication case studies\u201d. The course looks particularly at cryptographic primitives that are building blocks of various cryptographic applications. The course studies notions of security for a given cryptographic primitive, its various constructions and respective security analysis based on the security notion. The cryptographic primitives covered include pseudorandom functions, symmetric encryption (block ciphers), hash functions and random oracles, message authentication codes, asymmetric encryption, digital signatures and authenticated key exchange. The course covers how to build provably secure cryptographic protocols (e.g., secure message transmission, identification schemes, secure function evaluation, etc.), and various number-theoretic assumptions upon which cryptography is based. Also covered: implementation issues (e.g., key lengths, key management, standards, etc.) and, as application case studies, a number of real-life scenarios currently using solutions from modern cryptography. Prerequisite: CS-UY 1124 3.00 Credits Computer Networking CS-UY 4793 This course takes a top-down approach to computer networking. After an overview of computer networks and the Internet, the course covers the application layer, transport layer, network layer and link layers. Topics at the application layer include client-server architectures, P2P architectures, DNS and HTTP and Web applications. Topics at the transport layer include multiplexing, connectionless transport and UDP, principles or reliable data transfer, connection-oriented transport and TCP and TCP congestion control. Topics at the network layer include forwarding, router architecture, the IP protocol and routing protocols including OSPF and BGP. Topics at the link layer include multiple-access protocols, ALOHA, CSMA/CD, Ethernet, CSMA/CA, wireless 802.11 networks and link-layer switches. The course includes simple quantitative delay and throughput modeling, socket programming and network application development and Ethereal labs.

The company helps design their project according to their business needs. The team of 3 to 5 Masters students spends about a quarter to half of their time on the project. The team is jointly supervised by the company and a NYU Professor. A project will accomplish significant IT goals for a company, such as building useful software with advanced technology. NYU's Information Technology Projects course has completed 102 successful projects with 67 corporations and organizations in the last 12 years. The full list of projects goes all the way back to 1995.     Status   For information about current and future offerings, please see the related Computer Science Department Web pages at:    Information Technology Projects     Educational Goals   The Information Technology Projects course offers students a unique opportunity to apply their learnings about business technology and the entire software development lifecycle, from business needs to deployment. The ITP course amplifies classroom instruction about IT project planning and implementation.  The students are earning a Master of Science in Information Systems degree, which involves 13 courses split between Computer Science and the Stern School of Business. Courant and Stern are world-class educational institutions, highly ranked in evaluations. The course is also open to students earning a Master of Science in Computer Science ( http://www.cs.nyu.edu/web/Academic/Graduate/faqnewmscs.html ) and project teams are composed by pairing students working on either master degree.  The students are highly talented. They meet high admissions standards, for example GRE Quantitative and Analytical must both be above 85%, at least one above 92%. All of the students have at least a couple of years of work experience. The projects course is taken during one of their last 2 semesters, so they've already completed CS courses including algorithms, networking, and databases and business courses such as technology planning and managing organizations.     Results   Clients of NYU's Information Technology Projects course achieve significant benefits.  \u2022 High Quality Project Execution: Using a graduate student team allows companies to accomplish substantial results, with modest effort and a high degree of focus. If the company project is a software development effort, students will analyze the company\u2019s business needs and prototype code with extensive functionality. If the company project is a software purchase evaluation, students will produce a detailed evaluation of the company\u2019s needs, a comprehensive review of suitable commercial products and a recommendation indicating which solution offers the best value. Many other project types are available and can be customized to meet companies\u2019 needs. All intellectual property produced by the project becomes the property of the company.  \u2022 Close Evaluation of Potential Future Employees: Many students have been hired by clients upon graduation because of the excellent work performed during a semester project.   \u2022 Exposure to New Methods and New Research: Companies can explore new opportunities that their full-time staff does not have time to investigate. In addition, the outside perspective of the NYU team may facilitate exploration of delicate political situations which would create conflict if the company\u2019s full-time staff explored it.  \u2022 Direct Involvement of a NYU Professor: You receive hours of a NYU professor\u2019s guidance and advice, spread across the duration of the project.  \u2022 Public Relations and Corporate Community Involvement: Through public events like the semester end\u2019s Demo Showcase and various announcements posted by the NYU team running the projects, companies will be able to increase visibility at NYU for future hiring and corporate community relations.   \u2022 Chance to Give Back (Optional): Companies may build a relationship with Courant and NYU by contributing to a superb educational program. In this case, companies can feel good about investing in student learning and contributing to higher education. There is however no obligation to contribute monetarily on the part of the companies.    How to participate   Companies interested in being a \u201cclient\u201d should speak with the NYU Professor responsible for the ITP project course before the start of the Fall or Spring semester. Companies should begin the discussion by describing a problem they would like solved, and suggesting the approach they would consider for the solution. The ITP Professor will help structure a proposal for a successful project.  As an example, a software development project involves most of the software development lifecycle, including most of these steps:   \u2022 determining requirements,  \u2022 writing a specification,   \u2022 designing an architecture, and   \u2022 implementing a prototype  \u2022 etc.  The project would employ broadly available technology that the students find interesting and understand, such as databases, the Web, jsp, asp, Java, C++, XML, etc.  The ITP course favor 'experimental' projects, which are not on a company\u2019s 'critical path'. ITP students excel at investigating new technologies or methodologies. Other characteristics that increase the chance of a project's success include:  \u2022 well defined goals   \u2022 convenient interaction with a small number (5 or fewer) people in the participating  company   \u2022 a location near NYU, or availability via phone conferences with the company\u2019s responsible staff at least once a week   The ITP Professor will help scope a project with achievable goals.  A software purchase evaluation project can involve any kind of business need and many other project types qualify as part of this course to meet a company\u2019s needs.   A senior person in an organization with the appropriate authority must authorize a company\u2019s participation in a project. To participate in a project, the company must assign a 'project manager' who will provide weekly guidance to the students with respect to the company\u2019s objectives and help them obtain the resources they require. The 'project manager' should expect to spend no more than half a day a week on the project. Typically, they greatly enjoy the experience.  Assuming a suitable project can be identified, the Professor will write a project proposal like the following. Once the company approve the description, it can be circulated to students.  Morgan Stanley   Company Description   Morgan Stanley has earned a worldwide reputation for excellence in financial advice and market execution. The 58,000 members of Morgan Stanley in 28 countries connect people, ideas and capital to help our clients achieve their financial aspirations.   Proposal: XBRL taxonomy object model and document processor   Businesses and governments are making a massive global efforts to standardize the organization, definition and presentation of financial information. The information ranges broadly across many industries and many types of information. Technically, the extensible business reporting language (XBRL; see WWW.XBRL.ORG) is being built to encode this standardization. XBRL is an electronic format for simplifying the flow of financial statements, performance reports, accounting records, and other financial information between software programs. XBRL is based on XML. Two hundred corporations, including Morgan Stanley, are involved in the effort.   XBRL is quite complex because the information it must represent is complex. Consider, for example, the complexities across the multiple dimensions: industries, data types, corporate departments, nations, and languages.   Analogous with XML schemas, the structure of an XBRL document is described by a schema or \"taxonomy\" definition. Programmers write application that read, analyze, process and output XBRL documents. The development community sorely needs an object model that describes the structure of XBRL taxonomies. Given a taxonomy object model (TOM) a programmer could easily write an XBRL document processing application that could read a taxonomy and read, process or write XBRL documents.   The goals of this project are to:   \u2022 Write, in Java, an open-source XBRL taxonomy object model   \u2022 Develop, in Java, if time allows, a simple XBRL document processing application   This project will require extensive expertise on XML (which can be obtained during the project) and involve extensive study of the XBRL architecture and specification. This is a significant opportunity to be one of the first 100 people in the world be become expert in this new and important technology.   Intern Address:   1585 Broadway, at 48th   Company Web site   www.morganstanley.com   Project manager   Junior manager or non-manager   Resources that will be made available to students:   \u2022 Access to any sample data   \u2022 Code and information   \u2022 Temporary use of computers   NYU semesters start in early September and mid January. At the beginning of the semester, the ITP Professor staffs projects. (In a given semester 3 to 5 projects will be conducted.) In class, he describes all the proposed projects to the students. Students indicate their interest level for each project. The ITP Professor allocates students to projects. It is important for each student to be placed on a project they find interesting. Therefore, the ITP Professor staffs projects by balancing student interest and the need to provide an appropriate set of skills. If a company proposes a project, it will probably be staffed, but a project may not be staffed if students do not find it interesting or cannot supply the right set of skills.     Project Execution   The ITP Professor and his/her students devote considerable effort and intelligence to company projects. The course is tightly scheduled to accomplish as much as possible during the 14 weeks of an NYU semester. This helps train the students to prosecute IT projects efficiently. Projects executed by a student team are reviewed on a weekly basis by other students working on different projects in the same class and their overall input is used to improve the project deliverables. Weekly meeting minutes are compiled by the project team and become part of the overall set of project deliverables.
