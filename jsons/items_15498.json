We already entrust cyberspace with our privacy, national security, physical safety, and digital identities. Maintaining an orderly, peaceful, safe, and productive society will increasingly depend on maintaining safe and trustworthy information systems. However, trust cannot be realized by technology alone. This course adopts the viewpoint that cyberspace is essentially a social system that relies on important technical components. The course will begin with a discussion of trust, risk and deception as developed in the social sciences and examine how traditional notions apply or fail to apply to interactions in cyberspace. In the second part of the course we will examine the technical underpinning of cyberspace and the mechanisms that have been developed to create trustworthy systems. In the third and final part of the course we will examine the interplay between the technical and social aspects and see how better policy and systems can be developed to tackle cybercrime, cyber-espionage, cyberwar and cyberterrorism. A computer science or engineering knowledge is not necessary for taking this course.    Course Expectations: This course will involve a lot of reading, discussion and writing. Students are expected to read a substantial number of research papers, participate in classroom and online discussions, and complete a publishable research project. Each student is requires to do final project on a topic of their  choosing that goes deeper into the issues beyond what is discussed in class.
