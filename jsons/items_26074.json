Art, Education, and Community Practice    Welcome to our new, socially oriented Art + Education program at NYU. Fall 2014 will be the first year of this innovative master's program that explores the intersections between contemporary artistic practice, educational theory, and social activism. We are looking for students who are interested in envisioning new ways that artists, educators, designers, community organizers, and social activists can work together, and within community-based settings to propose critical interventions that inspire dialogue and catalyze social change through the arts. Investigate:       What is artistic activism?    How is artistic activism similar to and different from social practice or socially engaged art?    What are the aesthetics and ethics of artistic activism?    How do we know when artistic activism is most effective, toward what ends?       Explore:       Greenwich Village and New York City, the cultural capital of the world, including world renown museums such as The New Museum, MoMA, and the Whitney Museum, along with nearby galleries in the Lower East Side and Chelsea    A comprehensive curriculum in contemporary visual art, educational theory, and social activism that combines theory with practice    A flexible program of study that can be tailored to your interests       Collaborate:       Work with practicing artists and educators in community-based and neighborhood settings around New York City    An internationally renowned and dedicated faculty from across New York University schools and programs    A richly diverse and multicultural community committed to social justice       Connect to Communities Grounded in the work of critical educational theorists including Paolo Freire and bell hooks, this program supports artists and other publicly situated activists to connect visual strategies with the needs of a community. Students learn from artists who do socially engaged work, examining how art and design can open dialogue about a community&rsquo;s history, culture, and social needs. Drawing on community organizing strategies and artistic activism, students are directly involved in putting ideas generated with the community into practice. This hands-on approach leads to a capstone project, which provides an opportunity to design and implement a community-based art project that allows for social transformation. In this program students assume major roles in changing the social, cultural, political, and economic landscape through their artistic practice. This interdisciplinary program prepares students to work within community-based settings, museums, NGOs, or broader public and civic contexts to initiate social change through the arts.    This program does not lead to certification for teaching. One-Year Program with Small Classes Classes are small and personal attention is given to each student throughout the duration of program, from initial advisement through completion of the master's final project.    The program can be completed in as little as 3 semesters or 12 months, as a full-time student. The program can also be completed as a part-time student in two years.    Enrollment    The Art, Education, and Community Practice program serves individuals interested in socially engaged art who want to work outside of or in collaboration with traditional venues (museum, gallery arena, and classrooms). Students come from a wide variety of backgrounds including studio art and design, community-based organizations, social activism, and a variety of education contexts. Graduates may also serve as artists and organizers working as educators, curators, and artists in museums, community-based organizations, and NGOs. The program will initially enroll a total of 5-7 new students in the Fall semester of each year.    For Examples of Student Work    Visit our Art, Education, and Community Practice blog .

Students are engaged with the art and ideas of artists working in the public sphere as well as with the history of visual artistic practice including political/activist, public, and performance-based art. They will also be exposed to artists working today and to opportunities to learn from artists who have engaged with public audiences through socially driven, community-based projects.       What are the historical precedents for artists working in the public sphere and what are the possibilities and challenges of public work today?    In contemporary art, what is the spectrum of artistic practice that attempts to engage and involve public audiences?    What new models and tools for art-based interventions are possible today?       Module 2: Educational Theory Providing a firm grounding in educational theory, the program envisions the artist/educator as one who is able to apply pedagogical practices to diverse artistic endeavors. Educational theory will provide a solid understanding of critical pedagogy from Freire to Giroux. Students will consider educational theory in public, community-based, informal and virtual/media-based contexts, as well as from domestic and international perspectives.       In what ways can education&mdash;within a school or classroom context, as well as beyond&mdash;be considered a form of public pedagogy?    What are the developmental, social, and political implications of education as a public act?    What are current theories in education that support the idea of teaching as a public act as well as an artistic act?    In what ways do educational and artistic practice intersect in their use of pedagogical strategies?       Module 3: Social Activism Overlaying the artistic and educational modules is a focus on social activism and community engagement. Coursework will explore the politics of working in local, global, and virtual contexts. Within this module students will learn about methods of engagement from educational and artistic practice in order to inform social practice.       What are interventionist strategies that engage and mobilize community members to enable social transformation?    What are the politics and possibilities of community formation?    What role can artists, community organizers &amp; organizations, and activists play in community-based work and empowerment?    What kinds of pedagogical practices support meaningful social engagement in relation to local and global contexts?       Electives    Students also choose elective courses from across the university to customize their degree focus and experiences.    Terminal Integrative (Capstone) Project    Working under the supervision of the Program Director and a faculty mentor, students will design and implement a community-based project informed by their individual art practice, their core and elective coursework, and the cultural or organizational context in which they will be working. In collaboration with NYC-based cultural and educational organizations, students will be encouraged to use different methodologies that combine intuition, social, conceptual, and cultural ways of knowing and being in order to develop and implement an art project that allows for social transformation.
