The Birth of Gallatin                                 The Gallatin School grew out of the educational reform movement of the late 1960s and early 1970s, a period when social forces were bringing new populations of students to higher education. Gallatin was created to respond to the needs and interests of a special kind of student \u2014 focused, self-disciplined and creative. Some were accomplished professionals and people with broad life experiences, and the University recognized that they wanted to exercise more personal freedom in designing individual paths of study.   For more than 40 years, the Gallatin approach has continued to attract a wide variety of bright, talented students with its flexible but academically rigorous curriculum, its innovative, interdisciplinary approach to education, outstanding teachers and advisers and small college atmosphere.

Your adviser ensures that your program has depth, breadth and coherence, and that it is consistent with your professional and educational goals. Advisers also supervise and evaluate independent studies and internship projects and advise graduate students on their theses.

All of New York City becomes your classroom: you can intern at a publishing company, a television station, a museum, a hospital or a theater. Besides helping you decide if a particular field is right for you, these internships provide firsthand experience that can often lead to a full-time position after graduation. Through independent study, you can design your own project and work one-on-one with a professor who is an expert in the field.

The work will be supported by a three-year grant from Independence Blue Cross (IBC), the Philadelphia region\u2019s leading health insurer. The collaboration is part of NYU\u2019s Initiative in Data Science and Statistics, which aims to harness today\u2019s torrent of data in order to make advances in medicine, science, technology, business, and a range of other fields. IBC is a founding member of this university-wide effort.   \u201cIndependence Blue Cross is proud to be a leader in exploring the use of sophisticated computer analytics to help transform the delivery and quality of health care,\u201d said Daniel J. Hilferty, IBC president and CEO. \u201cPartnering with NYU, one of the nation\u2019s leading experts in the field of data analytics, will provide us with invaluable information we can use to greatly improve the health of our members and lower health care costs. After all diabetes is the number one chronic illness in the Philadelphia region.\u201d   More than 8 percent or 25 million people in the U.S. suffer from diabetes, according to the American Diabetes Association. But nearly one-third of those afflicted with diabetes are undiagnosed \u2014unaware that they have this disease. Moreover, it has recently been estimated that an additional 25 percent, or 79 million people, have \u201cpre-diabetes,\u201d a condition in which blood glucose levels are higher than normal, but not yet high enough to be diagnosed as diabetes. The pre-diabetes stage is a critical one. If hyperglycemia goes untreated, damage to the blood vessels begins and the risk of cardiovascular disease increases.   \u201cWithout a doubt, improved ways to accelerate the diagnosis of diabetes in affected people will improve health, reduce the complications of the disease, and reduce health care costs,\u201d said Ann Marie Schmidt, M.D., a professor of endocrinology and medicine at NYU Langone Medical Center and co-investigator.   \u201cDiabetes is a debilitating disease causing tremendous strain on our health care system,\u201d said Somesh Nigam, senior vice president, chief informatics officer of IBC. \u201cWith this analysis, we can slow the progression of the diabetes epidemic by identifying people at high risk for diabetes, working with them and their doctors to get the care they need, and ultimately keeping people well, reducing their complications from diabetes, and lowering costs.\u201d   NYU\u2019s David Sontag, an assistant professor in the Department of Computer Science at Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, will head the collaboration.   The project\u2019s other co-investigators will be Yann LeCun, a professor of computer science and neural science at the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, and Saul Blecker, M.D., an assistant professor of population health and general internal medicine at NYU Langone Medical Center.   Under this collaboration, the researchers will develop methodologies to predict which patients have undiagnosed diabetes and pre-diabetes by applying machine-learning algorithms to IBC\u2019s medical and pharmacy claims data.   Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence that involves computers \u201clearning\u201d to extract knowledge from massive data sets and rendering informed analyses and judgments, often predicting outcomes. This collaboration will use machine learning to develop an algorithm, using patients\u2019 historical claims data, to predict which patients are at the highest risk of diabetes. All patient data is securely maintained at all times.   Data Science \u2014 using automated methods to analyze massive amounts of data and extract knowledge from them \u2014 is a set of methods that is becoming core to many areas of business, science, and government. Last year, the White House announced a multi-agency initiative in \u201cBig Data\u201d to speed the pace of discovery in science and engineering, strengthen national security, and transform teaching and learning. A growing number of companies including those in the pharmaceutical, financial, insurance and web industries are driven by Data Science.

On the heels of its first absolute majority victory in the Scottish Parliament, the Scottish National Party led the charge for a referendum on independence. After reaching an agreement with the British government, an up-or-down vote will be held in late 2014. In Qu\u00e9bec, the Parti qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois formed a minority government in late 2012, bringing independence back onto the agenda after nearly 10 years out of power. In Catalonia, over one million people marched in support of independence in September 2012. Though the moderate separatist government led by the Convergence and Union Party lost ground in recent elections, separatists still make up enough seats to be able to call a referendum on independence. The Spanish government has vowed to block any vote on the issue.   This program aimed to frame the debate on these independence movements and discuss their possible trajectories in 2013 and beyond. The event provided a forum to discuss and exchange on differing experiences with similar referendums and devolution in the past.

One of the first schools in the country to allow students to take on the exciting challenge of shaping their own curriculum, Gallatin helps students draw on the vast resources of NYU and New York City, and encourages them to benefit from practical experience, including internships and independent studies.                                                            The History of Ideas and Significant World Texts                                 Undergraduates experience a thorough grounding in the history of ideas and significant world texts, and graduate students pursue advanced study in interdisciplinary modes of thought. Creating your own program requires maturity, motivation and independence. Students seeking a combination of flexible options and an academic challenge are natural Gallatin candidates.                                                              The Birth of Gallatin                                 The Gallatin School grew out of the educational reform movement of the late 1960s and early 1970s, a period when social forces were bringing new populations of students to higher education. Gallatin was created to respond to the needs and interests of a special kind of student \u2014 focused, self-disciplined and creative. Some were accomplished professionals and people with broad life experiences, and the University recognized that they wanted to exercise more personal freedom in designing individual paths of study.   For more than 40 years, the Gallatin approach has continued to attract a wide variety of bright, talented students with its flexible but academically rigorous curriculum, its innovative, interdisciplinary approach to education, outstanding teachers and advisers and small college atmosphere.                                                              Faculty Advisers                                 The key to Gallatin's educational approach is its faculty advisers. Your adviser ensures that your program has depth, breadth and coherence, and that it is consistent with your professional and educational goals. Advisers also supervise and evaluate independent studies and internship projects and advise graduate students on their theses.                                                              New York City as Your Classroom                                 Along with academic course work, internships, private lessons in the arts and independent studies can be essential parts of your education at Gallatin. All of New York City becomes your classroom: you can intern at a publishing company, a television station, a museum, a hospital or a theater. Besides helping you decide if a particular field is right for you, these internships provide firsthand experience that can often lead to a full-time position after graduation. Through independent study, you can design your own project and work one-on-one with a professor who is an expert in the field. As a small college within a highly regarded research university, Gallatin provides its students with the best of both worlds. Our small size creates a strong sense of community among students and faculty and allows you to develop lasting relationships with your professors, advisers and classmates. At the same time, access to all of New York University means that you have virtually unlimited resources \u2014 a wide variety of courses taught by world-renowned scholars, excellent facilities and research institutes and all of the resources of New York City at your doorstep                            top of page                            Location:   New York, NY      Right on the corner of Broadway and Washington Place in New York City's Greenwich Village                                             Did You Know?

The work will be supported by a three-year grant from Independence Blue Cross (IBC), the Philadelphia region\u2019s leading health insurer. The collaboration is part of NYU\u2019s Initiative in Data Science and Statistics, which aims to harness today\u2019s torrent of data in order to make advances in medicine, science, technology, business, and a range of other fields. IBC is a founding member of this university-wide effort.   \u201cIndependence Blue Cross is proud to be a leader in exploring the use of sophisticated computer analytics to help transform the delivery and quality of health care,\u201d said Daniel J. Hilferty, IBC president and CEO. \u201cPartnering with NYU, one of the nation\u2019s leading experts in the field of data analytics, will provide us with invaluable information we can use to greatly improve the health of our members and lower health care costs. After all diabetes is the number one chronic illness in the Philadelphia region.\u201d   More than 8 percent or 25 million people in the U.S. suffer from diabetes, according to the American Diabetes Association. But nearly one-third of those afflicted with diabetes are undiagnosed \u2014unaware that they have this disease. Moreover, it has recently been estimated that an additional 25 percent, or 79 million people, have \u201cpre-diabetes,\u201d a condition in which blood glucose levels are higher than normal, but not yet high enough to be diagnosed as diabetes. The pre-diabetes stage is a critical one. If hyperglycemia goes untreated, damage to the blood vessels begins and the risk of cardiovascular disease increases.   \u201cWithout a doubt, improved ways to accelerate the diagnosis of diabetes in affected people will improve health, reduce the complications of the disease, and reduce health care costs,\u201d said Ann Marie Schmidt, M.D., a professor of endocrinology and medicine at NYU Langone Medical Center and co-investigator.   \u201cDiabetes is a debilitating disease causing tremendous strain on our health care system,\u201d said Somesh Nigam, senior vice president, chief informatics officer of IBC. \u201cWith this analysis, we can slow the progression of the diabetes epidemic by identifying people at high risk for diabetes, working with them and their doctors to get the care they need, and ultimately keeping people well, reducing their complications from diabetes, and lowering costs.\u201d   NYU\u2019s David Sontag, an assistant professor in the Department of Computer Science at Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, will head the collaboration.   The project\u2019s other co-investigators will be Yann LeCun, a professor of computer science and neural science at the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, and Saul Blecker, M.D., an assistant professor of population health and general internal medicine at NYU Langone Medical Center.   Under this collaboration, the researchers will develop methodologies to predict which patients have undiagnosed diabetes and pre-diabetes by applying machine-learning algorithms to IBC\u2019s medical and pharmacy claims data.   Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence that involves computers \u201clearning\u201d to extract knowledge from massive data sets and rendering informed analyses and judgments, often predicting outcomes. This collaboration will use machine learning to develop an algorithm, using patients\u2019 historical claims data, to predict which patients are at the highest risk of diabetes. All patient data is securely maintained at all times.   Data Science \u2014 using automated methods to analyze massive amounts of data and extract knowledge from them \u2014 is a set of methods that is becoming core to many areas of business, science, and government. Last year, the White House announced a multi-agency initiative in \u201cBig Data\u201d to speed the pace of discovery in science and engineering, strengthen national security, and transform teaching and learning. A growing number of companies including those in the pharmaceutical, financial, insurance and web industries are driven by Data Science.

On the heels of its first absolute majority victory in the Scottish Parliament, the Scottish National Party led the charge for a referendum on independence. After reaching an agreement with the British government, an up-or-down vote will be held in late 2014. In Qu\u00e9bec, the Parti qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois formed a minority government in late 2012, bringing independence back onto the agenda after nearly 10 years out of power. In Catalonia, over one million people marched in support of independence in September 2012. Though the moderate separatist government led by the Convergence and Union Party lost ground in recent elections, separatists still make up enough seats to be able to call a referendum on independence.
