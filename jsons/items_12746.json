Focuses on the history of records and record keeping, development of archival theory, appraisal, arrangement and description, reference, legal and ethical issues, and current trends in the profession.                  HIST-GA.1012 Historical Editing Seminar         Introduces students to the theories, practices, and problems involved in editing and publishing historical documents. Students develop their own documentary editions complete with prefatory material, transcriptions, annotations, and calendars. Focuses especially on project leadership and includes an electronic edition component.              HIST-GA.1151 Literature of the Field: Modern Europe        This class introduces graduate students to major debates, problems and categories in European historiography on the period from the mid nineteenth to the late twentieth centuries. The emphasis is on methodological and analytical questions. Topics include nationalism, fascism, capitalism, colonialism, total war, cities, science, and subjectivity.              HIST-GA.1156 What is Europe?        Examines the formation of the European nation-state starting with the French Revolution. Provides an overview of key issues, including citizenship, exclusion, immigration, identity, nationalism, security, and the creation of the European Union and its policy formation.               HIST-GA.1201 Lit of the Field: Colonial Latin America        Surveys major literature and historiographical issues in the colonial Latin American field. Required for PhD students in Latin American and Caribbean History.                  HIST-GA.1209 19th Century France: France and its Empire 1750-1800s    France and Its Empire, 1750-1880s focuses on the revolutionary period of modern France. This was a tumultuous and creative time, a time of revolution and reaction, republics and monarchies, liberalism and centralized power. We will study this period in three principal ways: by learning about the various regimes, politics, ideologies, and social patterns that marked the era; by reading documents written during this time and texts composed by some of its principal figures; and by analyzing selected works of present-day historical scholarship that help us understand modern France.         As we build this understanding, our thinking will be guided by the following questions: Why was it so difficult during the century following the French Revolution for France to develop a stable political regime? Why, in this connection, did France irrupt into revolution in response to the problems it faced? And to what extent did the French Revolution define the nature and meaning of the period that followed it? Finally, what was the role of France\u2019s empire, and how did colonialism square with the effort to build a stable republican regime?        The French Revolution is fundamental not just to French history but to world history. For this reason, we will devote considerable attention to the origins and meaning of this event. We will also consider the subsequent revolutions of the nineteenth century revolutions and examine the extent to which France became a modern society in the second half of the nineteenth century.                     HIST-GA.1326 Russia: Law and Empire, 16th-21st Century     Description forthcoming. In the meantime, please contact the professor directly.             HIST-GA.1416 History of Modern Ireland I     Early-modern Irish history is an epic tale of conflict, subjugation, and the struggle for national identity. In the roughly two and a half centuries covered by this course, Ireland was transformed from a mysterious and remote island on the periphery of Europe to a quasi-autonomous state fully caught up in the sweeping economic, political, and social transformations that defined the late eighteenth century. Among the topics covered in History I are the Tudor conquest and colonization; Gaelic pushback; Ireland under the Stuarts; the Williamite War and formation of the Protestant Ascendancy; the emergence of Irish nationalism; Ireland and the Enlightenment; 18th-century political, economic, and societal transformations; and Ireland in the Age of Revolutions. The struggles and frustrations of this period define the agenda for Ireland\u2019s tumultuous passage through the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.             HIST-GA.1421 Debates in Modern Irish History     This course seeks to analyze a selection of the intense debates in Ireland itself and abroad, especially in Britain and the USA, that characterize modern Irish history, concentrating on topics that transcend the specific Irish experience to raise issues of wider human import. It is equally a study of events and of their interpretation from various contested perspectives, and thus requires intense engagement with the historiography, and with the study of history as a mode of thought. The topics to be explored include the issues of Conquest, Collaboration, Assimilation and Resistance, viewed through the prism of Ireland and the British Empire, as reflected in a number of major topics, including: The Act of Union; The Great Irish Famine; Irish Diaspora; Issues of Irish Identity (as seen through Irish and British eyes via historical movements and events); the ethno-religious conflict in Northern Ireland since 1968; Ireland and Globalization.              HIST-GA.1441 History and Historiography of Irish America     The Irish are one of the most significant ethnic groups to ever migrate from Europe to the United States. Their impact has been disproportional to their numbers but this only partially explains our contemporary understanding of \u201cIrish America.\u201d This seminar will explore how the history of Irish immigrants and their descendants in the United States has been written over the past century and a half. Students will evaluate books and documentary films that have been influential in constructing the narrative of the Irish in America, in addition to article literature. The goal is to learn how to separate historical content from historiography and to see how both can influence popular perceptions of an ethnic people.              HIST-GA.1521 Medieval Marriage     This course will explore the practical experience of marriage in the Middle Ages. We will be looking at the lay experience of the stages of married life (from courting and wedding to annulment and death) in all its gendered aspects. For each of the thematic sessions we will explore as much as possible the experience across the whole social range from aristocracy to peasants. Although our focus will be on the Christian Middle Ages of western Europe we will devote ample space to comparative aspects in Islamic and Jewish culture especially for the Mediterranean area. Thematic sessions will centre on exogamy (intermarriage) in mixed faith and ethnic circumstances, polygamy and concubinage, remarriage and step family relationships, male power and female obedience and the memorialisation of married life. We will also explore alternative forms of cohabitation in a sexual or celibate manner. Wherever possible special attention will be paid to the material culture of marriage, such as the domestic arrangement in the houses, living and sleeping quarters and moveable possessions.              HIST-GA.1562 Lit of the Field: Africa     This course introduces students to the major themes, scholarly approaches, and sources for African history.              HIST-GA.1600 Literature of the Field: US to 1877     A reading course covering the earlier period of American history that introduces students to the major themes, interpretations, and methods of inquiry. It is intended to provide a broad command of the field.              HIST-GA.1646 Materializing in the Middle Ages     The theme of the seminar, materiality, is concerned with the tangible stuff of medieval lives, with those materials: animal parts, vegetable fibers, metal, stones, clay, wood, that were used and processed into finished objects: comestibles, clothing, homes and monuments, artifacts and ornaments, images and the media of written and visual communication. As they emerged from raw materials, things affected social relations and cultural perception, enabling action and provoking reaction. We will consider, for example, the effects of pageantry, with its elaborate display of culinary, heraldic, and sartorial splendor, in asserting and maintaining chivalric claims to dominance. We will examine recent archeological findings to understand the ways that, through accessories to their dress, peasants resisted and re-fashioned the identities imposed upon them by medieval elites. Objects, thus, shaped history, yet historians tend to write history based upon texts. Avoiding such an exclusive dependency requires methodological reflection. Stimulated by the work of social scientists such as Jane Bennett, Alfred Gell, Tim Ingold, Bruno Latour, and Bjrnar Olsen, lively debates are currently taking place about the theory, goals, and relevance of material culture studies, and we will develop our own perspectives on the issues at stake. Assessing the participation, meaning, and agency of things in pre-modern lives forces to question boundaries and to put them in a newer historical perspective: the relationships between humans and animals (and nature), between humans and technology, body and soul, images and memory, the animate and the inanimate. Our exploration of the connections between human and non-human environments will consider the appropriation of animal skins in the production of writing; the extension of human personhood via the use of animal power, tools, weapons, images, and memory aids; human involvement with a living landscape of holy trees, sacred groves and springs, and powerful stars; attitudes toward idols and automata; the perception of art as vibrant matter. Though modern theory inspires historians and art historians to seek agency in a network of social and material relationships, medieval intellectuals were more cautious in their belief in the power of matter. In fact, for many, the materiality of the human body was suspicious, as was knowledge that depended upon the mediation of the senses. Such \u2018carnal\u2019 knowledge was ascribed to minorities (Jews) and alleged dissenters (magi, witches). Materiality in the Middle Ages was a philosophical topic fraught with ambivalence, imbued with a potential for violence.              HIST-GA.1750 Intro to Public History     Reviews the history of public history, focusing on historians\u2019 relationships, dialogues, and collaborations with public audiences. Considers issues involving memory, identity, heritage, commemoration, historic preservation, history museums, historic sites, oral history, and digital history. Final project involves a collaborative endeavor with a local public history institution.               HIST-GA.1763 Approaches to History of Women and Gender     This course is intended as an introduction to some of the central methodological and interpretive issues involved in the historical study of women and gender. We consider the development of women\u2019s history as a field from the 1960s, the historiographies that have shaped women\u2019s history (and been influenced by it), the introduction of gender as an analytical category, the interpretive models that have structured writing about women and gender in the past, and the particular challenges involved in researching subjects who have often left little trace in the historic record. This is not a nation-based survey of women\u2019s history. Instead, our approach is comparative. We will read works that have had a significant impact on the development of the field, works that model particular methodological or interpretive approaches, and works by faculty at NYU. We will also consider contemporary reflections on the state of the field, both in the US and internationally .               HIST-GA.1773 Society &amp; Culture: 20th Century America     This is a graduate level research seminar on the social and cultural history of the United States in the twentieth-century. The central project of the course will be each student\u2019s development of an extended, article-length essay based on original research. Considerable class time will be dedicated to preliminary discussions of each research problematic and its relevant historiographies. Research takes time, as does writing and re-writing; papers are NOT written in one sitting or in a single draft. Accordingly, students will be required to develop their research in the first weeks, even as readings and discussion proceed and present finished drafts in class that will be revised for final submission.        Although the seminar is not be readings course or colloquium, the first half of the semester will include readings to introduce some theoretical tools and writing strategies. Introductory readings and wider reading around the relevant historiographies that the various students\u2019 research problematic engages, and shared reading of the research essays of others will also expose students to a broad a range of subjects in the literature in social and cultural history. The subject is cast broadly to allow for diverse student research interests, but will be limited to the long 20th century (from ca. 1890 to the present).              HIST-GA.1782 African American History     Broad exposure to African American history. Begins with a historiographical introduction, describing the growth and development of the field, and moves to a major theme and period treatment ranging from ancient Africa to the civil rights movement. Provides an understanding of the field and a foundation for specialized course work and research.              HIST-GA.1981 Migration History and Theory: The Italian Case as Litmus Test     The course begins with the assumption that mobility is the norm in human history and it will focus on the case of Italy \u2013 a geographically well-defined peninsula, which for centuries has been at the crossroad of demographic movements \u2013 as an ideal example of what kind of socio-cultural transformations can be consequence of population mobility in every society and context. The course will draw on the lessons from the various theories of migration to analyze the way in which Italy's human landscape has been affected by migratory flows and the social, cultural, political impacts these in- and out-flows have originated in the course of history. It will first provide an overview of the state of the art in the field of international migration theories, with a view to clarify any conceptual distinctions between the terms migration, immigration, mobility, diasporas, etc. Then, we will explore some key pathways that will form the focus of the transformations: a) the arts \u2013 literary and visual; b) institutions and laws \u2013 juridical concerns in controlling flows and identifying status and memberships; c) familial/societal structures; d) entrepreneurship and economic culture. Finally, the course will discuss to what extent and in what manner population movements have been forging states and societies and, through the Italian case, will reflect upon the role of mobility as a key dynamic in globalization. The course is addressed to those students with basic knowledge of Italian migration history and/or interest in migration studies, who intend to enhance their knowledge both of international migration theory and the history of Italian global migrations. The main aim of the course is to provide the students with effective tools to develop critical thinking on human mobility.              HIST-GA.2022 MA Proseminar     Introduction to the theoretical and methodological components involved in the research process. Considers historiographical issues; develops an understanding of the archival and library environments, focusing on searching strategies and the use of automated techniques; and emphasizes framing research questions. Students complete a research paper with appropriate documentation and bibliography in their area of interest.              HIST-GA.2031 Advanced Archival Description     Provides an understanding of archival descriptive standards and practices. Focuses on the development and use of bibliographic standards to create and exchange data concerning archival records. Particular emphases include the MARC format; the development, implementation, and evaluation of Encoded Archival Description and Encoded Archival Context; content management systems; digital encoding standards; and digital library development.               HIST-GA.2033 Creating Digital History     Historians who work with the public have a particular need to be confidant with digital tools. The course offers students a hands-on primer in the skills archivist and historians need to create, contribute to, and use web-based historical sites. Students will gain experience digitizing historical materials for preservation and access, creating structured metadata and folksonomies to describe historical objects, conducting online historical research and presenting the results of that research online in the form of blog posts and an online digital exhibit. Projects will center around the history of Greenwich Village and be publicly accessible at htttp://aphdigital.org/GVH. Class discussions will focus on current topics in digital humanities and how they impact the making of digital history sites.               HIST-GA.2122 Empire, Nation, Globalization     Empire and globalization lie at the heart of the spatial turn in academic work during the last several decades. This graduate seminar is designed to enrich student research in various disciplines by exploring empire and globalization as features of modern spatial history. We focus on imperial Britain and the United States and on globalization in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and in most detail, on South Asia. Spatial history begins with the premise that various scalar forms of social space and social power relations are meaningfully connected to one another. Localities weave into regions, continents, and global spaces. Expanding spaces of social power affect everyday life in smaller spaces, right down to New York neighborhoods and mountain hamlets in the Global South. The scale and impact of meaningful spatial interaction pose problems for historical study. Empire and nation do not necessarily form dominant spatial frames. Space is not a stage or container, but rather a permanently ongoing construction project, at all scalar levels. Spatial history entails the study of interactive, changing spaces over time, configured by social power of many kinds at many levels of scale. This course is designed to stimulate, support, and inform student research. Before mid-term, we read and discuss assigned texts. Each week, we focus on one theme, which we develop according to student interest. The bibliography at the end of the syllabus is a work-in-progress, providing resources for further work. After mid-term, we focus on student research. Each student should join the class with a research idea to work with all term. This idea can be very vague to begin with; it can derive from other courses or outside projects. Student work for the course includes weekly reading and one-page weekly essays to prepare for class. Students and instructor meet individually at mid-term to develop research ideas and devise readings for the remainder of the term. Ideas for final week readings also appear at the end of the syllabus. Students present their work in class at the end of the term. A research paper is due on the last day of university classes.                 HIST-GA.2150 Fiction, Historiography &amp; the Event     In this seminar we will examine the construction, disappearance, and persistence of \u201ceventfulness\u201din fiction, historiography, and theory. We will consider narrative theory as it pertains to the writing of fictional and historical texts; the historical novel genre; the problem of collective memory; subjectivity and historical agency; historical time and regimes of figurability; the question of \u201cthe recent past.\u201d Case Study: the Paris Commune. Readings to include Lukacs, Ricoeur, Braudel, Bakhtin, Badiou, Ranci\u00e8re, and Trouillot.              HIST-GA.2162 Twentieth Century Cities      Description forthcoming. In the meantime, please contact the professor directly.                  HIST-GA.2163 European Conceptions of the New Man, 1789-1945     This course concerns a fundamental fantasy of modern European thought, art, and culture, the figure of the \u201cNew Man\u201d in the period 1789-1939\u2014a figure that expressed the idea that human society and even human nature could and should be regenerated through political, philosophical, and aesthetic means. The course is intended as an engagement with a series of further questions: problems of modernity, secularism, humanism and time; methodological questions pertinent to intellectual and conceptual history as well as theory, comparative literature, and political theory: it is thus aimed at once at students with historical but also literary and political-science backgrounds. We will read a mixture of primary and secondary sources.              HIST-GA.2168 Methods and Approaches to World History     Description forthcoming. In the meantime, please contact the professor directly.             HIST-GA.2655 Morning in America: Ronald Reagan, the Nuclear Crisis, and the Cold War of the 1980s          This course seeks to place the final decade of the Cold War in historical perspective by focusing on the intertwinement of domestic and foreign policy during the Reagan administration. It explores the emergence of the neoconservative movement, the \u201cReagan revolution,\u201d the effects of \u201cReaganomics\u201d and the military buildup, and the ascent of Evangelical Christianity as a political factor. It also retraces the debates surrounding the role of government, social responsibility, the welfare state and public health care system, shifting value systems, and technological innovation, as well as their representations in society and popular culture. Merging an \u201cestablishment\u201d perspective with an analysis of protest cultures, the course examines Reagan\u2019s foreign policy of \u201cpeace through strength\u201d with regard to the Soviet Union from a global perspective, analyzing the nuclear threat and the renewed arms race, his policies toward Europe and Central America, Iran-Contra, the question of human rights in East-West diplomacy, and the controversy, widespread opposition, and grassroots activism these issues triggered both at home and abroad. Readings include the most recent and influential scholarship on this period as well as a variety of primary sources.             HIST-GA.2707 The Agrarian Question in History     This course will explore the emergence of what was called the \u201cAgrarian Question\u201d in the eighteenth, nineteenth and twentieth centuries, as that question was related to the emergence of industrialization and the question of value, problems of domestic and global revolution, and the issues of modernization and development in Europe and the non-Western world. We will trace the evolution of the question from its physiocratic core, through its articulation in Smith, Marx, the Soviet Union, Peru, and into the later twentieth century as part of the 'peasant problem.' The last part of the semester will be devoted to studying how this question has re-emerged in today\u2019s China, as a problem of development, where the peasantry persists. The aim of the class is to familiarize students with some of the basic philosophical and historical texts surrounding problems of development and culture, as they pertain to the agrarian question in China and elsewhere and to assist students in analyzing contemporary problems through a longer historical perspective. A lot of reading and a research paper at the end are basic requirements. Students from all geographical specializations welcome; MA students should write for permission to register.              HIST-GA.2901 Captivity, Displacement, and Migration     This course explores questions of voluntary and involuntary movement across the greater Ottoman and Mediterranean worlds. The emphasis is on the early modern period, especially the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, heyday of corsairs, renegades, captives, and converts. (Participants interested in other periods may write final papers accordingly.) The Ottoman empire, with its particular brand of imperial slavery and its forms of economic and household slavery, is a principal, although not exclusive, focus of the course; the \u201cGrand Turk\u201d looms large even when not a direct protagonist of events. The Eurasian and Mediterranean frontiers of the empire and the peoples who crossed them are emphasized. The majority of the readings are recent monographs; we will also read contemporary narratives. Occasional guest speakers will share their expertise in the themes of the course.            HIST-GA.3013 Research in Archives and Public History     This course is an independent study within the Archives and Public History Program.              HIST-GA.3021 Research in History     This course is an independent study.              HIST-GA.3022 Readings in History     This course is an independent study.              HIST-GA.3213 Eastern Europe Workshop     This 2-credit course involves discussion of selected readings concerning Eastern Europe, discussion of graduate student papers and current research concerning Eastern Europe, attendance at guest lectures concerning Eastern Europe, and independent research on Eastern Europe guided by the instructor.            HIST-GA.3330 Guantanamo Public Memory Project at NYU     This class will bring together Museum Studies, Public History and CLACS students into a nationwide collaboration facilitated by the Guantanamo Public Memory Project. The class will seek to trace the complex history of Guantanomo Bay via the project\u2019s collation of oral history, documentary and photographic, and material culture pertaining to the facility. This history will be framed within a broader set of questions about the politics of archives, the ethics of historical narratives, the techniques and technologies that make history present for the public and the constitution of public consciousness via engagement with images, text and testimony. The class will coordinate, create and curate an exhibition that will draw content from 8 similar classes held in graduate programs across the country (the exhibition itself will travel subsequently to each of the venues). The exhibition will be held at NYU in the Kimmel Windows gallery space \u2013 a 24 hour accessible series of vitrines on the intersection of West 3 rd street and LaGuardia Place. NYU students will curate this exhibition, create digital and other content and coordinate a large international symposium to be held at the exhibition\u2019s opening.              HIST-GA.3603 Approaches to Historical Research and Writing     This course is designed to introduce students to some of the basic methodological and interpretive issues involved in historical research. Based around a core set of readings, the course covers important books and articles that explicitly deal with questions of method, as well as examples of certain methodologies or schools of historiography in action. The goal of this course is to help the student produce a research paper that is of potentially publishable quality and to reveal that the student is capable of doing graduate level research and writing.              HIST-GA.3701 Creation of the Constitution     The course begins with readings setting forth the intellectual and experiential background of the framing, including common law and natural rights theory, republicanism, economic &amp; political scientific ideas, and colonial and post-Independence experience. We then study large parts of the debates at the Constitutional Convention, primarily using Madison's Notes. Next come the ratification debates, including readings from antifederalist writers, about half of The Federalist, and overviews of the Virginia and New York ratification conventions. We conclude with the addition of the Bill of Rights. Classes consist of a combination of lecture and extensive participation by students.              HIST-GA.3704 Legal History Colloquium     This course, taught by faculty members of the School of Law, is designed for students planning academic careers, in particular, as legal historians. Students who take the course will be expected to work on a major research paper intended for publication. Specific topics discussed during the semester are determined by the interests of those participating in the colloquium. 2 credits. Consent of instructors is required to register.              HIST-GA.3803 Atlantic History Workshop     This yearlong course overlaps with the Atlantic History Workshop colloquium, which meets regularly in the Department of History throughout the academic year.

HIST-GA.1209 19th Century France: France and its Empire 1750-1800s    France and Its Empire, 1750-1880s focuses on the revolutionary period of modern France. This was a tumultuous and creative time, a time of revolution and reaction, republics and monarchies, liberalism and centralized power. We will study this period in three principal ways: by learning about the various regimes, politics, ideologies, and social patterns that marked the era; by reading documents written during this time and texts composed by some of its principal figures; and by analyzing selected works of present-day historical scholarship that help us understand modern France.         As we build this understanding, our thinking will be guided by the following questions: Why was it so difficult during the century following the French Revolution for France to develop a stable political regime? Why, in this connection, did France irrupt into revolution in response to the problems it faced? And to what extent did the French Revolution define the nature and meaning of the period that followed it? Finally, what was the role of France\u2019s empire, and how did colonialism square with the effort to build a stable republican regime?        The French Revolution is fundamental not just to French history but to world history. For this reason, we will devote considerable attention to the origins and meaning of this event. We will also consider the subsequent revolutions of the nineteenth century revolutions and examine the extent to which France became a modern society in the second half of the nineteenth century.

HIST-GA.1416 History of Modern Ireland I     Early-modern Irish history is an epic tale of conflict, subjugation, and the struggle for national identity. In the roughly two and a half centuries covered by this course, Ireland was transformed from a mysterious and remote island on the periphery of Europe to a quasi-autonomous state fully caught up in the sweeping economic, political, and social transformations that defined the late eighteenth century. Among the topics covered in History I are the Tudor conquest and colonization; Gaelic pushback; Ireland under the Stuarts; the Williamite War and formation of the Protestant Ascendancy; the emergence of Irish nationalism; Ireland and the Enlightenment; 18th-century political, economic, and societal transformations; and Ireland in the Age of Revolutions. The struggles and frustrations of this period define the agenda for Ireland\u2019s tumultuous passage through the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.             HIST-GA.1421 Debates in Modern Irish History     This course seeks to analyze a selection of the intense debates in Ireland itself and abroad, especially in Britain and the USA, that characterize modern Irish history, concentrating on topics that transcend the specific Irish experience to raise issues of wider human import. It is equally a study of events and of their interpretation from various contested perspectives, and thus requires intense engagement with the historiography, and with the study of history as a mode of thought. The topics to be explored include the issues of Conquest, Collaboration, Assimilation and Resistance, viewed through the prism of Ireland and the British Empire, as reflected in a number of major topics, including: The Act of Union; The Great Irish Famine; Irish Diaspora; Issues of Irish Identity (as seen through Irish and British eyes via historical movements and events); the ethno-religious conflict in Northern Ireland since 1968; Ireland and Globalization.              HIST-GA.1441 History and Historiography of Irish America     The Irish are one of the most significant ethnic groups to ever migrate from Europe to the United States. Their impact has been disproportional to their numbers but this only partially explains our contemporary understanding of \u201cIrish America.\u201d This seminar will explore how the history of Irish immigrants and their descendants in the United States has been written over the past century and a half. Students will evaluate books and documentary films that have been influential in constructing the narrative of the Irish in America, in addition to article literature. The goal is to learn how to separate historical content from historiography and to see how both can influence popular perceptions of an ethnic people.              HIST-GA.1521 Medieval Marriage     This course will explore the practical experience of marriage in the Middle Ages. We will be looking at the lay experience of the stages of married life (from courting and wedding to annulment and death) in all its gendered aspects. For each of the thematic sessions we will explore as much as possible the experience across the whole social range from aristocracy to peasants. Although our focus will be on the Christian Middle Ages of western Europe we will devote ample space to comparative aspects in Islamic and Jewish culture especially for the Mediterranean area. Thematic sessions will centre on exogamy (intermarriage) in mixed faith and ethnic circumstances, polygamy and concubinage, remarriage and step family relationships, male power and female obedience and the memorialisation of married life. We will also explore alternative forms of cohabitation in a sexual or celibate manner. Wherever possible special attention will be paid to the material culture of marriage, such as the domestic arrangement in the houses, living and sleeping quarters and moveable possessions.              HIST-GA.1562 Lit of the Field: Africa     This course introduces students to the major themes, scholarly approaches, and sources for African history.              HIST-GA.1600 Literature of the Field: US to 1877     A reading course covering the earlier period of American history that introduces students to the major themes, interpretations, and methods of inquiry. It is intended to provide a broad command of the field.              HIST-GA.1646 Materializing in the Middle Ages     The theme of the seminar, materiality, is concerned with the tangible stuff of medieval lives, with those materials: animal parts, vegetable fibers, metal, stones, clay, wood, that were used and processed into finished objects: comestibles, clothing, homes and monuments, artifacts and ornaments, images and the media of written and visual communication. As they emerged from raw materials, things affected social relations and cultural perception, enabling action and provoking reaction. We will consider, for example, the effects of pageantry, with its elaborate display of culinary, heraldic, and sartorial splendor, in asserting and maintaining chivalric claims to dominance. We will examine recent archeological findings to understand the ways that, through accessories to their dress, peasants resisted and re-fashioned the identities imposed upon them by medieval elites. Objects, thus, shaped history, yet historians tend to write history based upon texts. Avoiding such an exclusive dependency requires methodological reflection. Stimulated by the work of social scientists such as Jane Bennett, Alfred Gell, Tim Ingold, Bruno Latour, and Bjrnar Olsen, lively debates are currently taking place about the theory, goals, and relevance of material culture studies, and we will develop our own perspectives on the issues at stake. Assessing the participation, meaning, and agency of things in pre-modern lives forces to question boundaries and to put them in a newer historical perspective: the relationships between humans and animals (and nature), between humans and technology, body and soul, images and memory, the animate and the inanimate. Our exploration of the connections between human and non-human environments will consider the appropriation of animal skins in the production of writing; the extension of human personhood via the use of animal power, tools, weapons, images, and memory aids; human involvement with a living landscape of holy trees, sacred groves and springs, and powerful stars; attitudes toward idols and automata; the perception of art as vibrant matter. Though modern theory inspires historians and art historians to seek agency in a network of social and material relationships, medieval intellectuals were more cautious in their belief in the power of matter. In fact, for many, the materiality of the human body was suspicious, as was knowledge that depended upon the mediation of the senses. Such \u2018carnal\u2019 knowledge was ascribed to minorities (Jews) and alleged dissenters (magi, witches). Materiality in the Middle Ages was a philosophical topic fraught with ambivalence, imbued with a potential for violence.              HIST-GA.1750 Intro to Public History     Reviews the history of public history, focusing on historians\u2019 relationships, dialogues, and collaborations with public audiences. Considers issues involving memory, identity, heritage, commemoration, historic preservation, history museums, historic sites, oral history, and digital history. Final project involves a collaborative endeavor with a local public history institution.               HIST-GA.1763 Approaches to History of Women and Gender     This course is intended as an introduction to some of the central methodological and interpretive issues involved in the historical study of women and gender. We consider the development of women\u2019s history as a field from the 1960s, the historiographies that have shaped women\u2019s history (and been influenced by it), the introduction of gender as an analytical category, the interpretive models that have structured writing about women and gender in the past, and the particular challenges involved in researching subjects who have often left little trace in the historic record. This is not a nation-based survey of women\u2019s history. Instead, our approach is comparative. We will read works that have had a significant impact on the development of the field, works that model particular methodological or interpretive approaches, and works by faculty at NYU. We will also consider contemporary reflections on the state of the field, both in the US and internationally .               HIST-GA.1773 Society &amp; Culture: 20th Century America     This is a graduate level research seminar on the social and cultural history of the United States in the twentieth-century. The central project of the course will be each student\u2019s development of an extended, article-length essay based on original research. Considerable class time will be dedicated to preliminary discussions of each research problematic and its relevant historiographies. Research takes time, as does writing and re-writing; papers are NOT written in one sitting or in a single draft. Accordingly, students will be required to develop their research in the first weeks, even as readings and discussion proceed and present finished drafts in class that will be revised for final submission.        Although the seminar is not be readings course or colloquium, the first half of the semester will include readings to introduce some theoretical tools and writing strategies. Introductory readings and wider reading around the relevant historiographies that the various students\u2019 research problematic engages, and shared reading of the research essays of others will also expose students to a broad a range of subjects in the literature in social and cultural history. The subject is cast broadly to allow for diverse student research interests, but will be limited to the long 20th century (from ca. 1890 to the present).              HIST-GA.1782 African American History     Broad exposure to African American history. Begins with a historiographical introduction, describing the growth and development of the field, and moves to a major theme and period treatment ranging from ancient Africa to the civil rights movement. Provides an understanding of the field and a foundation for specialized course work and research.              HIST-GA.1981 Migration History and Theory: The Italian Case as Litmus Test     The course begins with the assumption that mobility is the norm in human history and it will focus on the case of Italy \u2013 a geographically well-defined peninsula, which for centuries has been at the crossroad of demographic movements \u2013 as an ideal example of what kind of socio-cultural transformations can be consequence of population mobility in every society and context. The course will draw on the lessons from the various theories of migration to analyze the way in which Italy's human landscape has been affected by migratory flows and the social, cultural, political impacts these in- and out-flows have originated in the course of history. It will first provide an overview of the state of the art in the field of international migration theories, with a view to clarify any conceptual distinctions between the terms migration, immigration, mobility, diasporas, etc. Then, we will explore some key pathways that will form the focus of the transformations: a) the arts \u2013 literary and visual; b) institutions and laws \u2013 juridical concerns in controlling flows and identifying status and memberships; c) familial/societal structures; d) entrepreneurship and economic culture. Finally, the course will discuss to what extent and in what manner population movements have been forging states and societies and, through the Italian case, will reflect upon the role of mobility as a key dynamic in globalization. The course is addressed to those students with basic knowledge of Italian migration history and/or interest in migration studies, who intend to enhance their knowledge both of international migration theory and the history of Italian global migrations. The main aim of the course is to provide the students with effective tools to develop critical thinking on human mobility.              HIST-GA.2022 MA Proseminar     Introduction to the theoretical and methodological components involved in the research process. Considers historiographical issues; develops an understanding of the archival and library environments, focusing on searching strategies and the use of automated techniques; and emphasizes framing research questions. Students complete a research paper with appropriate documentation and bibliography in their area of interest.              HIST-GA.2031 Advanced Archival Description     Provides an understanding of archival descriptive standards and practices. Focuses on the development and use of bibliographic standards to create and exchange data concerning archival records. Particular emphases include the MARC format; the development, implementation, and evaluation of Encoded Archival Description and Encoded Archival Context; content management systems; digital encoding standards; and digital library development.               HIST-GA.2033 Creating Digital History     Historians who work with the public have a particular need to be confidant with digital tools. The course offers students a hands-on primer in the skills archivist and historians need to create, contribute to, and use web-based historical sites. Students will gain experience digitizing historical materials for preservation and access, creating structured metadata and folksonomies to describe historical objects, conducting online historical research and presenting the results of that research online in the form of blog posts and an online digital exhibit. Projects will center around the history of Greenwich Village and be publicly accessible at htttp://aphdigital.org/GVH. Class discussions will focus on current topics in digital humanities and how they impact the making of digital history sites.               HIST-GA.2122 Empire, Nation, Globalization     Empire and globalization lie at the heart of the spatial turn in academic work during the last several decades. This graduate seminar is designed to enrich student research in various disciplines by exploring empire and globalization as features of modern spatial history. We focus on imperial Britain and the United States and on globalization in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and in most detail, on South Asia. Spatial history begins with the premise that various scalar forms of social space and social power relations are meaningfully connected to one another. Localities weave into regions, continents, and global spaces. Expanding spaces of social power affect everyday life in smaller spaces, right down to New York neighborhoods and mountain hamlets in the Global South. The scale and impact of meaningful spatial interaction pose problems for historical study. Empire and nation do not necessarily form dominant spatial frames. Space is not a stage or container, but rather a permanently ongoing construction project, at all scalar levels. Spatial history entails the study of interactive, changing spaces over time, configured by social power of many kinds at many levels of scale. This course is designed to stimulate, support, and inform student research. Before mid-term, we read and discuss assigned texts. Each week, we focus on one theme, which we develop according to student interest. The bibliography at the end of the syllabus is a work-in-progress, providing resources for further work. After mid-term, we focus on student research. Each student should join the class with a research idea to work with all term. This idea can be very vague to begin with; it can derive from other courses or outside projects. Student work for the course includes weekly reading and one-page weekly essays to prepare for class. Students and instructor meet individually at mid-term to develop research ideas and devise readings for the remainder of the term. Ideas for final week readings also appear at the end of the syllabus. Students present their work in class at the end of the term. A research paper is due on the last day of university classes.                 HIST-GA.2150 Fiction, Historiography &amp; the Event     In this seminar we will examine the construction, disappearance, and persistence of \u201ceventfulness\u201din fiction, historiography, and theory. We will consider narrative theory as it pertains to the writing of fictional and historical texts; the historical novel genre; the problem of collective memory; subjectivity and historical agency; historical time and regimes of figurability; the question of \u201cthe recent past.\u201d Case Study: the Paris Commune. Readings to include Lukacs, Ricoeur, Braudel, Bakhtin, Badiou, Ranci\u00e8re, and Trouillot.              HIST-GA.2162 Twentieth Century Cities      Description forthcoming. In the meantime, please contact the professor directly.                  HIST-GA.2163 European Conceptions of the New Man, 1789-1945     This course concerns a fundamental fantasy of modern European thought, art, and culture, the figure of the \u201cNew Man\u201d in the period 1789-1939\u2014a figure that expressed the idea that human society and even human nature could and should be regenerated through political, philosophical, and aesthetic means. The course is intended as an engagement with a series of further questions: problems of modernity, secularism, humanism and time; methodological questions pertinent to intellectual and conceptual history as well as theory, comparative literature, and political theory: it is thus aimed at once at students with historical but also literary and political-science backgrounds. We will read a mixture of primary and secondary sources.              HIST-GA.2168 Methods and Approaches to World History     Description forthcoming. In the meantime, please contact the professor directly.             HIST-GA.2655 Morning in America: Ronald Reagan, the Nuclear Crisis, and the Cold War of the 1980s          This course seeks to place the final decade of the Cold War in historical perspective by focusing on the intertwinement of domestic and foreign policy during the Reagan administration. It explores the emergence of the neoconservative movement, the \u201cReagan revolution,\u201d the effects of \u201cReaganomics\u201d and the military buildup, and the ascent of Evangelical Christianity as a political factor. It also retraces the debates surrounding the role of government, social responsibility, the welfare state and public health care system, shifting value systems, and technological innovation, as well as their representations in society and popular culture. Merging an \u201cestablishment\u201d perspective with an analysis of protest cultures, the course examines Reagan\u2019s foreign policy of \u201cpeace through strength\u201d with regard to the Soviet Union from a global perspective, analyzing the nuclear threat and the renewed arms race, his policies toward Europe and Central America, Iran-Contra, the question of human rights in East-West diplomacy, and the controversy, widespread opposition, and grassroots activism these issues triggered both at home and abroad. Readings include the most recent and influential scholarship on this period as well as a variety of primary sources.             HIST-GA.2707 The Agrarian Question in History     This course will explore the emergence of what was called the \u201cAgrarian Question\u201d in the eighteenth, nineteenth and twentieth centuries, as that question was related to the emergence of industrialization and the question of value, problems of domestic and global revolution, and the issues of modernization and development in Europe and the non-Western world. We will trace the evolution of the question from its physiocratic core, through its articulation in Smith, Marx, the Soviet Union, Peru, and into the later twentieth century as part of the 'peasant problem.' The last part of the semester will be devoted to studying how this question has re-emerged in today\u2019s China, as a problem of development, where the peasantry persists. The aim of the class is to familiarize students with some of the basic philosophical and historical texts surrounding problems of development and culture, as they pertain to the agrarian question in China and elsewhere and to assist students in analyzing contemporary problems through a longer historical perspective. A lot of reading and a research paper at the end are basic requirements. Students from all geographical specializations welcome; MA students should write for permission to register.              HIST-GA.2901 Captivity, Displacement, and Migration     This course explores questions of voluntary and involuntary movement across the greater Ottoman and Mediterranean worlds. The emphasis is on the early modern period, especially the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, heyday of corsairs, renegades, captives, and converts. (Participants interested in other periods may write final papers accordingly.) The Ottoman empire, with its particular brand of imperial slavery and its forms of economic and household slavery, is a principal, although not exclusive, focus of the course; the \u201cGrand Turk\u201d looms large even when not a direct protagonist of events. The Eurasian and Mediterranean frontiers of the empire and the peoples who crossed them are emphasized. The majority of the readings are recent monographs; we will also read contemporary narratives. Occasional guest speakers will share their expertise in the themes of the course.            HIST-GA.3013 Research in Archives and Public History     This course is an independent study within the Archives and Public History Program.              HIST-GA.3021 Research in History     This course is an independent study.              HIST-GA.3022 Readings in History     This course is an independent study.              HIST-GA.3213 Eastern Europe Workshop     This 2-credit course involves discussion of selected readings concerning Eastern Europe, discussion of graduate student papers and current research concerning Eastern Europe, attendance at guest lectures concerning Eastern Europe, and independent research on Eastern Europe guided by the instructor.            HIST-GA.3330 Guantanamo Public Memory Project at NYU     This class will bring together Museum Studies, Public History and CLACS students into a nationwide collaboration facilitated by the Guantanamo Public Memory Project. The class will seek to trace the complex history of Guantanomo Bay via the project\u2019s collation of oral history, documentary and photographic, and material culture pertaining to the facility. This history will be framed within a broader set of questions about the politics of archives, the ethics of historical narratives, the techniques and technologies that make history present for the public and the constitution of public consciousness via engagement with images, text and testimony. The class will coordinate, create and curate an exhibition that will draw content from 8 similar classes held in graduate programs across the country (the exhibition itself will travel subsequently to each of the venues). The exhibition will be held at NYU in the Kimmel Windows gallery space \u2013 a 24 hour accessible series of vitrines on the intersection of West 3 rd street and LaGuardia Place. NYU students will curate this exhibition, create digital and other content and coordinate a large international symposium to be held at the exhibition\u2019s opening.              HIST-GA.3603 Approaches to Historical Research and Writing     This course is designed to introduce students to some of the basic methodological and interpretive issues involved in historical research. Based around a core set of readings, the course covers important books and articles that explicitly deal with questions of method, as well as examples of certain methodologies or schools of historiography in action. The goal of this course is to help the student produce a research paper that is of potentially publishable quality and to reveal that the student is capable of doing graduate level research and writing.              HIST-GA.3701 Creation of the Constitution     The course begins with readings setting forth the intellectual and experiential background of the framing, including common law and natural rights theory, republicanism, economic &amp; political scientific ideas, and colonial and post-Independence experience. We then study large parts of the debates at the Constitutional Convention, primarily using Madison's Notes. Next come the ratification debates, including readings from antifederalist writers, about half of The Federalist, and overviews of the Virginia and New York ratification conventions. We conclude with the addition of the Bill of Rights. Classes consist of a combination of lecture and extensive participation by students.              HIST-GA.3704 Legal History Colloquium     This course, taught by faculty members of the School of Law, is designed for students planning academic careers, in particular, as legal historians. Students who take the course will be expected to work on a major research paper intended for publication. Specific topics discussed during the semester are determined by the interests of those participating in the colloquium. 2 credits. Consent of instructors is required to register.              HIST-GA.3803 Atlantic History Workshop     This yearlong course overlaps with the Atlantic History Workshop colloquium, which meets regularly in the Department of History throughout the academic year. At the colloquium, participants discuss pre-circulated works-in-progress presented by visiting scholars or members of the colloquium. Students enrolled in this course attend every meeting of the colloquium and undertake additional activities assigned by the instructor during the regular class meetings.            HIST-GA.3901 The Mediterranean in Historical Perspective        Trains students in the history of the Mediterranean and provides them with insights into the theories and interpretations of the Mediterranean. Analyzes the ways in which the Mediterranean has been identified not only as a geographical region, but also as a cultural, political, and social one. Examines the reshaping of cultural, political, and social borders across the Mediterranean.

The chronological extent of the course reaches from the late eighteenth century to the late twentieth century. In general, the course will not discuss the history of the Russian empire or the Soviet Union, though some issues will inevitably be relevant to Eastern Europe. The course will consider the entire region of Eastern Europe, but issues from Polish, Czech, and South Slavic history will be particularly prominent.               HIST-GA.1126 Rulers and Ruled in Imperial Rome and Byzantium     With an astonishingly long life span, extending from Antiquity to the end of the Middle Ages in the Byzantine East, the Roman Empire left a legacy of political and legal organization that has shaped the modern world. This seminar explores, on the one hand, the representation and exercise of imperial power and, on the other, the way the emperor\u2019s subjects perceived their position within the system and experienced authority, official or not. We will investigate imperial legitimacy building, political discourse, consensus and opposition, negotiation and concessions to the powerful, local government and justice, corruption, oppression and patronage, as well as the social groupings and networks that afforded some leverage to the less powerful.               HIST-GA.1196 European Fascisms in Comparative Perspective     Fascism, so one recent history has argued, posed the greatest challenge to liberal democracy during the 20th century. Fascism offered new answers to the problems arising from mass politics, industrialization, technology, and imperialism, and in doing so it sought to remake society, the continent of Europe, and the world. Our goal will be to develop a critical understanding of fascism as a product of the problems arising from modernity, and to understand how and why much of Europe took a violent path that ended in world war and genocide.          This course will study the development of fascism in interwar Europe in a comparative perspective, looking at it as an ideology, as a series of social movements, and eventually as a set of regimes that governed people\u2019s lives. The primary focus will lie on National Socialist Germany and Fascist Italy, but several weeks will be devoted both to Eastern European movements and the Spanish Civil War. Beginning with the intellectual origins of fascism in 19th century bourgeois Europe and World War I, we will move on to examine why fascist movements seized power in certain states but not others. We will then study how fascist regimes, once in power, cultivated popular support and legitimacy; how they developed their own systems of economics, aesthetics, science, and race; how these regimes shaped the everyday lives of their subjects; and how they radicalized with the onset of war. We will conclude by trying to understand how these illiberal regimes can best be interpreted\u2014totalitarian, fascist, racist, or as unique phenomena\u2014 and how they have been remembered. By the end of this course you will produce a substantial final paper.               HIST-GA.1200 Literature of the Field: Modern Latin America     Surveys major literature and historiographical issues in the modern Latin American field.               HIST-GA.1417 History of Modern Ireland II     This two-part survey course seeks to analyze modern Irish history before and after the Act of Union of 1800. The first semester seeks to understand the conditions of possibility for the Union itself: conquest and colonization, resistance and rebellion; the formation of the Protestant Ascendancy and the imperial context of the British state; the discursive development of Irish nationalism; the demographic and societal shifts occasioned by economic development, agricultural change, and emigration; and the Irish contexts of the Enlightenment and the Atlantic revolutions. The second semester examines the impact of the Union and the stages of its dissolution on Irish life, considering the role of Ireland in the British empire; the nature of civil society in Ireland, and the cultural and political dimensions of nationalism and unionism before and after independence; the role of the Irish diaspora on developments in Ireland; and the particular nature of the Irish experience of urbanization, modernization, and globalization.            HIST-GA.1552 Renaissance Italy    The principal goal of the course is to provide students with a working knowledge of the historiography of Renaissance Italy. The course is organized around some of the major themes and conceptual problems in the literature, including the social structure and political systems of Italian City-States; the Papacy and its role in Italian politics and culture; the intellectual and social role of the humanists; art and art patronage. Since complete coverage would be impossible, the course strives to provide a mix of classic texts and more recent scholarship in an effort to familiarize the students with the methods, objectives, and research techniques employed by historians of the Italian Renaissance. In so doing, the course will prepare students to apply these methods and insights to their own work.            HIST-GA.1563 Black Internationalisms     Black Internationalisms is an exploration of those examples and moments in modern/post-modern history in which manifested important transnational cooperative ventures between and among African-descended populations and/or representatives of those populations. The idea is to examine conditions conducive to and reasons for collaboration, together with forces and factors militating against it, with a view toward engaging with its intellectual and cultural productivity. Such investigation provides enormous insights into the complexity of diaspora, and how it has been variously interpreted and re-imagined over time and across cultures.            HIST-GA.1610 Literature of the Field: 19th Century US History     A reading course covering the later period of American history that introduces students to the major themes, interpretations, and methods of inquiry. It is intended to provide a broad command of the field.            HIST-GA.1620 Twentieth Century France     This course will explore central issues in the history of France from the late nineteenth century to the current era. We begin with an examination of the Dreyfus Affair, an extraordinary national convulsion over anti-Semitism and a miscarriage of justice that left a powerful legacy for the rest of the twentieth century. We then turn to the First World War, giving special attention to its effects on the economy, government, social classes, and the relationship between men and women, and between colonial peoples and the French empire. Our focus then shifts to the 1930s, when the country was shaken by the Great Depression, the rise of political extremism, and the struggle to forge a \u201cpopular front\u201d against fascism. We then spend several weeks exploring the Second World War, its anticipation, the French defeat of 1940, the Occupation, Resistance, Liberation, and postwar reconstruction amid the early years of the Cold War. The Second World War also had an enormous impact on the empire. We turn our attention to the wars over decolonization after 1945, especially in Algeria. The course concludes with a focus on Gaullism, the rebellion of May 1968, postcolonial immigration, the rise of the anti-immigrant National Front, and controversies over gender, sexuality, religion, and globalization in the final decade of the twentieth century. Although the course is organized around a chronological examination of the political history of France, we will stress social, cultural, and economic history as well. After all, the century of total wars also brought France its period of most rapid social and economic change. We will investigate issues that call for crossing the usual boundaries between these several kinds of history. We will also repeatedly consider French developments within three wider international contexts: Europe, the French empire, and trans-Atlantic relations.            HIST-GA.1757 Approaches to Public History     Public historians build bridges between the work of academic historians and the interests of audiences who reach far beyond college classrooms. Through readings, media, visits by working public historians, and project work, this course explores the intellectual and pragmatic issues public historians face as they build those bridges in a variety of settings from the brick-and-mortar precincts of museums and public sites to the vast digital reaches of the internet.            HIST-GA.1784 African History Seminar     This course is a research seminar. It is mainly intended for students who have completed the Literature of the Field: Africa course and developed a research proposal as a final project. Other students who have had equivalent preparation and have a research project ready to go may also take this course with permission of the instructor.            HIST-GA.1985 Italy in World War II     This course covers Italy from 1940 to 1945, with a focus on cultural and political responses to war and on how the war has been represented in memory. The course is thematic rather than chronological in nature; our sources include reportage, novels, archival documents, memoirs, and non-fiction and feature film as our sources. Ongoing themes will include the meanings of resistance and collaboration; the problematics of testimony, witnessing, and memory; the impact of war on gender roles and identities; and the representation of violence.            HIST-GA.2001 Literature of the Field: Atlantic History     Introduces students to the major themes, scholarly approaches, and sources for Atlantic history.            HIST-GA.2002 The Atlantic Economy in the Early Modern World     This colloquium looks at the wide range of factors (i.e., historical circumstances, personal initiative, resources allocation, slave labor, technological innovation, market formation, etc.) that created and sustained the early modern Atlantic economy (1350-1800). The course will trace the evolution of the Atlantic economy from the dislocations of the fourteenth century through the reconfiguration of the Atlantic trading environment that followed the American Revolution. Students will examine Portuguese, Spanish, Dutch, French, British (English, Scottish, and Irish), and African contributions, as well as those of diasporic communities such as the Sephardic Jews and French Huguenots. A close study of early-modern commercial life will reveal much about the economic, social, and political arrangements that defined the commercial environment of the Atlantic World.            HIST-GA.2011 Internship Seminar     Seminar setting in which students consider a variety of issues and topics relating to their fieldwork sites and internship venues. Topics include public policy, historic site interpretation, digital humanities, current archival and museological theory, and leadership in cultural institutions. Students complete a 120-hour internship/ practicum at a cooperating archives or public history site, arranged through the program director.            HIST-GA.2016 Institutional Archives &amp; Electronic Records     This course focuses on the concepts, practices, and concerns related to the management of institutional archives, that is, those records documenting an institution itself. Examines the organizational leadership role of the archivist; the records and information needs of businesses, nonprofits, universities, and governments; records management theory and practice; the legal and ethical frameworks for records and archives; and the administration of electronic records programs.            HIST-GA.2034 Research Seminar     Capstone seminar in which students create final projects in the program with a substantial research and writing component. Projects may take the form of historical theses, exhibition designs, historical editing projects, Web-based resources, or historic site interpretations. Class meetings allow students to focus on and discuss research issues.            HIST-GA.2163 Economy and the State in Europe: Debates in Historical Political Economy     This course explores the interrelationship between political and economic structures in Europe, and in the empires controlled by European states, from the seventeenth century to the twentieth. Without any pretentions to comprehensive coverage, the course offers an overview of some major topics and debates in the history of European and global political economy. Among the key questions to be addressed are the following: Why did empire fail to increase the wealth of Spain in the long run while it propelled the Dutch and the English to leading economic and political roles in Europe and globally? Why did parts of Europe pull ahead of the rest of the world in economic development and per capita income, and when did this process begin? How did warfare and revolution create the conditions for the emergence of modern public finance, and how did this financial revolution in turn transform the military capacities and the constitutional configurations of the European states that enacted it? What were the causes of the Industrial Revolution in Britain? Why did this shift not occur at the same time in competing European economies or in world regions with similar endowments? What were the economics of empire in the nineteenth century, and what political economic factors helped produce decolonization? How was European political economy transformed by the two world wars and the depression, and what forms did postwar reconstruction take? What was the political economy of communism in the Soviet Union and the Eastern Bloc, and why did this political and social system collapse? Readings include both classic scholarship and recent work in this field. No background in economics or economic history is assumed, nor will such a background be necessary to participate fully in the course.            HIST-GA.2294 Writing Gender Histories     The focus of this course is the research and writing of gender history. Not only will we discuss the overlap and tensions between the fields of women\u2019s history and gender history, we shall also consider histories of sexuality and the body. Class meetings and readings will emphasize methodologies and practices of gender historical research and writing, including: the definition and delineation of sources (primary, secondary, or hybrid); the challenges of narration; and the process of learning to read our own texts both critically and with attention to internal contradictions and/or silences. Course readings shall cover a range of geographical fields and time periods.          HIST-GA.2555 African Slavery and the Atlantic Slave Trade     This colloquium is designed around a number of provocative readings, including core texts, novels, films, and presentations by Professor Hull and enrolled students. We explore the various dimensions of master-servant relationships in pre-colonial African societies and how they were transformed into more classical forms of human bondage and exploitation. Issues to be examined are slavery and male/ female relationships, slavery and empowerment, and the commoditization of humanity in Africa. We will also consider origins and expansion of the Atlantic slave trade itself and plantation agriculture. We will assess the financing and actual conduct of the slave trade from point of capture, to embarkation, overseas voyage, and finally to the plantations in the Americas. Students will explore how and why this trade began, who financed and operated it, and who in society were its beneficiaries and its victims. We will consider the impact of the slave trades on Africa, the Americas, the Middle East, and on European countries that were directly involved. Finally, students will analyze the motivations and outcomes of efforts in Europe, Africa, and the Americas, to illegalize and ultimately to abolish the slave trade. We will also explore why slavery and the slave trade persisted in Africa and the Middle East until well into the 20th century and why it is re-emerging in many parts of the world today.        This graduate course is open to advanced undergraduate students with permission of Professor Hull.              HIST-GA.2561 Theorizing Race and Slavery      This   colloquium explores racial slavery both as histories and as groundings   for more contemporary studies of race, culture, economies, and power. We   will consider various theoretical models for thinking both about the   problems of race and slavery and about how histories of slavery provide   theoretical models for considerations across the disciplines. The   readings will draw from history, economics, literature, and cultural   studies. The object here is to consider how the subject of slavery is   situated in relation to broader considerations of power, violence, and   identity. My intent is to lay the groundwork for an interdisciplinary   understanding of the black Atlantic. To consider the consequences of   slavery and the slave trade, both historically and contemporarily, on   modern intellectual formations and institutions.          HIST-GA.2606 Human Rights and Humanitarian Perspective     This course will explore the web of good intentions and contradictions surrounding the issue of human rights and \"humanitarian\" interventions. We will begin with selected metanarratives about the history of human rights. We will then read some of the founding documents on which human rights theory rests. Next, we will spend three weeks examining the problems of enforcing human rights by looking closely at the issues of crimes of war, torture, economic and women's rights. We will then turn our attention to the question of genocide and recent efforts both to define and act against it. Here the central cases are Rwanda, Bosnia and Darfur. We shall conclude the class by posing the dilemmas facing liberal interventionism in defense of human rights.            HIST-GA.2707 Social History in Questions: Practices, Proposals and Debates, 1900-2013     Social history has been under attack on many sides for the last three decades. There is a risk here to forget the crucial role it has plaid in the renewal of historical knowledge, thinking, and methods throughout the last century. The course intends to offer a critical approach to some major points of the historiographical debate from the beginning of the 20th century to the present. It offers as well a substantial amount of optional, interdisciplinary readings which will be presented and discussed in class.            HIST-GA.2790 Comparative Social Movements     This course examines a variety of global social movements of the 20th century, including those in South Africa, Argentina, Palestine and the US (civil rights, the Ku Klux Klan, and women's liberation), along with theoretical reading about social movements. It is a research seminar designed to support students in producing a paper related to social movements in their own field of specialization, so the syllabus may change to reflect students' interests.        Social movements have been theorized primarily by social scientists: a typical sociological definition is, episodes of collective behavior and action that aim to create social change and command significant grassroots participation. We will consider these theories but also asking questions of the sorts historians (and thoughtful activists) must ask, such as: what contexts and local histories have engendered social movements? how have social movements constructed identities? have there been entirely apolitical social movements? have there been elite social movements? when and why have social movements become violent? have social movements been inevitably vulnerable to demagoguery and authoritarianism?             HIST-GA.2800 Historical Consciousness in Latin America     This course is an exploration of what can loosely be termed \u201chistorical consciousness\u201d or \u201chistorical imagination,\u201d that is, a broad field of images, sensibilities, conceptions, interpretations, and explanations of history. Aspects of collective memory and representations of the past play a central role in the course, of course, but we will also want to consider broader notions of time, historical process and periodization, and the future as a projection of history. Among the questions at the core of our inquiry will be: why history matters in Latin American culture and politics, and how interpretations of history reflect concerns in the present. Much of the course will look at intellectual and cultural production as well as political ideology in the twentieth century in Latin America. It will address elite as well as popular cultures, and do so from a range of disciplinary perspectives (history, anthropology, cultural studies, sociology, literature).            HIST-GA.2901 Golieb Research Colloquium     The Golieb Research Colloquium is successor to the Legal History Colloquium and continues its unique mission--the training of young scholars rather than the testing of ideas of senior professors. The core of the Golieb Research Colloquium consists of the Samuel I. Golieb Fellows , a group of two or three fledgling academics each year from schools around the United States. Golieb Fellows, who either have completed or are currently completing their graduate work in legal history, have come to NYU from doctoral programs at Cambridge, Columbia, Duke, Harvard, Johns Hopkins, Michigan, Princeton, Rice, Stanford, Virginia, Yale, and other universities. Other participants in the Colloquium have included J.D. students and graduate students at NYU, Fulbright Scholars from Europe, and faculty from NYU Law School and other law schools in the metropolitan region.            HIST-GA.3013 Research in Archives and Public History     This course is an independent study within the Archives and Public History Program.            HIST-GA.3020 Readings in History (P/F)     This course is an independent study (Qualifying Exam Prep).            HIST-GA.3021 Research in History     This course is an independent study.

HIST-GA.3115 Medieval Jewish History     A survey of landmark modern treatments of medieval Jewish history, concentrating on Western Europe and the Jewish communities of Ashkenaz and Sefarad.            HIST-GA.3213 Eastern Europe Workshop     This 2-credit course involves discussion of selected readings concerning Eastern Europe, discussion of graduate student papers and current research concerning Eastern Europe, attendance at guest lectures concerning Eastern Europe, and independent research on Eastern Europe guided by the instructor.            HIST-GA.3613 Approaches to Historical Research and Writing II     This course is designed to introduce students to some of the basic methodological and interpretive issues involved in historical research. Based around a core set of readings, the course covers important books and articles that explicitly deal with questions of method, as well as examples of certain methodologies or schools of historiography in action. The goal of this course is to help the student produce a research paper that is of potentially publishable quality and to reveal that the student is capable of doing graduate level research and writing.            HIST-GA.3803 Atlantic History Workshop     Introduces students to the major themes and scholarly approaches of Atlantic history. Readings will include works on cultural interactions, trade and commodities, Atlantic diasporas, comparative imperial histories, legal encounters and trends, labor regimes, and rebellion and revolution. Students will be responsible for extensive weekly readings and short papers, as well as a longer paper on the historiography of a particular problem in Atlantic history.              HIST-GA.3902 \"A Modern Mediterranean Region: Myth or Reality\"     Examines major political, cultural, and social trends of the region during the past two centuries, focusing on whether it is correct to locate these developments as particularly \u201cMediterranean\u201d or not.
