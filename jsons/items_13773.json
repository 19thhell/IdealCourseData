They will gain skills in modern  valuation techniques, including the use of the zero-coupon curve, duration  and convexity, option-adjusted spreads and the discount margin method for  floating-rate notes. They will learn about Treasuries, corporates and floating-rate  notes, about callable bonds and mortgage-backed securities, and about swap  valuation and trading..       Instructor        Ian Giddy has  taught finance at NYU, Columbia, Wharton, Chicago and abroad for the past  nineteen years. He was Director of International Fixed Income Research at  Drexel Burnham Lambert from 1986 to 1989. The author of more than fifty articles  on international finance, he has served at the International Monetary Fund  and the U.S. Treasury and has been a consultant with numerous financial institutions  and corporations in the U.S. and abroad. He is the author or co-author of   The International Money Market , The Handbook of International Finance ,   Cases in International Finance Global Financial Markets   and The Hudson River Waterway Guide.       Pedagogy       The course employs cases and problems as well as classroom lectures and  discussions and a bond portfolio management simulation and a swap negotiation  exercise. We will make use of international as well as domestic examples.  Each student will be expected to participate actively in class discussion.  There will be a final exam.       Textbook       Frank J. Fabozzi, Bond Markets, Analysis and Strategies , 3rd  Ed, (Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall, 1995). A supplementary book is  Frank J. Fabozzi, ed., The Handbook of Fixed Income Securities ,  3rd edition (Homewood, Il: Business One-Irwin, 1991). The latter book can  serve as a standard reference source beyond the course. For short term fixed  income securities, get Instruments of the Money Marke t, published  by the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond; or Dufey and Giddy, The International  Money Market (Prentice-Hall, 1994). Additional readings will be made   available in a readings package.       Students should have read the assignments before coming to class. Material  covered in the assigned textbook readings will generally not be repeated  in class. Rather, class time will be devoted to lecture and case discussion,  applying the material covered in the readings.       Portfolio Management Simulation       Each student will manage a hypothetical portfolio of bonds during the  course. Selections must be made from a list to be provided by the instructor.  The goal will be to beat a passive portfolio. Students will apply the concepts  learned in the course to select which bonds to buy and which to sell, and  to evaluate the interest rate sensitivity of the portfolio. It might help  to read Fabozzi, \"Active Bond Portfolio Management.\"       Software       Students will be provided with software to assist in the valuation of  Treasury bonds, callable and putable corporate bonds, swaps and swaptions.       Swap Negotiation Exercise       Teams representing different banks will negotiate a swap with one another.  This swap negotiation exercise is designed to emphasize the mechanics and  principles of interest rate swaps and currency swaps.       Grading       The course grade will be determined as follows: Class Participation 10%,  Portfolio Assignment 10%, Swap Negotiation 10%, Problems 30%, Final Examination  40%.

They will gain skills in modern  valuation techniques, including the use of the zero-coupon curve, duration  and convexity, option-adjusted spreads and the discount margin method for  floating-rate notes. They will learn about Treasuries, corporates and floating-rate  notes, about callable bonds and mortgage-backed securities, and about swap  valuation and trading..       Instructor        Ian Giddy has  taught finance at NYU, Columbia, Wharton, Chicago and abroad for the past  nineteen years. He was Director of International Fixed Income Research at  Drexel Burnham Lambert from 1986 to 1989. The author of more than fifty articles  on international finance, he has served at the International Monetary Fund  and the U.S. Treasury and has been a consultant with numerous financial institutions  and corporations in the U.S. and abroad. He is the author or co-author of   The International Money Market , The Handbook of International Finance ,   Cases in International Finance Global Financial Markets   and The Hudson River Waterway Guide.       Pedagogy       The course employs cases and problems as well as classroom lectures and  discussions and a bond portfolio management simulation and a swap negotiation  exercise. We will make use of international as well as domestic examples.  Each student will be expected to participate actively in class discussion.  There will be a final exam.       Textbook       Frank J. Fabozzi, Bond Markets, Analysis and Strategies , 3rd  Ed, (Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall, 1995). A supplementary book is  Frank J. Fabozzi, ed., The Handbook of Fixed Income Securities ,  3rd edition (Homewood, Il: Business One-Irwin, 1991). The latter book can  serve as a standard reference source beyond the course. For short term fixed  income securities, get Instruments of the Money Marke t, published  by the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond; or Dufey and Giddy, The International  Money Market (Prentice-Hall, 1994). Additional readings will be made   available in a readings package.       Students should have read the assignments before coming to class. Material  covered in the assigned textbook readings will generally not be repeated  in class. Rather, class time will be devoted to lecture and case discussion,  applying the material covered in the readings.       Portfolio Management Simulation       Each student will manage a hypothetical portfolio of bonds during the  course. Selections must be made from a list to be provided by the instructor.  The goal will be to beat a passive portfolio. Students will apply the concepts  learned in the course to select which bonds to buy and which to sell, and  to evaluate the interest rate sensitivity of the portfolio. It might help  to read Fabozzi, \"Active Bond Portfolio Management.\"       Software       Students will be provided with software to assist in the valuation of  Treasury bonds, callable and putable corporate bonds, swaps and swaptions.       Swap Negotiation Exercise       Teams representing different banks will negotiate a swap with one another.  This swap negotiation exercise is designed to emphasize the mechanics and  principles of interest rate swaps and currency swaps.       Grading       The course grade will be determined as follows: Class Participation 10%,  Portfolio Assignment 10%, Swap Negotiation 10%, Problems 30%, Final Examination  40%.

He is the author or co-author of   The International Money Market , The Handbook of International Finance ,   Cases in International Finance Global Financial Markets   and The Hudson River Waterway Guide.       Pedagogy       The course employs cases and problems as well as classroom lectures and  discussions and a bond portfolio management simulation and a swap negotiation  exercise. We will make use of international as well as domestic examples.  Each student will be expected to participate actively in class discussion.  There will be a final exam.       Textbook       Frank J. Fabozzi, Bond Markets, Analysis and Strategies , 3rd  Ed, (Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall, 1995). A supplementary book is  Frank J. Fabozzi, ed., The Handbook of Fixed Income Securities ,  3rd edition (Homewood, Il: Business One-Irwin, 1991). The latter book can  serve as a standard reference source beyond the course. For short term fixed  income securities, get Instruments of the Money Marke t, published  by the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond; or Dufey and Giddy, The International  Money Market (Prentice-Hall, 1994). Additional readings will be made   available in a readings package.       Students should have read the assignments before coming to class. Material  covered in the assigned textbook readings will generally not be repeated  in class. Rather, class time will be devoted to lecture and case discussion,  applying the material covered in the readings.       Portfolio Management Simulation       Each student will manage a hypothetical portfolio of bonds during the  course. Selections must be made from a list to be provided by the instructor.  The goal will be to beat a passive portfolio. Students will apply the concepts  learned in the course to select which bonds to buy and which to sell, and  to evaluate the interest rate sensitivity of the portfolio. It might help  to read Fabozzi, \"Active Bond Portfolio Management.\"       Software       Students will be provided with software to assist in the valuation of  Treasury bonds, callable and putable corporate bonds, swaps and swaptions.       Swap Negotiation Exercise       Teams representing different banks will negotiate a swap with one another.  This swap negotiation exercise is designed to emphasize the mechanics and  principles of interest rate swaps and currency swaps.       Grading       The course grade will be determined as follows: Class Participation 10%,  Portfolio Assignment 10%, Swap Negotiation 10%, Problems 30%, Final Examination  40%.
