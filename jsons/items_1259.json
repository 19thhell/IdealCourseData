I also work beyond the French tradition\u2014on medieval Europe in general, and on the Eastern Mediterranean and Middle East. I have drawn on various kinds of theory, in particular, narratology, in order to grasp medieval plot structures. I have worked on the complex relations between oral and written tradition (often a two-way street!). Much of my recent work deals with the performance of medieval narrative: drawing on evidence from the texts, manuscript tradition, and historical documents, I attempt to reconstruct performance possibilities of medieval epics, romances, and tales. (I also teach an UG course that is like an ongoing workshop: talented students perform all the works they read and study; many clips are available on my performance websites; I thus also work in the Digital Humanities.) Currently, I am also working on theories of cognition, as well as on the representation and role of the emotions in medieval literature. For example, how do various medieval genres differ in their handling of the emotions of the characters and in the emotional responses elicited from audiences? The general purpose of my scholarly work is, I would say, to make sense of the Middle Ages\u2014both other and (as it were) us.

I also work beyond the French tradition\u2014on medieval Europe in general, and on the Eastern Mediterranean and Middle East. I have drawn on various kinds of theory, in particular, narratology, in order to grasp medieval plot structures. I have worked on the complex relations between oral and written tradition (often a two-way street!). Much of my recent work deals with the performance of medieval narrative: drawing on evidence from the texts, manuscript tradition, and historical documents, I attempt to reconstruct performance possibilities of medieval epics, romances, and tales. (I also teach an UG course that is like an ongoing workshop: talented students perform all the works they read and study; many clips are available on my performance websites; I thus also work in the Digital Humanities.) Currently, I am also working on theories of cognition, as well as on the representation and role of the emotions in medieval literature. For example, how do various medieval genres differ in their handling of the emotions of the characters and in the emotional responses elicited from audiences? The general purpose of my scholarly work is, I would say, to make sense of the Middle Ages\u2014both other and (as it were) us.
