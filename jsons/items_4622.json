In studying interaction and conflict in specific locations, he became increasingly interested in the shifting nature of colonial thinking and practices that went into these processes. This new direction led to a book on the relationship of social change and conflict to decolonization in French and British Africa as well as a comparative project begun in the late 1980s with anthropologist Ann Stoler. Cooper and Stoler organized an international conference on colonialism in 1989 and published an edited book, Tensions of Empire, in 1997. Cooper's interest in social theory led him to write a series of articles critical of some of the key concepts widely used in the social sciences and humanities\u2013identity, modernity, and globalization. These and other essays have been collected in his book Colonialism in Question; he also edited with Randall Packard a book on development and the social sciences. Meanwhile, another track was developing, this one coming out of teaching at the University of Michigan (1982-2001) and since then at NYU. Having for many years taught courses not only on Africa, but on social theory, colonialism, and other broad topics, he began to collaborate with Jane Burbank on a graduate course that sought to counter both the national and the modern bias of most historical studies, via a study of the most durable form of political organization in world history\u2013empires. After bringing this course to NYU, Cooper and Burbank put together a lecture course on empires for beginning undergraduates through the MAP program. Teaching this course in turn encouraged Cooper and Burbank to write a book on empires in world history, published in 2010. It won the World History Association prize for 2011 and is being translated into five languages. Cooper has continued to do extensive archival research, the fruits of which are going into the book he is currently completing on citizenship in France and French Africa, 1945-1960. He has been a fellow at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences (1990-91, 1995-96, 2002-03), the Wilson Center (1987), the Rockefeller Study Center in Bellagio (2006), the Institut d'Etudes Avanc\u00e9es de Nantes (2009), and the Wissenschaftskolleg in Berlin (2010-11). He has also been a visiting professor at the Ecole des Hautes Etudes en Sciences Sociales, the Ecole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure, and Universit\u00e9 de Paris VII. His work has been supported by National Endowment for the Humanities, Guggenheim, ACLS, and other fellowships. His book From Slaves to Squatters won the Herskovits Prize of the African Studies Association. He was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2001. In 2011 he presented the  annual Marc Bloch lecture at the Ecole des Hautes Etudes en Sciences Sociales and the Thomas Hodgkin Memorial Lecture at Oxford University. In 2012 he delivered the McMillan-Stewart lectures at Harvard University.

There are 42 undergraduate and 39 graduate courses dealing with Africana Studies.     These courses are taught in the following disciplines: Anthropology, cinema studies, comparative literature, economics, English, French, history, journalism, museum studies, performance studies, political science, sociology, as well as Spanish and Portuguese.               Currently, the Africana Studies Program offers a masters degree, as well as a major and a minor for the bachelor's degree.     Also, there is always a small number of Ph.D. dissertations on topics related to Africana Studies.               There are three concentrations in the Africana Studies Program: 1. history, 2. social studies, and 3. philosophy, religion, and the arts.     Within these, Pan-Africanism and Black Urban Studies are given special consideration.               Some faculty members hold joint appointments in Africana Studies and in other departments.

Scope                Languages       Publications in the following languages are acquired: English, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish, and Swahili.                 Geographical Areas       Coverage includes publications on sub-Saharan Africa, North America, the Caribbean, and Latin America.     The regional focus in respect to sub-Saharan Africa is West, East, and Southern Africa.     For Northern African materials consult the Collection Development Policy Statement for Near East Studies.                 Chronological Periods       Coverage of Africana is from sub-Saharan prehistory to the present and from the beginning of slavery in the Americas and the Caribbean to the present situation of Black and African Americans.                           Types of Materials                Included       Monographs, monographic series, serials, proceedings, reprints, microforms, electronic texts, exhibition catalogs, maps, videos, compact discs, and cassette tapes.                 Very Selectively       Newspapers, dissertations, and scores.                 Excluded       Manuscripts, textbooks, and ephemera.                           Strengths &amp; Weaknesses of the Collection          The Library has research level collections in Caribbean and Brazilian Studies.     Well represented are also Ethiopia and the Republic of South Africa.     For the rest of sub-Saharan Africa and in African American Studies, the Library has a study collection level.     A weakness of the collection is Francophone Africa and Francophone Caribbean.               In December 1995, New York University Libraries purchased the collection of the University Place Bookshop which consisted of over 40,000 titles in 80,000 volumes most of which are Africana materials.     These books, periodicals and pamphlets cover a wide range of subjects related to sub-Saharan African, African American, and Caribbean cultures, including literature, art, history, politics, economics, religion, aand sociology.     There are also extensive materials on slavery.     Since many of the items are long out-of-print, the acquisition of this collection has strenghtened the retrospective collection of Africana at the Library considerably.               The Africana collection also includes microforms in the following subjects:     Black literature, 1827-1940; the slave trade, 1858-1892; slavery in ante-bellum southern industries; slavery source materials, and state slavery slavery statutes, 1789-1865.          Another strength of the collection lies in motion pictures from sub-Saharan Africa and the diaspora.      The Africana music collection is especially strong in jazz and Brazilian as well as Caribbean music.           The Fales Collection has a relatively small collection of African American periodicals and monographs which are shelved along with the rest of Fales books.     It also houses separately a collection of African American Avantgarde poems, anthologies and minstrels materials.                     Other Resources          There are two major Africana collections in New York City:     1. The Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture and 2. Columbia University Libraries.               Schomburg's collections include art objects, books, manuscripts, periodicals, newspapers, photographs, prints, recorded music, and sheet music.

In studying interaction and conflict in specific locations, he became increasingly interested in the shifting nature of colonial thinking and practices that went into these processes. This new direction led to a book on the relationship of social change and conflict to decolonization in French and British Africa as well as a comparative project begun in the late 1980s with anthropologist Ann Stoler. Cooper and Stoler organized an international conference on colonialism in 1989 and published an edited book, Tensions of Empire, in 1997. Cooper's interest in social theory led him to write a series of articles critical of some of the key concepts widely used in the social sciences and humanities\u2013identity, modernity, and globalization. These and other essays have been collected in his book Colonialism in Question; he also edited with Randall Packard a book on development and the social sciences. Meanwhile, another track was developing, this one coming out of teaching at the University of Michigan (1982-2001) and since then at NYU. Having for many years taught courses not only on Africa, but on social theory, colonialism, and other broad topics, he began to collaborate with Jane Burbank on a graduate course that sought to counter both the national and the modern bias of most historical studies, via a study of the most durable form of political organization in world history\u2013empires. After bringing this course to NYU, Cooper and Burbank put together a lecture course on empires for beginning undergraduates through the MAP program. Teaching this course in turn encouraged Cooper and Burbank to write a book on empires in world history, published in 2010. It won the World History Association prize for 2011 and is being translated into five languages. Cooper has continued to do extensive archival research, the fruits of which are going into the book he is currently completing on citizenship in France and French Africa, 1945-1960. He has been a fellow at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences (1990-91, 1995-96, 2002-03), the Wilson Center (1987), the Rockefeller Study Center in Bellagio (2006), the Institut d'Etudes Avanc\u00e9es de Nantes (2009), and the Wissenschaftskolleg in Berlin (2010-11). He has also been a visiting professor at the Ecole des Hautes Etudes en Sciences Sociales, the Ecole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure, and Universit\u00e9 de Paris VII. His work has been supported by National Endowment for the Humanities, Guggenheim, ACLS, and other fellowships. His book From Slaves to Squatters won the Herskovits Prize of the African Studies Association. He was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2001. In 2011 he presented the  annual Marc Bloch lecture at the Ecole des Hautes Etudes en Sciences Sociales and the Thomas Hodgkin Memorial Lecture at Oxford University. In 2012 he delivered the McMillan-Stewart lectures at Harvard University.

These courses are taught in the following disciplines: Anthropology, cinema studies, comparative literature, economics, English, French, history, journalism, museum studies, performance studies, political science, sociology, as well as Spanish and Portuguese.               Currently, the Africana Studies Program offers a masters degree, as well as a major and a minor for the bachelor's degree.     Also, there is always a small number of Ph.D. dissertations on topics related to Africana Studies.               There are three concentrations in the Africana Studies Program: 1. history, 2. social studies, and 3. philosophy, religion, and the arts.     Within these, Pan-Africanism and Black Urban Studies are given special consideration.               Some faculty members hold joint appointments in Africana Studies and in other departments.     In addition, there are several faculty members with interest in Africana Studies who teach courses in this field.

Scope                Languages       Publications in the following languages are acquired: English, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish, and Swahili.                 Geographical Areas       Coverage includes publications on sub-Saharan Africa, North America, the Caribbean, and Latin America.     The regional focus in respect to sub-Saharan Africa is West, East, and Southern Africa.     For Northern African materials consult the Collection Development Policy Statement for Near East Studies.                 Chronological Periods       Coverage of Africana is from sub-Saharan prehistory to the present and from the beginning of slavery in the Americas and the Caribbean to the present situation of Black and African Americans.                           Types of Materials                Included       Monographs, monographic series, serials, proceedings, reprints, microforms, electronic texts, exhibition catalogs, maps, videos, compact discs, and cassette tapes.                 Very Selectively       Newspapers, dissertations, and scores.                 Excluded       Manuscripts, textbooks, and ephemera.                           Strengths &amp; Weaknesses of the Collection          The Library has research level collections in Caribbean and Brazilian Studies.     Well represented are also Ethiopia and the Republic of South Africa.     For the rest of sub-Saharan Africa and in African American Studies, the Library has a study collection level.     A weakness of the collection is Francophone Africa and Francophone Caribbean.               In December 1995, New York University Libraries purchased the collection of the University Place Bookshop which consisted of over 40,000 titles in 80,000 volumes most of which are Africana materials.     These books, periodicals and pamphlets cover a wide range of subjects related to sub-Saharan African, African American, and Caribbean cultures, including literature, art, history, politics, economics, religion, aand sociology.     There are also extensive materials on slavery.     Since many of the items are long out-of-print, the acquisition of this collection has strenghtened the retrospective collection of Africana at the Library considerably.               The Africana collection also includes microforms in the following subjects:     Black literature, 1827-1940; the slave trade, 1858-1892; slavery in ante-bellum southern industries; slavery source materials, and state slavery slavery statutes, 1789-1865.          Another strength of the collection lies in motion pictures from sub-Saharan Africa and the diaspora.      The Africana music collection is especially strong in jazz and Brazilian as well as Caribbean music.           The Fales Collection has a relatively small collection of African American periodicals and monographs which are shelved along with the rest of Fales books.     It also houses separately a collection of African American Avantgarde poems, anthologies and minstrels materials.                     Other Resources          There are two major Africana collections in New York City:     1. The Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture and 2. Columbia University Libraries.               Schomburg's collections include art objects, books, manuscripts, periodicals, newspapers, photographs, prints, recorded music, and sheet music.     The printed text holdings are especially strong in African, Caribbean and African American literature as well as in the history of the Americas and the New York metropolitan area.     Other foci of the collection are texts on Harlem and Blacks in the performing arts.     The Manuscripts, Archives and Rare Books Division of Schomburg is strongest for the 20th century in the fields of the performing arts, Harlem, African American writers, women, civil rights organizations, historians, scholars, radical political movements, religion, and 18th and 19th century Haitian history.     The Moving Image and Recorded Sound Division holds a strong collection of African American, Caribbean and African popular and traditional music genres, early jazz and tap dance film footage, and public afairs television broadcasts.     The Photographs and Prints Division is strongest in the areas of slavery, Civil War, 19th-century Caribbean and South America, performing and visual arts, modern civil rights movements, religion, military, Harlem, migrant and rural farmers, writers and artists from the Harlem Renaissance period, civic and political leaders worldwide, sports figures and performing artists.               Geographically, Columbia's African collections emphasize Botswana, Lesotho, Swaziland and Zimbabwe as part of a Reasearch Libraries Group assignment.     In general, the following subjects are given special consideration: the arts, economic development, geography, history, law, literature, political science, sociology, and anthropology.     Some materials in African languages and Arabic are included.               The Rare Books and Manuscripts Library contains about two hundred books on Africa.     It also holds a Slavery Collection, the Frederick William Holls (1857-1903) papers which relate partly to the South African War, the Sir Henry Rider Haggard (1856-1925), British imperial official in South Africa and novelist) materials, and the Whitney M. Young, Jr. papers (American civil rights leader).
