The temperature of this transition is also measured.

The energy of the   emitted gamma ray is reduced by this recoil energy. However, if the Cobalt   is placed in a crystalline lattice that meets certain conditions, this   recoil can be prevented entirely, and photons with incredibly precise   energies can be generated. In this experiment,   students use the phenomenon of Resonance Fluorescense and the Doppler   shift to explore these highly accurated photons.

Positively charged muons incident as cosmic rays are detected and stopped in a slab of aluminum. The the positrons that result   from the decay of these muons are also detected. The lifetime of the muon is determined from the distribution of delay times   between muon and positron detection.

If a   constant magnetic field is applied and the particle's   magnetic moment is displaced from the direction from the   magnetic field, the particle will precess about the magnetic field at   what is known   as the Larmor frequency. If a magnetic field rotating at the Larmor   frequency is then applied, the particle will experience a constant   magnetic field in its rotating reference frame, and it will precess about   that field as well. Using this technique to orient the spins of   nuclei in various samples, students explore the mechanics of Nuclear   Magnetic Resonance.

An adjustable magnetic field is used to direct electrons emitted from a radioactive source along a semi-circular path   of known radius; the electron momentum spectrum is determined by measuring the number of electrons detected as a function of   magnetic field strength.

The Wavelength is measured using a spectrometer. Students also observe mode hopping in   the laser. With the grating feedback, students can observe the laser's wavelength stability, the frequency sweep, and the sweep   interruptions due to mode hopping. It is also possible to change the external cavity length and measure its effect.

The temperature of this transition is also measured.

The energy of the   emitted gamma ray is reduced by this recoil energy. However, if the Cobalt   is placed in a crystalline lattice that meets certain conditions, this   recoil can be prevented entirely, and photons with incredibly precise   energies can be generated. In this experiment,   students use the phenomenon of Resonance Fluorescense and the Doppler   shift to explore these highly accurated photons.

Positively charged muons incident as cosmic rays are detected and stopped in a slab of aluminum. The the positrons that result   from the decay of these muons are also detected. The lifetime of the muon is determined from the distribution of delay times   between muon and positron detection.

If a   constant magnetic field is applied and the particle's   magnetic moment is displaced from the direction from the   magnetic field, the particle will precess about the magnetic field at   what is known   as the Larmor frequency. If a magnetic field rotating at the Larmor   frequency is then applied, the particle will experience a constant   magnetic field in its rotating reference frame, and it will precess about   that field as well. Using this technique to orient the spins of   nuclei in various samples, students explore the mechanics of Nuclear   Magnetic Resonance.
