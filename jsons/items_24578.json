These experiences will give you the opportunity to apply the knowledge you gain in the classroom to clinical practice. We have relationships with more than 200 hospitals, outpatient centers, rehabilitation facilities, community organizations, schools, and private practices throughout the country, and we will work to place you at sites where you will grow and develop as an occupational therapist.    You will begin your clinical fieldwork rotations in the Fall semester of the 2 nd year. There are 3 Fieldwork I experiences: two in the Fall and one during the Spring. In these Fieldwork I rotations, you will have the opportunity to work with a variety of populations in a variety of settings. Its purpose is to have students connect their academic learning with clinical practice through directed observation and participation in selected aspects of the occupational therapy process.    Upon completion of all coursework, you will participate in two full-time Fieldwork II experiences, where you will be supervised by an Occupational Therapist in your practice. Your direct supervisor(s) will assign you a caseload of patients and clients, and you will be expected to demonstrate progressively higher levels of performance and responsibility as you proceed and gain experience. Fieldwork II is designed to develop competent, entry-level generalist practitioners. Your supervisor will assess your work.    The fieldwork courses are:       OT-GE 2721 Fieldwork I in Occupational Therapy (1 point)    OT-GE 2722 Fieldwork I in Occupational Therapy (1 point)    OT-GE 2703 Fieldwork II in Occupational Therapy (3 points)    OT-GE 2704 Fieldwork II in Occupational Therapy (12 weeks: 3 points)    OT-GE 2705 Fieldwork II in Occupational Therapy (10 weeks: 2 points)       For more information, please contact Alison Rangel-Padilla, academic fieldwork coordinator, at 212-998-5832 or alison.rangel@nyu.edu .       Out-of-State Fieldwork Experience    The Department of Occupational Therapy has relationships with more than 200 fieldwork sites across the country. If an enrolled student is requesting to complete any fieldwork experience outside of New York State, authorization within the specific state may be required prior to completion of the educational activity. Please read NYU&rsquo;s Non-NY State Authorization and Distance Education page on the university&rsquo;s website if you are a considering having a fieldwork experience outside of New York State for a current chart summary of the non-classroom experience restrictions for NYU and additional details.        Information for Host Organizations    Graduate students in the Department of Occupational Therapy are preparing to work as generalist practitioners in the profession. They complete three part-time Fieldwork I experiences during their course of study, and two full-time Fieldwork II experiences at the conclusion of their program. Their fieldwork provides them with an opportunity to apply the knowledge gained in the classroom to clinical practice.    The Department of Occupational Therapy has relationships with more than 200 fieldwork sites across the country. Each year, we place approximately 120 graduate students in a number of those sites. Students intern at hospitals, outpatient centers, rehabilitation facilities, community organizations, schools, and private practices. Our site placements include the New York Presbyterian Hospital, the New York City Department of Education, and the MedStar National Rehabilitation Hospital.    Students begin their Fieldwork I experiences during their second year. Sessions 1 and 2 occur during the fall semester of their second year, and session 3 occurs during the spring semester. In these clinical rotations, students perform observations and participate in selected aspects of the occupational therapy process.    After completing all coursework, students participate in two 12-week full-time Fieldwork II experiences, where they are supervised in their practice of occupational therapy. They are assigned caseloads of patients or clients, and are expected to demonstrate progressively higher levels of performance and responsibility as they proceed through their fieldwork experience. The goal of Fieldwork II is to exhibit entry-level practitioner skills by the end of each 12-week experience for that particular site.    In order to receive NYU fieldwork students, site supervisors work with our academic fieldwork coordinator and clinical placement administrator to establish an affiliation agreement. In addition to this agreement, each site must submit an AOTA data form, establish site-specific objectives for student assessment, and discuss mutual expectations. Each year, the Department of Occupational Therapy offers a seminar for our fieldwork site supervisors to discuss topics of mutual interest. In exchange for providing our students with valuable fieldwork experiences, we also offer site supervisors tuition waivers for courses taken at NYU.

These experiences will give you the opportunity to apply the knowledge you gain in the classroom to clinical practice. We have relationships with more than 200 hospitals, outpatient centers, rehabilitation facilities, community organizations, schools, and private practices throughout the country, and we will work to place you at sites where you will grow and develop as an occupational therapist.    You will begin your clinical fieldwork rotations in the Fall semester of the 2 nd year. There are 3 Fieldwork I experiences: two in the Fall and one during the Spring. In these Fieldwork I rotations, you will have the opportunity to work with a variety of populations in a variety of settings. Its purpose is to have students connect their academic learning with clinical practice through directed observation and participation in selected aspects of the occupational therapy process.    Upon completion of all coursework, you will participate in two full-time Fieldwork II experiences, where you will be supervised by an Occupational Therapist in your practice. Your direct supervisor(s) will assign you a caseload of patients and clients, and you will be expected to demonstrate progressively higher levels of performance and responsibility as you proceed and gain experience. Fieldwork II is designed to develop competent, entry-level generalist practitioners. Your supervisor will assess your work.    The fieldwork courses are:       OT-GE 2721 Fieldwork I in Occupational Therapy (1 point)    OT-GE 2722 Fieldwork I in Occupational Therapy (1 point)    OT-GE 2703 Fieldwork II in Occupational Therapy (3 points)    OT-GE 2704 Fieldwork II in Occupational Therapy (12 weeks: 3 points)    OT-GE 2705 Fieldwork II in Occupational Therapy (10 weeks: 2 points)       For more information, please contact Alison Rangel-Padilla, academic fieldwork coordinator, at 212-998-5832 or alison.rangel@nyu.edu .       Out-of-State Fieldwork Experience    The Department of Occupational Therapy has relationships with more than 200 fieldwork sites across the country. If an enrolled student is requesting to complete any fieldwork experience outside of New York State, authorization within the specific state may be required prior to completion of the educational activity. Please read NYU&rsquo;s Non-NY State Authorization and Distance Education page on the university&rsquo;s website if you are a considering having a fieldwork experience outside of New York State for a current chart summary of the non-classroom experience restrictions for NYU and additional details.        Information for Host Organizations    Graduate students in the Department of Occupational Therapy are preparing to work as generalist practitioners in the profession. They complete three part-time Fieldwork I experiences during their course of study, and two full-time Fieldwork II experiences at the conclusion of their program. Their fieldwork provides them with an opportunity to apply the knowledge gained in the classroom to clinical practice.    The Department of Occupational Therapy has relationships with more than 200 fieldwork sites across the country. Each year, we place approximately 120 graduate students in a number of those sites. Students intern at hospitals, outpatient centers, rehabilitation facilities, community organizations, schools, and private practices. Our site placements include the New York Presbyterian Hospital, the New York City Department of Education, and the MedStar National Rehabilitation Hospital.    Students begin their Fieldwork I experiences during their second year. Sessions 1 and 2 occur during the fall semester of their second year, and session 3 occurs during the spring semester. In these clinical rotations, students perform observations and participate in selected aspects of the occupational therapy process.    After completing all coursework, students participate in two 12-week full-time Fieldwork II experiences, where they are supervised in their practice of occupational therapy. They are assigned caseloads of patients or clients, and are expected to demonstrate progressively higher levels of performance and responsibility as they proceed through their fieldwork experience. The goal of Fieldwork II is to exhibit entry-level practitioner skills by the end of each 12-week experience for that particular site.    In order to receive NYU fieldwork students, site supervisors work with our academic fieldwork coordinator and clinical placement administrator to establish an affiliation agreement. In addition to this agreement, each site must submit an AOTA data form, establish site-specific objectives for student assessment, and discuss mutual expectations. Each year, the Department of Occupational Therapy offers a seminar for our fieldwork site supervisors to discuss topics of mutual interest. In exchange for providing our students with valuable fieldwork experiences, we also offer site supervisors tuition waivers for courses taken at NYU.

The fieldwork courses are:       OT-GE 2721 Fieldwork I in Occupational Therapy (1 point)    OT-GE 2722 Fieldwork I in Occupational Therapy (1 point)    OT-GE 2703 Fieldwork II in Occupational Therapy (3 points)    OT-GE 2704 Fieldwork II in Occupational Therapy (12 weeks: 3 points)    OT-GE 2705 Fieldwork II in Occupational Therapy (10 weeks: 2 points)       For more information, please contact Alison Rangel-Padilla, academic fieldwork coordinator, at 212-998-5832 or alison.rangel@nyu.edu .       Out-of-State Fieldwork Experience    The Department of Occupational Therapy has relationships with more than 200 fieldwork sites across the country. If an enrolled student is requesting to complete any fieldwork experience outside of New York State, authorization within the specific state may be required prior to completion of the educational activity. Please read NYU&rsquo;s Non-NY State Authorization and Distance Education page on the university&rsquo;s website if you are a considering having a fieldwork experience outside of New York State for a current chart summary of the non-classroom experience restrictions for NYU and additional details.        Information for Host Organizations    Graduate students in the Department of Occupational Therapy are preparing to work as generalist practitioners in the profession. They complete three part-time Fieldwork I experiences during their course of study, and two full-time Fieldwork II experiences at the conclusion of their program. Their fieldwork provides them with an opportunity to apply the knowledge gained in the classroom to clinical practice.    The Department of Occupational Therapy has relationships with more than 200 fieldwork sites across the country. Each year, we place approximately 120 graduate students in a number of those sites. Students intern at hospitals, outpatient centers, rehabilitation facilities, community organizations, schools, and private practices. Our site placements include the New York Presbyterian Hospital, the New York City Department of Education, and the MedStar National Rehabilitation Hospital.    Students begin their Fieldwork I experiences during their second year. Sessions 1 and 2 occur during the fall semester of their second year, and session 3 occurs during the spring semester. In these clinical rotations, students perform observations and participate in selected aspects of the occupational therapy process.    After completing all coursework, students participate in two 12-week full-time Fieldwork II experiences, where they are supervised in their practice of occupational therapy. They are assigned caseloads of patients or clients, and are expected to demonstrate progressively higher levels of performance and responsibility as they proceed through their fieldwork experience. The goal of Fieldwork II is to exhibit entry-level practitioner skills by the end of each 12-week experience for that particular site.    In order to receive NYU fieldwork students, site supervisors work with our academic fieldwork coordinator and clinical placement administrator to establish an affiliation agreement. In addition to this agreement, each site must submit an AOTA data form, establish site-specific objectives for student assessment, and discuss mutual expectations. Each year, the Department of Occupational Therapy offers a seminar for our fieldwork site supervisors to discuss topics of mutual interest. In exchange for providing our students with valuable fieldwork experiences, we also offer site supervisors tuition waivers for courses taken at NYU.
