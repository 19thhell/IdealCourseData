In his discovery of the symbol making function within the human psyche, Jung offers a possible answer. Variously described as the religious, imaginative or creative instinct, this psychological function offers the possibility of losing and finding multiple meanings throughout the cycles of life. We begin by defining pre modern, post modern and post secular within their historical context with special attention to the role of language. We identify the influences that shaped Jung\u2019s discovery, focusing on the classical elements that characterize a religious experience. Finally, we look to figures in the history of culture that have lost and found meaning, Jung himself in his Red Book and the Buddha.

How, then, is religious belief still possible? Under the conditions of postmodernity, religious questions and themes about God, the good life, suffering and evil, and what being \u201chuman\u201d means have been reclaimed and given new expression. This is the subject of this course. Most authors who might be situated as religiously postmodern write out of the Jewish and Christian traditions, for the postmodern situation arose out of those traditions. But wouldn\u2019t a consistent postmodern ethic be one that seriously engages \u201creligious\u201d perspectives outside the scope of these Abrahamic traditions? Affirming this, we\u2019ll also read Buddhist thinkers who employed philosophical therapies that exposed the error of assigning permanence where it does not reside, as in one\u2019s self. The problem of suffering associated with reified thinking\u2014turning processes into \u201cthings\u201d\u2014will serve as one guiding theme throughout our class. Other topics include: God without being; ethics without metaphysical foundations; the secular as sacred; mysticism of \u201cunsaying;\u201d deconstruction and\u00a0 shunyata \u00a0(emptiness) as shared ways of reading texts and seeing the self and world as both impermanent and interdependent. To help identify some roles that power and transformation play in postmodern religious thought, this class will collaborate and share some readings with Bradley Lewis\u2019s Foucault: Biopolitics and the Care of the Self. Course readings include: John Caputo, Derrida, Epictetus, Pierre Hadot, Thich Nhat Hahn, Heidegger, Irigaray, Kierkegaard, Levinas, David Loy, Jean-Luc Marion, Nagarjuna, Nietzsche, Nishitani, Shunyru Suzuki, and Gianni Vattimo.
