Maybe you went to your local Duane Reade/CVS/RiteAid to pick up an over-the-counter drug. You might have debated over a brand name versus a generic, or what was covered by your insurance, but the whole process probably didn\u2019t cause you too much anxiety. You probably don\u2019t stop to think if your provider was able to prescribe that medication in the first place, if it was stored properly, or if those meds might even be a useless or possibly harmful counterfeit.   Now, place yourself in another setting. You know you need some medication and you walk into a pharmacy. \u00a0The shelves are pretty dusty and filled will medications, labeled and unlabeled. You describe what\u2019s wrong to the guy behind the counter. He listens, and cuts off some tablets from a larger foil-wrapped strip. \u201cTake these twice a day for one week,\u201d he says. Are you thinking about some of those questions now?   For pharmaceutical companies, the developing world is an untapped market that is poised for growth. Recent developments, such as a landmark decision by India\u2019s Supreme Court to reject a patent application for a cancer drug made by Novartis, seem to be protecting generic manufacturer\u2019s ability to continue making low cost drugs available to this market. Other companies are trying to make their products available at competitive prices (the latest example: two name-brand HPV vaccines are now available for less than $5 per dose ).   Creating a reliable pharmaceutical regulatory and distribution system hasn\u2019t been a particularly trendy or popular priority in global health and development. But, as the focus around international aid shifts increasingly toward ownership and sustainability, it\u2019s increasingly important to ensure that people can access high-quality, affordable medicines outside of donor-funded supply chains.
