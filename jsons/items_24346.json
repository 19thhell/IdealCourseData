NYU faculty member Gustave Reese was one of the founding members of The American Musicological Society in 1934, and by mid-century the department had attracted a world-renowned group of scholars and musicians, from the pioneering musicologist Curt Sachs to composers of both concert and popular music such as Marion Bauer and Percy Grainger. Building on this legacy, the Department established its ethnomusicology sub-field in 1978, and a composition and theory sub-field in 1992. It has since grown into one of the country\u2019s most exciting, intellectually vibrant centers for the interdisciplinary study of music and sound. The NYU Department of Music offers studies in historical musicology, ethnomusicology, and composition and theory at both the undergraduate and graduate levels. With its leading research faculty, the Department grants degrees of Bachelor of Arts and Doctor of Philosophy. The Department also sponsors a colloquium series, musical ensembles, graduate and undergraduate concerts, the Washington Square Contemporary Music Society concert series, and a range of interdisciplinary symposia/conferences.

Our curriculum is designed for the serious young musician who is seeking a program that fully integrates the study of voice with the study of acting. We are committed to the traditions of classically-based vocal training while at the same time allowing students to explore the demanding repertoire that is expected of professional singers in today's ever-expanding world of music theatre performance.    In addition to voice, acting and dance, as well as courses in music theatre repertoire and history, the core of our program's music theatre specialization training takes place through an intensive series of music theatre workshops. These workshops explore such critical areas as movement, speech, diction, song study, scene study, audition skills, and business skills - the essential \"tools of the trade\" that a young artist needs in order to pursue a professional career.    In addition to the work in classrooms and studios, the program offers performance opportunities in fully-staged productions under the guidance of professional directors, choreographers, conductors, musical directors, and designers. Our guest artists and faculty are drawn from New York's vibrant community of professional artists who count Broadway, off-Broadway, regional theatre and national tours among their credits.    Students specializing in Music Theatre make their New York \"debut\" in their final semester as they are presented to New York's agents, casting directors, directors, and producers in their graduation showcase - a revue designed to feature the work of each student and help them make their first professional contacts in the industry.    The Department's acclaimed programs of study in Music Business (B.M., M.A.), Music Technology (B.M., M.M., Ph.D.), Jazz (B.M., M.M., Ph.D.), Music Composition (B.M., M.M., Ph.D.), and Music Education (B.M., M.A., Ph.D.) provide a rich and valuable array of elective courses for music performance majors that prepare them for an ever-changing music industry and musical climate. Undergraduate and graduate students also benefit from the extraordinary opportunities available through the diverse offerings of a major university in the cultural capital of the world, New York City.

Our curriculum is designed for the serious young musician who is seeking a program that fully integrates the study of voice with the study of acting. We are committed to the traditions of classically-based vocal training while at the same time allowing students to explore the demanding repertoire that is expected of professional singers in today's ever-expanding world of music theatre performance.    In addition to voice, acting and dance, as well as courses in music theatre repertoire and history, the core of our program's music theatre specialization training takes place through an intensive series of music theatre workshops. These workshops explore such critical areas as movement, speech, diction, song study, scene study, audition skills, and business skills - the essential \"tools of the trade\" that a young artist needs in order to pursue a professional career.    In addition to the work in classrooms and studios, the program offers performance opportunities in fully-staged productions under the guidance of professional directors, choreographers, conductors, musical directors, and designers. Our guest artists and faculty are drawn from New York's vibrant community of professional artists who count Broadway, off-Broadway, regional theatre and national tours among their credits.    Students specializing in Music Theatre make their New York \"debut\" in their final semester as they are presented to New York's agents, casting directors, directors, and producers in their graduation showcase - a revue designed to feature the work of each student and help them make their first professional contacts in the industry.
