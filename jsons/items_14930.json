Management Sciences    Introduction to Data Science for Business Analytics  INFO-GB.2336 (3.0 Credits)  Prof. Foster Provost &amp; Prof. Brian Dalessandro  Prerequisite: INFO-GB.2335 Programming in Python and Fundamentals of Software Development  Specializations: Business Analytics  Equivalency: INFO-GB.3336 Data Mining for Business Analytics    These will be the more-technical sections of the popular Data Mining for Business Analytics course. The fundamental principles taught will be the same, but the students will get more rigorous hands-on experiences. As background, as Business Analytics sees increasing demand, a subset of our MBA students are demanding more and more hands-on, programming-oriented material. On the other hand, there still is a core of more traditionally oriented MBA students who want a more conceptual, managerial treatment.      Management    Inclusive Leadership  MGMT-GB.2100 (1.5 Credits)  Prof. Linda Basch &amp; Prof. Anne Weisberg  Mondays, 6:00-9:00pm  Prerequisite: COR1-GB.1302 Leadership in Organizations  Specializations: Management; Leadership and Change Management    This course is a new version of the Women in Leadership course that was taught in the past. The reason for revising Women and Leadership (and changing the course title to Inclusive Leadership) is to broaden the course audience and to focus on the challenge of leading in an inclusive manner using the example of gender-inclusivity but with relevance to other forms of inclusivity (e.g., race, religion). The course draws attention to the unique capabilities of and challenges faced by women in the workplace. It also offers a model for inclusive leadership that is responsive to the high and increasing levels of diversity in the modern workplace all over the world.    Managing in Creative Industries  MGMT-GB.2309.10 (3.0 Credits)  Prof. Gino Cattani  Thursdays, 6:00-9:00pm  Specializations: SEntertainment, Media &amp; Technology    The purpose of the course is to expose students to the dynamics of creative \u2013 alias cultural \u2013 industries (e.g., art, theatre, music, film, photography, architecture), and to train you to think strategically about the nature of cultural products, what drives their supply and demand, factors that affect their value cultural products and how firms can profit from them. A key feature of these industries is that symbolic and aesthetic attributes are at the core of value creation. This implies that the value of cultural products depends largely on third parties, e.g., critics, dealers, foundations, users, etc. Some of these parties act as powerful gatekeepers as they control critical resources firms need to produce cultural products. Like the industries we will study, the course will be fast-paced, challenging and exciting.      Marketing    Data Driven Decision Making: Managerial  MKTG-GB.2344 (3.0 Credits)  Prof. Vishal Singh  Prerequisite: COR1-GB.1305 Statistics and Data Analysis  Specializations: Marketing; Product Management  Equivalency: MKTG-GB.2354 Data-Driven Decision Making: Technical    In every aspect of our lives, from the way we work, shop, or communicate we are consuming and creating vast amounts of information. These activities create a trail of digitized data that is being stored, mined, and analyzed by firms hoping to create valuable business intelligence. However, much of the promise of such data gathering has failed to materialize because managers find it difficult to translate data into actionable strategies. This course is designed to fill this gap by training you with tools for managerial decision making. Focus will be on applications and interpretation of results rather than the mathematical/statistical properties of techniques. Applications include various aspects of marketing decision making such as segmentation, forecasting demand, designing new products, and data mining.    Business &amp; Society    Global Markets, Human Rights and the Press  BSPA-GB.3105 (formerly INTA-GB.3105) (1.5 Credits)  Prof. Michael H. Posner    This seminar is designed to be a provocative exploration of normative differences. Its premise is that the leader of a global enterprise must confront, understand, and reconcile the ethical and cultural complexities and tensions at work in the world. Its objective is to bring students to a heightened, more nuanced understanding of the interplay of global forces and local norms. This seminar draws upon research, trade books, press readings, etc. Students will develop an appreciation for the intricacies of operating in a global environment, recognizing the unique elements of national character, government structures, and local normative frameworks. This seminar will benefit from the insights of Maria Bartiromo and Michael Posner, who will be present in each session to share insights.    Corporate Turnarounds and Leadership  BSPA-GB.3362 (formerly INTA-GB.3362) (3.0 Credits)  Prof. Karen Brenner    This course examines the opportunity for transformational change emanating from a corporate crisis. How does senior management change an organization in response to dramatic changes in circumstances? Too often, managers and corporate boards fail to recognize factors that threaten the firm's business until its survival is in doubt. In such cases, the board of directors and management may need to implement drastic and sudden changes in several aspects of the firm. An important aspect of the course is the role of leadership in creating a transformational opportunity resulting from a crisis. The course is relevant for students who anticipate working in any operating company or in a firm advising or interacting with such a company- including consultants, venture capital and private equity professionals, activist fund managers, and bankers.      Fall 2015 By-Permission Only Courses     Finance    Managing Investment Funds  FINC-GB.3320.20 (3.0 Credits)  Prof. Anthony Marciano  Tuesdays &amp; Thursdays 12:00-1:20pm  See website for application    Managing Investment Funds is a capstone course that requires students to draw on their knowledge of finance as well as macroeconomics, accounting, competitive analysis, strategy, marketing and other fields to manage a $1.5 million endowment fund held by New York University. In addition to honing their analytical skills, by organizing all activities related to institutional asset management, students gain experience in financial writing and oral presentations, advancing financial decisions in a group setting, and handling all of the governance and fiduciary responsibilities of a university endowment fund. The central mission of this course is for students to learn through having practical, hands on investment management experience. Because of the time requirements in formulating an investment strategy, screening and reviewing prospective stocks, updating the status and performance of existing positions, and all of the ancillary duties connected with the operation of a real, live portfolio, the experiential or hands-on component consumes the bulk of class time. However, a related mission is for students to acquire knowledge about institutional funds management and current industry practices and trends. This more traditional learning experience comes through readings and presentations from industry professionals. The endowment funds under management operate as the Michael Price Student Investment Fund (MPSIF). The Fund began in early 2000 thanks to a generous gift from Michael F. Price.      Information, Operations &amp; Management Sciences    OPS in ENT: Las Vegas  OPMG-GB.2313.0A (3.0 Credits)  Prof. Harry Chernoff  NYC dates: 1/5, 1/7 &amp; 1/27; Las Vegas dates: 1/10-1/15  See syllabus for application    When we think of entertainment, perhaps the most popular location that comes to mind is Las Vegas. Behind the glitter and excitement in Las Vegas are industries dedicated to supplying entertainment to customers. Operations address the supply side of business, including how products are produced and how services are supplied. This course goes behind the scenes in Las Vegas to observe and analyze the operations involved in performing this supply function. This course presents an opportunity to observe and study the entertainment industry including strategy formation and decision-making that are quite unique. The entertainment comes in various forms. The underlying driver is certainly gaming, but the industries surrounding the various forms of gambling have become major profit centers separate from the millions made on the casino floors. During a one-week visit to Las Vegas, students will observe and study some of the major operating industries that comprise the broad scope of entertainment in this city. Although the Operations Management models, techniques and strategies in this field are applicable anywhere, Las Vegas is the epicenter of the industry.      Management    Global Social Impact Strategy  MGMT-GB.2366.10 (1.5 Credits)  Prof. Jill Kickul  NYC pre-trip sessions TBD; Field work in Guatemala Jan 3-15, 2016  See syllabus for application    The International Social Impact Strategies course is designed to help students gain actionable insights into the nexus between economic and social value creation in an international context. Specifically, the purpose of ISIS is to provide students with hands-on exposure to the entrepreneurial pursuit of social impact in a developing economy. As a result of this course, students will gain: Increased ability to recognize and critically assess various forms of social enterprise and base-of-the-pyramid strategies as tools of poverty alleviation, economic development, and social transformation. Greater understanding of the challenges of growing and sustaining a social enterprise, as well as special insights into enterprise development in a developing economy. Improved consulting skills, including project planning, issue analysis, formulation of strategic and tactical recommendations, and client relationship management. While exploring these developing countries first hand, students will learn about local history, culture, economy, politics, social change, sustainable development, and entrepreneurship. By participating in the course, students will be better able to adapt and apply business skills and academic disciplines in the social sector, and will have increased skills for effective and thoughtful leadership in business and society throughout their careers.    Consulting Practice  MGMT-GB.3105.10 (1.5 Credits)  Prof. Sonia Marciano  Tuesday 6:00-9:00pm  See website for application    The objective of the Consulting Approach Class will be to learn how to solve a complex problem/case from problem definition to final client presentation. Emphasis will be on tools as well as real life situations / war stories. Students will work in groups, but will use blogs and other tools to interact with each other and professor. Students should walk out confident of their problem solving abilities, whether they work as consultants or use the techniques in other careers.    Business and Society    Sustainable Food Business  BSPA-GB.2306.10 (3.0 Credits)  Prof. Hans Taparia  Thursdays, 6:45-9:25pm  See syllabus for application    This course sees the free market as an opportunity to drive change in the food supply chain, leading to better public health outcomes, and even to serve as a catalyst for policy. As Gary Hirshberg, the founder of Stonyfield, states, \u201cwe exercise our vote with how we shop.\u201d This course will make the case that the market for food is still highly inefficient, often monopolistic at times, and that choice is still limited and hard to fulfill\u2014all this against a backdrop where consumer demand for healthier food options is growing dramatically. This is not to suggest that by simply offering healthier food options, consumers will choose them. Several recent studies have shown that this does not automatically happen [8]. After all, food choices are based on a variety of factors including taste preferences, cost effectiveness, ease of availability and brand image and messaging. This is where social entrepreneurs can play a pivotal role. Through a mix of passion, persistence, vision, innovation and marketing savvy, social entrepreneurs can develop and market desirable products and services that capitalize on this need-gap. They can create new choices, serve as economic engines and drive positive public health outcomes all at the same time.      Summer 2015 Course Announcements     Management    Consulting Practice: Process and Problem Solving (in conjunction with the Stern Consulting Corps)  MGMT-GB.3105.60 (1.5 Credits)  Prof. Sonia Marciano &amp; Prof. Keshava Dasarathy  Wednesdays 6:00-9:00pm, 5/13-6/17  See Office of Student Engagement website for information and application    This seminar investigates the role of cities in providing services to constituents and asks how characteristics such as form of governance, form of financing, labor relations, interlocal cooperation and competition, and state/local relationships affect the quantity and quality of service delivery. We will consider the extent to which cities should offer particular services, the ways of paying for those services, and various governance structures for deciding among these alternatives. We will consider the causes and consequences of fiscal distress that may interfere with service provision, and the role of different institutions in avoiding and alleviating local fiscal distress. In making these inquiries, we will often evaluate cities (which are formally known as \u201cmunicipal corporations\u201d) as economic units not unlike publicly held corporations, with \u201cshareholders\u201d (voters), a \u201cboard of directors\u201d (mayor and city council), and \u201cproduct lines\u201d (street cleaning and maintenance, safety, education, recreation, libraries) that it offers to potential \u201cconsumers\u201d (residents, employers, and employees).

Fall 2015 By-Permission Only Courses     Finance    Managing Investment Funds  FINC-GB.3320.20 (3.0 Credits)  Prof. Anthony Marciano  Tuesdays &amp; Thursdays 12:00-1:20pm  See website for application    Managing Investment Funds is a capstone course that requires students to draw on their knowledge of finance as well as macroeconomics, accounting, competitive analysis, strategy, marketing and other fields to manage a $1.5 million endowment fund held by New York University. In addition to honing their analytical skills, by organizing all activities related to institutional asset management, students gain experience in financial writing and oral presentations, advancing financial decisions in a group setting, and handling all of the governance and fiduciary responsibilities of a university endowment fund. The central mission of this course is for students to learn through having practical, hands on investment management experience. Because of the time requirements in formulating an investment strategy, screening and reviewing prospective stocks, updating the status and performance of existing positions, and all of the ancillary duties connected with the operation of a real, live portfolio, the experiential or hands-on component consumes the bulk of class time. However, a related mission is for students to acquire knowledge about institutional funds management and current industry practices and trends. This more traditional learning experience comes through readings and presentations from industry professionals. The endowment funds under management operate as the Michael Price Student Investment Fund (MPSIF). The Fund began in early 2000 thanks to a generous gift from Michael F. Price.      Information, Operations &amp; Management Sciences    OPS in ENT: Las Vegas  OPMG-GB.2313.0A (3.0 Credits)  Prof. Harry Chernoff  NYC dates: 1/5, 1/7 &amp; 1/27; Las Vegas dates: 1/10-1/15  See syllabus for application    When we think of entertainment, perhaps the most popular location that comes to mind is Las Vegas. Behind the glitter and excitement in Las Vegas are industries dedicated to supplying entertainment to customers. Operations address the supply side of business, including how products are produced and how services are supplied. This course goes behind the scenes in Las Vegas to observe and analyze the operations involved in performing this supply function. This course presents an opportunity to observe and study the entertainment industry including strategy formation and decision-making that are quite unique. The entertainment comes in various forms. The underlying driver is certainly gaming, but the industries surrounding the various forms of gambling have become major profit centers separate from the millions made on the casino floors. During a one-week visit to Las Vegas, students will observe and study some of the major operating industries that comprise the broad scope of entertainment in this city. Although the Operations Management models, techniques and strategies in this field are applicable anywhere, Las Vegas is the epicenter of the industry.      Management    Global Social Impact Strategy  MGMT-GB.2366.10 (1.5 Credits)  Prof. Jill Kickul  NYC pre-trip sessions TBD; Field work in Guatemala Jan 3-15, 2016  See syllabus for application    The International Social Impact Strategies course is designed to help students gain actionable insights into the nexus between economic and social value creation in an international context. Specifically, the purpose of ISIS is to provide students with hands-on exposure to the entrepreneurial pursuit of social impact in a developing economy. As a result of this course, students will gain: Increased ability to recognize and critically assess various forms of social enterprise and base-of-the-pyramid strategies as tools of poverty alleviation, economic development, and social transformation. Greater understanding of the challenges of growing and sustaining a social enterprise, as well as special insights into enterprise development in a developing economy. Improved consulting skills, including project planning, issue analysis, formulation of strategic and tactical recommendations, and client relationship management. While exploring these developing countries first hand, students will learn about local history, culture, economy, politics, social change, sustainable development, and entrepreneurship. By participating in the course, students will be better able to adapt and apply business skills and academic disciplines in the social sector, and will have increased skills for effective and thoughtful leadership in business and society throughout their careers.    Consulting Practice  MGMT-GB.3105.10 (1.5 Credits)  Prof. Sonia Marciano  Tuesday 6:00-9:00pm  See website for application    The objective of the Consulting Approach Class will be to learn how to solve a complex problem/case from problem definition to final client presentation. Emphasis will be on tools as well as real life situations / war stories. Students will work in groups, but will use blogs and other tools to interact with each other and professor. Students should walk out confident of their problem solving abilities, whether they work as consultants or use the techniques in other careers.    Business and Society    Sustainable Food Business  BSPA-GB.2306.10 (3.0 Credits)  Prof. Hans Taparia  Thursdays, 6:45-9:25pm  See syllabus for application    This course sees the free market as an opportunity to drive change in the food supply chain, leading to better public health outcomes, and even to serve as a catalyst for policy. As Gary Hirshberg, the founder of Stonyfield, states, \u201cwe exercise our vote with how we shop.\u201d This course will make the case that the market for food is still highly inefficient, often monopolistic at times, and that choice is still limited and hard to fulfill\u2014all this against a backdrop where consumer demand for healthier food options is growing dramatically. This is not to suggest that by simply offering healthier food options, consumers will choose them. Several recent studies have shown that this does not automatically happen [8]. After all, food choices are based on a variety of factors including taste preferences, cost effectiveness, ease of availability and brand image and messaging. This is where social entrepreneurs can play a pivotal role. Through a mix of passion, persistence, vision, innovation and marketing savvy, social entrepreneurs can develop and market desirable products and services that capitalize on this need-gap. They can create new choices, serve as economic engines and drive positive public health outcomes all at the same time.      Summer 2015 Course Announcements     Management    Consulting Practice: Process and Problem Solving (in conjunction with the Stern Consulting Corps)  MGMT-GB.3105.60 (1.5 Credits)  Prof. Sonia Marciano &amp; Prof. Keshava Dasarathy  Wednesdays 6:00-9:00pm, 5/13-6/17  See Office of Student Engagement website for information and application    This seminar investigates the role of cities in providing services to constituents and asks how characteristics such as form of governance, form of financing, labor relations, interlocal cooperation and competition, and state/local relationships affect the quantity and quality of service delivery. We will consider the extent to which cities should offer particular services, the ways of paying for those services, and various governance structures for deciding among these alternatives. We will consider the causes and consequences of fiscal distress that may interfere with service provision, and the role of different institutions in avoiding and alleviating local fiscal distress. In making these inquiries, we will often evaluate cities (which are formally known as \u201cmunicipal corporations\u201d) as economic units not unlike publicly held corporations, with \u201cshareholders\u201d (voters), a \u201cboard of directors\u201d (mayor and city council), and \u201cproduct lines\u201d (street cleaning and maintenance, safety, education, recreation, libraries) that it offers to potential \u201cconsumers\u201d (residents, employers, and employees).

Rachel Baruch, NYU Gallatin School of Individualized Study                               Rachel Baruch is a sophomore at the NYU Gallatin School of Individualized Study, where she is focusing on neuropsychology and criminology. When Rachel isn't trying to convince her roommate that a diagram of a spliced brain is appropriate living room decor, she can be found developing Jewish pluralistic spaces everyplace she can. Rachel was part of the NYU Bronfman Center team responsible for Chavurah, an award winning, peer-led Jewish learning experience. She is also founder of The Schmooze Project, an online base for the facilitation of inter-denominational connection and conversation that was inspired by her summer spent on the Bronfman Youth Fellowship in Israel.   Rachel speaks English and Hebrew \u2013 the latter proved to be an asset recently when it gave her the ability to lend a hand on Martin Scorsese\u2019s upcoming documentary, \u201cThe New York Review of Books: A 50 Year Argument.\u201d Rachel spent this past summer in Tel Aviv interning as Media &amp; Marketing Manager for Axis Innovation, a company that works on a global scale to connect start ups and investors. Rachel keeps a journal (in an actual notebook!) and is a contributor to the Huffington Post. This year Rachel took the Gallup Strengths Quest, which revealed her top five strengths to be input, learner, communication, responsibility, and individualization. Rachel is excited to contribute her strengths to the NYU Leadership Fellows and the greater NYU community.                                                                                      John Bautista, NYU Steinhardt School of Culture, Education and Human Development                               John Bautista is a junior in the Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development where he studies Media, Culture, and Communication. Originally from Manila, Philippines, John is active in various service initiatives at NYU including the NYU Service Project and Alternative Breaks, where he led a trip to the Dominican Republic to promote education over spring break of his sophomore year. John also currently works as an Admissions Ambassador, giving campus tours to prospective students and parents. He also promotes community building at NYU through his roles as an Orientation Leader and Peer Mentor for new students in Steinhardt and as a Resident Assistant in Broome.   Outside of NYU, John has pursued internships in the non-profit and entertainment industries and has had freelance production experience for theatre and concerts. John is thrilled to be part of the NYU Leadership Fellows. He believes that NYU students are the most passionate and driven people he has encountered, and he cannot wait to meet, build connections, and learn from his peers.                                                                                      Alexandra Cardinale, NYU Steinhardt School of Culture, Education and Human Development                               Alexandra Cardinale passionately advocates for nontraditional education. Before her academic career at NYU, she left high school to travel to eight countries over nine months to study international relations and grassroots activism. Through her service and intellectual pursuits abroad, she fell in love NYU\u2019s Media, Culture and Communications program- which, thanks to a series of brilliant professors- has led her to refine that drive with her two minors, Law and Society, and the Business of Entertainment, Media and Technology.   Now as a Junior, Alex has covered ground across industries, through her social venture start up Live To Give, as a business curioso with WNYC and NYPR in radio, marketing fanatic with Business Insider, global coordinator as the Director of Global Operations with TEDxNYU and all around technical nerd. She continues expand her voice with her YouTube show Business ReCaffeinated (a business offshoot of her old political news and satire show, The Meme Factory), and has recently found a mad passion for strategic consulting.   Alex\u2019s odd path to what she defines as a successful education may not meet traditional standards- and yet it is exactly what she believes gives her an edge to challenge her peers to not find the right answer, but to ask better questions. She holds this high standard of curiosity not only to herself, but to the intellectual circles she chooses to surround herself with. Needless to say, with the NYU leadership fellows, Alex is thrilled to experiment and engage with the like-minded budding leaders of her generation.                                                                                      Joshua Dean, NYU Stern School of Business                               Josh Dean is interested leveraging social media and storytelling to disrupt the nonprofit and public sectors by connecting people to causes and movements and empowering them to drive change.   He co-founded Live To Give HQ, a storytelling platform for people to raise money for charity, with fellow NYU Leadership Fellow and close friend Alexandra Cardinale. Josh and Alex have raised $40,000 in seed funding for Live To Give through winning the Stern Social Impact Business Challenge and applying for small grants. They attended Clinton Global Initiative University in Phoenix, AZ, last month. Josh and Alex hope to empower people to tell powerful stories and raise money for nonprofits from across the country.   Josh worked on Senator Cory Booker\u2019s Special Election Campaign in 2013 from June to October, when he was elected. This past summer, he interned for the Senator in Washington D.C., working for his communications and digital team.He is active in the Stern Social Impact community, holding a leadership position for Net Impact and co-founding the Net Impact Collaborative Experience, a weekly meeting for social entrepreneurs to share ideas and resources. The goal of the meetings is to cover a whiteboard with ideas. Josh's favorite leadership experience has been serving as a Peer Mentor for Project OutReach, a program that brings together service-minded incoming freshmen and transfer students for leadership training, service, reflection, and activities all around the city. His two groups inspire him to continue being active in the service community and to continue reflecting   Josh believes that the world is slowly but surely becoming less racist and less homophobic, yet, we are having trouble working with people we disagree with. He hopes to learn how to push people who have fundamental disagreements to work together through the NYU Leadership Fellowship Program.

She enjoys experiencing new shows around NYC and exploring new forms of art and expression. Caren has the honor to take on leadership roles at NYU and is proud to be a Welcome Week Leader, a Sophomore Cohort President, and an Undergraduate Writing Tutor. Caren is excited to share her knowledge and experiences with others and to learn from them. She is enthusiastic about receiving the chance to develop her leadership skills and apply them. She hopes she would be able to spread positive energy around her peers and to help them actualize their potential.

This summer Robert has remained in New York City working for both NYU\u2019s Project OutReach and Memorial Sloan Kettering\u2019s Finance Department. Both experiences have allowed Robert to continually cultivate his knowledge of volunteer organizations, general accounting, and the greater financial services industry.   In regards to New York University\u2019s 2014-2015 Leadership Fellows Program, Robert will add a steadfast commitment to sharing his viewpoints with others. Moreover, he will employ active listening in discerning new leadership styles counter to his own. He looks forward to exposing himself to new vantage points and furthering his development as a leader.

Zack was inducted into the Torch Chapter of the National Residence Hall Honorary in the spring of 2014.   Zack also sits on the Dean\u2019s Team at Gallatin, providing prospective and admitted students advice on student life at NYU, and he will be serving as the Gallatin Sophomore Class Treasurer for the 2014-2015 academic year. Zack enjoys exploring the streets and sights of New York City; his favorite landmark is the Brooklyn Bridge. His hobbies include tinkering with technology, volunteering for just about anything, meeting new people, and trying new things. Zack hopes to contribute the experience he has acquired from his involvement in residential life at NYU to the Leadership Fellows Program and bridge social experiences between students across campuses and residences.                                                                                      Tali Kuhel, NYU College of Arts and Sciences                               Tali is a creative and collaborative community builder on the NYU campus. She has demonstrated her passion for community engagement and volunteerism as Social Action Chair of NYU\u2019s Hillel board, past Vice President of NYU\u2019s Shalhevet community and, currently, as President of NYU\u2019s Shalhevet community. In these roles, Tali has led multiple student boards in implementing educational and social action events for one of NYU\u2019s largest student communities.   Her experience in program design, communications and resource mobilization also stem from her extensive work as a division head of Camp Stone, an overnight summer camp and leadership training program. There, Tali managed a team of twelve counselors in assuring the safety and personal growth of 56 campers entering eighth grade.Tali\u2019s experience extends beyond her roles in the Jewish community. She has led interfaith dialogue through Bridges, the Muslim-Jewish club on campus and has volunteered for the Friendship Circle, an organization that pairs volunteers with children with special needs for over six years.   Tali has demonstrated her commitment to quality writing and editing as a volunteer journalist for the UN department of South - South cooperation and as a columnist and arts reviewer for the Washington Square News. Her professional experience includes content marketing for sparkology.com &amp; budsies.com, and writing content for vibe.com. She has applied her editorial experience in viral marketing for those board positions.Tali is completing her Bachelors in English with a Minor in Web Development, College of Arts and Sciences at New York University.                                                                                      Jennifer Lau, NYU College of Arts and Sciences                               Jennifer Lau is a junior at New York University, majoring in Politics with minor studies in both Chinese and Public Health. Born and raised in Queens, New York, Jennifer is both an engaged New Yorker and a proud, first-generation Chinese American. She has been involved with several non-profit organizations dedicated to serving lower-income, minority communities of NY, including the Charles B. Wang Community Health Center (CBWCHC), a federally qualified health center that aims to provide healthcare to financially disadvantaged Asian Americans.   Her budding interest in public health, with its roots at the health center, only magnified during her experience abroad in China, where living standards are lower and open dialogue about health concerns are more taboo. Her exposure to inner-city politics, through her involvements in City Council Member Margaret Chin's re-election campaign and in a public interest law firm, the Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund (AALDEF), furthered her interest in the link between politics and public health. With a constant desire for new knowledge, Jennifer hopes to begin connecting the dots in the world through the varied experiences and diverse individuals she meets along the way.                                                                                      Kenny Lee, NYU College of Arts and Sciences                               An economics major in CAS, Kenny is an avid film photographer, aspiring writer, passionate adventurer, and proud South Korean. Since his return from his two-year-long military service in Korea, Kenny has been serving as multiple leadership roles in NYU. Last year he served as a business administrator at Greenwich Hotel Hall Council, contributing to active residential community building within the hall. Kenny has been writing for the opinion section of Washington Square News on a regular basis, shedding light on diverse topics such as education, international volunteer work, LGBTQ activism, and green energy. Last winter, he travelled NYU Alternative Breaks teammates to Rio Grande Valley, a southernmost tip of Texas, to work with a nonprofit to empower immigrant communities in the region. After spring semester, he had a privilege of taking a wonderful adventure in China with NYU Shanghai students.   Through such experiences, Kenny realized the value of inclusive leadership that can empower the members as well as organization. While collaborating on various projects with PricewaterhouseCoopers consultants and analysts this summer in Seoul, he could witness firsthand how even a small change in leadership framework can catalyze an extraordinary change within an organization. Kenny is now poised to start off as an RA at Founders Hall, and as a proud member of NYU Leadership Fellows Program. Without any doubt, he is excited to apply what he learned and push his boundaries through this initiative, and to see where the adventure takes him this year.

Annais developed a deep sense of humanitarianism from her parents who often reminded her of the quote by Edmund Burke: \u201cthe only thing necessary for the triumph of evil, is for good men to do nothing\u201d. This quote inspired her and instilled a deep interest in Politics as a way to answer the call to arms she feels in the face of social injustice, grievous inequality and other systematic issues currently affecting our country and our world.   Annais plans to attend law school following her undergraduate education, become a public interest lawyer and later a politician so that she may help address both societal and environmental issues that do not get the attention they deserve. In her spare time Annais tutors children as part of NYU\u2019s America Reads program. She also works for the College of Arts and Science where she mentors and guides freshman students in her role as College Leader. Annais hopes to add value to the world around her by maintaining a high level of positivity and offering her talents in ways that benefit her peers and her community.

In her free time, Selena likes reading and playing the piano. She will add value to the Leadership Fellows Program, her peer fellows and the larger NYU community through her leadership and passion for volunteerism.

Besides entrepreneurship, Greyson loves fishing and has spent last two summers working in northern Minnesota at a fishing resort.

She hopes to use Brighter Today as a tool to further unite peers, build leadership and create a more ecofriendly environment at NYU: creating awareness about some of the world\u2019s most pressing issues, combing skills to transform ideas into actions and ultimately helping to enact change both at NYU and in the world.
