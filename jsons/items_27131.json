A papering service is a company which makes available complimentary tickets to its members, who pay a membership fee of usually between $50 - $100 per year. In addition to a membership fee, there is usually a $3 - $5 per ticket handling fee each time a member uses the service. Otherwise, there is no charge for the tickets.   Papering services usually offer its members complimentary tickets when a performance or event is in previews, under publicized, expecting the attendance of reviewers or celebrities, or would like the benefits of a full house. Performances range from previews to opening nights to performances throughout a show\u2019s run.   Ticket Central recommends the following three services - in part because some offer discounts on memberships to the NYU community. Some of Ticket Central\u2019s staff belong to these services and have seen some really great shows on the cheap!          StudentRush.org Membership fee: FREE for up to 4 tickets per show offered. Per ticket handling fee: $5.   TheaterExtras.com Membership fee: $99 (20% off Membership with code ST7912UNBM ) per year for up to 2 tickets per show offered. Per ticket handling fee: $4.
