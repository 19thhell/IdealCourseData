Their method, which appears as the cover article in the most recent issue of the journal Nanotechnology , employs \u201cspin waves,\u201d which are waves that move in magnetic materials. Physically, these spin waves are much like water waves\u2014like those that propagate on the surface of an ocean. However, with a purpose akin to that of electromagnetic waves (i.e., light and radio waves), spin waves can efficiently transfer energy and information from place to place.   \u201cSpin waves hold tremendous promise in improving the functionality of a range of technologies,\u201d says Andrew Kent, a professor in NYU\u2019s Department of Physics and one of the paper\u2019s co-authors. \u201cOur results mark another vital step in harnessing a resource that is faster and more energy efficient that what we rely on today.\u201d   Currently, electromagnetic waves in antennas can be converted into spin waves. However, the resulting spin waves have a long wavelength and propagate slowly. In contrast, short-wavelength spin waves can move over greater distances, more quickly, and with less energy, and thus present the possibility of improving a range of communications and electronic devices.   Yet, scientists have had difficulty in creating such spin waves. To overcome this obstacle, the NYU researchers developed \u201cspin torque nano-oscillators\u201d (STNO)\u2014nanoscale devices that can convert a direct current into spin waves. They showed that these oscillators can be arranged in arrays to direct the spin wave energy, much the way antennas are used to direct electromagnetic waves.   Crucially, they developed a method that allows the spin waves to navigate in specific patterns and directions throughout a magnetic material. Their idea relies on the interference of waves and controlling the interference to produce specific wave propagation patterns.
