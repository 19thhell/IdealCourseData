The first track is modern European history of concepts, with an emphasis on France and philosophy. My An Atheism that is not Humanist Emerges in French Thought (Stanford, 2010) studied the transformation of the concept of the human around the critiques of secular humanism in interwar and early postwar France. I am currently completing a second monograph in this field, The Matter with Transparency in Postwar France . Long a goal and ideal in philosophy and today once again a major political catchword, the concept was treated by philosophers, anthropologists, psychologists, filmmakers, and other intellectuals as profoundly problematic in 1945-1975 France. This book takes as its starting point the question raised by this rejection of transparency, whether as a social ideal (the aspiration to a transparent society or a transparent state), as an ethical priority (the traditional demand for personal purity and the romantic fantasy of the heart-to-heart), or as an epistemological ideal (the assertion of man\u2019s capacity to know the world).      The second track is in the history of the human sciences, starting out from the history of biology and related disciplines. In Experimente im Individuum (August/Walther K\u00f6nig Vlg, 2014), co-authored with Todd Meyers, we offered an account of the German-Jewish neuropsychiatrist Kurt Goldstein\u2019s influential elaboration of a concept of the individual premised upon his epistemological, experimental, and therapeutic work with on aphasia and tonic musculature in brain-injured patients. I have also been involved in two translations of books by Georges Canguilhem, Knowledge of Life (Fordham 2009) and Writings on Medicine (Fordham 2012), and have co-edited (with Richard Baxstrom) a collection of essays for the journal Republics of Letters on self-assertion and conflicts over territory and method in the human sciences. Todd Meyers and I co-edit the Forms of Living series at Fordham University Press and we are now completing a book-length study of the early-twentieth-century transformation of conceptions of the organism (and its consequences) in physiology and related sciences: The Whole on the Verge of Collapse: Integration, Disequilibrium, and the Sciences of the Body around WWI . This project traces the emphasis of organismic balance and disequilibrium that occurred during the period 1905-1930 across a transnational quasi-network of scholars. We are interested in problems like wound shock, aphasia, homeostasis, anaphylaxis, gastro-enteric distress, and especially the theorization of disequilibrium and collapse; in new or renewed concepts ranging from histamine response to \u201ccatastrophic reaction\u201d to the \u201cindividual\u201d patient.       My other current projects generally concern the intersections of aesthetics and politics with a continued focus on the history of concepts in Europe and of scientific and political languages concerning the body. The Scaffold of Sovereignty: Global and Aesthetic Perspectives on the History of a Concept , a volume co-edited with Zvi Ben-Dor Benite and Nicole Jerr, is under contract with Columbia University Press. In 2015-2016 I will be on leave, thanks to an ACLS Ryskamp Fellowship, to pursue research toward a history of conceptions of the \u201cNew Man\u201d in nineteenth- and early-twentieth-century Europe. This project concerns the dream of a transformation of human nature resulting from\u2014but often working against\u2014the advance of modernity; it brings together considerations of different scientific fields (anthropology, psychology, social hygiene, etc), competing figures of authority and power, aesthetic figurations of the motif, and the announcements, ever more frequent after World War I and especially in the National Socialist and Soviet regimes, of the impending or ongoing construction and supposedly redemptive promise of \u201cNew Men.\u201d      My teaching includes courses on the history of particular concepts, on moments in European philosophical and scientific thought, and on specific thinkers. Recent courses include The Origin of Humanity: A European Obsession, 1750-2000; Freud; European Culture and World War One ; and Structuralism: Language and Man in Postwar Europe . This semester I am co-teaching an undergraduate colloquium with Larry Wolff on The Anthropological Encounter in European Intellectual History and a graduate course on Sovereignty: Twentieth-Century Ideas, Aesthetics, and Practices .

The first track is modern European history of concepts, with an emphasis on France and philosophy. My An Atheism that is not Humanist Emerges in French Thought (Stanford, 2010) studied the transformation of the concept of the human around the critiques of secular humanism in interwar and early postwar France. I am currently completing a second monograph in this field, The Matter with Transparency in Postwar France . Long a goal and ideal in philosophy and today once again a major political catchword, the concept was treated by philosophers, anthropologists, psychologists, filmmakers, and other intellectuals as profoundly problematic in 1945-1975 France. This book takes as its starting point the question raised by this rejection of transparency, whether as a social ideal (the aspiration to a transparent society or a transparent state), as an ethical priority (the traditional demand for personal purity and the romantic fantasy of the heart-to-heart), or as an epistemological ideal (the assertion of man\u2019s capacity to know the world).      The second track is in the history of the human sciences, starting out from the history of biology and related disciplines. In Experimente im Individuum (August/Walther K\u00f6nig Vlg, 2014), co-authored with Todd Meyers, we offered an account of the German-Jewish neuropsychiatrist Kurt Goldstein\u2019s influential elaboration of a concept of the individual premised upon his epistemological, experimental, and therapeutic work with on aphasia and tonic musculature in brain-injured patients. I have also been involved in two translations of books by Georges Canguilhem, Knowledge of Life (Fordham 2009) and Writings on Medicine (Fordham 2012), and have co-edited (with Richard Baxstrom) a collection of essays for the journal Republics of Letters on self-assertion and conflicts over territory and method in the human sciences. Todd Meyers and I co-edit the Forms of Living series at Fordham University Press and we are now completing a book-length study of the early-twentieth-century transformation of conceptions of the organism (and its consequences) in physiology and related sciences: The Whole on the Verge of Collapse: Integration, Disequilibrium, and the Sciences of the Body around WWI . This project traces the emphasis of organismic balance and disequilibrium that occurred during the period 1905-1930 across a transnational quasi-network of scholars. We are interested in problems like wound shock, aphasia, homeostasis, anaphylaxis, gastro-enteric distress, and especially the theorization of disequilibrium and collapse; in new or renewed concepts ranging from histamine response to \u201ccatastrophic reaction\u201d to the \u201cindividual\u201d patient.       My other current projects generally concern the intersections of aesthetics and politics with a continued focus on the history of concepts in Europe and of scientific and political languages concerning the body. The Scaffold of Sovereignty: Global and Aesthetic Perspectives on the History of a Concept , a volume co-edited with Zvi Ben-Dor Benite and Nicole Jerr, is under contract with Columbia University Press. In 2015-2016 I will be on leave, thanks to an ACLS Ryskamp Fellowship, to pursue research toward a history of conceptions of the \u201cNew Man\u201d in nineteenth- and early-twentieth-century Europe. This project concerns the dream of a transformation of human nature resulting from\u2014but often working against\u2014the advance of modernity; it brings together considerations of different scientific fields (anthropology, psychology, social hygiene, etc), competing figures of authority and power, aesthetic figurations of the motif, and the announcements, ever more frequent after World War I and especially in the National Socialist and Soviet regimes, of the impending or ongoing construction and supposedly redemptive promise of \u201cNew Men.\u201d      My teaching includes courses on the history of particular concepts, on moments in European philosophical and scientific thought, and on specific thinkers. Recent courses include The Origin of Humanity: A European Obsession, 1750-2000; Freud; European Culture and World War One ; and Structuralism: Language and Man in Postwar Europe . This semester I am co-teaching an undergraduate colloquium with Larry Wolff on The Anthropological Encounter in European Intellectual History and a graduate course on Sovereignty: Twentieth-Century Ideas, Aesthetics, and Practices .
