Competition for admission to the Institute is high.      The student following the PhD course of study gains a deeper understanding of a subject area, beyond what is normally acquired at the master\u2019s level and develops a capacity for independent scholarship. The PhD program is designed for the person who wants to investigate the role of the visual arts in culture through detailed, object-based examination as well as historical and theoretical interpretation. The degree program provides a focused and rigorous experience supported by interaction with the leading scholars of the Institute and access to New York area museums, curators, conservators, archaeological sites as well as NYU\u2019s global network. The PhD program is designed for six years of full time funded study.            Requirements for Admission            &#8226;Candidates for a degree from the Institute of Fine Arts should have an excellent background in the liberal arts, normally including at least four courses of undergraduate art history.

Those PhD applicants who already hold an MA in art history must provide a copy of their thesis or another substantial research paper to be read by an appropriate member of the IFA faculty.                  Applicants who received their bachelor\u2019s degree from a non-English speaking university must also submit a TOEFL score.            Candidates wishing to be considered for admission to the Institute for Fall 2015 should submit their applications by December 18, 2014.
