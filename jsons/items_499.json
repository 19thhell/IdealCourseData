The name of our lab is \"computation and cognition\" which reflect the two main strands that         inform our work. Principally, we attempt to understand the nature of human cognition by         developing computational theories of human information processing. By comparing the operation         formal models and the behavior of humans, we can gain insight into the mechanisms that people         use to to solve problems and adapt their behavior. In addition, insights from these           models can inform the development of artificial systems capable of learning on their own.                                      We are particularly interested in how people learn from experience. Our research ranges         from studies of the different neural systems that contribute to         category and concept acquisition, to the interactions between categorization, memory, and         perceptual processes, to (more recently) studies of how people learn by interacting with          the world through exploration and information-search behaviors.                                      To give you a better sense of some of the basic scientific questions we are interested          in, we've highlighted below some of the main lines of work we are currently developing.          Our lab paper archive has a full list of papers         and abstracts.                                                            Our first, and in some sense primary, line of work deals with category and concept learning or how people learn          to generalize from the instances they see in the world. For example, how do young children learn which plants          belong to the category \"tree\" and which are \"flowers\"? Category learning is a critical cognitive ability which          underlies a vast array of abilities such as object recognition and language acquisition. Our research in this area          seeks a better understanding of the learning processes which support this ability and how they might be organized          or implemented in the brain. Our work in this area combines a variety of methodologies including behavioral          studies, neuro-imaging, and computational modeling.                               An example finding from our work:                               In one recent study, we looked at the influence that categories have on our perceptual abilities (Gureckis & Goldstone, 2008, in prep).         In this study we asked people to discriminate between a set of highly similar human faces. Then we taught them to assign         different subsets of the faces into categories. After learning, we again tested participant's discrimination ability.          The key finding is that, after learning, participants were less able to discriminate items that were assigned to the same         category and were better able to discrimination faces from different categories (a effect known as categorical perception).         More interestingly, we also found that the distribution of exemplars within each category also had an influence on people's         perception. Items that belonged to the same \"cluster\" of items inside a category were harder to discriminate after         learning than items that belong two different clusters within the same category. Thus, distinctions that were not         directly relevant for success in the learning task ended up influencing people's perception. We are currently following up         these studies to better understand the interplay of language, learning, and perception.

A second line of work considers how learning can be viewed as an active (or interactive) process.         Imagine a young child just beginning to learn about how the world works. Some of the time, an adult is          nearby to provide feedback or instruction, but often times the child must learn on their own by trial          and error. In some of our recent work, we've looked at how people learn effective behavioral strategies          through interacting with dynamic task environments where reward structure continually changes in response          to the actions of the individual. In contrast to approaches that treat learners as passive   observers, our goal in this work is to          develop theories of learning that can account for the active way in which we search, sample, and          explore our environment. On the computational side, this work applies the framework of          reinforcement learning (Sutton & Barto, 1998) to understand higher-level cognitive behavior and decision making.            Reinforcement learning is an agent-based approach to learning through interaction with the environment in          pursuit of goal-directed behavior. Reinforcement          learning is also a promising theoretical approach to studying higher-level human learning since it emphasizes the role of a         situated agent interacting with their environment. For example, RL models specify how learners should balance exploration          versus exploitation of resources in their environment, how they take into account delayed rewards while learning, and how          to assign credit to actions that later lead to successful outcomes.

In other words, how are categories represented in the brain, and how do different brain systems          influence what we learn? However, these efforts have tended to focus on the localization of particular          functions to particular brain regions in the absence of useful linking theories which detail how these          regions interact. One project we have been apart of over the past few years has been to consider the role          that models developed in cognitive science can play in helping to integrate these often disparate findings.

We are interested in the analysis and representation of visual information, including empirical study of the structure of visual scenes, construction of mathematical theories for representation and processing of that structure, implementation and simulation of biologically plausible instantiations of these theories, and psychophysical or (through collaboration) physiological investigations designed to test these theories.
