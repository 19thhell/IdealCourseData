To achieve this goal, a collaborative network of local, regional, and national research centers was developed to improve patient management through quality clinical research.   The Clinical and Translational Research offices are strategically located in the 70,000 square-foot Clinical and Translational Science Institute (CTSI). Comprised of three floors plus ground-floor space, the CTSI is populated by a number of dry research programs in population sciences, community health, epidemiology and bioinformatics. The facility is designed to accommodate growth in clinical research activity and to address the objective of the Medical Center's Campus Transformation of moving non-clinical functions off campus. The Clinical and Translational Research space is located in the heart of the CTSI and includes offices and flexible work spaces with direct access to conference centers with multi-media, class rooms, dedicated servers and databases, and secured medical research record storage space.   Research fellowship training opportunities in the Clinical and Translation Research Program, as well as Masters Degrees in Public Administration in Health Policy and Management, Global Health Leadership, and Science in Clinical Investigation are available for qualified individuals.   Active areas under clinical investigation in the Department of Plastic Surgery include: wound healing, cleft surgery, presurgical infant orthopedics, breast reconstruction, hand surgery, and craniosynostosis.
