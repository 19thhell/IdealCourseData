Evaluates the Western in terms of the ways that it interrelates with central tenets of American ideology; consequently, understanding the shifting cultural signification of the Western and the dynamics of the transformation of history into myth will be basic to our concerns. The topics emphasized include the thematic of civilization and savagery, and the representation of the Western hero, heroine, and Native Americans, especially in terms of the problematizing of these motifs.
