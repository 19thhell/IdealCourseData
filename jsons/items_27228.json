The ultimate aim for the Playwrights\u2019 actor, is to emerge after six to eight semesters, skilled at both transforming and collaborating.In the first year, every student takes two acting classes; a basic technique class that draws on a variety of techniques to ground the young actor in the reality of doing and a more physical, character-oriented class that encourages students to explore physical impulse as the generator of character and emotional truth.Second year students collaborate as an ensemble focusing on being alive in the room at all times. As they work with a single text all year students collaborate on telling the story of the play, while learning how to synthesize voice, movement, and alignment into their acting. Having been grounded in emotional truth in first year, by the end of second year students have become increasingly crafty story-tellers.The focus is on style, character, and performance at the Advanced level. Acting classes are all scene-study based, and cover a variety of styles and genres, from classical to contemporary. Students perform in one of a variety of faculty-directed productions, giving them a true company experience and requiring them to put their ever-increasing knowledge into practice. The productions provide students the opportunity of working with professional actors from the faculty and/or graduates of the school. By the end of three years, the Playwrights\u2019 actor is a savvy theater collaborator, capable of working with a variety of genres, styles, and directors. Design: The combination of developing a visual sensibility and vocabulary through reading, research, and hands-on work allows each student to become a thoughtful designer. The pursuits of a designer are rarely solitary; therefore students are paired with one another to act in director-designer collaborations, starting in their first year, in both classwork and directing projects. The curriculum places a strong emphasis on process rather than product. Students are taught the basics of drafting and model making as tools in which to explore their ideas. Students are urged to work in a rough fast style to allow their thought processes to become three-dimensional. Greater challenges met over multiple drafts increase each student\u2019s store of skills and content knowledge, allowing the students to more confidently approach future artistic exploration. All three years of classwork involve classmate feedback, allowing students\u2019 work to thrive through a free flow of observations, risk taking, and critiques. In their fourth year, students work on faculty-led productions to push their work and level of collaboration further. Devised Theater: In the fall semester, Fundamentals of Directing (required for all first year students), is structured to have the students build scene work of their own making in collaborative groups, which introduces them to the basics of devising and collective creation.Creating Original Work I (fall, required for all second year students) offers students the opportunity to build 5-7 minutes of their own performance material. Students are required to work alone, and must perform in the piece. Focus is on development through redrafting, identifying patterns in personal creative process, constructive feedback models, and building muscles for self-assessment. The spring semester students build a 10-minute project. They may work solo again, or with up to 2 collaborators. Both semesters culminate in an open showing for an invited audience. At the advanced level, students spend a semester building fully produced independent projects (ranging from 30 minutes to full-length), which comprise the bulk of their training for the semester. Each student is guided through the semester\u2019s work by both the Program Head and a project mentor. Additional classes within the curriculum offer support skill sets and opportunities to experiment with rehearsal process. Directing: The foundation of the Directing Program at Playwrights Horizons Theater School lies in an approach to directing plays that balances leadership with collaboration. This balance, which is hard for even seasoned professionals to achieve, is a particular challenge to college-age students, whose own identities, social skills, and peer interactions are constantly evolving during their years at NYU. We work to give them concrete directorial tools, first-hand experience (not only in directing but in other areas of theater-making as well), as well as examples and role models among the diverse directing faculty and mentors with whom they come into contact during their time at PHTS. Movement: The Movement Curriculum at PHTS is focused on the student discovering what their own unique, individual body is capable of as an expressive instrument and then expanding and pushing that territory as far as it can go. In the first year, they are immersed in Contact Improvisation and Ensemble-based Composition, learning that their bodies are capable of much more than they ever thought, that their physical being is a vital part of acting, performing, and creating, and that communication can begin with the physical. In the second year, students explore more advanced forms of improvisation, such as Forsythe-based improvisation technologies or explorations with leading contemporary dance practitioner/educators from companies like Susan Marshall. As well, they further their strength, lexibility, and endurance training and enter in the process of learning choreography and repertory forcing them to become fluid, adept, specific, and consistent with their bodies as dancers, actors, and performers. In the advanced training years, a variety of courses are offered to follow the training of the first two years. These include Contemporary Technique (Cunningham, et al), Butoh, Choreography, Physical Theater Methodology, led by a rotating group of leading guest artists. Music Theater: Recognizing current trends in American and International Theater, the New Music Theater Practicum at Playwrights Horizons Theater School offers advanced students the opportunity to fully immerse themselves in the exciting field of Music Theater. Driven by music, and incorporating experimental forms and interdisciplinary combinations, the New Music Theater Practicum demands a rigorous commitment to craft, the flexibility to incorporate the ever-expanding opportunities presented by new media, and the intellectual rigor to participate as a full collaborator in the development of new work. Playwrights\u2019 project-driven methodology offers a fertile landscape for the ambitious Music Theater artist. Emerging and professional lyricists, composers and writers are commissioned to work hand-in-hand with NMTP students in the creation, development and presentation of original new work. From inception-to-performance, course work is designed not only to support the skills necessary for a specific piece, but also to build the discipline and flexibility necessary for long-term success in this exciting, demanding and ever-expanding field. Forging collaborative relationships with their professional peers, NMTP students effectively bridge the gap from student to professional experience. Playwriting: Students are introduced to Playwriting in their Freshman Year with The Living Text which they use to explore their own writing and existing material to gain a closer, more integrated relationship to text as a practical blueprint conveying time, space, character, action, idea, sound, language and spectacle. In second year, students explore these tools more deeply in the writing of 10-minute plays in Fall, and use their writing as the basis for dramatic labs in the Spring in which they can test, explore and deepen their own work. Advanced Playwrights, in their third and fourth years, focus on student-driven projects in a workshop setting: this may be a series of shorter plays, a full length play or a musical piece. The nature of Playwriting Projects may vary depending on the needs of the piece from a staged reading, to workshop productions of more finished work. Voice &amp; Speech: The first year of voice and speech training focuses on developing the expressive range of the human voice and the intricacies of speaking American English. Second year focuses on developing fluid, connected speech in the context of acting classical poetic texts while looking at language skills and phonetic interpretive needs and choices as well as furthering the development of the voice through the introduction of Fitzmaurice Voice-work. Advanced Voice and Speech builds on the core voice and speech skills with a focus on \u201cnon-linear\u201d dynamics of creative performance utilizing a combination of holistic and movement approaches to acting. Third year speech emphasizes the advancement of dialect work. In fourth year, the focus shifts almost entirely to the application and coaching of previously developed skills as the student performs in a a full length play, where the teacher takes on the role of vocal coach, facilitating the vision of the play, actors, and director.
