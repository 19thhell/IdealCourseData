The purpose of this 4 week senior elective is: (1) To integrate pharmacology, pathophysiology and clinical medicine, in order to understand the care of poisoned patient (2) To learn how to evaluate and treat common toxic exposures (3) To expose the medical student to the resources and structure of a regional poison control center.    Students will understand the evaluation of poisoned patients. Students will be able to describe the pharmacology and toxicology of common poisons, understand the use of common antidotes and to describe the function of poison centers.   Key Responsibilities of the student while on Elective:   To attend all conferences and lectures   To perform daily follow up poisoned patients (AKA \u201cCall backs\u201d)   To present articles for Journal Club once during 4 week elective   Brief presentation (5-10 minute) at the end of the rotation on a topic picked by the student    Months Offered: Variable, but offered at this time 8 months/year   Interested students should send contact:   Ellie Pena, Education Administrator  Manager Department of Emergency Medicine\u00a0  Administrator, Undergraduate Medical Education Program EM\u00a0  NYU Langone/Bellevue Hospital Center  462 First Avenue, Suite A-329  New York, NY 10016                                                                                        NYU Langone Medical Center       Student Login       Library                 Policies &amp; Disclaimers"}]},
