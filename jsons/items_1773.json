Baroque:   The  Sovereign and the Law in German Tragedy (Gryphius to Kleist) Christiane Frey &amp; Guest Lecturer Slavoj Zizek  What is the relationship between sovereignty and the law? Is the law  sovereign? Or does it owe its legitimacy to the sovereignty that institutes it?  In the early modern era, these issues are subject to new scrutiny and  negotiation on at least three levels: politics or political theology (as it is  depicted in drama); poetics and the law of genre (as it is realized in the  writing of drama); and \u201cphilosophy of nature,\u201d in which the notion of modern  science emerges from a new concept of the laws of nature. The course explores  the relationship of law to sovereignty in all three of these domains with an  emphasis on the first. We will ask what drama has to say about the nature of  law and how drama\u2019s relationship to the law of genre lends it a unique status  in the discourse on law and sovereignty. Plays from Andreas Gryphius\u2019s baroque  tragedy Leo Armenius to Kleist\u2019s Prinz Friedrich von Homburg ;  source texts from the history of science; literary and political theory  from Aristotle to Benjamin, Derrida, and Roberto Esposito. Discussion in  English; reading knowledge of German required.   GERM-GA1650 T 3:30 - 6:10; This course meets from 9/2 through 9/30. Visual  Culture: Series, Repetition, Seriality. Where literature meets quality t.v.  Elisabeth Bronfen  Matthew Weiner\u2019s Mad Men not only  uses the literature of the 1960s as one of its frames of reference but also  picks up on the claim to moral imagination for which the Victorian novel is  famous. While much has been made of the analogy between the serialization of  fiction in periodicals and the t.v. series format, this block seminar will  explore the thematic and rhetorical implications of repetition and seriality on  which such a comparison is also predicated. How does seriality appear in both  19th century fiction and early 21st century quality t.v. as a thematic concern?  How do the plethora of individual portraits produced by a serialized text also  form a network of relations that offer up a coherent whole? What rhetorical  strategies does each text deploy so as to call forth both intellectual and  affective empathy? What imaginary community is thus produced? We will use  Freud\u2019s psychoanalytic discussion of repetition along with Deleuze\u2019s comment on  this as our theoretical frame for a crossmapping that brings Eliot\u2019s Middlemarch and Keller\u2019s Leute von Seldwyla into conversation  with the first two seasons of Mad Men .  Since all three texts are long, please begin with the reading/viewing well in  advance.  GERM-GA1115 W 3:30 \u2013 6:10  Origins  of Critical Thought I: \u201cTrag\u00f6die im Sittlichen\u201d (Kant \u2013 Schiller \u2013 Hegel)  Eckart Goebel  This seminar, conducted in German, discusses key texts on ethics from  around 1800. We begin with Kant\u2019s Grundlegung zur Metaphysik der Sitten,  and his Anthropologie in pragmatischer Hinsicht. We will then read  two of Schiller\u2019s essays (\u00dcber Anmut und W\u00fcrde and \u00dcber das Erhabene),  reflecting on Kant\u2019s thought. The remaining sessions will be used to  reconstruct Hegel\u2019s concept of a \u201cTrag\u00f6die im Sittlichen\u201d as it has been  developed in his early anti-Kantian essay \u00dcber die wissenschaftlichen  Behandlungsarten des Naturrechts. A more refined understanding of the \u201cTrag\u00f6die  im Sittlichen\u201d requires a careful reading of the reflections on tragedy Hegel  unfolds in his Ph\u00e4nomenologie des Geistes and in his Vorlesungen \u00fcber  die \u00c4sthetik. In order to prepare this seminar, a reading of the tragedies  Hegel is referring to, is highly recommended: Aeschylus\u2019 Eumenides,  Sophocles\u2019 Antigone, Shakespeare\u2019s Hamlet, Schiller\u2018s Wallenstein , and Goethe\u2019s Faust I. Origins of Critical Thought II, dealing with post-Kantian  'Philosophical Anthropology' (Plessner, Gehlen, Heidegger, Adorno, Freud,  Blumenberg) will take place in Spring 2015.       GERM-GA1512 W 6:20 \u2013 8:20 Kafka  Friedrich Ulfers  The course will deal with Kafka\u2019s work largely in the light of the author\u2019s  preoccupation with language, particularly with the way this preoccupation  affected his writing, indeed provided the topic of it. The point of departure  will be the experience of \u201clanguage crisis\u201d among intellectuals and writers in  turn of the century Austria, which led to the radical criticism of conceptual  or referential language\u2013 already foreshadowed by Nietzsche \u2013 of Fritz Mauthner  and Ludwig Wittgenstein, among others. The course will then show Kafka\u2019s  response to this crisis: his insight that conceptual/referential language and  oppositional/binary involves an abstraction of the \u201ctruth\u201d or the \u201creal,\u201d which  is only apprehensible in a space of radical undecidability between opposites,  demanding a language of irreducible allusiveness, a language that is constitutive  of Kafka\u2019s texts.  GERM-GA2610 R 1:30 - 4:20  Special  Topics in Theory - Unpacking Derrida\u2019s Library: The Secret to the Archive  Avital Ronell  Marking the tenth anniversary of Derrida\u2019s death, this course revisits  Derrida\u2019s library in order to suggest that his texts are more valuable today  than ever before. His library may even be a space for reading and writing  that\u2014dominated by texts that no longer correspond only to the \u201cbook\u201d form, and  by a corpus that exceeds the library that would contain it\u2014touches on the  entirety of the world. Open 24 hours a day, every day of the year, it forces  us, in Derrida\u2019s words, \u201cinto a delirium of reading\u201d that reads us as much as  it teaches us to read\u2014actively, historically, politically, and ethically. The  course will provide an opportunity to remember several of his lessons\u2014about  philosophy, literature, history, politics, religion, economics, ideology, law,  rights, nationalism, racism, colonialism, the media, university institutions,  capitalism, rogue states, the war on terror, justice, responsibility, language,  friendship, love, life, death, and, mourning\u2014all of which are more urgent and  necessary than ever before. It should never be said\u2014as so many have, and will  no doubt continue to say\u2014that his work did not engage history and politics,  that his work retreated from what remains most important to us. From the  beginning he proceeded in the conviction that his philosophical activity did  not require a political or ethical practice because it already was, from the  start, an ethico- political practice. This course takes place at Princeton  University. Students should enroll through the Inter-University Doctoral  Consortium.  GERM-GA3000 TBD Independent Research  GERM-GA3100-001  ENGL-GA3629-001 (Course originating in English  Department)  W 6:20 \u2013 8:20; 244 Greene Street, Room 306     Politics in  Deconstruction  Geoffrey Bennington   Taking its lead from some of Derrida\u2019s later work,  this course will set off again from Aristotle\u2019s famous characterization of man  as a zoon politikon, and follow the threads of sovereignty and democracy  through some of the great texts of political philosophy in the Western  tradition. We shall attempt to understand why both of these notions pose such  problems for that tradition, and give rise to all manner of complications and  paradoxes, which turn out to be definitive of the conceptual space of the  political as such. We shall wonder why almost all traditional political  philosophers are enamored of sovereignty, while almost none has anything very  good to say about democracy. We shall consider the possibility of a non-trivial  affinity between the political, the rhetorical, the literary, and animality in  their constant tendency to exceed conceptual grasp, and also compare our  deconstructive approach to these political questions with some other  contemporary theories. Classic authors to be discussed will include Plato, Aristotle,  Machiavelli, Bodin, Hobbes, Spinoza, Rousseau, Kant, Hegel and Schmitt; more  recent theorists to be considered alongside Derrida may include Agamben,  Badiou, Foucault, Hardt and Negri, Lyotard, Mouffe and Ranci\u00e8re.  GERM-GA1221-001 MEDI-GA 2100-003 (Course originating in MARC) T, R 11:00-12:15pm   Dawn  Songs in Middle High German Literature  Jessica Quinlan   Ow\u00ea, nu ist  ez tac! A scenario describing the pain experienced by  lovers who must part at daybreak seems to have been the subject of lyrical  reflection the world over from well before the time of Christ. In the European  Middle Ages, the dawn song ( Tagelied )  enjoyed particular popularity in the German tradition. It depicts scenes of awakening,  lamentation and farewell, couched as narrative action with dialogue. Between  the 12th and 15th centuries, this pattern is repeated,  redrawn and almost endlessly varied; the subject of the dawn song is recreated,  inverted, parodied and removed to a spiritual level. The primary texts will be  read in their original language; in addition to the discussion of the place of  the dawn song in medieval German literature, therefore, this course seeks to  offer participants the opportunity to develop and enhance reading skills in  Middle High German.       SPRING 2014   GERM-GA1219  - The Information  Society: Planetarity (Taught in German)  - Hans-Christian  von Herrmann  \"I  propose the planet to overwrite the globe.\" This statement can be found in  Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak's 2003 book \"Death of a Discipline\", which  brings up the concept of \"planetarity\" as a description of a  post-global, post-national and post-colonial world, interconnected and  differentiated by electronic information systems. But \"planetarity\"  has a history that is older than what is called the information age today and  that leads back to Weimar Germany. So the seminar will follow up the traces of  \"planetarity\" in Walter Benjamin's \"Einbahnstra\u00dfe\" (1928)  and Ernst J\u00fcnger's \"Der Arbeiter\" (1932) afterwards moving on to the  writings of Martin Heidegger, Kostas Axelos and Wilfrid Desan. By doing so the  seminar's objective is to discuss \"planetarity\" as a theoretical  approach emerging from the crisis of modernity and envisioning a post-modern  culture totally shaped by technology.       GERM-GA3610  (COLIT-GA2155; POET-GA2002) - Topics  in Early Modern Written Culture: Literary Matter - The Lucretian Tradition  on European Modernity - Jacques  Lezra   GERM-GA3100  (COLIT-GA2300) - Studies in Prose  Genres: J.M. Coetzee &amp; Metafiction - Mark Sanders       When  J.M. Coetzee received the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2003, he stunned the  Swedish Academy in Stockholm by presenting not the customary lecture, but a  story. In this tale, entitled \u201cHe and His Man,\u201d Robinson Crusoe sends reports  to his \u201cman,\u201d whom Coetzee\u2019s audience recognizes as being Daniel Defoe, since  the reports appear to come from books authored by Defoe. The relationship of  character and author is turned inside out, in an exciting metafictional  performance that also places in question the conventional boundaries of the  lecture. The Swedish audience should not have been stunned, however, for some  of J.M. Coetzee\u2019s most recent novels, Summertime, Slow Man, and Elizabeth  Costello have, in different ways, foregrounded the mechanics of fiction-making  typically concealed by the realist novel. Concentrating on these works, as well  as Coetzee\u2019s early novels, in which metafiction is the dominant mode for  interrogating colonial literary genres, and drawing comparisons with the  fiction of Italo Calvino, Alain Robbe-Grillet, and Zo\u00eb Wicomb, while at the  same time availing ourselves of relevant narrative theory (Mieke Bal, Roland  Barthes) and critical commentary (Attwell, Attridge, Spivak, Wicomb), the  seminar will explore the aesthetic, ethical and political implications of a  writer putting the inner workings of his or her craft on open display. The  seminar will culminate with a roundtable on Coetzee\u2019s enigmatic new novel, The  Childhood of Jesus.  GERM-GA2703 - Poetics &amp; Theory Seminar:  Autofiction: Writing the Self (Taught in German) - Emine Sevgi \u00d6zdamar  &amp; Alys George       Autobiographical  writing has evolved into a highly controversial issue in contemporary literary  theory. Every constituent of the term has become problematic: the \u201cauto\u201d of a  sovereign ego and an undivided persona; the \u201cbios\u201d relating to a culturally  encoded life; the \u201cgraphein\u201d (\u03b3\u03c1\u03b1\u03c6\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd), which registers problems of  mediality. Serge Doubrovsky coined the term \u201cautofiction\u201d in the late  1970s in an attempt to address these vicissitudes of autobiography as a genre.  How  can we distinguish between autobiography and fiction? Can works of literature  be reliable archives of individual and collective memory? Can they be authentic  expressions of our lives at all? We will consider writing that invites and  engages these questions. In addition to Emine Sevgi \u00d6zdamar\u2019s work,  we will read texts by Else Lasker-Sch\u00fcler, Charlotte Salomon, Roland Barthes,  Thomas Bernhard, Herta M\u00fcller, and Thomas Glavinic.       GERM-GA2912  (COLIT-GA2912) -  Literature  &amp; Philosophy: POETS TAKE PHILOSOPHY:  H\u00f6lderlin~Heidegger~Celan~Derrida  - Avital Ronell  The  course will dwell on the poetry of H\u00f6lderlin and Celan with an eye to the  critical works of Heidegger, Adorno, Benjamin, Derrida, Lacoue-Labarthe. There  will be two separate workshops led by Kevin McLaughlin (Brown Univ.) and Werner  Hamacher (Frankfurt) in addition to possible visits by Ulrich Baer and  Richard Sieburth. Expect intense and staggeringly beautiful work to come out of  this.       GERM-GA3000 - Independent Research    FALL  2013     GERM-GA1110  -Theory of Art: Aby Warburg - Christopher  Wood        Aby  Warburg (1866-1929) was an art historian who worked outside the academic  establishment, building a prodigious private library and research center that  mapped a new field of study: the persistence of the ancient pagan world  into modernity, conceived as an ongoing psychic event. Exposed to what he  experienced as a relentless barrage of expressive images of passion\u2014\u201cpathos  formulas\u201d\u2014mediating archaic trauma, Warburg sought but could not find relief in  the promise of aesthetic sublimation. The seminar will pose one central  question which bears on the larger problems of communication (between subjects,  between past and present) under the conditions of modernity: is Warburg\u2019s  pathos formula best understood as an image, a symbol, a symptom, a metaphor, a  talisman, an avatar, a memory, or a packet of psychic energy?  His  person, his library (which was transported from Hamburg to London in 1933 and  survives intact), and his gnomic writings serve as a crossroads where many  paths of thought meet, throughout the twentieth century and into our  own. The seminar will relocate Warburg among the thinkers who  shaped him, including Darwin, Nietzsche, Burckhardt, and Usener; relate him to  the art history of his day as practiced by Schlosser, Riegl, W\u00f6lfflin,  Schmarsow, and Panofsky; coordinate his thought with the biological sciences,  early anthropology, the study of archaic ritual and religion, the spheres of  modern ornament, design, and dance, the emergence of the technological media  including cinema, and the Husserlian \u201ccrisis of the sciences\u201d; and finally  consider his reception by Cassirer, Benjamin, Gombrich, Ginzburg, Agamben, and  Didi-Huberman. Reading of knowledge of German required.        GERM-GA1700  - Romanticism: Drives of Romanticism, 1900/1800 - Elisabeth Bronfen &amp; Leif  Weatherby  (1)  To participate in the celebration of the Wagner year, the first part of the  seminar will look at unconventional traces of both his libretti and scores in  Classic Hollywood. At issue, as we look at Tristan and Isolde, Tannh\u00e4user and  Holl\u00e4nder, is both the obsession with the psychological struggle between law  and desire as well as the redemption death is claimed to afford. What also  drives this crossmapping, however, is the wager that in the 20th century cinema  appropriates but also signficiantly refigures Wagner's Gesamtkunstwerk  project  (2)  From here, the course will go back to the future, focusing on German  Romanticism and its re-readings in philosophy of technology in the 20th and  21st centuries. Here we will read Hoffmann with Kittler, H\u00f6lderlin with  Heidegger, Novalis with Blumenberg, and others. The complementary  wager of the second part of the course is that the pretense of  Romantic art--post-revolutionary, \"post\"-Enlightenment--has a great  deal to do with the end of the so-called \"techne-physis analogy.\" If  \"technology\" was freed from its metaphysical moorings in the long  18th century, then how does it anticipate later Romantic aesthetics, and what  might it have to say about our contemporary situation?  GERM-GA1842  - Nietzsche\u2019s Impact on 20th Century Thought - Friedrich Ulfers  The  objective of the seminar is to show how Nietzsche revolutionized Western  philosophy by transforming its dualistic-metaphysical worldview into a holistic  one that corresponds to the reality of the world as one interrelated,  processual whole. It will also show how this transformation influenced  significantly what is known as \u201cContinental Philosophy,\u201d which includes such  figures as Heidegger, Derrida, and Deleuze.  Particular  attention will be paid to the meaning of Nietzsche\u2019s pronouncement that \u201cGod is  dead\u201d; his declaration that the world is \u201cWill to Power \u201d and an \u201caesthetic  phenomenon\u201d; and his idea of \u201cEternal Recurrence.\u201d Also discussed will be the  role language plays in Nietzsche\u2019s view on epistemology and ontology, his  revaluation of morality, and his influence on the arts.       GERM-GA2610 - Special Topics in Theory: What\u2019s  Happening? EVENT in Philosophy, Literature, Psychoanalysis - Avital Ronell  A  sequel to last year\u2019s seminar on Derrida, et. al. and the Event, we will  explore motifs such as love and catastrophe in exemplary literary and  philosophical texts. Students are urged to have read thoroughly at  least one book by the instructor in preparation for outstanding discussions.       GERM-GA3000 - Independent Research - Avital  Ronell   SPRING  2013  GERM-GA1116  - Origins of Critical Thought II:Renaissance and Modernity  (Seminar and Texts in German) - Eckart Goebel  This  seminar examines modern texts dealing with the legacy of the European  Renaissance. We will read works by Walter Pater, Jacob Burckhardt, Ernst  Kantorowicz, Erwin Panofsky, and Hans Blumenberg.Participation in this class  does not require previous attendance of the fall 2012 seminar on Renaissance  &amp; Reformation. In preparation, it might be useful, however, to study some  of the texts, with which the authors mentioned above are dealing, such as  Shakespeare\u2019s King Richard the Second .  GERM-GA1219  - The Information Society: By Chance \u2013 Literature and Mathematics - Hans-Christian von Herrmann       In  E.A. Poe's 1844 short story \"The purloined letter\" private  investigator Auguste Dupin is able to close the case because he is gifted with  a certain talent which is in fact an amalgam of a poetic and a mathematical  attitude towards the world. The seminar's ambition is to decipher this  mysterious mindset by consulting Jacques Lacan's famous reading of Poe's text  including its detour in the fields of information theory and cybernetics. In a  second step the seminar will pass on to other literary texts by Heinrich von  Kleist, Jorge Luis Borges and Hans Magnus Enzensberger in order to follow up  the traces of the modern interplay of literature and mathematics.  GERM-GA1698  - Photography and the World: Theories of Photography from the Medium\u2019s  Inception to the Present -   Ulrich Baer        We  live in an illustrated world, and photographs often determine political,  personal, and even the most private of decisions. Who is guilty and who is  exonerated; who gets elected and who loses the vote; who and what we favor or  despise, will get to know, desire, remember or forget depends on how someone or  something has been presented in a photograph. Today more images are produced  daily than in the entire history of photography from 1839 until the mass  production of digital cameras. There is great danger in this development and  immense potential to free ourselves from existing constraints, too. The skills  required to interpret photographs is related to our capacity of gauging the  role of images in our imagination. It behooves us to know how to turn the  current plethora of pictures into tools with which to shape the world we share  with others.  This  interdisciplinary seminar explores how photographic images create meaning, and  how thinkers have responded to photography \u2013 as a phenomenon to be reckoned  with lest it overwhelms our critical faculties. How do we make sense of the  ways in which photographs shape our experience of being in the world \u2013 and how  do we shape our own lives amidst this flood of images? What does the world  mean, in a photograph, and how do we distinguish this meaning from the world  outside of photography? What is the relation between meaning, photography, and  a worldview? Is it possible to experience someone\u2019s else\u2019s world through  photographs? What is the relation between worlds and worldviews, and what role  do images play in this relationship?       We  will read theoretical and other texts on visuality and photography (Baudelaire,  Kracauer, Panofsky, Benjamin, Barthes, Sontag, Batchen, Derrida, Flusser,  Cadava, Ranci\u00e8re, Enwezor, and others), and look at a wide range of photographs  from the inception of the medium to the present to test theories of photography  against the medium\u2019s uncanny and unrivaled power to evoke the real.  GERM-GA2703 - Poetics and Theory Seminar: Short  Fiction ( Seminar and Texts in German) - Katja Lange-M\u00fcller &amp;  Alys George  This  comparative seminar traces the \u201cmigration\u201d of short fiction between Germany and  America. It also focuses on how literary markets and the economy of production  have shaped the economy of form. From its beginnings in the European novella (Boccaccio)  and the German literary Kalendergeschichte (Hebel, Kleist), short fiction made  its way to America and was transformed with the flourishing of the short story  in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The conventions of the American  short story then took hold in Germany, where they have influenced postwar  literature to the present. We look, finally, at flash fiction/microfiction and  toward the future of short(est) fiction. Our focus is on close textual  analysis, and authors will be paired, e.g.: Twain and Hebel; Poe and Kafka;  Hemingway and Rothmann; Melville and Kleist; McCullers and Hermann; Carver and  Schulze. We also consider classification debates in theoretical essays by  Schlegel, James, O\u2019Connor, Lange-M\u00fcller, and Oates.  After  the spring recess acclaimed writer and Bachmann-Preis-winner Katja Lange-M\u00fcller  will co-teach the seminar and will discuss role of short fiction in the German  and American literary traditions, as well as her own work in the form. Non-NYU  students who wish to audit the second portion of the course only are welcome.    FALL  2012  GERM-GA.1004  - Image and Text: Psychic Visuality \u2013 E.T.A. Hoffmann and Hitchcock - Elizabeth Bronfen  Hitchcock,  who was on the set in Babelsberg Studios (Berlin) in 1924 when Murnau filmed The  Last Man , brought the demonic screen expressionist film had perfected in  Weimar Germany to Hollywood in 1940, and with it a legacy of the German  romantic Nachtst\u00fcck . This block seminar will cross map three films from  his mature period \u2013 Vertigo , Rear Window and Psycho \u2013 onto  novellas by E.T.A. Hoffmann, in an attempt to reconstruct this line of  association. At issue is the manner in which both the Gothic novella and the  Hollywood thriller engage a visualization of psychic disorders. A second point  of connection is that both artists are great technicians who offer  self-reflexive commentaries on their respective medium. Finally, as masters of  aesthetic artifice, both pit intense emotions against textual play, with  Hoffmann's romantic irony reflected and refracted in Hitchcock's dark humor.   GERM-GA.1115  - Origins of German Critical Thought I: Renaissance &amp; Reformation I - Eckart Goebel    This  course offers an introduction to key texts from the 15th and 16th  centuries. Since each of the complex works we read provides so many insights  that one could organize an entire class around any one of them, the goal is  merely to make first contact with the world of Renaissance and Reformation. The  research interest I pursue with this class is the \u2018history of the soul\u2019 in  early modernity as well as the history of melancholia. The reading load is  admittedly high, and it might be even useful to have, in addition, a closer  look at some seminal works from Greek and Roman antiquity over the summer, such  as Plato\u2019s Symposium , Aristoteles\u2019 De Anima , Cicero\u2019s De  Officiis , his Tusculanae Disputationes , and St. Augustine\u2019s Confessiones .  We will read all texts in English translations.  I  intend to continue this class in spring with a seminar on the reception of  Renaissance &amp; Reformation in modernity from Goethe, Burckhardt, and  Nietzsche to Cassirer, Panofsky, and Kantorowicz.

We will explore political works,  psychoanalysis, music, and film. Expect sparks.  GERM-  GA.3000 - Independent Research        GERM-GA.1512  - Kafka - Friedrich Ulfers  The  course will deal with Kafka\u2019s work largely in the light of the author\u2019s  preoccupation with language, particularly with the way this preoccupation  affected his writing, indeed provided the topic of it.       The  point of departure will be the experience of \u201clanguage crisis\u201d among  intellectuals and writers in turn of the century Austria, which led to the  radical criticism of conceptual or referential language\u2013 already foreshadowed  by Nietzsche \u2013 of Fritz Mauthner and Ludwig Wittgenstein, among others.  The  course will then show Kafka\u2019s response to this crisis: his insight that  conceptual/referential language and oppositional/binary involves an abstraction  of the \u201ctruth\u201d or the \u201creal,\u201d which is only apprehensible in a space of radical  undecidability between opposites, demanding a language of irreducible  allusiveness, a language that is constitutive of Kafka\u2019s texts.       In  the context of this undecidability and allusivesness, which Kafka attributes to  his \u201cdreamlike inner life\u201d that he claims informs his writing, his becoming  \u201cliterature,\u201d Freud\u2019s The Interpretation of Dreams will be used as a  reference. In this work Freud asserts that many psychological \u201cprocesses which  are described as irrational are not in fact falsification of normal  processes\u2014intellectual errors\u2014but are modes of activity of the psychical  apparatus that have been freed from an inhibition\u201d (Freud 644), and that in  dream thinking, \u201cEach train of thought is almost invariably accompanied by its  contradictory counterpart, linked with it by antithetical association\u201d (Freud  346). It will be shown that Kafka\u2019s texts are suffused with this kind of  thinking, a thinking that allows opposites to coexist as a both/and that never  achieves resolution. As Freud puts it: \u201cBoth of the alternatives [of a logical  opposition] are usually inserted in the text of the dream as though they were  equally valid\u201d (Freud 351).  Another  context in which Kafka\u2019s writing will be read in this seminar is that of  contemporary Continental Philosophy, especially the texts of Deleuze and  Derrida that have interpreted Kafka\u2019s writing in terms of the alterity of a  \u201cminor literature\u201d and the putting in question of judgment and the law,  respectively.       The  seminar will then deal with Kafka\u2019s insight into the inherent violence involved  in any conceptual understanding, in relation to which literature, that is,  poetic or radically metaphorical language functions as a countermeasure in that  it has the capacity of \u201cun-judging\u201d the real, leaving us with texts that  constitute an embrace of infinite relationality and the concomitant  undecidability.  Finally,  we will look at Kafka\u2019s writing in terms of the possibility of embodying an  inherent ethical aspect insofar as it constitutes freedom from truth as  the tyranny of univocity and teleology towards the truth of an  a-topical, endlessly de-territorializing and metamorphosing world. As such,  this truth is always already other in relation with itself, and thus ethical in  its irreducible self-less-ness, its inherent openness to, and interrelatedness  with, the other. It would be the ethical structure of the \u201cgiven\u201d - not the  anthropomorphically instrumentalized world - in which its interpenetrating  parts exist \u201cpoetically,\u201d as metamorphic units that constitute an \u201cethics of  alterity,\u201d that is, an irreducible responsiveness and responsibility to the  other as other.   SPRING 2012  GERM-GA.1698 \u2013 Photography and the  World - Ulrich Baer          GERM-GA.1720 \u2013 Echoes of Antiquity:  Translatio Romae - Barbara Vinken  Marx remarked in his 18 brumaire of  Napol\u00e9on Bonaparte , History comes always back twice: first as tragedy, than  as farce. Roughly up to the beginning of the 20th century Europe and the United  States told and thought their History in terms of antique History that was a  basso continuo to all political conflicts and imperial enterprises. Our focus  will not be on Greek, but on Roman History. In the United States, as well as in  France, Germany and Italy, political realities were spelled out in Roman terms.  If most people agreed that History is nothing but a repetion of Roman History,  it is very much a question if this is a blessing or a curse. And what Roman  History comes back? Is the Roman Republic restored, are the civil wars coming  back, or are people to live in an Empire sine fine? It is in literary texts  that these questions are most subtly asked and answered. The most interesting  and influential texts like Schiller, Kleist, Leopardi, Hugo, Baudelaire,  Flaubert, and James will be submitted to a close reading in order to disclose  their hidden Roman intertexts.       GERM-GA.2703 \u2013 Poetics and Theory  Seminar: Literature &amp; Film (Taught in English) - Daniel Kehlmann and Eckart Goebel  The seminar investigates the  transformations literary texts undergo when they are turned into feature films.  The seminar also addresses the consequences the invention of film had for  writing: Is the potential of \u2018filmability\u2019 always inscribed in literature, and  if so, what exactly does \u2018filmability\u2019 mean?       The trajectory of this class leads us  from classics such as Schloendorff\u2019s acclaimed adaptation of Musil\u2019s early  novel The Confusions of Young Toerless to the new movie based on Oscar  Wilde\u2019s notorious novel The Picture of Dorian Gray of 2009. After the  spring recess acclaimed author Daniel Kehlmann will co-teach the seminar, and  will discuss with us not only No Country for Old Men and Radetzky March   but also his own novels Fame and Measuring the World ,  currently produced as films. Daniel Kehlmann will discuss his film scripts with  us, which will provide us with new insights into the relation of film and  literature.  Students from outside NYU, who prefer  to audit the second part of this seminar only, are welcome to do so.          GERM-GA.1513 \u2013 Bertolt Brecht - Robert Cohen  Brecht's oeuvre can be read as a  radical critique of philosophical, theoretical, political, economic, and  aesthetic discourses from Aristotle to Marx, Luk\u00e1cs, and Benjamin. It is a work  forever in progress, a collection of unstable and endlessly revised texts  exploring the human condition in a time of class struggle, violence, and war.       The Seminar is conceived as a general  introduction to Brecht's work. Topics include the experience of the modern  metropolis; the disintegration of social and sexual relations; the destruction  of identity and the construction of a 'collective individuality;' Brecht's  Marxism and his contribution to a new dialectics; Brecht and the Weimar  avant-garde.  Discussions based on close readings of  poetry, plays, prose, and theoretical writings will focus on the way meaning is  produced through Brecht's performative and gestural (\"Gestus\") use of  language; as well as through his use of modernist literary techniques such as  montage, fragmentation, and distanciation/alienation (\"Verfremdung\").       GERM-GA.3000  \u2013 Independent Research    FALL 2011  GERM-GA.1410 - Goethe: Eros and  Thanatos: Goethe\u2019s Psychology - Eckart  Goebel  Aus schwer erfindlichen Gr\u00fcnden gilt  Goethe zuweilen als \u201anaiv\u2018.       Das Seminar studiert, in Abwandlung  eines Titels von Max Kommerell \u00fcber - Schiller, \u201aGoethe als Psychologe\u2018.  Gelesen werden bekannte Texte des Dichters im Hinblick auf das in ihnen  \u00fcberreich ausgebreitete Wissen um die Seele des Menschen.  For not really convincing reasons  Goethe is regarded here and there as being \u2018naive.\u2018 In reaction to this cliche  this seminar studies, \u2018Goethe as psychologist.\u2018 We will re-read famous texts in  order to learn about Goethe\u2019s abysmal knowledge concerning the human soul, and  its vissicitudes.       GERM-GA.1650: Visual Culture:  Configurations of the Night   - Elisabeth Bronfen  Night is a double of the day, a comment  on diurnal activities, a counter site to the ordinary. It prompts a thinking  closer to imagination than reason. While philosophy's theoria is based  on the promise of bringing illumination, and as such is of and for   the day, literature and visual arts engage a nocturnal side of knowledge. This  course will cross map theory's tropic use of night onto aesthetic enactments of  the night as a stage and state of mind. Looking at the way both sustain the  antagonism between days' reason and night's magical thinking we will read  Mozart's Magic Flute with Foucault's \"piece of night each carries  within,\"; Shakespeare's Midsummer Night's Dream with Freud's  \"navel of the dream\"; Schnitzler's \"Dream Novella\" with  Hegel's \"night of the world\"; Scorsese's Taxi Driver with  Blanchot's \"autre nuit\".       GERM-GA.2610 - Special Topics in Theory:  The Debilitated Subject - Avital  Ronell and Slavoj Zizek  GERM-GA. 1842 - Nietzsche\u2019s Impact on  20th Century Thought - Friedrich  Ulfers       Objective of the seminar: The objective  of the seminar is to show how Nietzsche revolutionized Western philosophy by transforming  its dualistic-metaphysical worldview into a holistic one that corresponds to  the reality of the world as one interrelated whole. It will also show how this  transformation influenced significantly what is known as \"Continental  Philosophy,\" which includes such figures as Heidegger, Derrida, and  Deleuze.  Particular attention will be paid to  the meaning of Nietzsche\u2019s pronouncement that \"God is dead,\" his  declaration that the world is \"Will to Power\" and an \"aesthetic  phenomenon,\" and his idea of \"Eternal Recurrence.\" Also  discussed will be the role language plays in Nietzsche\u2019s view on epistemology  and ontology, his revaluation of morality and his influence on the arts.       GERM-GA.3000 \u2013 Independent Research  SPRING 2011  G51.1655: Archive, Image,  Text - Ulrich Baer, Shelley  Rice   G51.1116: Origins of  Critical Thought II: Heidegger and Adorno - Eckart  Goebel  The course, conducted in German, offers  a slow line-by-line reading of Martin Heidegger\u2019s book on Sein und Zeit from  1926. Halfway through the semester, we will start a close reading of Th. W.  Adorno\u2019s Negative Dialektik from 1966, focusing mainly on Adorno\u2019s  Heidegger-critique. The course is intended to provide students with strong  theoretical interests, a detailed knowledge of two seminal texts of 20th  century thought. Finally, we might also consult Max Horkheimer\u2019s Eclipse of  Reason , however, that will be determined at a later date.  G51.2703: Poetics &amp;  Theory Seminar: Writing Animals -  Marcel Beyer  This seminar examines \"writing  animals\" in a dual sense: both animals that write and the writing on  animals. At stake is the animal as a figure of imagination, of the work of  imagination in the creative process.        G51.1945: Post-World War II  Mordernism: Max Frisch and Peter Weiss - Robert Cohen  Max Frisch and Peter Weiss were key  figures in the reconstitution of (West-) German post-World War II litera\u00adture,  though \u2013 or maybe because \u2013 neither was German. Their works are both  paradigmatic of, and different from, the literature of their German  contemporaries (Andersch, B\u00f6ll, Koeppen, Walser) that emerged out of the  collapse of Germany. From vantage points located at the periphery of German  culture (Switzerland in the case of Frisch, Sweden for Peter Weiss) the two  authors functioned as seismographs reacting to post-war reality. Their use of  innovative and avant-gardist forms in drama and prose reflects the problematic  recovering of the recent past and decoding of a complex present.       After prose works exploring the  immediate post-war trauma and reconstituting the (literary) subject, both  Frisch and Weiss turned to drama with works focusing on anti-Semitism and  Auschwitz. These plays will be read against theoretical writings by Sartre and  Adorno.  Frisch and Weiss's evolution from  modernist to late-modernist/post-modernist writing will be traced through their  late works which dissolve narrative certainty and signal a new kind of text  with unstable meanings and uncertain chronologies. In order to situate these  works in the aesthetic and literary context of the postwar period, two sessions  will be devoted to theories of modernism, the avant-garde, and postmodernism.  Beyond \u2013 and before \u2013 all the topical  issues these works evoke, however, they need to be understood as literature. Discussions  will be based on close readings of the texts, on their narrative and dramatic  structures, and on the way meaning is produced in literary texts.  G51.3000: Independent Research  FALL 2010  G51.1111 \u2013 EXEMPLARY TEXTS: Traces of  Modernity (Benjamin, Bloch, Kracauer, Adorno) - Paul Fleming  This course investigates four seminal  texts written on and about the margins of modernity: Kracauer\u2019s Mass Ornament,  Bloch\u2019s Traces, Benjamin\u2019s One-Way Street, and Adorno\u2019s Minima Moralia. At  stake in each of these works is a protocol of reading that takes the seemingly  insignificant \u2013 surface structures, minor details, popular sayings, fragmented  memories \u2013 as the entrance to the deeper structures that define modern society  and thought.       G51.2610 - Special Topics in  Theory: How to read -   Avital Ronell  Beginning with Heidegger's important  text, _What is Called Thinking?_ the class will explore exemplary texts that  turn against themselves as they face down ruling cognitive regimens. If you  have understood the first sentence of this course description, you do not need  to take the class. Otherwise, be prepared to train rhetorically, and with  critical finesse, in order to confront some genuinely demanding textual events  of the canon. Students can expect to get close to major axioms and theoretical  concerns of selected texts by Barbara Johnson, Paul de Man and Derrida while  also confronting technological installations, paranoid utterance, political  reactivity, historical registers of anxiety and traumatic forgetting. Nearly  every work under consideration engages literature in essential ways, so  theoryheads must be prepared to read and submit to poetic language.       Smart undergraduates are also welcome,  but should obtain permission from the professor.  G51.1550 \u2013 German Poetry: German  Symbolism - Eckart  Goebel       This graduate seminar will follow the  contours of an art at the limits of (traditional) art by means of closely  reading George, Hofmannsthal, and Rilke. The poetry of German symbolism \u2013 and  this is the hypothesis to be discussed in class \u2013 is understood less as last  feverish shivers of Romanticism but rather as modern literature on the  threshold. German symbolism \u2013 the art of crisis emerging from the crisis of art  \u2013 points towards the Avant-garde movements of the 20th century on the one hand,  and towards charismatic leadership as the modern myth on the other.  The reading of lyrical poetry and  lyrical drama will be prepared by a careful study of the black bible of  aestheticism and pessimism: Arthur Schopenhauer\u2019s The World as Will and  Representation. Schopenhauer\u2019s influence on European writers from Flaubert to  Kafka, Beckett, and Bernhard can hardly be overrated. Reading his book, ending  with the word \u201cnichts,\u201d may also serve as an introduction to the concept of  \u201cnihilism,\u201d haunting an art on the verge of silence.       G51.1600 \u2013 Theory Clashes: The  Persistence of the Theologico \u2013 Political   - Avital Ronell, Slavoj Zizek, and Fran\u00e7ois Noudelman  The question of political theology has  become an increasingly important concern for students of literary and political  theory, religious studies, and philosophy. Starting off the course, Professor  Ronell will be hosting and engaging world renowned philosophers Slavoj Zizek  and Fran\u00e7ois Noudelmann on crucial aspects of political theology ranging from  the works of Jean-Luc Nancy on the deconstruction of Christianity to Derrida on  religion (Ronell) and the concept of the absent Third in Sartre, Ranci\u00e8re, and  Negri (Noudelmann).  G51.2250 - Post 1945 Germany: Polemics,  Provocation, Pop - Elke  Siegel  G51.1512 \u2013 Kafka - Friedrich Ulfers  The course will deal with Kafka\u2019s work  largely in the light of the author\u2019s preoccupation with language particularly  with the way this preoccupation affected his writing, indeed provided the theme  of it. The point of departure will be the experience of \u201clanguage crisis\u201d among  intellectuals and writers in turn of the century Austria, which led to the  radical language criticism \u2013 already foreshadowed by Nietzsche \u2013 of Fritz  Mauthner and Ludwig Wittgenstein among others. An interpretation of Kafka\u2019s  work aims to show not only the influences of this thinking on his writing, but  also how Kafka radicalized it so as to make it \u201cKafkaesque.\u201d Another aspect of  the course will be to examine Kafka as anticipating a line of writing and  thinking that could be described as deconstructive. In this context,  undecidability, the breakdown of referential language and irreducible  allusiveness will be shown as constitutive of Kafka\u2019s texts. This will  also be the context to discuss the problematization of the real, of judgment,  of justice, and the law that suffuses Kafka\u2019s writing.  SPRING 2010  G51.3399: Comparative Poetics:  Lyric Poetry - Prof. Ulrich Baer  This course is taught in English and  originates in the Comparative Literature Department.  A seminar that examines different  approaches to lyric poetry as a genre, a sensibility, a mood (Stimmung).  Particular emphasis will be placed on the modern lyric from formalist,  historicist, rhetorical/deconstructive, hermeneutic, cultural-sociological  (materialist), literary historical, philosophical perspectives. We will examine  how lyric poetry teaches us about these approaches and the relationship between  them, and to what extent poems contains their own ars poetica (\u201cthe art of  poetry\u201d)\u2013 or how reading poetry can teach us how to read in general. We will focus on a selection of poems  by the following authors: Sappho, Pindar, Du Fu, Li Po; William Wordsworth,  Percy Bysshe Shelley, John Keats, Robert Browning; Emily Dickinson, Walt  Whitman, Wallace Stevens, Elizabeth Bishop, Anne Carson; Friedrich H\u00f6lderlin,  Rainer Maria Rilke; Charles Baudelaire, St\u00e9phane Mallarm\u00e9, Paul Celan; Yehuda  Amichai, Octavio Paz.  The seminar will instruct students in  basic and advanced skills of interpreting lyric poetry, and in recognizing the  differences between periods, forms, and poets. It is also intended as a  reflection on the field of comparative literature by reading comparatively a  range of poets from distinct backgrounds and traditions. We will also compare existing  methodologies in the interpretation of literary works.  G51.1863: Psychoanlysis &amp;  Philosophy: Genealogies of Psychoanalysis -   Prof. Larry Rickels      Psychoanalysis, as institution of  higher yearning, is open to the address of the Superhuman, the Psycho, and the  Android. The following movies will be referred to  during class discussions: Batman Forever, Batman Returns, Dr. No, From  Russia with Love, Octopussy, Psycho, Halloween, Nightmare on Elm Street, Blade  Runner, Total Recall, and Minority Report .    G51.2912: Literature &amp;  Philosophy: Decadence -  Prof. Eckart Goebel       In his diaries young Robert Musil  portrays himself as \u201cMonsieur le vivisecteur,\u201d and thus provides this graduate  course on \u201cd\u00e9cadence\u201d with a certain perspective on a European movement. We  will read some famous texts from the 19th century from Pater to Wilde focusing  on their insights into the less boring aspects of the conditio humana, psychological,  physiological, sexual, and artistic subtleties: \u201cBeing natural is simply a  pose, and the most irritating pose I know\u201d (Wilde). The second part of the  class will discuss seminal works from the 20th century which were, for example  by Georg Luk\u00e1cs, banned as documents of \u201cbourgeois decadence,\u201d such as the  works of Kafka, and even Beckett. \u201cI think he is a little deranged,\u201d the  narrator says about Bartleby who prefers not to function in Downtown Manhattan.  The seminar intends to discuss the critical potential of those who are a little  deranged, dysfunctional, d\u00e9goutant, or decadent.  G51.1513: Brecht - Prof. Robert Cohen  Dialogical and intertextual to the  core, Brecht's oeuvre can be seen as an open-ended critical conversation with  philosophical, theoretical, political, economic, and aesthetic discourses from  Aristotle to Marx, Luk\u00e1cs, and Benjamin, as well as with readers and  theatergoers, with collaborators, colleagues and lovers. The result of these  conversations is a work in progress, a collection of unstable and endlessly revised  texts exploring the human experience in a time of class struggle, violence, and  war.  The course is conceived as a general  introduction to Brecht's work. Topics include the experience of the modern  metropolis; the disintegration of social and sexual relations; the destruction  of identity and the construction of a 'collective individuality;' Brecht's  Marxism and his contribution to a new dialectics; Brecht's formal innovations  in drama and poetry, and his theater theories.  Before any of the controversies which  Brecht's work evokes, it needs to be understood as literature. Discussions in  class will be based on close readings of the texts \u2013 poetry, plays, and  theoretical writings \u2013 and on the way meaning is produced through Brecht's  performative use of language (\" Gestus \"), as well as through  his use of modern\u00ad\u00adist literary techniques such as montage, frag\u00admen\u00adtation,  repetition, and distanciation/alienation (\"Verfremdung\").  FALL 2009  G51.1716 - Autobiographical Writing:  The Day in Writing (Diaries)   - Prof. Elke Siegel Das Tagebuch \u2013 in seiner modernen  Erscheinung seit dem 18. Jahrhundert als \u2018pers\u00f6nliches Tagebuch\u2019 \u2013 bereitet der  Literaturwissenschaft Schwierigkeiten, die ins Herz ihrer g\u00e4ngigen  Begrifflichkeiten \u2013 etwa Autorschaft und Gattung \u2013 treffen. Wie \u2013 dies eine  Fragen im Zentrum der Arbeit in diesem Seminar \u2013 ist ein solches  fragmentarisches Schreiben zu lesen, begreift man das Tagebuch nicht vorrangig  als Steinbruch f\u00fcr Informationen zu Biographie und Werkgeschichte oder als  historisches Dokument? Die Spannung von Ich und Welt, Alltag und Geschichte,  Subjektivit\u00e4t und Objektivit\u00e4t, \u00d6ffentlichkeit und Privatheit, Fiktion und  Dokumentarismus \u00f6ffnet und verhandelt jedes einzelne Tagebuch neu. Damit  widersteht dieses Schreiben am Rande der Form verallgemeinernden Bestimmungen.  Im Seminar werden wir uns mit ausgew\u00e4hlten Tageb\u00fcchern der deutschsprachigen  Literatur vom 18. bis zum 20. Jahrhundert besch\u00e4ftigen und dabei auch  beobachten, wie TagebuchautorInnen sich auf die Tageb\u00fccher anderer beziehen und  damit literarische Traditionslinien er\u00f6ffnen und/oder verweigern. Wir werden \u2013  in G\u00e4nze oder Ausz\u00fcgen \u2013 die Tageb\u00fccher u.a. folgender Autoren und Autorinnen  lesen: Lavater, Goethe, Hebbel, Grillparzer, Kafka, Doderer, J\u00fcnger, Frisch,  Frank, Wolf, Goetz, Gr\u00fcnbein, dies vor dem Hintergrund theoretischer  Interventionen von, z.B., Barthes, Genette und Blanchot. Besondere  Aufmerksamkeit wird dabei dem Problem des Autobiographischen (Philippe Lejeune)  gelten, sowie der Frage nach dem Verh\u00e4ltnis von Alltag und Schreiben.  Welche Rolle \u2013 dies eine der m\u00f6glichen  weiteren Fragen, die im Seminar zur Diskussion stehen werden \u2013 kommt dem  Tagebuch in der Geschichte des Subjekts zu? Welche Bedeutung erh\u00e4lt dabei der  Akt der Relekt\u00fcre des eigenen Tagebuchs? Registriert das Tagebuch den Tag oder  versucht es, ein Leben, einen Lebensplan zu projizieren? Und wie ist es um die  Literarizit\u00e4t des Tagebuchs bestellt? Handelt es sich bei dem im Datum  verankerten Schreiben gar um eine sch\u00fctzende Geste vor den Gefahren des  Schreibens und der Zeit, die das Subjekt zu zerschlagen drohen?    G51.2700 - TPCS: Representations of  Death - Prof.  Elisabeth Bronfen  The act of dying is something one can  expect or something one can witness. Yet it defies all unmediated articulation.  Representations of death, in turn, can be horrifying, fascinating or morally  elevating. In all cases, however, death has been translated into an image or a  story, and as such contained. The mortality we experience is not our own; the  medium we engage with is not the materiality of the mortal body but the  mediality of aesthetic signs. Death is the limit of representation but also one  of its most seminal sources of inspiration. The seminar will engage this  complex interface between death and represenation by looking at fictions  (Goethe's Elective Affinities, Poe's Tales and Sketches), Hitchcock's late  trilogy (Rear Window, Vertigo, Psycho), Freud's speculations on death, as well  as recycling of death photography (Andy Warhol, Jeff Wall).       G51.1112 - Problems in Critical Theory:  Metaphors, Examples, Anecdotes   - Prof. Paul Fleming  The course will explore the role of  para-theoretical (e.g., poetic, rhetorical, and narrative) elements within  philosophy and critical theory. In particular, it will examine the status of  the literary-rhetorical elements as at once illuminating and obscuring thought,  whereby the didactic function of metaphors, examples, and anecdotes lies in  compelling the reader to continually return to and hermeneutically re-examine  the material. The central focus will be on metaphors, examples, and anecdotes  in Western thought from Plato and the Bible to Classical rhetoric (Horace and  Quinitilian) to contemporary theory (DeMan, Derrida, Benjamin, and Blumenberg).  G51.2912 - Literature &amp; Philosophy:  Hegel, Freud, &amp; Literature   - Prof. Avital Ronell &amp; Prof. Slavoj Zizek  G51.1824 - Nietzsche's Impact on 20th  Century Thought - Prof.  Friedrich Ulfers  The objective of the seminar is to show  how Nietzsche revolutionized Western philosophy by transforming its dualistic-metaphysical  worldview into a holistic one that corresponds to the reality of the world as  one interrelated, processual whole. It will also show how this transformation  influenced significantly what is known as \u201cContinental Philosophy,\u201d which  includes such figures as Heidegger, Derrida, and Deleuze. Particular attention  will be paid to the meaning of Nietzsche\u2019s pronouncement that \u201cGod is dead\u201d;  his declaration that the world is \u201cWill to Power \u201d and an \u201caesthetic  phenomenon\u201d; and his idea of \u201cEternal Recurrence.\u201d Also discussed will be the  role language plays in Nietzsche\u2019s view on epistemology and ontology, his  revaluation of morality, and his influence on the arts.  G51.3000 - Independent Research   SPRING 2009   G51.2912 \u2013 Literature &amp; Philosophy:  Theories of Time - Prof. Paul North  In this class we will read texts that  consciously try to regain time as a concept, category, or intuition after the  European enlightenment. Following a singular development, starting from a  theorization of the transcendental subject of experience by means of time in  Kant, we will move toward the pointed dismantling of this configuration in  Heidegger, interestingly enough, also by means of time. Bookending the  course\u2014but not merely that\u2014the first and last volumes of Proust\u2019s In Search of  Lost Time will help explain the urgency that seems to characterize the gesture  toward time in what has been called \u201cmodernity.\u201d  G51.1720 \u2013 Echoes of Antiquity: Germany  and the Gre eks - Prof. John  Hamilton  This seminar investigates the rise and  development of German Philhellenism from Winckelmann to Heidegger. Topics  include antiquarianism and national identity; originality, genius, and  tradition; pedagogy and revolution; the formation of the lyrical subject;  representations of the classical body; Dionysus and theories of tragedy;  philology, classical scholarship, and institutional history .  G51.1919 \u2013 Literature of the Weimer  Period: Philosophical Anthropology   - Prof. Eckart Goebel       The course provides a careful close  reading of key texts on philosophical anthropology. We will start with Kant\u2019s  highly influential Anthropologie in pragmatischer Hinsicht, followed by a  reconstruction of Nietzsche\u2019s theory of civilization developed in his  Morgenr\u00f6te, focusing mainly on book 1. The second part of the seminar is meant  to discuss Arnold Gehlen\u2019s notorious book on Der Mensch (including an analysis  of the famous radio debate between Gehlen, and Adorno, provided in copy), as  well as a discussion of Martin Heidegger\u2019s critique of philosophical anthropology,  formulated in his book on Kant und das Problem der Metaphysik (including, as an  appendix, the seminal debate between Cassirer and Heidegger in Davos). The  seminar will provide background information on further reading, such as Helmuth  Plessner, Max Scheler, and Michel Foucault. Books: Immanuel Kant, Schriften zur  Anthropologie, Werkausgabe Bd. XII (Suhrkamp Taschenbuch) Friedrich Nietzsche,  Morgenr\u00f6the, Kritische Studienausgabe (dtv-Taschenbuch) Arnold Gehlen, Der  Mensch, Aula paperback Ausgabe Helmuth Plessner, Die Stufen des Organischen und  der Mensch, de Gruyter paperback  G51.1994 \u2013 Realism: Problems in 19th  Century Prose - Prof. Paul Fleming         This seminar is a systematic  introduction to the problems of representation in 19th-century prose, particularly  with respect to notions of the everyday, the ordinary, and the average. The  course explores to what extent language can produce a \u2018reality effect,\u2019 and  whether the quotidian, by means of such detailed description, necessarily leaps  into the realm of the exemplary. Authors include Tieck, Grillparzer, Keller,  Stifter, and Fontane.  G29.2640 - Romanticism &amp; Revolution - Prof. Richard Sieburth       The course will explore various  literary and philosophical reactions to the French Revolution during the late 18th  and early 19th centuries in Germany, England, and France.  FALL 2008  Goethe: The Art of Dilettantism - Paul Fleming  This seminar examines Goethe\u2019s  literature and thought through the prism of dilettantism, the art of doing  things in a non-professional manner. Dilettantism for Goethe is a modern  phenomenon, concomitant with the rise of the bourgeois subject, and is thus  inextricable from questions surrounding art, education, and knowledge since the  18th century. In addition to Goethe\u2019s poetry, prose, and drama, we will also  examine his aesthetic, scientific, and autobiographical writings. A further  focal point will be the reception of Goethe and the question of tradition.   Object Relations: Melanie Klein - Laurence Rickels (Visiting Professor)  The seminar will focus on the work of  Melanie Klein, its point of departure in Karl Abraham\u2019s reflections on  melancholia and its running commentary on (and continuity with) Freud\u2019s \u201csecond  system.\u201d The delegation of Klein\u2019s thought proceeds via a series of controversies:  Klein\u2019s followers were largely guided and contextualized via the contest with  the \u201cAnna Freudians\u201d in London in the 1940s, while Klein\u2019s reception today (in  the humanities) is inflected by the ambivalent revalorization of her work  within French Freud.  War, Text, Image - Elisabeth Bronfen (Distinguished  Global Professor of German)       War: Literally a state of open, armed,  often prolonged, conflict carried on between nations, states, or parties.  Figuratively a condition of active antagonism or contention. War is not only a  concrete condition but also a trope for all the other antagonisms that  structure our sense of who we are, what our relation is to the world, and how  others relate to us. Point of departure for this seminar is the question why  the political situation of embattlement has served so resiliently as theme,  scene, topos and Denkfigur in our cultural imagination. The seminar will  involve four domains of inquiry: 1. Shakespeare's Henry V and its  cinematic afterlife; 2. Kleist's Penthesilea and the battle of the  sexes; 3. Cinematic enactments of battlescenes; and 4. Cultural theoretical  issues involved in the representation of war.   SPRING 2008  Interdisciplinary approaches to  Literature: German Music and Letters   - Prof. John Hamilton  This seminar examines the history of  music and music theory in specific relation to German literature, philosophy,  and criticism. Particular focus is given to the employment of music as a  privileged metaphor in literary projects as well as music\u2019s distance from and appropriation  of verbal and linguistic structures. Session topics include: theories of the  harmony of the spheres; synaesthesia, Romanticism and Universalpoesie ;  Wagner, tragedy and the Gesamtkunstwerk ; absolute music and the  tone-poem; secularization and the rise of chromatization; the semiotics of  music; and music and psychoanalysis. Historical and cultural contexts will be  presented as a number of predominant theoretical questions are developed,  including but not limited to the following: the presumed immediacy or  singularity of musical expression versus the mediation or abstraction of verbal  language; the relation of tonal language and text; the reciprocal,  philosophical critique of music and poetry; the \u201cliteralization\u201d of music;  patriotism, nationalism, and racism. The course ends with a close reading of  Thomas Mann\u2019s Doktor Faustus , a novel that is profoundly critical  of, while being thoroughly informed by, the tradition outlined here.          Archive, Image, Text - Prof. Ulrich Baer  This interdisciplinary seminar explores  the role of the archive as the actual and conceptual origin or grounding  context of much, if not all, research in the arts and humanities. Virtually all  intellectual inquiry into artistic and humanistic expression \u2013 whether we are  considering artworks, literary texts or scholarly productions \u2013 ultimate makes  reference to one authoritative version of the object under discussion. This  version is most frequently housed in some kind of actual or virtual archive  from where the work is canonized, and effectively put into circulation.  The archive is supposed to guarantee  authenticity while permitting revisions and rethinking of the humanistic  heritage. The archive is thus at once the solid reference point and grounding  origin of scholarly work, and the site where prevailing views are most  effectively challenged or overthrown. This class will examine two particular  aspects of this process: the notion of the archive as an actual physical  location that houses actual objects and artifacts beyond an artist\u2019s lifespan,  and the metaphor of the archive as the receptacle of past knowledge and a  work\u2019s inalienable history. Different types of archives and issues will be  addressed, since we will include literary works, art objects, political  documents, racial and national repositories as well as technological storage  \u201cspaces\u201d in our discussions. Guest speakers, experts on various types of  research materials, will supplement lectures by the two professors, who  specialize in the history and theory of modern texts and images respectively.  Updating classical concepts of the archive, we will try to examine how new  technologies are rapidly changing both the nature and the power of information,  and thus its repositories.  Anna Seghers, Christa Wolf &amp; Theory  of Narration - Prof. Robert Cohen  The works of Seghers and Wolf have  acquired iconic status. They appear overdetermined by their authors' identities  as women, as communists, as Jewish (Seghers) or Protestant (Wolf), as Nazi  victims (Seghers) or perpetrators (Wolf's childhood), and as key figures of  Weimar modern\u00adism (Seghers) and of the literature of the GDR. Analyses and  interpretations will proceed from close readings of the texts, with emphasis on  the theoretical problems of modernist narration and on the way meaning is constructed  in 20th century fiction (novels, novel\u00adlas, historical and autobio\u00adgraphical  fiction). Several sessions will be devoted to theories of narration from K\u00e4the  Hamburger, Franz Stanzel, and G\u00e9rard Genette, to Philippe Lejeune's theory of  autobiography. The sessions on Seghers will focus on the avant-gardist  narrative techniques of works such as Aufstand der Fischer von St. Barbara   and \"Der Ausflug der toten M\u00e4dchen.\"  Readings of other works \u2013 Transit ,  \"Die sch\u00f6nsten Sagen vom R\u00e4uber Woynok,\" Die Reisebegegnung\" \u2013  will investigate Seghers' repeated recourse to cross over narration (a woman  narrating as a man), and her use of mythology, fairy tales and the  fantastic as ways of disrupting traditional notions of realism. Discussions of  Wolf's work will focus on the late modernist agenda of transforming the  writer's own life into the subject of fiction ( Nachdenken \u00fcber Christa T. ,   St\u00f6rfall ); and on the construction of the female subject, and its  constantly threatened destruction in patriarchal society, from Nachdenken  \u00fcber Christa T. through its staging in historical ( Kein Ort. Nirgends )  and mythological costumes ( Kassandra ).        Exemplary Texts: Poetry &amp;  Experience - Prof. Avital  Ronell  In the Presence of Noise: Theories and  Media - Prof.  Hans-Christian von Herrman n At the end of the 1970s when the era of  the personal computer was dawning a new kind of media theories started to break  up with the sociological analysis of mass media communication by analyzing  modernity\u2019s technological unconscious. As the seminar will show these concepts  emerged from the confluence of three main sources: French poststructuralist  theory, Canadian media history and American information theory. The reading  list will include texts by Vil\u00e9m Flusser, Friedrich Kittler, Paul Virilio, R\u00e9gis  Debray, Niklas Luhmann, and others.  FALL 2007  Psychoanalysis and Philosophy: Love\u2019s  Body revisited. The Religion of Psychoanalysis - Professor Eckart Goebel        This graduate course is intended to  reread the relation between religion and psychoanalysis. The first part is  devoted to key figures of religious thought, such as St. Augustine, Pascal, and  Luther who were at the same time path breaking as analysts of the human psyche.  We will read Erikson\u2019s book on Luther since Erikson had the provocative thesis  that Luther actually invented what Freud then was forced to study 400 years  later. Before the seminar turns to Freud\u2019s writings on religion and monotheism  we will read a key book for the development of psychoanalysis, especially the  concepts of the Nirvana principle or the Death Drive: Schopenhauer\u2019s seminal  work on The World as Will and Representation . This first part is  followed by close readings of several Freudian writings. The overall goal of  this seminar is to equip students of literary studies with the background  information needed for a better understanding of modern literature and advanced  literary theory.  Literature and Philosophy: More  Trauma - Professor Avital  Ronell  Visual Culture - Taught by Prof. Elizabeth Bronfen  SPRING 2007  Origins of Critical thought II - Professor Paul Fleming  In this continuation of Origins of  Critical Thought, we follow two trajectories of critical thinking in Germany  since Hegel. The first is the hermeneutic-interpretative tradition  beginning with Schleiermacher, proceeding through Dilthey, Nietzsche, and  Freud, and ending with Gadamer\u2019s epochal work Truth and Method. The  second trajectory addresses the differences and disputes of the two most  influential critical directions in the 20th century: Heidegger  and the Frankfurt School. Finally, we will look at critical thought today  in Germany and its two most influential representatives: Kittler and Luhmann.  Whenever possible, we will try to create a dialogue \u2013 at times friendly, at  times antagonistic \u2013 between two thinkers for each session.   Postwar Modernism: Max Frisch &amp;  Peter Weiss, - Professor Robert  Cohen       Though neither Max Frisch nor Peter  Weiss was German, they were key figures in the reconstitution of (West-) German  post-war litera\u00adture. Their works are both paradigmatic of, and different from,  the literature of their German contemporaries (Andersch, B\u00f6ll, K\u00f6ppen, Walser)  which emerged out of the collapse of Germany. From vantage points located at  the periphery of German culture (Switzerland in the case of Frisch, Sweden for  Peter Weiss) the two authors functioned like seismographs reacting to post-war  reality. Their use of innovative and avant-gardism forms in drama and prose  reflects the problematic of recovering the recent past and decoding a complex  present. After prose works exploring the immediate post-war trauma and  reconstituting the (literary) subject both Frisch and Weiss turned to drama and  produced works which focus on anti-Semitism and Auschwitz. These plays will be  read against canonized texts by Sartre and Adorno. Frisch and Weiss's evolution  from modernist into post-modernist writing will be traced through their later  works which decenter and dissolve narrative certainty and signal a new kind of  text with unstable and multiple meanings and uncertain chronologies. In order  to situate these works in the aesthetic and literary context of the postwar  period, two sessions will be devoted to theories of modernism, the avant-garde,  and postmodernism. Beyond \u2013 and before \u2013 all the topical issues these works  evoke, however, they need to be understood as literature. Discussions in class  will be based on close readings, on the narrative and dramatic structures of  these texts, and generally on the way meaning is produced in literary texts.  FALL 2006   Theories of History - Professor Werner Hamacher  In Theories of History we are  going to discuss some of the classical texts from the history of thinking about  history \u2013 in particular Kant\u00b4s \"Idea for a Universal History\" and  \"An Old Question Raised Again: Is the Human Race Constantly  Progressing?\", Hegel\u00b4s lecture course on \"Philosophy of  History\", the relevant paragraphs from Heidegger\u00b4s \"Being and  Time\" and Benjamin\u00b4s notes on the structure of history and cognition.          Fascism &amp; Sexuality - Professor Christopher Clark  This seminar will explore the  relationships between fascism (primarily, but not exclusively in its German  form) and sexuality. Primary topics of analysis in this course are the central  importance of sexuality to fascism not only in historical practice but in  theory, as well as the (dubiously) privileged status of sexuality in theories  of fascism continuing through today. We will begin with the Nazi era, noting  what constituted acceptable and forbidden expressions of gender and sexuality,  in theory and in everyday life. We will proceed through the postwar era to the  present, examining the ways in which artists, theorists, and historians have  continually portrayed and analyzed fascism in sexual terms, paying particular  attention to the recurring figure of \u201cthe gay Nazi.\u201d We will also address such  phenomena as gays and lesbians in the Holocaust (and debates over their  memorialization), the intrinsic homophobia of much antifascist critique, the  1970s \u201cNaziploitation film,\u201d and contemporary queer skinheads, with an eye  toward which of these are historically specific and which still determine the  terms and framing of discourse on fascism today. Readings/viewings include  Mann, Hitler, Genet, Sontag, Mosse, Theweleit, Fassbinder, Visconti, Cavani,  Pasolini, LaBruce, and others. No expertise in spoken or written German is  required for participation in the course. However, graduate students from the  Department of German, as well as students from other departments who are  concentrating in part on German literature, will be expected to read a number  of the primary texts in the original German.       Der Mann ohne Eigenschaften - Professor Eckart Goebel  Torture and Authority - Professor Avital Ronell  Led by an overriding concern with the  concept of legitimacy , the course offers a wide ranging  theoretical exploration of modalities of torture and the underpinnings of  authority. Some topoi, ranging from the chain gang to the culture of bondage  and national political behaviors, include penal styles, the disappearance and  returns of torture as spectacle, the punishment-body, the right to punish, the  punitive ceremony as an exercise of terror, forces of revenge, the final exam,  and so forth. We will take recourse to key psychoanalytic, philosophical and  literary texts that have established a lexicon of torture, gauging specific  effects of authority, whether betrayed, corrupt, book-bound, or legitimate. The  course will consider the status of minoritized, disenfranchized figures, those  subjected to legal as well as institutional persecution. One starting point  will be Adorno's thoughts on the \"authoritarian personality,\" which  gets profiled close by, in conjunction with Blanchot's pages in The Infinite  Conversation , \"The Indestructible.\"  SPRING 2006        Photography &amp; the World - Professor Ulrich Baer  An investigation into the ways  photography has been conceptualized since its inception until its recent  transformation brought about by the advent of digital imaging. Particular  attention will be paid to the notion of the \u2018world\u2019 as it informs most  theoretical attempts to grasp photography; the way in which the rise of  photography is indissociably linked to the emergence of psychoanalysis and  phenomenology; theories of perception; issues of veracity, mimesis, and  aesthetics; and the relation between photography and its historical moment.          Kafka   - Professor Friedrich Ulfers  The course will deal with Kafka\u2019s work  largely in the light of the author\u2019s preoccupation with language particularly  with the way this preoccupation affected his writing, indeed provided the theme  of it. The point of departure will be the experience of \u201clanguage crisis\u201d among  intellectuals and writers in turn of the century Austria, which led to the  radical language criticism \u2013 already foreshadowed by Nietzsche \u2013 of Fritz Mauthner  and Ludwig Wittgenstein among others. An interpretation of Kafka\u2019s work aims to  show not only the influences of this thinking on his writing, but also how  Kafka radicalized it so as to make it \u201cKafkaesque.\u201d Another aspect of the  course will be to examine Kafka as anticipating a line of writing and thinking  that could be described as deconstructive. In this context,  undecidability, the breakdown of referential language, and irreducible  allusiveness will be shown as constitutive of Kafka\u2019s texts. This will  also be the context to discuss the problematization of the real, of judgment,  of justice, and the law that suffuses Kafka\u2019s writing.       Literature &amp; Depression: The  Sickness to Death - Professor Eckart  Goebel  The seminar starts with an  investigation of seminal theoretical texts on mourning and melancholia (Freud,  Klein, Spielrein). It continues with close readings of canonical text of the  philosophical and literary tradition from Kierkegaard to T. S. Eliot, and  Heidegger. The course discusses the history of depression between mediation  (language, art), meditation (religion), and medication (Prozac) and tries to  reconstruct the role of art and poetry within this flexible scaffolding.          Brecht - Professor Robert Cohen  Dialogical and intertextual in the  extreme, Brecht's oeuvre can be seen as an endless critical conversation with  readers and theatergoers, with collaborators, colleagues and lovers, as well as  with philosophical, theoretical, political, economic, and aesthetic theories  from Aristotle to Marx, Lukacs, and Benjamin. The result of these conversations  is a work in progress, a collection of unstable and endlessly revised texts  exploring the human experience in a time of class struggle, violence, and war.  Within this framework the course is conceived as a general introduction to  Brecht's work. Some of the topics the course will focus on are: the experience  of the modern metropolis; the destruction of identity and the construction of a  'collective individuality;' the disintegration of social and sexual relations;  Brecht's Marxism and his contribution to a new dialectics; Brecht's formal  innovations in drama and poetry, and his theater theories. Beyond all the  controversial issues which Brecht's oeuvre (and life) evoke, it needs to be  understood as literature. Discussions in class will be based on close readings  of the texts - poetry, plays, and theoretical works - and on the way  meaning is produced through Brecht's performative use of language (\" Gestus \"),  as well as through his use of modern\u00ad\u00adist literary techniques such as montage,  frag\u00admen\u00adtation and repetition, and \"Verfremdung.\"                                                                                                        Back to Top"}]},

Baroque:   The  Sovereign and the Law in German Tragedy (Gryphius to Kleist) Christiane Frey &amp; Guest Lecturer Slavoj Zizek  What is the relationship between sovereignty and the law? Is the law  sovereign? Or does it owe its legitimacy to the sovereignty that institutes it?  In the early modern era, these issues are subject to new scrutiny and  negotiation on at least three levels: politics or political theology (as it is  depicted in drama); poetics and the law of genre (as it is realized in the  writing of drama); and \u201cphilosophy of nature,\u201d in which the notion of modern  science emerges from a new concept of the laws of nature. The course explores  the relationship of law to sovereignty in all three of these domains with an  emphasis on the first. We will ask what drama has to say about the nature of  law and how drama\u2019s relationship to the law of genre lends it a unique status  in the discourse on law and sovereignty. Plays from Andreas Gryphius\u2019s baroque  tragedy Leo Armenius to Kleist\u2019s Prinz Friedrich von Homburg ;  source texts from the history of science; literary and political theory  from Aristotle to Benjamin, Derrida, and Roberto Esposito. Discussion in  English; reading knowledge of German required.   GERM-GA1650 T 3:30 - 6:10; This course meets from 9/2 through 9/30. Visual  Culture: Series, Repetition, Seriality. Where literature meets quality t.v.  Elisabeth Bronfen  Matthew Weiner\u2019s Mad Men not only  uses the literature of the 1960s as one of its frames of reference but also  picks up on the claim to moral imagination for which the Victorian novel is  famous. While much has been made of the analogy between the serialization of  fiction in periodicals and the t.v. series format, this block seminar will  explore the thematic and rhetorical implications of repetition and seriality on  which such a comparison is also predicated. How does seriality appear in both  19th century fiction and early 21st century quality t.v. as a thematic concern?  How do the plethora of individual portraits produced by a serialized text also  form a network of relations that offer up a coherent whole? What rhetorical  strategies does each text deploy so as to call forth both intellectual and  affective empathy? What imaginary community is thus produced? We will use  Freud\u2019s psychoanalytic discussion of repetition along with Deleuze\u2019s comment on  this as our theoretical frame for a crossmapping that brings Eliot\u2019s Middlemarch and Keller\u2019s Leute von Seldwyla into conversation  with the first two seasons of Mad Men .  Since all three texts are long, please begin with the reading/viewing well in  advance.  GERM-GA1115 W 3:30 \u2013 6:10  Origins  of Critical Thought I: \u201cTrag\u00f6die im Sittlichen\u201d (Kant \u2013 Schiller \u2013 Hegel)  Eckart Goebel  This seminar, conducted in German, discusses key texts on ethics from  around 1800. We begin with Kant\u2019s Grundlegung zur Metaphysik der Sitten,  and his Anthropologie in pragmatischer Hinsicht. We will then read  two of Schiller\u2019s essays (\u00dcber Anmut und W\u00fcrde and \u00dcber das Erhabene),  reflecting on Kant\u2019s thought. The remaining sessions will be used to  reconstruct Hegel\u2019s concept of a \u201cTrag\u00f6die im Sittlichen\u201d as it has been  developed in his early anti-Kantian essay \u00dcber die wissenschaftlichen  Behandlungsarten des Naturrechts. A more refined understanding of the \u201cTrag\u00f6die  im Sittlichen\u201d requires a careful reading of the reflections on tragedy Hegel  unfolds in his Ph\u00e4nomenologie des Geistes and in his Vorlesungen \u00fcber  die \u00c4sthetik. In order to prepare this seminar, a reading of the tragedies  Hegel is referring to, is highly recommended: Aeschylus\u2019 Eumenides,  Sophocles\u2019 Antigone, Shakespeare\u2019s Hamlet, Schiller\u2018s Wallenstein , and Goethe\u2019s Faust I. Origins of Critical Thought II, dealing with post-Kantian  'Philosophical Anthropology' (Plessner, Gehlen, Heidegger, Adorno, Freud,  Blumenberg) will take place in Spring 2015.       GERM-GA1512 W 6:20 \u2013 8:20 Kafka  Friedrich Ulfers  The course will deal with Kafka\u2019s work largely in the light of the author\u2019s  preoccupation with language, particularly with the way this preoccupation  affected his writing, indeed provided the topic of it. The point of departure  will be the experience of \u201clanguage crisis\u201d among intellectuals and writers in  turn of the century Austria, which led to the radical criticism of conceptual  or referential language\u2013 already foreshadowed by Nietzsche \u2013 of Fritz Mauthner  and Ludwig Wittgenstein, among others. The course will then show Kafka\u2019s  response to this crisis: his insight that conceptual/referential language and  oppositional/binary involves an abstraction of the \u201ctruth\u201d or the \u201creal,\u201d which  is only apprehensible in a space of radical undecidability between opposites,  demanding a language of irreducible allusiveness, a language that is constitutive  of Kafka\u2019s texts.  GERM-GA2610 R 1:30 - 4:20  Special  Topics in Theory - Unpacking Derrida\u2019s Library: The Secret to the Archive  Avital Ronell  Marking the tenth anniversary of Derrida\u2019s death, this course revisits  Derrida\u2019s library in order to suggest that his texts are more valuable today  than ever before. His library may even be a space for reading and writing  that\u2014dominated by texts that no longer correspond only to the \u201cbook\u201d form, and  by a corpus that exceeds the library that would contain it\u2014touches on the  entirety of the world. Open 24 hours a day, every day of the year, it forces  us, in Derrida\u2019s words, \u201cinto a delirium of reading\u201d that reads us as much as  it teaches us to read\u2014actively, historically, politically, and ethically. The  course will provide an opportunity to remember several of his lessons\u2014about  philosophy, literature, history, politics, religion, economics, ideology, law,  rights, nationalism, racism, colonialism, the media, university institutions,  capitalism, rogue states, the war on terror, justice, responsibility, language,  friendship, love, life, death, and, mourning\u2014all of which are more urgent and  necessary than ever before. It should never be said\u2014as so many have, and will  no doubt continue to say\u2014that his work did not engage history and politics,  that his work retreated from what remains most important to us. From the  beginning he proceeded in the conviction that his philosophical activity did  not require a political or ethical practice because it already was, from the  start, an ethico- political practice. This course takes place at Princeton  University. Students should enroll through the Inter-University Doctoral  Consortium.  GERM-GA3000 TBD Independent Research  GERM-GA3100-001  ENGL-GA3629-001 (Course originating in English  Department)  W 6:20 \u2013 8:20; 244 Greene Street, Room 306     Politics in  Deconstruction  Geoffrey Bennington   Taking its lead from some of Derrida\u2019s later work,  this course will set off again from Aristotle\u2019s famous characterization of man  as a zoon politikon, and follow the threads of sovereignty and democracy  through some of the great texts of political philosophy in the Western  tradition. We shall attempt to understand why both of these notions pose such  problems for that tradition, and give rise to all manner of complications and  paradoxes, which turn out to be definitive of the conceptual space of the  political as such. We shall wonder why almost all traditional political  philosophers are enamored of sovereignty, while almost none has anything very  good to say about democracy. We shall consider the possibility of a non-trivial  affinity between the political, the rhetorical, the literary, and animality in  their constant tendency to exceed conceptual grasp, and also compare our  deconstructive approach to these political questions with some other  contemporary theories. Classic authors to be discussed will include Plato, Aristotle,  Machiavelli, Bodin, Hobbes, Spinoza, Rousseau, Kant, Hegel and Schmitt; more  recent theorists to be considered alongside Derrida may include Agamben,  Badiou, Foucault, Hardt and Negri, Lyotard, Mouffe and Ranci\u00e8re.  GERM-GA1221-001 MEDI-GA 2100-003 (Course originating in MARC) T, R 11:00-12:15pm   Dawn  Songs in Middle High German Literature  Jessica Quinlan   Ow\u00ea, nu ist  ez tac! A scenario describing the pain experienced by  lovers who must part at daybreak seems to have been the subject of lyrical  reflection the world over from well before the time of Christ. In the European  Middle Ages, the dawn song ( Tagelied )  enjoyed particular popularity in the German tradition. It depicts scenes of awakening,  lamentation and farewell, couched as narrative action with dialogue. Between  the 12th and 15th centuries, this pattern is repeated,  redrawn and almost endlessly varied; the subject of the dawn song is recreated,  inverted, parodied and removed to a spiritual level. The primary texts will be  read in their original language; in addition to the discussion of the place of  the dawn song in medieval German literature, therefore, this course seeks to  offer participants the opportunity to develop and enhance reading skills in  Middle High German.       SPRING 2014   GERM-GA1219  - The Information  Society: Planetarity (Taught in German)  - Hans-Christian  von Herrmann  \"I  propose the planet to overwrite the globe.\" This statement can be found in  Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak's 2003 book \"Death of a Discipline\", which  brings up the concept of \"planetarity\" as a description of a  post-global, post-national and post-colonial world, interconnected and  differentiated by electronic information systems. But \"planetarity\"  has a history that is older than what is called the information age today and  that leads back to Weimar Germany. So the seminar will follow up the traces of  \"planetarity\" in Walter Benjamin's \"Einbahnstra\u00dfe\" (1928)  and Ernst J\u00fcnger's \"Der Arbeiter\" (1932) afterwards moving on to the  writings of Martin Heidegger, Kostas Axelos and Wilfrid Desan. By doing so the  seminar's objective is to discuss \"planetarity\" as a theoretical  approach emerging from the crisis of modernity and envisioning a post-modern  culture totally shaped by technology.       GERM-GA3610  (COLIT-GA2155; POET-GA2002) - Topics  in Early Modern Written Culture: Literary Matter - The Lucretian Tradition  on European Modernity - Jacques  Lezra   GERM-GA3100  (COLIT-GA2300) - Studies in Prose  Genres: J.M. Coetzee &amp; Metafiction - Mark Sanders       When  J.M. Coetzee received the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2003, he stunned the  Swedish Academy in Stockholm by presenting not the customary lecture, but a  story. In this tale, entitled \u201cHe and His Man,\u201d Robinson Crusoe sends reports  to his \u201cman,\u201d whom Coetzee\u2019s audience recognizes as being Daniel Defoe, since  the reports appear to come from books authored by Defoe. The relationship of  character and author is turned inside out, in an exciting metafictional  performance that also places in question the conventional boundaries of the  lecture. The Swedish audience should not have been stunned, however, for some  of J.M. Coetzee\u2019s most recent novels, Summertime, Slow Man, and Elizabeth  Costello have, in different ways, foregrounded the mechanics of fiction-making  typically concealed by the realist novel. Concentrating on these works, as well  as Coetzee\u2019s early novels, in which metafiction is the dominant mode for  interrogating colonial literary genres, and drawing comparisons with the  fiction of Italo Calvino, Alain Robbe-Grillet, and Zo\u00eb Wicomb, while at the  same time availing ourselves of relevant narrative theory (Mieke Bal, Roland  Barthes) and critical commentary (Attwell, Attridge, Spivak, Wicomb), the  seminar will explore the aesthetic, ethical and political implications of a  writer putting the inner workings of his or her craft on open display. The  seminar will culminate with a roundtable on Coetzee\u2019s enigmatic new novel, The  Childhood of Jesus.  GERM-GA2703 - Poetics &amp; Theory Seminar:  Autofiction: Writing the Self (Taught in German) - Emine Sevgi \u00d6zdamar  &amp; Alys George       Autobiographical  writing has evolved into a highly controversial issue in contemporary literary  theory. Every constituent of the term has become problematic: the \u201cauto\u201d of a  sovereign ego and an undivided persona; the \u201cbios\u201d relating to a culturally  encoded life; the \u201cgraphein\u201d (\u03b3\u03c1\u03b1\u03c6\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd), which registers problems of  mediality. Serge Doubrovsky coined the term \u201cautofiction\u201d in the late  1970s in an attempt to address these vicissitudes of autobiography as a genre.  How  can we distinguish between autobiography and fiction? Can works of literature  be reliable archives of individual and collective memory? Can they be authentic  expressions of our lives at all? We will consider writing that invites and  engages these questions. In addition to Emine Sevgi \u00d6zdamar\u2019s work,  we will read texts by Else Lasker-Sch\u00fcler, Charlotte Salomon, Roland Barthes,  Thomas Bernhard, Herta M\u00fcller, and Thomas Glavinic.       GERM-GA2912  (COLIT-GA2912) -  Literature  &amp; Philosophy: POETS TAKE PHILOSOPHY:  H\u00f6lderlin~Heidegger~Celan~Derrida  - Avital Ronell  The  course will dwell on the poetry of H\u00f6lderlin and Celan with an eye to the  critical works of Heidegger, Adorno, Benjamin, Derrida, Lacoue-Labarthe. There  will be two separate workshops led by Kevin McLaughlin (Brown Univ.) and Werner  Hamacher (Frankfurt) in addition to possible visits by Ulrich Baer and  Richard Sieburth. Expect intense and staggeringly beautiful work to come out of  this.       GERM-GA3000 - Independent Research    FALL  2013     GERM-GA1110  -Theory of Art: Aby Warburg - Christopher  Wood        Aby  Warburg (1866-1929) was an art historian who worked outside the academic  establishment, building a prodigious private library and research center that  mapped a new field of study: the persistence of the ancient pagan world  into modernity, conceived as an ongoing psychic event. Exposed to what he  experienced as a relentless barrage of expressive images of passion\u2014\u201cpathos  formulas\u201d\u2014mediating archaic trauma, Warburg sought but could not find relief in  the promise of aesthetic sublimation. The seminar will pose one central  question which bears on the larger problems of communication (between subjects,  between past and present) under the conditions of modernity: is Warburg\u2019s  pathos formula best understood as an image, a symbol, a symptom, a metaphor, a  talisman, an avatar, a memory, or a packet of psychic energy?  His  person, his library (which was transported from Hamburg to London in 1933 and  survives intact), and his gnomic writings serve as a crossroads where many  paths of thought meet, throughout the twentieth century and into our  own. The seminar will relocate Warburg among the thinkers who  shaped him, including Darwin, Nietzsche, Burckhardt, and Usener; relate him to  the art history of his day as practiced by Schlosser, Riegl, W\u00f6lfflin,  Schmarsow, and Panofsky; coordinate his thought with the biological sciences,  early anthropology, the study of archaic ritual and religion, the spheres of  modern ornament, design, and dance, the emergence of the technological media  including cinema, and the Husserlian \u201ccrisis of the sciences\u201d; and finally  consider his reception by Cassirer, Benjamin, Gombrich, Ginzburg, Agamben, and  Didi-Huberman. Reading of knowledge of German required.        GERM-GA1700  - Romanticism: Drives of Romanticism, 1900/1800 - Elisabeth Bronfen &amp; Leif  Weatherby  (1)  To participate in the celebration of the Wagner year, the first part of the  seminar will look at unconventional traces of both his libretti and scores in  Classic Hollywood. At issue, as we look at Tristan and Isolde, Tannh\u00e4user and  Holl\u00e4nder, is both the obsession with the psychological struggle between law  and desire as well as the redemption death is claimed to afford. What also  drives this crossmapping, however, is the wager that in the 20th century cinema  appropriates but also signficiantly refigures Wagner's Gesamtkunstwerk  project  (2)  From here, the course will go back to the future, focusing on German  Romanticism and its re-readings in philosophy of technology in the 20th and  21st centuries. Here we will read Hoffmann with Kittler, H\u00f6lderlin with  Heidegger, Novalis with Blumenberg, and others. The complementary  wager of the second part of the course is that the pretense of  Romantic art--post-revolutionary, \"post\"-Enlightenment--has a great  deal to do with the end of the so-called \"techne-physis analogy.\" If  \"technology\" was freed from its metaphysical moorings in the long  18th century, then how does it anticipate later Romantic aesthetics, and what  might it have to say about our contemporary situation?  GERM-GA1842  - Nietzsche\u2019s Impact on 20th Century Thought - Friedrich Ulfers  The  objective of the seminar is to show how Nietzsche revolutionized Western  philosophy by transforming its dualistic-metaphysical worldview into a holistic  one that corresponds to the reality of the world as one interrelated,  processual whole. It will also show how this transformation influenced  significantly what is known as \u201cContinental Philosophy,\u201d which includes such  figures as Heidegger, Derrida, and Deleuze.  Particular  attention will be paid to the meaning of Nietzsche\u2019s pronouncement that \u201cGod is  dead\u201d; his declaration that the world is \u201cWill to Power \u201d and an \u201caesthetic  phenomenon\u201d; and his idea of \u201cEternal Recurrence.\u201d Also discussed will be the  role language plays in Nietzsche\u2019s view on epistemology and ontology, his  revaluation of morality, and his influence on the arts.       GERM-GA2610 - Special Topics in Theory: What\u2019s  Happening? EVENT in Philosophy, Literature, Psychoanalysis - Avital Ronell  A  sequel to last year\u2019s seminar on Derrida, et. al. and the Event, we will  explore motifs such as love and catastrophe in exemplary literary and  philosophical texts. Students are urged to have read thoroughly at  least one book by the instructor in preparation for outstanding discussions.       GERM-GA3000 - Independent Research - Avital  Ronell   SPRING  2013  GERM-GA1116  - Origins of Critical Thought II:Renaissance and Modernity  (Seminar and Texts in German) - Eckart Goebel  This  seminar examines modern texts dealing with the legacy of the European  Renaissance. We will read works by Walter Pater, Jacob Burckhardt, Ernst  Kantorowicz, Erwin Panofsky, and Hans Blumenberg.Participation in this class  does not require previous attendance of the fall 2012 seminar on Renaissance  &amp; Reformation. In preparation, it might be useful, however, to study some  of the texts, with which the authors mentioned above are dealing, such as  Shakespeare\u2019s King Richard the Second .  GERM-GA1219  - The Information Society: By Chance \u2013 Literature and Mathematics - Hans-Christian von Herrmann       In  E.A. Poe's 1844 short story \"The purloined letter\" private  investigator Auguste Dupin is able to close the case because he is gifted with  a certain talent which is in fact an amalgam of a poetic and a mathematical  attitude towards the world. The seminar's ambition is to decipher this  mysterious mindset by consulting Jacques Lacan's famous reading of Poe's text  including its detour in the fields of information theory and cybernetics. In a  second step the seminar will pass on to other literary texts by Heinrich von  Kleist, Jorge Luis Borges and Hans Magnus Enzensberger in order to follow up  the traces of the modern interplay of literature and mathematics.  GERM-GA1698  - Photography and the World: Theories of Photography from the Medium\u2019s  Inception to the Present -   Ulrich Baer        We  live in an illustrated world, and photographs often determine political,  personal, and even the most private of decisions. Who is guilty and who is  exonerated; who gets elected and who loses the vote; who and what we favor or  despise, will get to know, desire, remember or forget depends on how someone or  something has been presented in a photograph. Today more images are produced  daily than in the entire history of photography from 1839 until the mass  production of digital cameras. There is great danger in this development and  immense potential to free ourselves from existing constraints, too. The skills  required to interpret photographs is related to our capacity of gauging the  role of images in our imagination. It behooves us to know how to turn the  current plethora of pictures into tools with which to shape the world we share  with others.  This  interdisciplinary seminar explores how photographic images create meaning, and  how thinkers have responded to photography \u2013 as a phenomenon to be reckoned  with lest it overwhelms our critical faculties. How do we make sense of the  ways in which photographs shape our experience of being in the world \u2013 and how  do we shape our own lives amidst this flood of images? What does the world  mean, in a photograph, and how do we distinguish this meaning from the world  outside of photography? What is the relation between meaning, photography, and  a worldview? Is it possible to experience someone\u2019s else\u2019s world through  photographs? What is the relation between worlds and worldviews, and what role  do images play in this relationship?       We  will read theoretical and other texts on visuality and photography (Baudelaire,  Kracauer, Panofsky, Benjamin, Barthes, Sontag, Batchen, Derrida, Flusser,  Cadava, Ranci\u00e8re, Enwezor, and others), and look at a wide range of photographs  from the inception of the medium to the present to test theories of photography  against the medium\u2019s uncanny and unrivaled power to evoke the real.  GERM-GA2703 - Poetics and Theory Seminar: Short  Fiction ( Seminar and Texts in German) - Katja Lange-M\u00fcller &amp;  Alys George  This  comparative seminar traces the \u201cmigration\u201d of short fiction between Germany and  America. It also focuses on how literary markets and the economy of production  have shaped the economy of form. From its beginnings in the European novella (Boccaccio)  and the German literary Kalendergeschichte (Hebel, Kleist), short fiction made  its way to America and was transformed with the flourishing of the short story  in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The conventions of the American  short story then took hold in Germany, where they have influenced postwar  literature to the present. We look, finally, at flash fiction/microfiction and  toward the future of short(est) fiction. Our focus is on close textual  analysis, and authors will be paired, e.g.: Twain and Hebel; Poe and Kafka;  Hemingway and Rothmann; Melville and Kleist; McCullers and Hermann; Carver and  Schulze. We also consider classification debates in theoretical essays by  Schlegel, James, O\u2019Connor, Lange-M\u00fcller, and Oates.  After  the spring recess acclaimed writer and Bachmann-Preis-winner Katja Lange-M\u00fcller  will co-teach the seminar and will discuss role of short fiction in the German  and American literary traditions, as well as her own work in the form. Non-NYU  students who wish to audit the second portion of the course only are welcome.    FALL  2012  GERM-GA.1004  - Image and Text: Psychic Visuality \u2013 E.T.A. Hoffmann and Hitchcock - Elizabeth Bronfen  Hitchcock,  who was on the set in Babelsberg Studios (Berlin) in 1924 when Murnau filmed The  Last Man , brought the demonic screen expressionist film had perfected in  Weimar Germany to Hollywood in 1940, and with it a legacy of the German  romantic Nachtst\u00fcck . This block seminar will cross map three films from  his mature period \u2013 Vertigo , Rear Window and Psycho \u2013 onto  novellas by E.T.A. Hoffmann, in an attempt to reconstruct this line of  association. At issue is the manner in which both the Gothic novella and the  Hollywood thriller engage a visualization of psychic disorders. A second point  of connection is that both artists are great technicians who offer  self-reflexive commentaries on their respective medium. Finally, as masters of  aesthetic artifice, both pit intense emotions against textual play, with  Hoffmann's romantic irony reflected and refracted in Hitchcock's dark humor.   GERM-GA.1115  - Origins of German Critical Thought I: Renaissance &amp; Reformation I - Eckart Goebel    This  course offers an introduction to key texts from the 15th and 16th  centuries. Since each of the complex works we read provides so many insights  that one could organize an entire class around any one of them, the goal is  merely to make first contact with the world of Renaissance and Reformation. The  research interest I pursue with this class is the \u2018history of the soul\u2019 in  early modernity as well as the history of melancholia. The reading load is  admittedly high, and it might be even useful to have, in addition, a closer  look at some seminal works from Greek and Roman antiquity over the summer, such  as Plato\u2019s Symposium , Aristoteles\u2019 De Anima , Cicero\u2019s De  Officiis , his Tusculanae Disputationes , and St. Augustine\u2019s Confessiones .  We will read all texts in English translations.  I  intend to continue this class in spring with a seminar on the reception of  Renaissance &amp; Reformation in modernity from Goethe, Burckhardt, and  Nietzsche to Cassirer, Panofsky, and Kantorowicz.

We will explore political works,  psychoanalysis, music, and film. Expect sparks.  GERM-  GA.3000 - Independent Research        GERM-GA.1512  - Kafka - Friedrich Ulfers  The  course will deal with Kafka\u2019s work largely in the light of the author\u2019s  preoccupation with language, particularly with the way this preoccupation  affected his writing, indeed provided the topic of it.       The  point of departure will be the experience of \u201clanguage crisis\u201d among  intellectuals and writers in turn of the century Austria, which led to the  radical criticism of conceptual or referential language\u2013 already foreshadowed  by Nietzsche \u2013 of Fritz Mauthner and Ludwig Wittgenstein, among others.  The  course will then show Kafka\u2019s response to this crisis: his insight that  conceptual/referential language and oppositional/binary involves an abstraction  of the \u201ctruth\u201d or the \u201creal,\u201d which is only apprehensible in a space of radical  undecidability between opposites, demanding a language of irreducible  allusiveness, a language that is constitutive of Kafka\u2019s texts.       In  the context of this undecidability and allusivesness, which Kafka attributes to  his \u201cdreamlike inner life\u201d that he claims informs his writing, his becoming  \u201cliterature,\u201d Freud\u2019s The Interpretation of Dreams will be used as a  reference. In this work Freud asserts that many psychological \u201cprocesses which  are described as irrational are not in fact falsification of normal  processes\u2014intellectual errors\u2014but are modes of activity of the psychical  apparatus that have been freed from an inhibition\u201d (Freud 644), and that in  dream thinking, \u201cEach train of thought is almost invariably accompanied by its  contradictory counterpart, linked with it by antithetical association\u201d (Freud  346). It will be shown that Kafka\u2019s texts are suffused with this kind of  thinking, a thinking that allows opposites to coexist as a both/and that never  achieves resolution. As Freud puts it: \u201cBoth of the alternatives [of a logical  opposition] are usually inserted in the text of the dream as though they were  equally valid\u201d (Freud 351).  Another  context in which Kafka\u2019s writing will be read in this seminar is that of  contemporary Continental Philosophy, especially the texts of Deleuze and  Derrida that have interpreted Kafka\u2019s writing in terms of the alterity of a  \u201cminor literature\u201d and the putting in question of judgment and the law,  respectively.       The  seminar will then deal with Kafka\u2019s insight into the inherent violence involved  in any conceptual understanding, in relation to which literature, that is,  poetic or radically metaphorical language functions as a countermeasure in that  it has the capacity of \u201cun-judging\u201d the real, leaving us with texts that  constitute an embrace of infinite relationality and the concomitant  undecidability.  Finally,  we will look at Kafka\u2019s writing in terms of the possibility of embodying an  inherent ethical aspect insofar as it constitutes freedom from truth as  the tyranny of univocity and teleology towards the truth of an  a-topical, endlessly de-territorializing and metamorphosing world. As such,  this truth is always already other in relation with itself, and thus ethical in  its irreducible self-less-ness, its inherent openness to, and interrelatedness  with, the other. It would be the ethical structure of the \u201cgiven\u201d - not the  anthropomorphically instrumentalized world - in which its interpenetrating  parts exist \u201cpoetically,\u201d as metamorphic units that constitute an \u201cethics of  alterity,\u201d that is, an irreducible responsiveness and responsibility to the  other as other.   SPRING 2012  GERM-GA.1698 \u2013 Photography and the  World - Ulrich Baer          GERM-GA.1720 \u2013 Echoes of Antiquity:  Translatio Romae - Barbara Vinken  Marx remarked in his 18 brumaire of  Napol\u00e9on Bonaparte , History comes always back twice: first as tragedy, than  as farce. Roughly up to the beginning of the 20th century Europe and the United  States told and thought their History in terms of antique History that was a  basso continuo to all political conflicts and imperial enterprises. Our focus  will not be on Greek, but on Roman History. In the United States, as well as in  France, Germany and Italy, political realities were spelled out in Roman terms.  If most people agreed that History is nothing but a repetion of Roman History,  it is very much a question if this is a blessing or a curse. And what Roman  History comes back? Is the Roman Republic restored, are the civil wars coming  back, or are people to live in an Empire sine fine? It is in literary texts  that these questions are most subtly asked and answered. The most interesting  and influential texts like Schiller, Kleist, Leopardi, Hugo, Baudelaire,  Flaubert, and James will be submitted to a close reading in order to disclose  their hidden Roman intertexts.       GERM-GA.2703 \u2013 Poetics and Theory  Seminar: Literature &amp; Film (Taught in English) - Daniel Kehlmann and Eckart Goebel  The seminar investigates the  transformations literary texts undergo when they are turned into feature films.  The seminar also addresses the consequences the invention of film had for  writing: Is the potential of \u2018filmability\u2019 always inscribed in literature, and  if so, what exactly does \u2018filmability\u2019 mean?       The trajectory of this class leads us  from classics such as Schloendorff\u2019s acclaimed adaptation of Musil\u2019s early  novel The Confusions of Young Toerless to the new movie based on Oscar  Wilde\u2019s notorious novel The Picture of Dorian Gray of 2009. After the  spring recess acclaimed author Daniel Kehlmann will co-teach the seminar, and  will discuss with us not only No Country for Old Men and Radetzky March   but also his own novels Fame and Measuring the World ,  currently produced as films. Daniel Kehlmann will discuss his film scripts with  us, which will provide us with new insights into the relation of film and  literature.  Students from outside NYU, who prefer  to audit the second part of this seminar only, are welcome to do so.          GERM-GA.1513 \u2013 Bertolt Brecht - Robert Cohen  Brecht's oeuvre can be read as a  radical critique of philosophical, theoretical, political, economic, and  aesthetic discourses from Aristotle to Marx, Luk\u00e1cs, and Benjamin. It is a work  forever in progress, a collection of unstable and endlessly revised texts  exploring the human condition in a time of class struggle, violence, and war.       The Seminar is conceived as a general  introduction to Brecht's work. Topics include the experience of the modern  metropolis; the disintegration of social and sexual relations; the destruction  of identity and the construction of a 'collective individuality;' Brecht's  Marxism and his contribution to a new dialectics; Brecht and the Weimar  avant-garde.  Discussions based on close readings of  poetry, plays, prose, and theoretical writings will focus on the way meaning is  produced through Brecht's performative and gestural (\"Gestus\") use of  language; as well as through his use of modernist literary techniques such as  montage, fragmentation, and distanciation/alienation (\"Verfremdung\").       GERM-GA.3000  \u2013 Independent Research    FALL 2011  GERM-GA.1410 - Goethe: Eros and  Thanatos: Goethe\u2019s Psychology - Eckart  Goebel  Aus schwer erfindlichen Gr\u00fcnden gilt  Goethe zuweilen als \u201anaiv\u2018.       Das Seminar studiert, in Abwandlung  eines Titels von Max Kommerell \u00fcber - Schiller, \u201aGoethe als Psychologe\u2018.  Gelesen werden bekannte Texte des Dichters im Hinblick auf das in ihnen  \u00fcberreich ausgebreitete Wissen um die Seele des Menschen.  For not really convincing reasons  Goethe is regarded here and there as being \u2018naive.\u2018 In reaction to this cliche  this seminar studies, \u2018Goethe as psychologist.\u2018 We will re-read famous texts in  order to learn about Goethe\u2019s abysmal knowledge concerning the human soul, and  its vissicitudes.       GERM-GA.1650: Visual Culture:  Configurations of the Night   - Elisabeth Bronfen  Night is a double of the day, a comment  on diurnal activities, a counter site to the ordinary. It prompts a thinking  closer to imagination than reason. While philosophy's theoria is based  on the promise of bringing illumination, and as such is of and for   the day, literature and visual arts engage a nocturnal side of knowledge. This  course will cross map theory's tropic use of night onto aesthetic enactments of  the night as a stage and state of mind. Looking at the way both sustain the  antagonism between days' reason and night's magical thinking we will read  Mozart's Magic Flute with Foucault's \"piece of night each carries  within,\"; Shakespeare's Midsummer Night's Dream with Freud's  \"navel of the dream\"; Schnitzler's \"Dream Novella\" with  Hegel's \"night of the world\"; Scorsese's Taxi Driver with  Blanchot's \"autre nuit\".       GERM-GA.2610 - Special Topics in Theory:  The Debilitated Subject - Avital  Ronell and Slavoj Zizek  GERM-GA. 1842 - Nietzsche\u2019s Impact on  20th Century Thought - Friedrich  Ulfers       Objective of the seminar: The objective  of the seminar is to show how Nietzsche revolutionized Western philosophy by transforming  its dualistic-metaphysical worldview into a holistic one that corresponds to  the reality of the world as one interrelated whole. It will also show how this  transformation influenced significantly what is known as \"Continental  Philosophy,\" which includes such figures as Heidegger, Derrida, and  Deleuze.  Particular attention will be paid to  the meaning of Nietzsche\u2019s pronouncement that \"God is dead,\" his  declaration that the world is \"Will to Power\" and an \"aesthetic  phenomenon,\" and his idea of \"Eternal Recurrence.\" Also  discussed will be the role language plays in Nietzsche\u2019s view on epistemology  and ontology, his revaluation of morality and his influence on the arts.       GERM-GA.3000 \u2013 Independent Research  SPRING 2011  G51.1655: Archive, Image,  Text - Ulrich Baer, Shelley  Rice   G51.1116: Origins of  Critical Thought II: Heidegger and Adorno - Eckart  Goebel  The course, conducted in German, offers  a slow line-by-line reading of Martin Heidegger\u2019s book on Sein und Zeit from  1926. Halfway through the semester, we will start a close reading of Th. W.  Adorno\u2019s Negative Dialektik from 1966, focusing mainly on Adorno\u2019s  Heidegger-critique. The course is intended to provide students with strong  theoretical interests, a detailed knowledge of two seminal texts of 20th  century thought. Finally, we might also consult Max Horkheimer\u2019s Eclipse of  Reason , however, that will be determined at a later date.  G51.2703: Poetics &amp;  Theory Seminar: Writing Animals -  Marcel Beyer  This seminar examines \"writing  animals\" in a dual sense: both animals that write and the writing on  animals. At stake is the animal as a figure of imagination, of the work of  imagination in the creative process.        G51.1945: Post-World War II  Mordernism: Max Frisch and Peter Weiss - Robert Cohen  Max Frisch and Peter Weiss were key  figures in the reconstitution of (West-) German post-World War II litera\u00adture,  though \u2013 or maybe because \u2013 neither was German. Their works are both  paradigmatic of, and different from, the literature of their German  contemporaries (Andersch, B\u00f6ll, Koeppen, Walser) that emerged out of the  collapse of Germany. From vantage points located at the periphery of German  culture (Switzerland in the case of Frisch, Sweden for Peter Weiss) the two  authors functioned as seismographs reacting to post-war reality. Their use of  innovative and avant-gardist forms in drama and prose reflects the problematic  recovering of the recent past and decoding of a complex present.       After prose works exploring the  immediate post-war trauma and reconstituting the (literary) subject, both  Frisch and Weiss turned to drama with works focusing on anti-Semitism and  Auschwitz. These plays will be read against theoretical writings by Sartre and  Adorno.  Frisch and Weiss's evolution from  modernist to late-modernist/post-modernist writing will be traced through their  late works which dissolve narrative certainty and signal a new kind of text  with unstable meanings and uncertain chronologies. In order to situate these  works in the aesthetic and literary context of the postwar period, two sessions  will be devoted to theories of modernism, the avant-garde, and postmodernism.  Beyond \u2013 and before \u2013 all the topical  issues these works evoke, however, they need to be understood as literature. Discussions  will be based on close readings of the texts, on their narrative and dramatic  structures, and on the way meaning is produced in literary texts.  G51.3000: Independent Research  FALL 2010  G51.1111 \u2013 EXEMPLARY TEXTS: Traces of  Modernity (Benjamin, Bloch, Kracauer, Adorno) - Paul Fleming  This course investigates four seminal  texts written on and about the margins of modernity: Kracauer\u2019s Mass Ornament,  Bloch\u2019s Traces, Benjamin\u2019s One-Way Street, and Adorno\u2019s Minima Moralia. At  stake in each of these works is a protocol of reading that takes the seemingly  insignificant \u2013 surface structures, minor details, popular sayings, fragmented  memories \u2013 as the entrance to the deeper structures that define modern society  and thought.       G51.2610 - Special Topics in  Theory: How to read -   Avital Ronell  Beginning with Heidegger's important  text, _What is Called Thinking?_ the class will explore exemplary texts that  turn against themselves as they face down ruling cognitive regimens. If you  have understood the first sentence of this course description, you do not need  to take the class. Otherwise, be prepared to train rhetorically, and with  critical finesse, in order to confront some genuinely demanding textual events  of the canon. Students can expect to get close to major axioms and theoretical  concerns of selected texts by Barbara Johnson, Paul de Man and Derrida while  also confronting technological installations, paranoid utterance, political  reactivity, historical registers of anxiety and traumatic forgetting. Nearly  every work under consideration engages literature in essential ways, so  theoryheads must be prepared to read and submit to poetic language.       Smart undergraduates are also welcome,  but should obtain permission from the professor.  G51.1550 \u2013 German Poetry: German  Symbolism - Eckart  Goebel       This graduate seminar will follow the  contours of an art at the limits of (traditional) art by means of closely  reading George, Hofmannsthal, and Rilke. The poetry of German symbolism \u2013 and  this is the hypothesis to be discussed in class \u2013 is understood less as last  feverish shivers of Romanticism but rather as modern literature on the  threshold. German symbolism \u2013 the art of crisis emerging from the crisis of art  \u2013 points towards the Avant-garde movements of the 20th century on the one hand,  and towards charismatic leadership as the modern myth on the other.  The reading of lyrical poetry and  lyrical drama will be prepared by a careful study of the black bible of  aestheticism and pessimism: Arthur Schopenhauer\u2019s The World as Will and  Representation. Schopenhauer\u2019s influence on European writers from Flaubert to  Kafka, Beckett, and Bernhard can hardly be overrated. Reading his book, ending  with the word \u201cnichts,\u201d may also serve as an introduction to the concept of  \u201cnihilism,\u201d haunting an art on the verge of silence.       G51.1600 \u2013 Theory Clashes: The  Persistence of the Theologico \u2013 Political   - Avital Ronell, Slavoj Zizek, and Fran\u00e7ois Noudelman  The question of political theology has  become an increasingly important concern for students of literary and political  theory, religious studies, and philosophy. Starting off the course, Professor  Ronell will be hosting and engaging world renowned philosophers Slavoj Zizek  and Fran\u00e7ois Noudelmann on crucial aspects of political theology ranging from  the works of Jean-Luc Nancy on the deconstruction of Christianity to Derrida on  religion (Ronell) and the concept of the absent Third in Sartre, Ranci\u00e8re, and  Negri (Noudelmann).  G51.2250 - Post 1945 Germany: Polemics,  Provocation, Pop - Elke  Siegel  G51.1512 \u2013 Kafka - Friedrich Ulfers  The course will deal with Kafka\u2019s work  largely in the light of the author\u2019s preoccupation with language particularly  with the way this preoccupation affected his writing, indeed provided the theme  of it. The point of departure will be the experience of \u201clanguage crisis\u201d among  intellectuals and writers in turn of the century Austria, which led to the  radical language criticism \u2013 already foreshadowed by Nietzsche \u2013 of Fritz  Mauthner and Ludwig Wittgenstein among others. An interpretation of Kafka\u2019s  work aims to show not only the influences of this thinking on his writing, but  also how Kafka radicalized it so as to make it \u201cKafkaesque.\u201d Another aspect of  the course will be to examine Kafka as anticipating a line of writing and  thinking that could be described as deconstructive. In this context,  undecidability, the breakdown of referential language and irreducible  allusiveness will be shown as constitutive of Kafka\u2019s texts. This will  also be the context to discuss the problematization of the real, of judgment,  of justice, and the law that suffuses Kafka\u2019s writing.  SPRING 2010  G51.3399: Comparative Poetics:  Lyric Poetry - Prof. Ulrich Baer  This course is taught in English and  originates in the Comparative Literature Department.  A seminar that examines different  approaches to lyric poetry as a genre, a sensibility, a mood (Stimmung).  Particular emphasis will be placed on the modern lyric from formalist,  historicist, rhetorical/deconstructive, hermeneutic, cultural-sociological  (materialist), literary historical, philosophical perspectives. We will examine  how lyric poetry teaches us about these approaches and the relationship between  them, and to what extent poems contains their own ars poetica (\u201cthe art of  poetry\u201d)\u2013 or how reading poetry can teach us how to read in general. We will focus on a selection of poems  by the following authors: Sappho, Pindar, Du Fu, Li Po; William Wordsworth,  Percy Bysshe Shelley, John Keats, Robert Browning; Emily Dickinson, Walt  Whitman, Wallace Stevens, Elizabeth Bishop, Anne Carson; Friedrich H\u00f6lderlin,  Rainer Maria Rilke; Charles Baudelaire, St\u00e9phane Mallarm\u00e9, Paul Celan; Yehuda  Amichai, Octavio Paz.  The seminar will instruct students in  basic and advanced skills of interpreting lyric poetry, and in recognizing the  differences between periods, forms, and poets. It is also intended as a  reflection on the field of comparative literature by reading comparatively a  range of poets from distinct backgrounds and traditions. We will also compare existing  methodologies in the interpretation of literary works.  G51.1863: Psychoanlysis &amp;  Philosophy: Genealogies of Psychoanalysis -   Prof. Larry Rickels      Psychoanalysis, as institution of  higher yearning, is open to the address of the Superhuman, the Psycho, and the  Android. The following movies will be referred to  during class discussions: Batman Forever, Batman Returns, Dr. No, From  Russia with Love, Octopussy, Psycho, Halloween, Nightmare on Elm Street, Blade  Runner, Total Recall, and Minority Report .    G51.2912: Literature &amp;  Philosophy: Decadence -  Prof. Eckart Goebel       In his diaries young Robert Musil  portrays himself as \u201cMonsieur le vivisecteur,\u201d and thus provides this graduate  course on \u201cd\u00e9cadence\u201d with a certain perspective on a European movement. We  will read some famous texts from the 19th century from Pater to Wilde focusing  on their insights into the less boring aspects of the conditio humana, psychological,  physiological, sexual, and artistic subtleties: \u201cBeing natural is simply a  pose, and the most irritating pose I know\u201d (Wilde). The second part of the  class will discuss seminal works from the 20th century which were, for example  by Georg Luk\u00e1cs, banned as documents of \u201cbourgeois decadence,\u201d such as the  works of Kafka, and even Beckett. \u201cI think he is a little deranged,\u201d the  narrator says about Bartleby who prefers not to function in Downtown Manhattan.  The seminar intends to discuss the critical potential of those who are a little  deranged, dysfunctional, d\u00e9goutant, or decadent.  G51.1513: Brecht - Prof. Robert Cohen  Dialogical and intertextual to the  core, Brecht's oeuvre can be seen as an open-ended critical conversation with  philosophical, theoretical, political, economic, and aesthetic discourses from  Aristotle to Marx, Luk\u00e1cs, and Benjamin, as well as with readers and  theatergoers, with collaborators, colleagues and lovers. The result of these  conversations is a work in progress, a collection of unstable and endlessly revised  texts exploring the human experience in a time of class struggle, violence, and  war.  The course is conceived as a general  introduction to Brecht's work. Topics include the experience of the modern  metropolis; the disintegration of social and sexual relations; the destruction  of identity and the construction of a 'collective individuality;' Brecht's  Marxism and his contribution to a new dialectics; Brecht's formal innovations  in drama and poetry, and his theater theories.  Before any of the controversies which  Brecht's work evokes, it needs to be understood as literature. Discussions in  class will be based on close readings of the texts \u2013 poetry, plays, and  theoretical writings \u2013 and on the way meaning is produced through Brecht's  performative use of language (\" Gestus \"), as well as through  his use of modern\u00ad\u00adist literary techniques such as montage, frag\u00admen\u00adtation,  repetition, and distanciation/alienation (\"Verfremdung\").  FALL 2009  G51.1716 - Autobiographical Writing:  The Day in Writing (Diaries)   - Prof. Elke Siegel Das Tagebuch \u2013 in seiner modernen  Erscheinung seit dem 18. Jahrhundert als \u2018pers\u00f6nliches Tagebuch\u2019 \u2013 bereitet der  Literaturwissenschaft Schwierigkeiten, die ins Herz ihrer g\u00e4ngigen  Begrifflichkeiten \u2013 etwa Autorschaft und Gattung \u2013 treffen. Wie \u2013 dies eine  Fragen im Zentrum der Arbeit in diesem Seminar \u2013 ist ein solches  fragmentarisches Schreiben zu lesen, begreift man das Tagebuch nicht vorrangig  als Steinbruch f\u00fcr Informationen zu Biographie und Werkgeschichte oder als  historisches Dokument? Die Spannung von Ich und Welt, Alltag und Geschichte,  Subjektivit\u00e4t und Objektivit\u00e4t, \u00d6ffentlichkeit und Privatheit, Fiktion und  Dokumentarismus \u00f6ffnet und verhandelt jedes einzelne Tagebuch neu. Damit  widersteht dieses Schreiben am Rande der Form verallgemeinernden Bestimmungen.  Im Seminar werden wir uns mit ausgew\u00e4hlten Tageb\u00fcchern der deutschsprachigen  Literatur vom 18. bis zum 20. Jahrhundert besch\u00e4ftigen und dabei auch  beobachten, wie TagebuchautorInnen sich auf die Tageb\u00fccher anderer beziehen und  damit literarische Traditionslinien er\u00f6ffnen und/oder verweigern. Wir werden \u2013  in G\u00e4nze oder Ausz\u00fcgen \u2013 die Tageb\u00fccher u.a. folgender Autoren und Autorinnen  lesen: Lavater, Goethe, Hebbel, Grillparzer, Kafka, Doderer, J\u00fcnger, Frisch,  Frank, Wolf, Goetz, Gr\u00fcnbein, dies vor dem Hintergrund theoretischer  Interventionen von, z.B., Barthes, Genette und Blanchot. Besondere  Aufmerksamkeit wird dabei dem Problem des Autobiographischen (Philippe Lejeune)  gelten, sowie der Frage nach dem Verh\u00e4ltnis von Alltag und Schreiben.  Welche Rolle \u2013 dies eine der m\u00f6glichen  weiteren Fragen, die im Seminar zur Diskussion stehen werden \u2013 kommt dem  Tagebuch in der Geschichte des Subjekts zu? Welche Bedeutung erh\u00e4lt dabei der  Akt der Relekt\u00fcre des eigenen Tagebuchs? Registriert das Tagebuch den Tag oder  versucht es, ein Leben, einen Lebensplan zu projizieren? Und wie ist es um die  Literarizit\u00e4t des Tagebuchs bestellt? Handelt es sich bei dem im Datum  verankerten Schreiben gar um eine sch\u00fctzende Geste vor den Gefahren des  Schreibens und der Zeit, die das Subjekt zu zerschlagen drohen?    G51.2700 - TPCS: Representations of  Death - Prof.  Elisabeth Bronfen  The act of dying is something one can  expect or something one can witness. Yet it defies all unmediated articulation.  Representations of death, in turn, can be horrifying, fascinating or morally  elevating. In all cases, however, death has been translated into an image or a  story, and as such contained. The mortality we experience is not our own; the  medium we engage with is not the materiality of the mortal body but the  mediality of aesthetic signs. Death is the limit of representation but also one  of its most seminal sources of inspiration. The seminar will engage this  complex interface between death and represenation by looking at fictions  (Goethe's Elective Affinities, Poe's Tales and Sketches), Hitchcock's late  trilogy (Rear Window, Vertigo, Psycho), Freud's speculations on death, as well  as recycling of death photography (Andy Warhol, Jeff Wall).       G51.1112 - Problems in Critical Theory:  Metaphors, Examples, Anecdotes   - Prof. Paul Fleming  The course will explore the role of  para-theoretical (e.g., poetic, rhetorical, and narrative) elements within  philosophy and critical theory. In particular, it will examine the status of  the literary-rhetorical elements as at once illuminating and obscuring thought,  whereby the didactic function of metaphors, examples, and anecdotes lies in  compelling the reader to continually return to and hermeneutically re-examine  the material. The central focus will be on metaphors, examples, and anecdotes  in Western thought from Plato and the Bible to Classical rhetoric (Horace and  Quinitilian) to contemporary theory (DeMan, Derrida, Benjamin, and Blumenberg).  G51.2912 - Literature &amp; Philosophy:  Hegel, Freud, &amp; Literature   - Prof. Avital Ronell &amp; Prof. Slavoj Zizek  G51.1824 - Nietzsche's Impact on 20th  Century Thought - Prof.  Friedrich Ulfers  The objective of the seminar is to show  how Nietzsche revolutionized Western philosophy by transforming its dualistic-metaphysical  worldview into a holistic one that corresponds to the reality of the world as  one interrelated, processual whole. It will also show how this transformation  influenced significantly what is known as \u201cContinental Philosophy,\u201d which  includes such figures as Heidegger, Derrida, and Deleuze. Particular attention  will be paid to the meaning of Nietzsche\u2019s pronouncement that \u201cGod is dead\u201d;  his declaration that the world is \u201cWill to Power \u201d and an \u201caesthetic  phenomenon\u201d; and his idea of \u201cEternal Recurrence.\u201d Also discussed will be the  role language plays in Nietzsche\u2019s view on epistemology and ontology, his  revaluation of morality, and his influence on the arts.  G51.3000 - Independent Research   SPRING 2009   G51.2912 \u2013 Literature &amp; Philosophy:  Theories of Time - Prof. Paul North  In this class we will read texts that  consciously try to regain time as a concept, category, or intuition after the  European enlightenment. Following a singular development, starting from a  theorization of the transcendental subject of experience by means of time in  Kant, we will move toward the pointed dismantling of this configuration in  Heidegger, interestingly enough, also by means of time. Bookending the  course\u2014but not merely that\u2014the first and last volumes of Proust\u2019s In Search of  Lost Time will help explain the urgency that seems to characterize the gesture  toward time in what has been called \u201cmodernity.\u201d  G51.1720 \u2013 Echoes of Antiquity: Germany  and the Gre eks - Prof. John  Hamilton  This seminar investigates the rise and  development of German Philhellenism from Winckelmann to Heidegger. Topics  include antiquarianism and national identity; originality, genius, and  tradition; pedagogy and revolution; the formation of the lyrical subject;  representations of the classical body; Dionysus and theories of tragedy;  philology, classical scholarship, and institutional history .  G51.1919 \u2013 Literature of the Weimer  Period: Philosophical Anthropology   - Prof. Eckart Goebel       The course provides a careful close  reading of key texts on philosophical anthropology. We will start with Kant\u2019s  highly influential Anthropologie in pragmatischer Hinsicht, followed by a  reconstruction of Nietzsche\u2019s theory of civilization developed in his  Morgenr\u00f6te, focusing mainly on book 1. The second part of the seminar is meant  to discuss Arnold Gehlen\u2019s notorious book on Der Mensch (including an analysis  of the famous radio debate between Gehlen, and Adorno, provided in copy), as  well as a discussion of Martin Heidegger\u2019s critique of philosophical anthropology,  formulated in his book on Kant und das Problem der Metaphysik (including, as an  appendix, the seminal debate between Cassirer and Heidegger in Davos). The  seminar will provide background information on further reading, such as Helmuth  Plessner, Max Scheler, and Michel Foucault. Books: Immanuel Kant, Schriften zur  Anthropologie, Werkausgabe Bd. XII (Suhrkamp Taschenbuch) Friedrich Nietzsche,  Morgenr\u00f6the, Kritische Studienausgabe (dtv-Taschenbuch) Arnold Gehlen, Der  Mensch, Aula paperback Ausgabe Helmuth Plessner, Die Stufen des Organischen und  der Mensch, de Gruyter paperback  G51.1994 \u2013 Realism: Problems in 19th  Century Prose - Prof. Paul Fleming         This seminar is a systematic  introduction to the problems of representation in 19th-century prose, particularly  with respect to notions of the everyday, the ordinary, and the average. The  course explores to what extent language can produce a \u2018reality effect,\u2019 and  whether the quotidian, by means of such detailed description, necessarily leaps  into the realm of the exemplary. Authors include Tieck, Grillparzer, Keller,  Stifter, and Fontane.  G29.2640 - Romanticism &amp; Revolution - Prof. Richard Sieburth       The course will explore various  literary and philosophical reactions to the French Revolution during the late 18th  and early 19th centuries in Germany, England, and France.  FALL 2008  Goethe: The Art of Dilettantism - Paul Fleming  This seminar examines Goethe\u2019s  literature and thought through the prism of dilettantism, the art of doing  things in a non-professional manner. Dilettantism for Goethe is a modern  phenomenon, concomitant with the rise of the bourgeois subject, and is thus  inextricable from questions surrounding art, education, and knowledge since the  18th century. In addition to Goethe\u2019s poetry, prose, and drama, we will also  examine his aesthetic, scientific, and autobiographical writings. A further  focal point will be the reception of Goethe and the question of tradition.   Object Relations: Melanie Klein - Laurence Rickels (Visiting Professor)  The seminar will focus on the work of  Melanie Klein, its point of departure in Karl Abraham\u2019s reflections on  melancholia and its running commentary on (and continuity with) Freud\u2019s \u201csecond  system.\u201d The delegation of Klein\u2019s thought proceeds via a series of controversies:  Klein\u2019s followers were largely guided and contextualized via the contest with  the \u201cAnna Freudians\u201d in London in the 1940s, while Klein\u2019s reception today (in  the humanities) is inflected by the ambivalent revalorization of her work  within French Freud.  War, Text, Image - Elisabeth Bronfen (Distinguished  Global Professor of German)       War: Literally a state of open, armed,  often prolonged, conflict carried on between nations, states, or parties.  Figuratively a condition of active antagonism or contention. War is not only a  concrete condition but also a trope for all the other antagonisms that  structure our sense of who we are, what our relation is to the world, and how  others relate to us. Point of departure for this seminar is the question why  the political situation of embattlement has served so resiliently as theme,  scene, topos and Denkfigur in our cultural imagination. The seminar will  involve four domains of inquiry: 1. Shakespeare's Henry V and its  cinematic afterlife; 2. Kleist's Penthesilea and the battle of the  sexes; 3. Cinematic enactments of battlescenes; and 4. Cultural theoretical  issues involved in the representation of war.   SPRING 2008  Interdisciplinary approaches to  Literature: German Music and Letters   - Prof. John Hamilton  This seminar examines the history of  music and music theory in specific relation to German literature, philosophy,  and criticism. Particular focus is given to the employment of music as a  privileged metaphor in literary projects as well as music\u2019s distance from and appropriation  of verbal and linguistic structures. Session topics include: theories of the  harmony of the spheres; synaesthesia, Romanticism and Universalpoesie ;  Wagner, tragedy and the Gesamtkunstwerk ; absolute music and the  tone-poem; secularization and the rise of chromatization; the semiotics of  music; and music and psychoanalysis. Historical and cultural contexts will be  presented as a number of predominant theoretical questions are developed,  including but not limited to the following: the presumed immediacy or  singularity of musical expression versus the mediation or abstraction of verbal  language; the relation of tonal language and text; the reciprocal,  philosophical critique of music and poetry; the \u201cliteralization\u201d of music;  patriotism, nationalism, and racism. The course ends with a close reading of  Thomas Mann\u2019s Doktor Faustus , a novel that is profoundly critical  of, while being thoroughly informed by, the tradition outlined here.          Archive, Image, Text - Prof. Ulrich Baer  This interdisciplinary seminar explores  the role of the archive as the actual and conceptual origin or grounding  context of much, if not all, research in the arts and humanities. Virtually all  intellectual inquiry into artistic and humanistic expression \u2013 whether we are  considering artworks, literary texts or scholarly productions \u2013 ultimate makes  reference to one authoritative version of the object under discussion. This  version is most frequently housed in some kind of actual or virtual archive  from where the work is canonized, and effectively put into circulation.  The archive is supposed to guarantee  authenticity while permitting revisions and rethinking of the humanistic  heritage. The archive is thus at once the solid reference point and grounding  origin of scholarly work, and the site where prevailing views are most  effectively challenged or overthrown. This class will examine two particular  aspects of this process: the notion of the archive as an actual physical  location that houses actual objects and artifacts beyond an artist\u2019s lifespan,  and the metaphor of the archive as the receptacle of past knowledge and a  work\u2019s inalienable history. Different types of archives and issues will be  addressed, since we will include literary works, art objects, political  documents, racial and national repositories as well as technological storage  \u201cspaces\u201d in our discussions. Guest speakers, experts on various types of  research materials, will supplement lectures by the two professors, who  specialize in the history and theory of modern texts and images respectively.  Updating classical concepts of the archive, we will try to examine how new  technologies are rapidly changing both the nature and the power of information,  and thus its repositories.  Anna Seghers, Christa Wolf &amp; Theory  of Narration - Prof. Robert Cohen  The works of Seghers and Wolf have  acquired iconic status. They appear overdetermined by their authors' identities  as women, as communists, as Jewish (Seghers) or Protestant (Wolf), as Nazi  victims (Seghers) or perpetrators (Wolf's childhood), and as key figures of  Weimar modern\u00adism (Seghers) and of the literature of the GDR. Analyses and  interpretations will proceed from close readings of the texts, with emphasis on  the theoretical problems of modernist narration and on the way meaning is constructed  in 20th century fiction (novels, novel\u00adlas, historical and autobio\u00adgraphical  fiction). Several sessions will be devoted to theories of narration from K\u00e4the  Hamburger, Franz Stanzel, and G\u00e9rard Genette, to Philippe Lejeune's theory of  autobiography. The sessions on Seghers will focus on the avant-gardist  narrative techniques of works such as Aufstand der Fischer von St. Barbara   and \"Der Ausflug der toten M\u00e4dchen.\"  Readings of other works \u2013 Transit ,  \"Die sch\u00f6nsten Sagen vom R\u00e4uber Woynok,\" Die Reisebegegnung\" \u2013  will investigate Seghers' repeated recourse to cross over narration (a woman  narrating as a man), and her use of mythology, fairy tales and the  fantastic as ways of disrupting traditional notions of realism. Discussions of  Wolf's work will focus on the late modernist agenda of transforming the  writer's own life into the subject of fiction ( Nachdenken \u00fcber Christa T. ,   St\u00f6rfall ); and on the construction of the female subject, and its  constantly threatened destruction in patriarchal society, from Nachdenken  \u00fcber Christa T. through its staging in historical ( Kein Ort. Nirgends )  and mythological costumes ( Kassandra ).        Exemplary Texts: Poetry &amp;  Experience - Prof. Avital  Ronell  In the Presence of Noise: Theories and  Media - Prof.  Hans-Christian von Herrman n At the end of the 1970s when the era of  the personal computer was dawning a new kind of media theories started to break  up with the sociological analysis of mass media communication by analyzing  modernity\u2019s technological unconscious. As the seminar will show these concepts  emerged from the confluence of three main sources: French poststructuralist  theory, Canadian media history and American information theory. The reading  list will include texts by Vil\u00e9m Flusser, Friedrich Kittler, Paul Virilio, R\u00e9gis  Debray, Niklas Luhmann, and others.  FALL 2007  Psychoanalysis and Philosophy: Love\u2019s  Body revisited. The Religion of Psychoanalysis - Professor Eckart Goebel        This graduate course is intended to  reread the relation between religion and psychoanalysis. The first part is  devoted to key figures of religious thought, such as St. Augustine, Pascal, and  Luther who were at the same time path breaking as analysts of the human psyche.  We will read Erikson\u2019s book on Luther since Erikson had the provocative thesis  that Luther actually invented what Freud then was forced to study 400 years  later. Before the seminar turns to Freud\u2019s writings on religion and monotheism  we will read a key book for the development of psychoanalysis, especially the  concepts of the Nirvana principle or the Death Drive: Schopenhauer\u2019s seminal  work on The World as Will and Representation . This first part is  followed by close readings of several Freudian writings. The overall goal of  this seminar is to equip students of literary studies with the background  information needed for a better understanding of modern literature and advanced  literary theory.  Literature and Philosophy: More  Trauma - Professor Avital  Ronell  Visual Culture - Taught by Prof. Elizabeth Bronfen  SPRING 2007  Origins of Critical thought II - Professor Paul Fleming  In this continuation of Origins of  Critical Thought, we follow two trajectories of critical thinking in Germany  since Hegel. The first is the hermeneutic-interpretative tradition  beginning with Schleiermacher, proceeding through Dilthey, Nietzsche, and  Freud, and ending with Gadamer\u2019s epochal work Truth and Method. The  second trajectory addresses the differences and disputes of the two most  influential critical directions in the 20th century: Heidegger  and the Frankfurt School. Finally, we will look at critical thought today  in Germany and its two most influential representatives: Kittler and Luhmann.  Whenever possible, we will try to create a dialogue \u2013 at times friendly, at  times antagonistic \u2013 between two thinkers for each session.   Postwar Modernism: Max Frisch &amp;  Peter Weiss, - Professor Robert  Cohen       Though neither Max Frisch nor Peter  Weiss was German, they were key figures in the reconstitution of (West-) German  post-war litera\u00adture. Their works are both paradigmatic of, and different from,  the literature of their German contemporaries (Andersch, B\u00f6ll, K\u00f6ppen, Walser)  which emerged out of the collapse of Germany. From vantage points located at  the periphery of German culture (Switzerland in the case of Frisch, Sweden for  Peter Weiss) the two authors functioned like seismographs reacting to post-war  reality. Their use of innovative and avant-gardism forms in drama and prose  reflects the problematic of recovering the recent past and decoding a complex  present. After prose works exploring the immediate post-war trauma and  reconstituting the (literary) subject both Frisch and Weiss turned to drama and  produced works which focus on anti-Semitism and Auschwitz. These plays will be  read against canonized texts by Sartre and Adorno. Frisch and Weiss's evolution  from modernist into post-modernist writing will be traced through their later  works which decenter and dissolve narrative certainty and signal a new kind of  text with unstable and multiple meanings and uncertain chronologies. In order  to situate these works in the aesthetic and literary context of the postwar  period, two sessions will be devoted to theories of modernism, the avant-garde,  and postmodernism. Beyond \u2013 and before \u2013 all the topical issues these works  evoke, however, they need to be understood as literature. Discussions in class  will be based on close readings, on the narrative and dramatic structures of  these texts, and generally on the way meaning is produced in literary texts.  FALL 2006   Theories of History - Professor Werner Hamacher  In Theories of History we are  going to discuss some of the classical texts from the history of thinking about  history \u2013 in particular Kant\u00b4s \"Idea for a Universal History\" and  \"An Old Question Raised Again: Is the Human Race Constantly  Progressing?\", Hegel\u00b4s lecture course on \"Philosophy of  History\", the relevant paragraphs from Heidegger\u00b4s \"Being and  Time\" and Benjamin\u00b4s notes on the structure of history and cognition.          Fascism &amp; Sexuality - Professor Christopher Clark  This seminar will explore the  relationships between fascism (primarily, but not exclusively in its German  form) and sexuality. Primary topics of analysis in this course are the central  importance of sexuality to fascism not only in historical practice but in  theory, as well as the (dubiously) privileged status of sexuality in theories  of fascism continuing through today. We will begin with the Nazi era, noting  what constituted acceptable and forbidden expressions of gender and sexuality,  in theory and in everyday life. We will proceed through the postwar era to the  present, examining the ways in which artists, theorists, and historians have  continually portrayed and analyzed fascism in sexual terms, paying particular  attention to the recurring figure of \u201cthe gay Nazi.\u201d We will also address such  phenomena as gays and lesbians in the Holocaust (and debates over their  memorialization), the intrinsic homophobia of much antifascist critique, the  1970s \u201cNaziploitation film,\u201d and contemporary queer skinheads, with an eye  toward which of these are historically specific and which still determine the  terms and framing of discourse on fascism today. Readings/viewings include  Mann, Hitler, Genet, Sontag, Mosse, Theweleit, Fassbinder, Visconti, Cavani,  Pasolini, LaBruce, and others. No expertise in spoken or written German is  required for participation in the course. However, graduate students from the  Department of German, as well as students from other departments who are  concentrating in part on German literature, will be expected to read a number  of the primary texts in the original German.       Der Mann ohne Eigenschaften - Professor Eckart Goebel  Torture and Authority - Professor Avital Ronell  Led by an overriding concern with the  concept of legitimacy , the course offers a wide ranging  theoretical exploration of modalities of torture and the underpinnings of  authority. Some topoi, ranging from the chain gang to the culture of bondage  and national political behaviors, include penal styles, the disappearance and  returns of torture as spectacle, the punishment-body, the right to punish, the  punitive ceremony as an exercise of terror, forces of revenge, the final exam,  and so forth. We will take recourse to key psychoanalytic, philosophical and  literary texts that have established a lexicon of torture, gauging specific  effects of authority, whether betrayed, corrupt, book-bound, or legitimate. The  course will consider the status of minoritized, disenfranchized figures, those  subjected to legal as well as institutional persecution. One starting point  will be Adorno's thoughts on the \"authoritarian personality,\" which  gets profiled close by, in conjunction with Blanchot's pages in The Infinite  Conversation , \"The Indestructible.\"  SPRING 2006        Photography &amp; the World - Professor Ulrich Baer  An investigation into the ways  photography has been conceptualized since its inception until its recent  transformation brought about by the advent of digital imaging. Particular  attention will be paid to the notion of the \u2018world\u2019 as it informs most  theoretical attempts to grasp photography; the way in which the rise of  photography is indissociably linked to the emergence of psychoanalysis and  phenomenology; theories of perception; issues of veracity, mimesis, and  aesthetics; and the relation between photography and its historical moment.          Kafka   - Professor Friedrich Ulfers  The course will deal with Kafka\u2019s work  largely in the light of the author\u2019s preoccupation with language particularly  with the way this preoccupation affected his writing, indeed provided the theme  of it. The point of departure will be the experience of \u201clanguage crisis\u201d among  intellectuals and writers in turn of the century Austria, which led to the  radical language criticism \u2013 already foreshadowed by Nietzsche \u2013 of Fritz Mauthner  and Ludwig Wittgenstein among others. An interpretation of Kafka\u2019s work aims to  show not only the influences of this thinking on his writing, but also how  Kafka radicalized it so as to make it \u201cKafkaesque.\u201d Another aspect of the  course will be to examine Kafka as anticipating a line of writing and thinking  that could be described as deconstructive. In this context,  undecidability, the breakdown of referential language, and irreducible  allusiveness will be shown as constitutive of Kafka\u2019s texts. This will  also be the context to discuss the problematization of the real, of judgment,  of justice, and the law that suffuses Kafka\u2019s writing.       Literature &amp; Depression: The  Sickness to Death - Professor Eckart  Goebel  The seminar starts with an  investigation of seminal theoretical texts on mourning and melancholia (Freud,  Klein, Spielrein). It continues with close readings of canonical text of the  philosophical and literary tradition from Kierkegaard to T. S. Eliot, and  Heidegger. The course discusses the history of depression between mediation  (language, art), meditation (religion), and medication (Prozac) and tries to  reconstruct the role of art and poetry within this flexible scaffolding.          Brecht - Professor Robert Cohen  Dialogical and intertextual in the  extreme, Brecht's oeuvre can be seen as an endless critical conversation with  readers and theatergoers, with collaborators, colleagues and lovers, as well as  with philosophical, theoretical, political, economic, and aesthetic theories  from Aristotle to Marx, Lukacs, and Benjamin. The result of these conversations  is a work in progress, a collection of unstable and endlessly revised texts  exploring the human experience in a time of class struggle, violence, and war.  Within this framework the course is conceived as a general introduction to  Brecht's work. Some of the topics the course will focus on are: the experience  of the modern metropolis; the destruction of identity and the construction of a  'collective individuality;' the disintegration of social and sexual relations;  Brecht's Marxism and his contribution to a new dialectics; Brecht's formal  innovations in drama and poetry, and his theater theories. Beyond all the  controversial issues which Brecht's oeuvre (and life) evoke, it needs to be  understood as literature. Discussions in class will be based on close readings  of the texts - poetry, plays, and theoretical works - and on the way  meaning is produced through Brecht's performative use of language (\" Gestus \"),  as well as through his use of modern\u00ad\u00adist literary techniques such as montage,  frag\u00admen\u00adtation and repetition, and \"Verfremdung.\"                                                                                                        Back to Top"}, {"content": "Course Offerings    | German | NYU                                                                                                                                                     Back to Previous Page         Course Offerings     Placement    All students with previous study of German should take a placement examination before registering for their first courses in those languages; see \" Placement Examinations \" in the Academic Policies section of this Bulletin. The departmental placement process consists of a consultation with the director of language programs to choose the level of language instruction most appropriate to the individual student's needs and abilities.      Language Requirement    The department offers courses allowing students to complete the College of Arts and Science language requirement in German. Students may choose either the extensive sequence of four 4-point courses or the intensive sequence of two 6-point courses. Students planning to major in German are advised to follow the intensive sequence.      Basic Language Courses in German    All German language courses use communicative methodology. Elementary-level courses introduce students to essential linguistic and social conventions of contemporary spoken German, with an emphasis on establishing conversational skills. Intermediate-level courses introduce more complex features of the language and focus on building reading and writing skills, while continuing to develop conversational ability.      Extensive Sequence    Elementary German I GERM-UA 1 Open only to students with no previous training in German; others require permission of the department. Offered every semester. 4 points.

Offered every semester. 6 points. Completes the equivalent of a year's intermediate work (GERM-UA 3 and GERM-UA 4) in one semester. Continuing emphasis on developing spoken and written communication skills. Students learn more-advanced features of the language and begin to read longer and more-complex texts.      Postintermediate Courses in Language, Culture, and Literature (100 Level)    These are \"bridge\" courses between basic language study and more advanced courses. The common goal of courses at this level is to consolidate students' command of spoken and written German, to review advanced structures of the language, and to provide core information that will be needed in advanced study of literature and culture. Particular emphasis is placed on the development of complex reading and writing skills and their integration with speaking skills. All courses at this level are conducted in German. All German courses at the 100 level require successful completion of GERM-UA 4 or GERM-UA 20, or permission of the department.    German Conversation and Composition GERM-UA 111 Offered every year. 4 points. Required for the German major. Aims to improve students' proficiency in writing and speaking German in three functional areas: description, narration, and argumentation. Grammar and vocabulary are reviewed and practiced as appropriate. Students examine and discuss texts of various genres, then draft and present work of their own in each genre. Discussion and writing components are closely coordinated. Activities include presentations, peer review, guided writing, and editing.    Advanced Composition and Grammar GERM-UA 114 Offered periodically. 4 points. Improves students' proficiency in writing German at an advanced level. Students develop skills in the functional areas of analysis, interpretation, and argumentation.

This seminar offers an interdisciplinary introduction to the culture of turn-of-the-century Vienna, one of the birthplaces of twentieth-century modernism. The works of Austrian writers, artists, architects, composers, and thinkers will be studied against the backdrop of the political and social climate of the Habsburg monarchy\u2019s final years. Works from a wide variety of fields\u2014including literary texts (poetry, prose, and drama), film, music, art, architecture, philosophy, and psychology\u2014form the core of this course. We will consider how cultural production is both shaped by and reflects its historical context. Figures we will engage with include Sigmund Freud, Arthur Schnitzler, Hugo von Hofmannsthal, Gustav Klimt, Arnold Sch\u00f6nberg, Gustav Mahler, Adolf Loos, Theodor Herzl, and Berta Zuckerkandl. This course is a 100-level, post-intermediate course in German, which will also focus on language acquisition at the advanced level. A portion of the course will involve visits to museums in New York, such as the Neue Galerie.    Introduction to German Literature GERM-UA 152 Offered every year. 4 points. Required for the German major. Introduces students to representative authors and works of German literature, with emphasis on the modern period. Students learn basic conventions of literature and literary interpretation, as well as strategies for the effective reading of shorter and longer prose works, drama, and poetry. Guided writing assignments focus on developing the language skills necessary for effective written analysis and interpretation of literary texts in German.    Techniques of Translation GERM-UA 153 Offered periodically. 4 points. Introduces students to the history, theory, and practice of translation through German and English texts taken from a variety of cultural backgrounds. While engaging in the craft of translation firsthand, students encounter diverse grammatical, syntactical, and stylistic problems, thus gaining a deeper understanding of the German language. Also stresses the acquisition of vocabulary and complex idiomatic structures necessary for effective reading comprehension, as well as written expression.       Advanced Literature and Culture Courses Conducted in English (200 Level)    Courses at the 200 level are conducted in English. Literature-oriented courses at this level may count in fulfillment of the College's minor in literature in translation. Many of these courses are cross-listed with other NYU departments or programs. No knowledge of German is required for courses at this level, and there are no prerequisites.    Introduction to German Culture GERM-UA 220 Offered periodically. 4 points. German thinkers and artists have exerted a profound influence on the history of philosophy, aesthetics, literature, and science. This course aims not only at providing an introduction to crucial periods and events in German cultural history since the Enlightenment, but also at familiarizing students with some of the most important figures in modern intellectual and aesthetic history. The philosophies of Kant and Nietzsche; the music of Mozart and Wagner; the literary contributions of Lessing, Goethe, Fontane, and Brecht; as well as the art movements of dada and Bauhaus all serve as the basis for a discussion of the complex constellation of \"kultur,\" politics, and power in the German intellectual tradition.    Marx, Nietzsche, Freud GERM-UA 240 Offered periodically. 4 points. Examines the work of these three seminal authors by focusing on their notions of interpretation, history, subjectivity, politics, religion, and art. The seminar does not present their work chronologically, but rather creates a dialogue between the authors around each topic and, thereby, delineates the origins of much modern thought.    The German Intellectual Tradition GERM-UA 244 Offered periodically. 4 points. Designed to familiarize students with the major currents of German intellectual and literary history. Organized thematically, conceptually, or according to the trajectories associated with crucial thinkers.

Topics in German Cinema GERM-UA 253 Offered periodically. 4 points. Introduces special topics in acquainting students with significant contributions emerging from the German cinematic tradition. Selections are studied generically, thematically, or by historical period. Emphasis is also placed on issues of film analysis and theory. Possible course topics are new German cinema, film and feminism, early German film, and film and nationalism.    Modernism GERM-UA 265 Offered periodically. 4 points. Focuses on the emergence of mass culture and shows how the modernist and avant-garde movements question the very institution of art in work. Materials include works of literature, theory, film, and the visual arts.    Madness and Genius GERM-UA 285 Offered periodically. 4 points. Explores the relationship among talent, inspiration, and psychological instability in works of the 19th and 20th centuries. Considers the link between inspiration and possession, Western culture's valorization of originality, the political purpose of characterizing originality as psychologically transgressive, and the allegorization of the creative process through depictions of madness.    Topics in 19th-Century Literature GERM-UA 297 Identical to COLIT-UA 180. Offered periodically. 4 points.    Topics in 20th-Century Literature GERM-UA 298 Offered periodically. 4 points.      Advanced Literature and Culture Courses Conducted in German (300 Level)    Courses at this level provide a broad historical overview of specific periods in German literary and cultural development. Advanced German language skills are practiced, with particular emphasis on the ability to summarize and on the expression of supported opinion. Students read more texts of greater linguistic and conceptual complexity than those used at the 100 level, although readings consist primarily of short works and excerpts. Readings are drawn from literary and nonliterary sources.    It is recommended that students complete GERM-UA 152 or the equivalent before enrolling in courses at the 300 level.

German Poetry GERM-UA 385 Offered periodically. 4 points. Survey of significant authors and developments in German poetry, with emphasis on the 19th and 20th centuries. Traces basic themes and examines narrative, dramatic, and lyric structures in poetry.    Topics in 19th Century Literature GERM-UA 397 Offered periodically. 4 points. Course focuses on 19th-century German literature by examining various intersections between cultural, social, and scientific discourse. Study of German novellas and drama from romanticism to realism and naturalism with a focus on form, genre, and narrativity.     Advanced Seminars Conducted in German (400 Level)    These courses examine authors, groups of works, and intellectual, aesthetic, and social movements of particular significance in the development of German literature and culture. These courses have a narrower focus than do those at the 300 level; the emphasis is on in-depth examination rather than on overview. Readings are longer and more linguistically demanding than those used at the previous level. Language work focuses on conjecture and the expression of abstract concepts, in both written and spoken German.    Goethe GERM-UA 455 Offered periodically. 4 points. Examines Goethe as the pivotal literary figure of his time. Considers Goethe's prose, poetry, and drama from the late Enlightenment through storm and stress to classicism and beyond.    The Age of Goethe GERM-UA 456 Offered periodically. 4 points. Examines German reaction to the Enlightenment in the literature of storm and stress and of classicism. Considers irrationalism, social protest, and Humanit\u00e4tsdichtung as successive stages of the expansion of consciousness in an age in which Goethe was the central, but not the only significant, literary figure. Readings include Herder, Von der Urpoesie der V\u00f6lker and selected poems; Lenz, Die Soldaten; Schiller, Die R\u00e4uber, Kabale und Liebe, Maria Stuart, and selected poems; and H\u00f6lderlin, selected poems.

Johann Fausten; Goethe's Urfaust and excerpts from his later dramatic versions (Faust, Ein Fragment; Faust I and II); and Thomas Mann's Doktor Faustus.    Literature of the Weimar Period GERM-UA 468 Offered periodically. 4 points. The chaotic Weimar period (1918-33) began with a revolution and ended with the takeover by the Nazis. During these few years, German modernism evolved from expressionism to the aesthetics of new sobriety (Neue Sachlichkeit). From the more traditional (Thomas Mann, Hermann Hesse) to the experimental and revolutionary (Bertolt Brecht, Anna Seghers), the works of this period draw into question its subsequent glorification as the golden '20s. Readings include works by Brecht, Hesse, Roth, Seghers, Klaus Mann, and Thomas Mann.    Minority Discourses GERM-UA 475 Offered periodically. 4 points. In recent years, literary productions have emerged that fall under the heading of \"minority\" literatures, often understood as texts written in German by so-called foreigners. This course examines this notion critically and also analyzes the impact of individual works in relation to current debates on multiculturalism, integration, and national identity.    Seminar on 19th-Century Authors GERM-UA 487 Offered periodically. 4 points.    Seminar on 20th-Century Authors GERM-UA 488 Offered periodically. 4 points. Each of these courses provides advanced students of German with an in-depth knowledge of one major author of either the 19th or 20th century. Works of the chosen author are examined in terms of how he or she contributes to, and possibly challenges, prevailing aesthetic, political, and cultural trends of his or her time.

Baroque:   The  Sovereign and the Law in German Tragedy (Gryphius to Kleist) Christiane Frey &amp; Guest Lecturer Slavoj Zizek  What is the relationship between sovereignty and the law? Is the law  sovereign? Or does it owe its legitimacy to the sovereignty that institutes it?  In the early modern era, these issues are subject to new scrutiny and  negotiation on at least three levels: politics or political theology (as it is  depicted in drama); poetics and the law of genre (as it is realized in the  writing of drama); and \u201cphilosophy of nature,\u201d in which the notion of modern  science emerges from a new concept of the laws of nature. The course explores  the relationship of law to sovereignty in all three of these domains with an  emphasis on the first. We will ask what drama has to say about the nature of  law and how drama\u2019s relationship to the law of genre lends it a unique status  in the discourse on law and sovereignty. Plays from Andreas Gryphius\u2019s baroque  tragedy Leo Armenius to Kleist\u2019s Prinz Friedrich von Homburg ;  source texts from the history of science; literary and political theory  from Aristotle to Benjamin, Derrida, and Roberto Esposito. Discussion in  English; reading knowledge of German required.   GERM-GA1650 T 3:30 - 6:10; This course meets from 9/2 through 9/30. Visual  Culture: Series, Repetition, Seriality. Where literature meets quality t.v.  Elisabeth Bronfen  Matthew Weiner\u2019s Mad Men not only  uses the literature of the 1960s as one of its frames of reference but also  picks up on the claim to moral imagination for which the Victorian novel is  famous. While much has been made of the analogy between the serialization of  fiction in periodicals and the t.v. series format, this block seminar will  explore the thematic and rhetorical implications of repetition and seriality on  which such a comparison is also predicated. How does seriality appear in both  19th century fiction and early 21st century quality t.v. as a thematic concern?  How do the plethora of individual portraits produced by a serialized text also  form a network of relations that offer up a coherent whole? What rhetorical  strategies does each text deploy so as to call forth both intellectual and  affective empathy? What imaginary community is thus produced? We will use  Freud\u2019s psychoanalytic discussion of repetition along with Deleuze\u2019s comment on  this as our theoretical frame for a crossmapping that brings Eliot\u2019s Middlemarch and Keller\u2019s Leute von Seldwyla into conversation  with the first two seasons of Mad Men .  Since all three texts are long, please begin with the reading/viewing well in  advance.  GERM-GA1115 W 3:30 \u2013 6:10  Origins  of Critical Thought I: \u201cTrag\u00f6die im Sittlichen\u201d (Kant \u2013 Schiller \u2013 Hegel)  Eckart Goebel  This seminar, conducted in German, discusses key texts on ethics from  around 1800. We begin with Kant\u2019s Grundlegung zur Metaphysik der Sitten,  and his Anthropologie in pragmatischer Hinsicht. We will then read  two of Schiller\u2019s essays (\u00dcber Anmut und W\u00fcrde and \u00dcber das Erhabene),  reflecting on Kant\u2019s thought. The remaining sessions will be used to  reconstruct Hegel\u2019s concept of a \u201cTrag\u00f6die im Sittlichen\u201d as it has been  developed in his early anti-Kantian essay \u00dcber die wissenschaftlichen  Behandlungsarten des Naturrechts. A more refined understanding of the \u201cTrag\u00f6die  im Sittlichen\u201d requires a careful reading of the reflections on tragedy Hegel  unfolds in his Ph\u00e4nomenologie des Geistes and in his Vorlesungen \u00fcber  die \u00c4sthetik. In order to prepare this seminar, a reading of the tragedies  Hegel is referring to, is highly recommended: Aeschylus\u2019 Eumenides,  Sophocles\u2019 Antigone, Shakespeare\u2019s Hamlet, Schiller\u2018s Wallenstein , and Goethe\u2019s Faust I. Origins of Critical Thought II, dealing with post-Kantian  'Philosophical Anthropology' (Plessner, Gehlen, Heidegger, Adorno, Freud,  Blumenberg) will take place in Spring 2015.       GERM-GA1512 W 6:20 \u2013 8:20 Kafka  Friedrich Ulfers  The course will deal with Kafka\u2019s work largely in the light of the author\u2019s  preoccupation with language, particularly with the way this preoccupation  affected his writing, indeed provided the topic of it. The point of departure  will be the experience of \u201clanguage crisis\u201d among intellectuals and writers in  turn of the century Austria, which led to the radical criticism of conceptual  or referential language\u2013 already foreshadowed by Nietzsche \u2013 of Fritz Mauthner  and Ludwig Wittgenstein, among others. The course will then show Kafka\u2019s  response to this crisis: his insight that conceptual/referential language and  oppositional/binary involves an abstraction of the \u201ctruth\u201d or the \u201creal,\u201d which  is only apprehensible in a space of radical undecidability between opposites,  demanding a language of irreducible allusiveness, a language that is constitutive  of Kafka\u2019s texts.  GERM-GA2610 R 1:30 - 4:20  Special  Topics in Theory - Unpacking Derrida\u2019s Library: The Secret to the Archive  Avital Ronell  Marking the tenth anniversary of Derrida\u2019s death, this course revisits  Derrida\u2019s library in order to suggest that his texts are more valuable today  than ever before. His library may even be a space for reading and writing  that\u2014dominated by texts that no longer correspond only to the \u201cbook\u201d form, and  by a corpus that exceeds the library that would contain it\u2014touches on the  entirety of the world. Open 24 hours a day, every day of the year, it forces  us, in Derrida\u2019s words, \u201cinto a delirium of reading\u201d that reads us as much as  it teaches us to read\u2014actively, historically, politically, and ethically. The  course will provide an opportunity to remember several of his lessons\u2014about  philosophy, literature, history, politics, religion, economics, ideology, law,  rights, nationalism, racism, colonialism, the media, university institutions,  capitalism, rogue states, the war on terror, justice, responsibility, language,  friendship, love, life, death, and, mourning\u2014all of which are more urgent and  necessary than ever before. It should never be said\u2014as so many have, and will  no doubt continue to say\u2014that his work did not engage history and politics,  that his work retreated from what remains most important to us. From the  beginning he proceeded in the conviction that his philosophical activity did  not require a political or ethical practice because it already was, from the  start, an ethico- political practice. This course takes place at Princeton  University. Students should enroll through the Inter-University Doctoral  Consortium.  GERM-GA3000 TBD Independent Research  GERM-GA3100-001  ENGL-GA3629-001 (Course originating in English  Department)  W 6:20 \u2013 8:20; 244 Greene Street, Room 306     Politics in  Deconstruction  Geoffrey Bennington   Taking its lead from some of Derrida\u2019s later work,  this course will set off again from Aristotle\u2019s famous characterization of man  as a zoon politikon, and follow the threads of sovereignty and democracy  through some of the great texts of political philosophy in the Western  tradition. We shall attempt to understand why both of these notions pose such  problems for that tradition, and give rise to all manner of complications and  paradoxes, which turn out to be definitive of the conceptual space of the  political as such. We shall wonder why almost all traditional political  philosophers are enamored of sovereignty, while almost none has anything very  good to say about democracy. We shall consider the possibility of a non-trivial  affinity between the political, the rhetorical, the literary, and animality in  their constant tendency to exceed conceptual grasp, and also compare our  deconstructive approach to these political questions with some other  contemporary theories. Classic authors to be discussed will include Plato, Aristotle,  Machiavelli, Bodin, Hobbes, Spinoza, Rousseau, Kant, Hegel and Schmitt; more  recent theorists to be considered alongside Derrida may include Agamben,  Badiou, Foucault, Hardt and Negri, Lyotard, Mouffe and Ranci\u00e8re.  GERM-GA1221-001 MEDI-GA 2100-003 (Course originating in MARC) T, R 11:00-12:15pm   Dawn  Songs in Middle High German Literature  Jessica Quinlan   Ow\u00ea, nu ist  ez tac! A scenario describing the pain experienced by  lovers who must part at daybreak seems to have been the subject of lyrical  reflection the world over from well before the time of Christ. In the European  Middle Ages, the dawn song ( Tagelied )  enjoyed particular popularity in the German tradition. It depicts scenes of awakening,  lamentation and farewell, couched as narrative action with dialogue. Between  the 12th and 15th centuries, this pattern is repeated,  redrawn and almost endlessly varied; the subject of the dawn song is recreated,  inverted, parodied and removed to a spiritual level. The primary texts will be  read in their original language; in addition to the discussion of the place of  the dawn song in medieval German literature, therefore, this course seeks to  offer participants the opportunity to develop and enhance reading skills in  Middle High German.       SPRING 2014   GERM-GA1219  - The Information  Society: Planetarity (Taught in German)  - Hans-Christian  von Herrmann  \"I  propose the planet to overwrite the globe.\" This statement can be found in  Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak's 2003 book \"Death of a Discipline\", which  brings up the concept of \"planetarity\" as a description of a  post-global, post-national and post-colonial world, interconnected and  differentiated by electronic information systems. But \"planetarity\"  has a history that is older than what is called the information age today and  that leads back to Weimar Germany. So the seminar will follow up the traces of  \"planetarity\" in Walter Benjamin's \"Einbahnstra\u00dfe\" (1928)  and Ernst J\u00fcnger's \"Der Arbeiter\" (1932) afterwards moving on to the  writings of Martin Heidegger, Kostas Axelos and Wilfrid Desan. By doing so the  seminar's objective is to discuss \"planetarity\" as a theoretical  approach emerging from the crisis of modernity and envisioning a post-modern  culture totally shaped by technology.       GERM-GA3610  (COLIT-GA2155; POET-GA2002) - Topics  in Early Modern Written Culture: Literary Matter - The Lucretian Tradition  on European Modernity - Jacques  Lezra   GERM-GA3100  (COLIT-GA2300) - Studies in Prose  Genres: J.M. Coetzee &amp; Metafiction - Mark Sanders       When  J.M. Coetzee received the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2003, he stunned the  Swedish Academy in Stockholm by presenting not the customary lecture, but a  story. In this tale, entitled \u201cHe and His Man,\u201d Robinson Crusoe sends reports  to his \u201cman,\u201d whom Coetzee\u2019s audience recognizes as being Daniel Defoe, since  the reports appear to come from books authored by Defoe. The relationship of  character and author is turned inside out, in an exciting metafictional  performance that also places in question the conventional boundaries of the  lecture. The Swedish audience should not have been stunned, however, for some  of J.M. Coetzee\u2019s most recent novels, Summertime, Slow Man, and Elizabeth  Costello have, in different ways, foregrounded the mechanics of fiction-making  typically concealed by the realist novel. Concentrating on these works, as well  as Coetzee\u2019s early novels, in which metafiction is the dominant mode for  interrogating colonial literary genres, and drawing comparisons with the  fiction of Italo Calvino, Alain Robbe-Grillet, and Zo\u00eb Wicomb, while at the  same time availing ourselves of relevant narrative theory (Mieke Bal, Roland  Barthes) and critical commentary (Attwell, Attridge, Spivak, Wicomb), the  seminar will explore the aesthetic, ethical and political implications of a  writer putting the inner workings of his or her craft on open display. The  seminar will culminate with a roundtable on Coetzee\u2019s enigmatic new novel, The  Childhood of Jesus.  GERM-GA2703 - Poetics &amp; Theory Seminar:  Autofiction: Writing the Self (Taught in German) - Emine Sevgi \u00d6zdamar  &amp; Alys George       Autobiographical  writing has evolved into a highly controversial issue in contemporary literary  theory. Every constituent of the term has become problematic: the \u201cauto\u201d of a  sovereign ego and an undivided persona; the \u201cbios\u201d relating to a culturally  encoded life; the \u201cgraphein\u201d (\u03b3\u03c1\u03b1\u03c6\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd), which registers problems of  mediality. Serge Doubrovsky coined the term \u201cautofiction\u201d in the late  1970s in an attempt to address these vicissitudes of autobiography as a genre.  How  can we distinguish between autobiography and fiction? Can works of literature  be reliable archives of individual and collective memory? Can they be authentic  expressions of our lives at all? We will consider writing that invites and  engages these questions. In addition to Emine Sevgi \u00d6zdamar\u2019s work,  we will read texts by Else Lasker-Sch\u00fcler, Charlotte Salomon, Roland Barthes,  Thomas Bernhard, Herta M\u00fcller, and Thomas Glavinic.       GERM-GA2912  (COLIT-GA2912) -  Literature  &amp; Philosophy: POETS TAKE PHILOSOPHY:  H\u00f6lderlin~Heidegger~Celan~Derrida  - Avital Ronell  The  course will dwell on the poetry of H\u00f6lderlin and Celan with an eye to the  critical works of Heidegger, Adorno, Benjamin, Derrida, Lacoue-Labarthe. There  will be two separate workshops led by Kevin McLaughlin (Brown Univ.) and Werner  Hamacher (Frankfurt) in addition to possible visits by Ulrich Baer and  Richard Sieburth. Expect intense and staggeringly beautiful work to come out of  this.       GERM-GA3000 - Independent Research    FALL  2013     GERM-GA1110  -Theory of Art: Aby Warburg - Christopher  Wood        Aby  Warburg (1866-1929) was an art historian who worked outside the academic  establishment, building a prodigious private library and research center that  mapped a new field of study: the persistence of the ancient pagan world  into modernity, conceived as an ongoing psychic event. Exposed to what he  experienced as a relentless barrage of expressive images of passion\u2014\u201cpathos  formulas\u201d\u2014mediating archaic trauma, Warburg sought but could not find relief in  the promise of aesthetic sublimation. The seminar will pose one central  question which bears on the larger problems of communication (between subjects,  between past and present) under the conditions of modernity: is Warburg\u2019s  pathos formula best understood as an image, a symbol, a symptom, a metaphor, a  talisman, an avatar, a memory, or a packet of psychic energy?  His  person, his library (which was transported from Hamburg to London in 1933 and  survives intact), and his gnomic writings serve as a crossroads where many  paths of thought meet, throughout the twentieth century and into our  own. The seminar will relocate Warburg among the thinkers who  shaped him, including Darwin, Nietzsche, Burckhardt, and Usener; relate him to  the art history of his day as practiced by Schlosser, Riegl, W\u00f6lfflin,  Schmarsow, and Panofsky; coordinate his thought with the biological sciences,  early anthropology, the study of archaic ritual and religion, the spheres of  modern ornament, design, and dance, the emergence of the technological media  including cinema, and the Husserlian \u201ccrisis of the sciences\u201d; and finally  consider his reception by Cassirer, Benjamin, Gombrich, Ginzburg, Agamben, and  Didi-Huberman. Reading of knowledge of German required.        GERM-GA1700  - Romanticism: Drives of Romanticism, 1900/1800 - Elisabeth Bronfen &amp; Leif  Weatherby  (1)  To participate in the celebration of the Wagner year, the first part of the  seminar will look at unconventional traces of both his libretti and scores in  Classic Hollywood. At issue, as we look at Tristan and Isolde, Tannh\u00e4user and  Holl\u00e4nder, is both the obsession with the psychological struggle between law  and desire as well as the redemption death is claimed to afford. What also  drives this crossmapping, however, is the wager that in the 20th century cinema  appropriates but also signficiantly refigures Wagner's Gesamtkunstwerk  project  (2)  From here, the course will go back to the future, focusing on German  Romanticism and its re-readings in philosophy of technology in the 20th and  21st centuries. Here we will read Hoffmann with Kittler, H\u00f6lderlin with  Heidegger, Novalis with Blumenberg, and others. The complementary  wager of the second part of the course is that the pretense of  Romantic art--post-revolutionary, \"post\"-Enlightenment--has a great  deal to do with the end of the so-called \"techne-physis analogy.\" If  \"technology\" was freed from its metaphysical moorings in the long  18th century, then how does it anticipate later Romantic aesthetics, and what  might it have to say about our contemporary situation?  GERM-GA1842  - Nietzsche\u2019s Impact on 20th Century Thought - Friedrich Ulfers  The  objective of the seminar is to show how Nietzsche revolutionized Western  philosophy by transforming its dualistic-metaphysical worldview into a holistic  one that corresponds to the reality of the world as one interrelated,  processual whole. It will also show how this transformation influenced  significantly what is known as \u201cContinental Philosophy,\u201d which includes such  figures as Heidegger, Derrida, and Deleuze.  Particular  attention will be paid to the meaning of Nietzsche\u2019s pronouncement that \u201cGod is  dead\u201d; his declaration that the world is \u201cWill to Power \u201d and an \u201caesthetic  phenomenon\u201d; and his idea of \u201cEternal Recurrence.\u201d Also discussed will be the  role language plays in Nietzsche\u2019s view on epistemology and ontology, his  revaluation of morality, and his influence on the arts.       GERM-GA2610 - Special Topics in Theory: What\u2019s  Happening? EVENT in Philosophy, Literature, Psychoanalysis - Avital Ronell  A  sequel to last year\u2019s seminar on Derrida, et. al. and the Event, we will  explore motifs such as love and catastrophe in exemplary literary and  philosophical texts. Students are urged to have read thoroughly at  least one book by the instructor in preparation for outstanding discussions.       GERM-GA3000 - Independent Research - Avital  Ronell   SPRING  2013  GERM-GA1116  - Origins of Critical Thought II:Renaissance and Modernity  (Seminar and Texts in German) - Eckart Goebel  This  seminar examines modern texts dealing with the legacy of the European  Renaissance. We will read works by Walter Pater, Jacob Burckhardt, Ernst  Kantorowicz, Erwin Panofsky, and Hans Blumenberg.Participation in this class  does not require previous attendance of the fall 2012 seminar on Renaissance  &amp; Reformation. In preparation, it might be useful, however, to study some  of the texts, with which the authors mentioned above are dealing, such as  Shakespeare\u2019s King Richard the Second .  GERM-GA1219  - The Information Society: By Chance \u2013 Literature and Mathematics - Hans-Christian von Herrmann       In  E.A. Poe's 1844 short story \"The purloined letter\" private  investigator Auguste Dupin is able to close the case because he is gifted with  a certain talent which is in fact an amalgam of a poetic and a mathematical  attitude towards the world. The seminar's ambition is to decipher this  mysterious mindset by consulting Jacques Lacan's famous reading of Poe's text  including its detour in the fields of information theory and cybernetics. In a  second step the seminar will pass on to other literary texts by Heinrich von  Kleist, Jorge Luis Borges and Hans Magnus Enzensberger in order to follow up  the traces of the modern interplay of literature and mathematics.  GERM-GA1698  - Photography and the World: Theories of Photography from the Medium\u2019s  Inception to the Present -   Ulrich Baer        We  live in an illustrated world, and photographs often determine political,  personal, and even the most private of decisions. Who is guilty and who is  exonerated; who gets elected and who loses the vote; who and what we favor or  despise, will get to know, desire, remember or forget depends on how someone or  something has been presented in a photograph. Today more images are produced  daily than in the entire history of photography from 1839 until the mass  production of digital cameras. There is great danger in this development and  immense potential to free ourselves from existing constraints, too. The skills  required to interpret photographs is related to our capacity of gauging the  role of images in our imagination. It behooves us to know how to turn the  current plethora of pictures into tools with which to shape the world we share  with others.  This  interdisciplinary seminar explores how photographic images create meaning, and  how thinkers have responded to photography \u2013 as a phenomenon to be reckoned  with lest it overwhelms our critical faculties. How do we make sense of the  ways in which photographs shape our experience of being in the world \u2013 and how  do we shape our own lives amidst this flood of images? What does the world  mean, in a photograph, and how do we distinguish this meaning from the world  outside of photography? What is the relation between meaning, photography, and  a worldview? Is it possible to experience someone\u2019s else\u2019s world through  photographs? What is the relation between worlds and worldviews, and what role  do images play in this relationship?       We  will read theoretical and other texts on visuality and photography (Baudelaire,  Kracauer, Panofsky, Benjamin, Barthes, Sontag, Batchen, Derrida, Flusser,  Cadava, Ranci\u00e8re, Enwezor, and others), and look at a wide range of photographs  from the inception of the medium to the present to test theories of photography  against the medium\u2019s uncanny and unrivaled power to evoke the real.  GERM-GA2703 - Poetics and Theory Seminar: Short  Fiction ( Seminar and Texts in German) - Katja Lange-M\u00fcller &amp;  Alys George  This  comparative seminar traces the \u201cmigration\u201d of short fiction between Germany and  America. It also focuses on how literary markets and the economy of production  have shaped the economy of form. From its beginnings in the European novella (Boccaccio)  and the German literary Kalendergeschichte (Hebel, Kleist), short fiction made  its way to America and was transformed with the flourishing of the short story  in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The conventions of the American  short story then took hold in Germany, where they have influenced postwar  literature to the present. We look, finally, at flash fiction/microfiction and  toward the future of short(est) fiction. Our focus is on close textual  analysis, and authors will be paired, e.g.: Twain and Hebel; Poe and Kafka;  Hemingway and Rothmann; Melville and Kleist; McCullers and Hermann; Carver and  Schulze. We also consider classification debates in theoretical essays by  Schlegel, James, O\u2019Connor, Lange-M\u00fcller, and Oates.  After  the spring recess acclaimed writer and Bachmann-Preis-winner Katja Lange-M\u00fcller  will co-teach the seminar and will discuss role of short fiction in the German  and American literary traditions, as well as her own work in the form. Non-NYU  students who wish to audit the second portion of the course only are welcome.    FALL  2012  GERM-GA.1004  - Image and Text: Psychic Visuality \u2013 E.T.A. Hoffmann and Hitchcock - Elizabeth Bronfen  Hitchcock,  who was on the set in Babelsberg Studios (Berlin) in 1924 when Murnau filmed The  Last Man , brought the demonic screen expressionist film had perfected in  Weimar Germany to Hollywood in 1940, and with it a legacy of the German  romantic Nachtst\u00fcck . This block seminar will cross map three films from  his mature period \u2013 Vertigo , Rear Window and Psycho \u2013 onto  novellas by E.T.A. Hoffmann, in an attempt to reconstruct this line of  association. At issue is the manner in which both the Gothic novella and the  Hollywood thriller engage a visualization of psychic disorders. A second point  of connection is that both artists are great technicians who offer  self-reflexive commentaries on their respective medium. Finally, as masters of  aesthetic artifice, both pit intense emotions against textual play, with  Hoffmann's romantic irony reflected and refracted in Hitchcock's dark humor.   GERM-GA.1115  - Origins of German Critical Thought I: Renaissance &amp; Reformation I - Eckart Goebel    This  course offers an introduction to key texts from the 15th and 16th  centuries. Since each of the complex works we read provides so many insights  that one could organize an entire class around any one of them, the goal is  merely to make first contact with the world of Renaissance and Reformation. The  research interest I pursue with this class is the \u2018history of the soul\u2019 in  early modernity as well as the history of melancholia. The reading load is  admittedly high, and it might be even useful to have, in addition, a closer  look at some seminal works from Greek and Roman antiquity over the summer, such  as Plato\u2019s Symposium , Aristoteles\u2019 De Anima , Cicero\u2019s De  Officiis , his Tusculanae Disputationes , and St. Augustine\u2019s Confessiones .  We will read all texts in English translations.  I  intend to continue this class in spring with a seminar on the reception of  Renaissance &amp; Reformation in modernity from Goethe, Burckhardt, and  Nietzsche to Cassirer, Panofsky, and Kantorowicz.

We will explore political works,  psychoanalysis, music, and film. Expect sparks.  GERM-  GA.3000 - Independent Research        GERM-GA.1512  - Kafka - Friedrich Ulfers  The  course will deal with Kafka\u2019s work largely in the light of the author\u2019s  preoccupation with language, particularly with the way this preoccupation  affected his writing, indeed provided the topic of it.       The  point of departure will be the experience of \u201clanguage crisis\u201d among  intellectuals and writers in turn of the century Austria, which led to the  radical criticism of conceptual or referential language\u2013 already foreshadowed  by Nietzsche \u2013 of Fritz Mauthner and Ludwig Wittgenstein, among others.  The  course will then show Kafka\u2019s response to this crisis: his insight that  conceptual/referential language and oppositional/binary involves an abstraction  of the \u201ctruth\u201d or the \u201creal,\u201d which is only apprehensible in a space of radical  undecidability between opposites, demanding a language of irreducible  allusiveness, a language that is constitutive of Kafka\u2019s texts.       In  the context of this undecidability and allusivesness, which Kafka attributes to  his \u201cdreamlike inner life\u201d that he claims informs his writing, his becoming  \u201cliterature,\u201d Freud\u2019s The Interpretation of Dreams will be used as a  reference. In this work Freud asserts that many psychological \u201cprocesses which  are described as irrational are not in fact falsification of normal  processes\u2014intellectual errors\u2014but are modes of activity of the psychical  apparatus that have been freed from an inhibition\u201d (Freud 644), and that in  dream thinking, \u201cEach train of thought is almost invariably accompanied by its  contradictory counterpart, linked with it by antithetical association\u201d (Freud  346). It will be shown that Kafka\u2019s texts are suffused with this kind of  thinking, a thinking that allows opposites to coexist as a both/and that never  achieves resolution. As Freud puts it: \u201cBoth of the alternatives [of a logical  opposition] are usually inserted in the text of the dream as though they were  equally valid\u201d (Freud 351).  Another  context in which Kafka\u2019s writing will be read in this seminar is that of  contemporary Continental Philosophy, especially the texts of Deleuze and  Derrida that have interpreted Kafka\u2019s writing in terms of the alterity of a  \u201cminor literature\u201d and the putting in question of judgment and the law,  respectively.       The  seminar will then deal with Kafka\u2019s insight into the inherent violence involved  in any conceptual understanding, in relation to which literature, that is,  poetic or radically metaphorical language functions as a countermeasure in that  it has the capacity of \u201cun-judging\u201d the real, leaving us with texts that  constitute an embrace of infinite relationality and the concomitant  undecidability.  Finally,  we will look at Kafka\u2019s writing in terms of the possibility of embodying an  inherent ethical aspect insofar as it constitutes freedom from truth as  the tyranny of univocity and teleology towards the truth of an  a-topical, endlessly de-territorializing and metamorphosing world. As such,  this truth is always already other in relation with itself, and thus ethical in  its irreducible self-less-ness, its inherent openness to, and interrelatedness  with, the other. It would be the ethical structure of the \u201cgiven\u201d - not the  anthropomorphically instrumentalized world - in which its interpenetrating  parts exist \u201cpoetically,\u201d as metamorphic units that constitute an \u201cethics of  alterity,\u201d that is, an irreducible responsiveness and responsibility to the  other as other.   SPRING 2012  GERM-GA.1698 \u2013 Photography and the  World - Ulrich Baer          GERM-GA.1720 \u2013 Echoes of Antiquity:  Translatio Romae - Barbara Vinken  Marx remarked in his 18 brumaire of  Napol\u00e9on Bonaparte , History comes always back twice: first as tragedy, than  as farce. Roughly up to the beginning of the 20th century Europe and the United  States told and thought their History in terms of antique History that was a  basso continuo to all political conflicts and imperial enterprises. Our focus  will not be on Greek, but on Roman History. In the United States, as well as in  France, Germany and Italy, political realities were spelled out in Roman terms.  If most people agreed that History is nothing but a repetion of Roman History,  it is very much a question if this is a blessing or a curse. And what Roman  History comes back? Is the Roman Republic restored, are the civil wars coming  back, or are people to live in an Empire sine fine? It is in literary texts  that these questions are most subtly asked and answered. The most interesting  and influential texts like Schiller, Kleist, Leopardi, Hugo, Baudelaire,  Flaubert, and James will be submitted to a close reading in order to disclose  their hidden Roman intertexts.       GERM-GA.2703 \u2013 Poetics and Theory  Seminar: Literature &amp; Film (Taught in English) - Daniel Kehlmann and Eckart Goebel  The seminar investigates the  transformations literary texts undergo when they are turned into feature films.  The seminar also addresses the consequences the invention of film had for  writing: Is the potential of \u2018filmability\u2019 always inscribed in literature, and  if so, what exactly does \u2018filmability\u2019 mean?       The trajectory of this class leads us  from classics such as Schloendorff\u2019s acclaimed adaptation of Musil\u2019s early  novel The Confusions of Young Toerless to the new movie based on Oscar  Wilde\u2019s notorious novel The Picture of Dorian Gray of 2009. After the  spring recess acclaimed author Daniel Kehlmann will co-teach the seminar, and  will discuss with us not only No Country for Old Men and Radetzky March   but also his own novels Fame and Measuring the World ,  currently produced as films. Daniel Kehlmann will discuss his film scripts with  us, which will provide us with new insights into the relation of film and  literature.  Students from outside NYU, who prefer  to audit the second part of this seminar only, are welcome to do so.          GERM-GA.1513 \u2013 Bertolt Brecht - Robert Cohen  Brecht's oeuvre can be read as a  radical critique of philosophical, theoretical, political, economic, and  aesthetic discourses from Aristotle to Marx, Luk\u00e1cs, and Benjamin. It is a work  forever in progress, a collection of unstable and endlessly revised texts  exploring the human condition in a time of class struggle, violence, and war.       The Seminar is conceived as a general  introduction to Brecht's work. Topics include the experience of the modern  metropolis; the disintegration of social and sexual relations; the destruction  of identity and the construction of a 'collective individuality;' Brecht's  Marxism and his contribution to a new dialectics; Brecht and the Weimar  avant-garde.  Discussions based on close readings of  poetry, plays, prose, and theoretical writings will focus on the way meaning is  produced through Brecht's performative and gestural (\"Gestus\") use of  language; as well as through his use of modernist literary techniques such as  montage, fragmentation, and distanciation/alienation (\"Verfremdung\").       GERM-GA.3000  \u2013 Independent Research    FALL 2011  GERM-GA.1410 - Goethe: Eros and  Thanatos: Goethe\u2019s Psychology - Eckart  Goebel  Aus schwer erfindlichen Gr\u00fcnden gilt  Goethe zuweilen als \u201anaiv\u2018.       Das Seminar studiert, in Abwandlung  eines Titels von Max Kommerell \u00fcber - Schiller, \u201aGoethe als Psychologe\u2018.  Gelesen werden bekannte Texte des Dichters im Hinblick auf das in ihnen  \u00fcberreich ausgebreitete Wissen um die Seele des Menschen.  For not really convincing reasons  Goethe is regarded here and there as being \u2018naive.\u2018 In reaction to this cliche  this seminar studies, \u2018Goethe as psychologist.\u2018 We will re-read famous texts in  order to learn about Goethe\u2019s abysmal knowledge concerning the human soul, and  its vissicitudes.       GERM-GA.1650: Visual Culture:  Configurations of the Night   - Elisabeth Bronfen  Night is a double of the day, a comment  on diurnal activities, a counter site to the ordinary. It prompts a thinking  closer to imagination than reason. While philosophy's theoria is based  on the promise of bringing illumination, and as such is of and for   the day, literature and visual arts engage a nocturnal side of knowledge. This  course will cross map theory's tropic use of night onto aesthetic enactments of  the night as a stage and state of mind. Looking at the way both sustain the  antagonism between days' reason and night's magical thinking we will read  Mozart's Magic Flute with Foucault's \"piece of night each carries  within,\"; Shakespeare's Midsummer Night's Dream with Freud's  \"navel of the dream\"; Schnitzler's \"Dream Novella\" with  Hegel's \"night of the world\"; Scorsese's Taxi Driver with  Blanchot's \"autre nuit\".

It will also show how this  transformation influenced significantly what is known as \"Continental  Philosophy,\" which includes such figures as Heidegger, Derrida, and  Deleuze.  Particular attention will be paid to  the meaning of Nietzsche\u2019s pronouncement that \"God is dead,\" his  declaration that the world is \"Will to Power\" and an \"aesthetic  phenomenon,\" and his idea of \"Eternal Recurrence.\" Also  discussed will be the role language plays in Nietzsche\u2019s view on epistemology  and ontology, his revaluation of morality and his influence on the arts.

Halfway through the semester, we will start a close reading of Th. W.  Adorno\u2019s Negative Dialektik from 1966, focusing mainly on Adorno\u2019s  Heidegger-critique. The course is intended to provide students with strong  theoretical interests, a detailed knowledge of two seminal texts of 20th  century thought. Finally, we might also consult Max Horkheimer\u2019s Eclipse of  Reason , however, that will be determined at a later date.  G51.2703: Poetics &amp;  Theory Seminar: Writing Animals -  Marcel Beyer  This seminar examines \"writing  animals\" in a dual sense: both animals that write and the writing on  animals. At stake is the animal as a figure of imagination, of the work of  imagination in the creative process.        G51.1945: Post-World War II  Mordernism: Max Frisch and Peter Weiss - Robert Cohen  Max Frisch and Peter Weiss were key  figures in the reconstitution of (West-) German post-World War II litera\u00adture,  though \u2013 or maybe because \u2013 neither was German. Their works are both  paradigmatic of, and different from, the literature of their German  contemporaries (Andersch, B\u00f6ll, Koeppen, Walser) that emerged out of the  collapse of Germany. From vantage points located at the periphery of German  culture (Switzerland in the case of Frisch, Sweden for Peter Weiss) the two  authors functioned as seismographs reacting to post-war reality. Their use of  innovative and avant-gardist forms in drama and prose reflects the problematic  recovering of the recent past and decoding of a complex present.       After prose works exploring the  immediate post-war trauma and reconstituting the (literary) subject, both  Frisch and Weiss turned to drama with works focusing on anti-Semitism and  Auschwitz. These plays will be read against theoretical writings by Sartre and  Adorno.  Frisch and Weiss's evolution from  modernist to late-modernist/post-modernist writing will be traced through their  late works which dissolve narrative certainty and signal a new kind of text  with unstable meanings and uncertain chronologies. In order to situate these  works in the aesthetic and literary context of the postwar period, two sessions  will be devoted to theories of modernism, the avant-garde, and postmodernism.  Beyond \u2013 and before \u2013 all the topical  issues these works evoke, however, they need to be understood as literature. Discussions  will be based on close readings of the texts, on their narrative and dramatic  structures, and on the way meaning is produced in literary texts.  G51.3000: Independent Research  FALL 2010  G51.1111 \u2013 EXEMPLARY TEXTS: Traces of  Modernity (Benjamin, Bloch, Kracauer, Adorno) - Paul Fleming  This course investigates four seminal  texts written on and about the margins of modernity: Kracauer\u2019s Mass Ornament,  Bloch\u2019s Traces, Benjamin\u2019s One-Way Street, and Adorno\u2019s Minima Moralia. At  stake in each of these works is a protocol of reading that takes the seemingly  insignificant \u2013 surface structures, minor details, popular sayings, fragmented  memories \u2013 as the entrance to the deeper structures that define modern society  and thought.       G51.2610 - Special Topics in  Theory: How to read -   Avital Ronell  Beginning with Heidegger's important  text, _What is Called Thinking?_ the class will explore exemplary texts that  turn against themselves as they face down ruling cognitive regimens. If you  have understood the first sentence of this course description, you do not need  to take the class. Otherwise, be prepared to train rhetorically, and with  critical finesse, in order to confront some genuinely demanding textual events  of the canon. Students can expect to get close to major axioms and theoretical  concerns of selected texts by Barbara Johnson, Paul de Man and Derrida while  also confronting technological installations, paranoid utterance, political  reactivity, historical registers of anxiety and traumatic forgetting. Nearly  every work under consideration engages literature in essential ways, so  theoryheads must be prepared to read and submit to poetic language.       Smart undergraduates are also welcome,  but should obtain permission from the professor.  G51.1550 \u2013 German Poetry: German  Symbolism - Eckart  Goebel       This graduate seminar will follow the  contours of an art at the limits of (traditional) art by means of closely  reading George, Hofmannsthal, and Rilke. The poetry of German symbolism \u2013 and  this is the hypothesis to be discussed in class \u2013 is understood less as last  feverish shivers of Romanticism but rather as modern literature on the  threshold. German symbolism \u2013 the art of crisis emerging from the crisis of art  \u2013 points towards the Avant-garde movements of the 20th century on the one hand,  and towards charismatic leadership as the modern myth on the other.  The reading of lyrical poetry and  lyrical drama will be prepared by a careful study of the black bible of  aestheticism and pessimism: Arthur Schopenhauer\u2019s The World as Will and  Representation. Schopenhauer\u2019s influence on European writers from Flaubert to  Kafka, Beckett, and Bernhard can hardly be overrated. Reading his book, ending  with the word \u201cnichts,\u201d may also serve as an introduction to the concept of  \u201cnihilism,\u201d haunting an art on the verge of silence.       G51.1600 \u2013 Theory Clashes: The  Persistence of the Theologico \u2013 Political   - Avital Ronell, Slavoj Zizek, and Fran\u00e7ois Noudelman  The question of political theology has  become an increasingly important concern for students of literary and political  theory, religious studies, and philosophy. Starting off the course, Professor  Ronell will be hosting and engaging world renowned philosophers Slavoj Zizek  and Fran\u00e7ois Noudelmann on crucial aspects of political theology ranging from  the works of Jean-Luc Nancy on the deconstruction of Christianity to Derrida on  religion (Ronell) and the concept of the absent Third in Sartre, Ranci\u00e8re, and  Negri (Noudelmann).  G51.2250 - Post 1945 Germany: Polemics,  Provocation, Pop - Elke  Siegel  G51.1512 \u2013 Kafka - Friedrich Ulfers  The course will deal with Kafka\u2019s work  largely in the light of the author\u2019s preoccupation with language particularly  with the way this preoccupation affected his writing, indeed provided the theme  of it. The point of departure will be the experience of \u201clanguage crisis\u201d among  intellectuals and writers in turn of the century Austria, which led to the  radical language criticism \u2013 already foreshadowed by Nietzsche \u2013 of Fritz  Mauthner and Ludwig Wittgenstein among others. An interpretation of Kafka\u2019s  work aims to show not only the influences of this thinking on his writing, but  also how Kafka radicalized it so as to make it \u201cKafkaesque.\u201d Another aspect of  the course will be to examine Kafka as anticipating a line of writing and  thinking that could be described as deconstructive. In this context,  undecidability, the breakdown of referential language and irreducible  allusiveness will be shown as constitutive of Kafka\u2019s texts. This will  also be the context to discuss the problematization of the real, of judgment,  of justice, and the law that suffuses Kafka\u2019s writing.  SPRING 2010  G51.3399: Comparative Poetics:  Lyric Poetry - Prof. Ulrich Baer  This course is taught in English and  originates in the Comparative Literature Department.  A seminar that examines different  approaches to lyric poetry as a genre, a sensibility, a mood (Stimmung).  Particular emphasis will be placed on the modern lyric from formalist,  historicist, rhetorical/deconstructive, hermeneutic, cultural-sociological  (materialist), literary historical, philosophical perspectives. We will examine  how lyric poetry teaches us about these approaches and the relationship between  them, and to what extent poems contains their own ars poetica (\u201cthe art of  poetry\u201d)\u2013 or how reading poetry can teach us how to read in general. We will focus on a selection of poems  by the following authors: Sappho, Pindar, Du Fu, Li Po; William Wordsworth,  Percy Bysshe Shelley, John Keats, Robert Browning; Emily Dickinson, Walt  Whitman, Wallace Stevens, Elizabeth Bishop, Anne Carson; Friedrich H\u00f6lderlin,  Rainer Maria Rilke; Charles Baudelaire, St\u00e9phane Mallarm\u00e9, Paul Celan; Yehuda  Amichai, Octavio Paz.  The seminar will instruct students in  basic and advanced skills of interpreting lyric poetry, and in recognizing the  differences between periods, forms, and poets. It is also intended as a  reflection on the field of comparative literature by reading comparatively a  range of poets from distinct backgrounds and traditions. We will also compare existing  methodologies in the interpretation of literary works.  G51.1863: Psychoanlysis &amp;  Philosophy: Genealogies of Psychoanalysis -   Prof. Larry Rickels      Psychoanalysis, as institution of  higher yearning, is open to the address of the Superhuman, the Psycho, and the  Android. The following movies will be referred to  during class discussions: Batman Forever, Batman Returns, Dr. No, From  Russia with Love, Octopussy, Psycho, Halloween, Nightmare on Elm Street, Blade  Runner, Total Recall, and Minority Report .    G51.2912: Literature &amp;  Philosophy: Decadence -  Prof. Eckart Goebel       In his diaries young Robert Musil  portrays himself as \u201cMonsieur le vivisecteur,\u201d and thus provides this graduate  course on \u201cd\u00e9cadence\u201d with a certain perspective on a European movement. We  will read some famous texts from the 19th century from Pater to Wilde focusing  on their insights into the less boring aspects of the conditio humana, psychological,  physiological, sexual, and artistic subtleties: \u201cBeing natural is simply a  pose, and the most irritating pose I know\u201d (Wilde). The second part of the  class will discuss seminal works from the 20th century which were, for example  by Georg Luk\u00e1cs, banned as documents of \u201cbourgeois decadence,\u201d such as the  works of Kafka, and even Beckett. \u201cI think he is a little deranged,\u201d the  narrator says about Bartleby who prefers not to function in Downtown Manhattan.  The seminar intends to discuss the critical potential of those who are a little  deranged, dysfunctional, d\u00e9goutant, or decadent.  G51.1513: Brecht - Prof. Robert Cohen  Dialogical and intertextual to the  core, Brecht's oeuvre can be seen as an open-ended critical conversation with  philosophical, theoretical, political, economic, and aesthetic discourses from  Aristotle to Marx, Luk\u00e1cs, and Benjamin, as well as with readers and  theatergoers, with collaborators, colleagues and lovers. The result of these  conversations is a work in progress, a collection of unstable and endlessly revised  texts exploring the human experience in a time of class struggle, violence, and  war.  The course is conceived as a general  introduction to Brecht's work. Topics include the experience of the modern  metropolis; the disintegration of social and sexual relations; the destruction  of identity and the construction of a 'collective individuality;' Brecht's  Marxism and his contribution to a new dialectics; Brecht's formal innovations  in drama and poetry, and his theater theories.  Before any of the controversies which  Brecht's work evokes, it needs to be understood as literature. Discussions in  class will be based on close readings of the texts \u2013 poetry, plays, and  theoretical writings \u2013 and on the way meaning is produced through Brecht's  performative use of language (\" Gestus \"), as well as through  his use of modern\u00ad\u00adist literary techniques such as montage, frag\u00admen\u00adtation,  repetition, and distanciation/alienation (\"Verfremdung\").  FALL 2009  G51.1716 - Autobiographical Writing:  The Day in Writing (Diaries)   - Prof. Elke Siegel Das Tagebuch \u2013 in seiner modernen  Erscheinung seit dem 18. Jahrhundert als \u2018pers\u00f6nliches Tagebuch\u2019 \u2013 bereitet der  Literaturwissenschaft Schwierigkeiten, die ins Herz ihrer g\u00e4ngigen  Begrifflichkeiten \u2013 etwa Autorschaft und Gattung \u2013 treffen. Wie \u2013 dies eine  Fragen im Zentrum der Arbeit in diesem Seminar \u2013 ist ein solches  fragmentarisches Schreiben zu lesen, begreift man das Tagebuch nicht vorrangig  als Steinbruch f\u00fcr Informationen zu Biographie und Werkgeschichte oder als  historisches Dokument? Die Spannung von Ich und Welt, Alltag und Geschichte,  Subjektivit\u00e4t und Objektivit\u00e4t, \u00d6ffentlichkeit und Privatheit, Fiktion und  Dokumentarismus \u00f6ffnet und verhandelt jedes einzelne Tagebuch neu. Damit  widersteht dieses Schreiben am Rande der Form verallgemeinernden Bestimmungen.  Im Seminar werden wir uns mit ausgew\u00e4hlten Tageb\u00fcchern der deutschsprachigen  Literatur vom 18. bis zum 20. Jahrhundert besch\u00e4ftigen und dabei auch  beobachten, wie TagebuchautorInnen sich auf die Tageb\u00fccher anderer beziehen und  damit literarische Traditionslinien er\u00f6ffnen und/oder verweigern. Wir werden \u2013  in G\u00e4nze oder Ausz\u00fcgen \u2013 die Tageb\u00fccher u.a. folgender Autoren und Autorinnen  lesen: Lavater, Goethe, Hebbel, Grillparzer, Kafka, Doderer, J\u00fcnger, Frisch,  Frank, Wolf, Goetz, Gr\u00fcnbein, dies vor dem Hintergrund theoretischer  Interventionen von, z.B., Barthes, Genette und Blanchot. Besondere  Aufmerksamkeit wird dabei dem Problem des Autobiographischen (Philippe Lejeune)  gelten, sowie der Frage nach dem Verh\u00e4ltnis von Alltag und Schreiben.  Welche Rolle \u2013 dies eine der m\u00f6glichen  weiteren Fragen, die im Seminar zur Diskussion stehen werden \u2013 kommt dem  Tagebuch in der Geschichte des Subjekts zu? Welche Bedeutung erh\u00e4lt dabei der  Akt der Relekt\u00fcre des eigenen Tagebuchs? Registriert das Tagebuch den Tag oder  versucht es, ein Leben, einen Lebensplan zu projizieren? Und wie ist es um die  Literarizit\u00e4t des Tagebuchs bestellt? Handelt es sich bei dem im Datum  verankerten Schreiben gar um eine sch\u00fctzende Geste vor den Gefahren des  Schreibens und der Zeit, die das Subjekt zu zerschlagen drohen?    G51.2700 - TPCS: Representations of  Death - Prof.  Elisabeth Bronfen  The act of dying is something one can  expect or something one can witness. Yet it defies all unmediated articulation.  Representations of death, in turn, can be horrifying, fascinating or morally  elevating. In all cases, however, death has been translated into an image or a  story, and as such contained. The mortality we experience is not our own; the  medium we engage with is not the materiality of the mortal body but the  mediality of aesthetic signs. Death is the limit of representation but also one  of its most seminal sources of inspiration. The seminar will engage this  complex interface between death and represenation by looking at fictions  (Goethe's Elective Affinities, Poe's Tales and Sketches), Hitchcock's late  trilogy (Rear Window, Vertigo, Psycho), Freud's speculations on death, as well  as recycling of death photography (Andy Warhol, Jeff Wall).       G51.1112 - Problems in Critical Theory:  Metaphors, Examples, Anecdotes   - Prof. Paul Fleming  The course will explore the role of  para-theoretical (e.g., poetic, rhetorical, and narrative) elements within  philosophy and critical theory. In particular, it will examine the status of  the literary-rhetorical elements as at once illuminating and obscuring thought,  whereby the didactic function of metaphors, examples, and anecdotes lies in  compelling the reader to continually return to and hermeneutically re-examine  the material. The central focus will be on metaphors, examples, and anecdotes  in Western thought from Plato and the Bible to Classical rhetoric (Horace and  Quinitilian) to contemporary theory (DeMan, Derrida, Benjamin, and Blumenberg).  G51.2912 - Literature &amp; Philosophy:  Hegel, Freud, &amp; Literature   - Prof. Avital Ronell &amp; Prof. Slavoj Zizek  G51.1824 - Nietzsche's Impact on 20th  Century Thought - Prof.  Friedrich Ulfers  The objective of the seminar is to show  how Nietzsche revolutionized Western philosophy by transforming its dualistic-metaphysical  worldview into a holistic one that corresponds to the reality of the world as  one interrelated, processual whole. It will also show how this transformation  influenced significantly what is known as \u201cContinental Philosophy,\u201d which  includes such figures as Heidegger, Derrida, and Deleuze. Particular attention  will be paid to the meaning of Nietzsche\u2019s pronouncement that \u201cGod is dead\u201d;  his declaration that the world is \u201cWill to Power \u201d and an \u201caesthetic  phenomenon\u201d; and his idea of \u201cEternal Recurrence.\u201d Also discussed will be the  role language plays in Nietzsche\u2019s view on epistemology and ontology, his  revaluation of morality, and his influence on the arts.  G51.3000 - Independent Research   SPRING 2009   G51.2912 \u2013 Literature &amp; Philosophy:  Theories of Time - Prof. Paul North  In this class we will read texts that  consciously try to regain time as a concept, category, or intuition after the  European enlightenment. Following a singular development, starting from a  theorization of the transcendental subject of experience by means of time in  Kant, we will move toward the pointed dismantling of this configuration in  Heidegger, interestingly enough, also by means of time. Bookending the  course\u2014but not merely that\u2014the first and last volumes of Proust\u2019s In Search of  Lost Time will help explain the urgency that seems to characterize the gesture  toward time in what has been called \u201cmodernity.\u201d  G51.1720 \u2013 Echoes of Antiquity: Germany  and the Gre eks - Prof. John  Hamilton  This seminar investigates the rise and  development of German Philhellenism from Winckelmann to Heidegger. Topics  include antiquarianism and national identity; originality, genius, and  tradition; pedagogy and revolution; the formation of the lyrical subject;  representations of the classical body; Dionysus and theories of tragedy;  philology, classical scholarship, and institutional history .  G51.1919 \u2013 Literature of the Weimer  Period: Philosophical Anthropology   - Prof. Eckart Goebel       The course provides a careful close  reading of key texts on philosophical anthropology. We will start with Kant\u2019s  highly influential Anthropologie in pragmatischer Hinsicht, followed by a  reconstruction of Nietzsche\u2019s theory of civilization developed in his  Morgenr\u00f6te, focusing mainly on book 1. The second part of the seminar is meant  to discuss Arnold Gehlen\u2019s notorious book on Der Mensch (including an analysis  of the famous radio debate between Gehlen, and Adorno, provided in copy), as  well as a discussion of Martin Heidegger\u2019s critique of philosophical anthropology,  formulated in his book on Kant und das Problem der Metaphysik (including, as an  appendix, the seminal debate between Cassirer and Heidegger in Davos). The  seminar will provide background information on further reading, such as Helmuth  Plessner, Max Scheler, and Michel Foucault. Books: Immanuel Kant, Schriften zur  Anthropologie, Werkausgabe Bd. XII (Suhrkamp Taschenbuch) Friedrich Nietzsche,  Morgenr\u00f6the, Kritische Studienausgabe (dtv-Taschenbuch) Arnold Gehlen, Der  Mensch, Aula paperback Ausgabe Helmuth Plessner, Die Stufen des Organischen und  der Mensch, de Gruyter paperback  G51.1994 \u2013 Realism: Problems in 19th  Century Prose - Prof. Paul Fleming         This seminar is a systematic  introduction to the problems of representation in 19th-century prose, particularly  with respect to notions of the everyday, the ordinary, and the average. The  course explores to what extent language can produce a \u2018reality effect,\u2019 and  whether the quotidian, by means of such detailed description, necessarily leaps  into the realm of the exemplary. Authors include Tieck, Grillparzer, Keller,  Stifter, and Fontane.  G29.2640 - Romanticism &amp; Revolution - Prof. Richard Sieburth       The course will explore various  literary and philosophical reactions to the French Revolution during the late 18th  and early 19th centuries in Germany, England, and France.  FALL 2008  Goethe: The Art of Dilettantism - Paul Fleming  This seminar examines Goethe\u2019s  literature and thought through the prism of dilettantism, the art of doing  things in a non-professional manner. Dilettantism for Goethe is a modern  phenomenon, concomitant with the rise of the bourgeois subject, and is thus  inextricable from questions surrounding art, education, and knowledge since the  18th century. In addition to Goethe\u2019s poetry, prose, and drama, we will also  examine his aesthetic, scientific, and autobiographical writings. A further  focal point will be the reception of Goethe and the question of tradition.   Object Relations: Melanie Klein - Laurence Rickels (Visiting Professor)  The seminar will focus on the work of  Melanie Klein, its point of departure in Karl Abraham\u2019s reflections on  melancholia and its running commentary on (and continuity with) Freud\u2019s \u201csecond  system.\u201d The delegation of Klein\u2019s thought proceeds via a series of controversies:  Klein\u2019s followers were largely guided and contextualized via the contest with  the \u201cAnna Freudians\u201d in London in the 1940s, while Klein\u2019s reception today (in  the humanities) is inflected by the ambivalent revalorization of her work  within French Freud.  War, Text, Image - Elisabeth Bronfen (Distinguished  Global Professor of German)       War: Literally a state of open, armed,  often prolonged, conflict carried on between nations, states, or parties.  Figuratively a condition of active antagonism or contention. War is not only a  concrete condition but also a trope for all the other antagonisms that  structure our sense of who we are, what our relation is to the world, and how  others relate to us. Point of departure for this seminar is the question why  the political situation of embattlement has served so resiliently as theme,  scene, topos and Denkfigur in our cultural imagination. The seminar will  involve four domains of inquiry: 1. Shakespeare's Henry V and its  cinematic afterlife; 2. Kleist's Penthesilea and the battle of the  sexes; 3. Cinematic enactments of battlescenes; and 4. Cultural theoretical  issues involved in the representation of war.   SPRING 2008  Interdisciplinary approaches to  Literature: German Music and Letters   - Prof. John Hamilton  This seminar examines the history of  music and music theory in specific relation to German literature, philosophy,  and criticism. Particular focus is given to the employment of music as a  privileged metaphor in literary projects as well as music\u2019s distance from and appropriation  of verbal and linguistic structures. Session topics include: theories of the  harmony of the spheres; synaesthesia, Romanticism and Universalpoesie ;  Wagner, tragedy and the Gesamtkunstwerk ; absolute music and the  tone-poem; secularization and the rise of chromatization; the semiotics of  music; and music and psychoanalysis. Historical and cultural contexts will be  presented as a number of predominant theoretical questions are developed,  including but not limited to the following: the presumed immediacy or  singularity of musical expression versus the mediation or abstraction of verbal  language; the relation of tonal language and text; the reciprocal,  philosophical critique of music and poetry; the \u201cliteralization\u201d of music;  patriotism, nationalism, and racism. The course ends with a close reading of  Thomas Mann\u2019s Doktor Faustus , a novel that is profoundly critical  of, while being thoroughly informed by, the tradition outlined here.          Archive, Image, Text - Prof. Ulrich Baer  This interdisciplinary seminar explores  the role of the archive as the actual and conceptual origin or grounding  context of much, if not all, research in the arts and humanities. Virtually all  intellectual inquiry into artistic and humanistic expression \u2013 whether we are  considering artworks, literary texts or scholarly productions \u2013 ultimate makes  reference to one authoritative version of the object under discussion. This  version is most frequently housed in some kind of actual or virtual archive  from where the work is canonized, and effectively put into circulation.  The archive is supposed to guarantee  authenticity while permitting revisions and rethinking of the humanistic  heritage. The archive is thus at once the solid reference point and grounding  origin of scholarly work, and the site where prevailing views are most  effectively challenged or overthrown. This class will examine two particular  aspects of this process: the notion of the archive as an actual physical  location that houses actual objects and artifacts beyond an artist\u2019s lifespan,  and the metaphor of the archive as the receptacle of past knowledge and a  work\u2019s inalienable history. Different types of archives and issues will be  addressed, since we will include literary works, art objects, political  documents, racial and national repositories as well as technological storage  \u201cspaces\u201d in our discussions. Guest speakers, experts on various types of  research materials, will supplement lectures by the two professors, who  specialize in the history and theory of modern texts and images respectively.  Updating classical concepts of the archive, we will try to examine how new  technologies are rapidly changing both the nature and the power of information,  and thus its repositories.  Anna Seghers, Christa Wolf &amp; Theory  of Narration - Prof. Robert Cohen  The works of Seghers and Wolf have  acquired iconic status. They appear overdetermined by their authors' identities  as women, as communists, as Jewish (Seghers) or Protestant (Wolf), as Nazi  victims (Seghers) or perpetrators (Wolf's childhood), and as key figures of  Weimar modern\u00adism (Seghers) and of the literature of the GDR. Analyses and  interpretations will proceed from close readings of the texts, with emphasis on  the theoretical problems of modernist narration and on the way meaning is constructed  in 20th century fiction (novels, novel\u00adlas, historical and autobio\u00adgraphical  fiction). Several sessions will be devoted to theories of narration from K\u00e4the  Hamburger, Franz Stanzel, and G\u00e9rard Genette, to Philippe Lejeune's theory of  autobiography. The sessions on Seghers will focus on the avant-gardist  narrative techniques of works such as Aufstand der Fischer von St. Barbara   and \"Der Ausflug der toten M\u00e4dchen.\"  Readings of other works \u2013 Transit ,  \"Die sch\u00f6nsten Sagen vom R\u00e4uber Woynok,\" Die Reisebegegnung\" \u2013  will investigate Seghers' repeated recourse to cross over narration (a woman  narrating as a man), and her use of mythology, fairy tales and the  fantastic as ways of disrupting traditional notions of realism. Discussions of  Wolf's work will focus on the late modernist agenda of transforming the  writer's own life into the subject of fiction ( Nachdenken \u00fcber Christa T. ,   St\u00f6rfall ); and on the construction of the female subject, and its  constantly threatened destruction in patriarchal society, from Nachdenken  \u00fcber Christa T. through its staging in historical ( Kein Ort. Nirgends )  and mythological costumes ( Kassandra ).        Exemplary Texts: Poetry &amp;  Experience - Prof. Avital  Ronell  In the Presence of Noise: Theories and  Media - Prof.  Hans-Christian von Herrman n At the end of the 1970s when the era of  the personal computer was dawning a new kind of media theories started to break  up with the sociological analysis of mass media communication by analyzing  modernity\u2019s technological unconscious. As the seminar will show these concepts  emerged from the confluence of three main sources: French poststructuralist  theory, Canadian media history and American information theory. The reading  list will include texts by Vil\u00e9m Flusser, Friedrich Kittler, Paul Virilio, R\u00e9gis  Debray, Niklas Luhmann, and others.  FALL 2007  Psychoanalysis and Philosophy: Love\u2019s  Body revisited. The Religion of Psychoanalysis - Professor Eckart Goebel        This graduate course is intended to  reread the relation between religion and psychoanalysis. The first part is  devoted to key figures of religious thought, such as St. Augustine, Pascal, and  Luther who were at the same time path breaking as analysts of the human psyche.  We will read Erikson\u2019s book on Luther since Erikson had the provocative thesis  that Luther actually invented what Freud then was forced to study 400 years  later. Before the seminar turns to Freud\u2019s writings on religion and monotheism  we will read a key book for the development of psychoanalysis, especially the  concepts of the Nirvana principle or the Death Drive: Schopenhauer\u2019s seminal  work on The World as Will and Representation . This first part is  followed by close readings of several Freudian writings. The overall goal of  this seminar is to equip students of literary studies with the background  information needed for a better understanding of modern literature and advanced  literary theory.  Literature and Philosophy: More  Trauma - Professor Avital  Ronell  Visual Culture - Taught by Prof. Elizabeth Bronfen  SPRING 2007  Origins of Critical thought II - Professor Paul Fleming  In this continuation of Origins of  Critical Thought, we follow two trajectories of critical thinking in Germany  since Hegel. The first is the hermeneutic-interpretative tradition  beginning with Schleiermacher, proceeding through Dilthey, Nietzsche, and  Freud, and ending with Gadamer\u2019s epochal work Truth and Method. The  second trajectory addresses the differences and disputes of the two most  influential critical directions in the 20th century: Heidegger  and the Frankfurt School. Finally, we will look at critical thought today  in Germany and its two most influential representatives: Kittler and Luhmann.  Whenever possible, we will try to create a dialogue \u2013 at times friendly, at  times antagonistic \u2013 between two thinkers for each session.   Postwar Modernism: Max Frisch &amp;  Peter Weiss, - Professor Robert  Cohen       Though neither Max Frisch nor Peter  Weiss was German, they were key figures in the reconstitution of (West-) German  post-war litera\u00adture. Their works are both paradigmatic of, and different from,  the literature of their German contemporaries (Andersch, B\u00f6ll, K\u00f6ppen, Walser)  which emerged out of the collapse of Germany. From vantage points located at  the periphery of German culture (Switzerland in the case of Frisch, Sweden for  Peter Weiss) the two authors functioned like seismographs reacting to post-war  reality. Their use of innovative and avant-gardism forms in drama and prose  reflects the problematic of recovering the recent past and decoding a complex  present. After prose works exploring the immediate post-war trauma and  reconstituting the (literary) subject both Frisch and Weiss turned to drama and  produced works which focus on anti-Semitism and Auschwitz. These plays will be  read against canonized texts by Sartre and Adorno. Frisch and Weiss's evolution  from modernist into post-modernist writing will be traced through their later  works which decenter and dissolve narrative certainty and signal a new kind of  text with unstable and multiple meanings and uncertain chronologies. In order  to situate these works in the aesthetic and literary context of the postwar  period, two sessions will be devoted to theories of modernism, the avant-garde,  and postmodernism. Beyond \u2013 and before \u2013 all the topical issues these works  evoke, however, they need to be understood as literature. Discussions in class  will be based on close readings, on the narrative and dramatic structures of  these texts, and generally on the way meaning is produced in literary texts.  FALL 2006   Theories of History - Professor Werner Hamacher  In Theories of History we are  going to discuss some of the classical texts from the history of thinking about  history \u2013 in particular Kant\u00b4s \"Idea for a Universal History\" and  \"An Old Question Raised Again: Is the Human Race Constantly  Progressing?\", Hegel\u00b4s lecture course on \"Philosophy of  History\", the relevant paragraphs from Heidegger\u00b4s \"Being and  Time\" and Benjamin\u00b4s notes on the structure of history and cognition.          Fascism &amp; Sexuality - Professor Christopher Clark  This seminar will explore the  relationships between fascism (primarily, but not exclusively in its German  form) and sexuality. Primary topics of analysis in this course are the central  importance of sexuality to fascism not only in historical practice but in  theory, as well as the (dubiously) privileged status of sexuality in theories  of fascism continuing through today. We will begin with the Nazi era, noting  what constituted acceptable and forbidden expressions of gender and sexuality,  in theory and in everyday life. We will proceed through the postwar era to the  present, examining the ways in which artists, theorists, and historians have  continually portrayed and analyzed fascism in sexual terms, paying particular  attention to the recurring figure of \u201cthe gay Nazi.\u201d We will also address such  phenomena as gays and lesbians in the Holocaust (and debates over their  memorialization), the intrinsic homophobia of much antifascist critique, the  1970s \u201cNaziploitation film,\u201d and contemporary queer skinheads, with an eye  toward which of these are historically specific and which still determine the  terms and framing of discourse on fascism today. Readings/viewings include  Mann, Hitler, Genet, Sontag, Mosse, Theweleit, Fassbinder, Visconti, Cavani,  Pasolini, LaBruce, and others. No expertise in spoken or written German is  required for participation in the course. However, graduate students from the  Department of German, as well as students from other departments who are  concentrating in part on German literature, will be expected to read a number  of the primary texts in the original German.       Der Mann ohne Eigenschaften - Professor Eckart Goebel  Torture and Authority - Professor Avital Ronell  Led by an overriding concern with the  concept of legitimacy , the course offers a wide ranging  theoretical exploration of modalities of torture and the underpinnings of  authority. Some topoi, ranging from the chain gang to the culture of bondage  and national political behaviors, include penal styles, the disappearance and  returns of torture as spectacle, the punishment-body, the right to punish, the  punitive ceremony as an exercise of terror, forces of revenge, the final exam,  and so forth. We will take recourse to key psychoanalytic, philosophical and  literary texts that have established a lexicon of torture, gauging specific  effects of authority, whether betrayed, corrupt, book-bound, or legitimate. The  course will consider the status of minoritized, disenfranchized figures, those  subjected to legal as well as institutional persecution. One starting point  will be Adorno's thoughts on the \"authoritarian personality,\" which  gets profiled close by, in conjunction with Blanchot's pages in The Infinite  Conversation , \"The Indestructible.\"  SPRING 2006        Photography &amp; the World - Professor Ulrich Baer  An investigation into the ways  photography has been conceptualized since its inception until its recent  transformation brought about by the advent of digital imaging. Particular  attention will be paid to the notion of the \u2018world\u2019 as it informs most  theoretical attempts to grasp photography; the way in which the rise of  photography is indissociably linked to the emergence of psychoanalysis and  phenomenology; theories of perception; issues of veracity, mimesis, and  aesthetics; and the relation between photography and its historical moment.          Kafka   - Professor Friedrich Ulfers  The course will deal with Kafka\u2019s work  largely in the light of the author\u2019s preoccupation with language particularly  with the way this preoccupation affected his writing, indeed provided the theme  of it. The point of departure will be the experience of \u201clanguage crisis\u201d among  intellectuals and writers in turn of the century Austria, which led to the  radical language criticism \u2013 already foreshadowed by Nietzsche \u2013 of Fritz Mauthner  and Ludwig Wittgenstein among others. An interpretation of Kafka\u2019s work aims to  show not only the influences of this thinking on his writing, but also how  Kafka radicalized it so as to make it \u201cKafkaesque.\u201d Another aspect of the  course will be to examine Kafka as anticipating a line of writing and thinking  that could be described as deconstructive. In this context,  undecidability, the breakdown of referential language, and irreducible  allusiveness will be shown as constitutive of Kafka\u2019s texts. This will  also be the context to discuss the problematization of the real, of judgment,  of justice, and the law that suffuses Kafka\u2019s writing.       Literature &amp; Depression: The  Sickness to Death - Professor Eckart  Goebel  The seminar starts with an  investigation of seminal theoretical texts on mourning and melancholia (Freud,  Klein, Spielrein). It continues with close readings of canonical text of the  philosophical and literary tradition from Kierkegaard to T. S. Eliot, and  Heidegger. The course discusses the history of depression between mediation  (language, art), meditation (religion), and medication (Prozac) and tries to  reconstruct the role of art and poetry within this flexible scaffolding.          Brecht - Professor Robert Cohen  Dialogical and intertextual in the  extreme, Brecht's oeuvre can be seen as an endless critical conversation with  readers and theatergoers, with collaborators, colleagues and lovers, as well as  with philosophical, theoretical, political, economic, and aesthetic theories  from Aristotle to Marx, Lukacs, and Benjamin. The result of these conversations  is a work in progress, a collection of unstable and endlessly revised texts  exploring the human experience in a time of class struggle, violence, and war.  Within this framework the course is conceived as a general introduction to  Brecht's work. Some of the topics the course will focus on are: the experience  of the modern metropolis; the destruction of identity and the construction of a  'collective individuality;' the disintegration of social and sexual relations;  Brecht's Marxism and his contribution to a new dialectics; Brecht's formal  innovations in drama and poetry, and his theater theories. Beyond all the  controversial issues which Brecht's oeuvre (and life) evoke, it needs to be  understood as literature. Discussions in class will be based on close readings  of the texts - poetry, plays, and theoretical works - and on the way  meaning is produced through Brecht's performative use of language (\" Gestus \"),  as well as through his use of modern\u00ad\u00adist literary techniques such as montage,  frag\u00admen\u00adtation and repetition, and \"Verfremdung.\"                                                                                                        Back to Top"}, {"content": "Course Offerings    | German | NYU                                                                                                                                                     Back to Previous Page         Course Offerings     Placement    All students with previous study of German should take a placement examination before registering for their first courses in those languages; see \" Placement Examinations \" in the Academic Policies section of this Bulletin. The departmental placement process consists of a consultation with the director of language programs to choose the level of language instruction most appropriate to the individual student's needs and abilities.      Language Requirement    The department offers courses allowing students to complete the College of Arts and Science language requirement in German. Students may choose either the extensive sequence of four 4-point courses or the intensive sequence of two 6-point courses. Students planning to major in German are advised to follow the intensive sequence.      Basic Language Courses in German    All German language courses use communicative methodology. Elementary-level courses introduce students to essential linguistic and social conventions of contemporary spoken German, with an emphasis on establishing conversational skills. Intermediate-level courses introduce more complex features of the language and focus on building reading and writing skills, while continuing to develop conversational ability.

Continuing emphasis on developing spoken and written communication skills. Students learn more-advanced features of the language and begin to read longer and more-complex texts.      Postintermediate Courses in Language, Culture, and Literature (100 Level)    These are \"bridge\" courses between basic language study and more advanced courses. The common goal of courses at this level is to consolidate students' command of spoken and written German, to review advanced structures of the language, and to provide core information that will be needed in advanced study of literature and culture. Particular emphasis is placed on the development of complex reading and writing skills and their integration with speaking skills. All courses at this level are conducted in German. All German courses at the 100 level require successful completion of GERM-UA 4 or GERM-UA 20, or permission of the department.

This seminar offers an interdisciplinary introduction to the culture of turn-of-the-century Vienna, one of the birthplaces of twentieth-century modernism. The works of Austrian writers, artists, architects, composers, and thinkers will be studied against the backdrop of the political and social climate of the Habsburg monarchy\u2019s final years. Works from a wide variety of fields\u2014including literary texts (poetry, prose, and drama), film, music, art, architecture, philosophy, and psychology\u2014form the core of this course. We will consider how cultural production is both shaped by and reflects its historical context. Figures we will engage with include Sigmund Freud, Arthur Schnitzler, Hugo von Hofmannsthal, Gustav Klimt, Arnold Sch\u00f6nberg, Gustav Mahler, Adolf Loos, Theodor Herzl, and Berta Zuckerkandl.

Techniques of Translation GERM-UA 153 Offered periodically. 4 points. Introduces students to the history, theory, and practice of translation through German and English texts taken from a variety of cultural backgrounds. While engaging in the craft of translation firsthand, students encounter diverse grammatical, syntactical, and stylistic problems, thus gaining a deeper understanding of the German language. Also stresses the acquisition of vocabulary and complex idiomatic structures necessary for effective reading comprehension, as well as written expression.       Advanced Literature and Culture Courses Conducted in English (200 Level)    Courses at the 200 level are conducted in English. Literature-oriented courses at this level may count in fulfillment of the College's minor in literature in translation. Many of these courses are cross-listed with other NYU departments or programs. No knowledge of German is required for courses at this level, and there are no prerequisites.    Introduction to German Culture GERM-UA 220 Offered periodically. 4 points. German thinkers and artists have exerted a profound influence on the history of philosophy, aesthetics, literature, and science. This course aims not only at providing an introduction to crucial periods and events in German cultural history since the Enlightenment, but also at familiarizing students with some of the most important figures in modern intellectual and aesthetic history. The philosophies of Kant and Nietzsche; the music of Mozart and Wagner; the literary contributions of Lessing, Goethe, Fontane, and Brecht; as well as the art movements of dada and Bauhaus all serve as the basis for a discussion of the complex constellation of \"kultur,\" politics, and power in the German intellectual tradition.    Marx, Nietzsche, Freud GERM-UA 240 Offered periodically. 4 points. Examines the work of these three seminal authors by focusing on their notions of interpretation, history, subjectivity, politics, religion, and art. The seminar does not present their work chronologically, but rather creates a dialogue between the authors around each topic and, thereby, delineates the origins of much modern thought.    The German Intellectual Tradition GERM-UA 244 Offered periodically. 4 points. Designed to familiarize students with the major currents of German intellectual and literary history.

Explores the relationship among talent, inspiration, and psychological instability in works of the 19th and 20th centuries. Considers the link between inspiration and possession, Western culture's valorization of originality, the political purpose of characterizing originality as psychologically transgressive, and the allegorization of the creative process through depictions of madness.    Topics in 19th-Century Literature GERM-UA 297 Identical to COLIT-UA 180. Offered periodically. 4 points.    Topics in 20th-Century Literature GERM-UA 298 Offered periodically. 4 points.      Advanced Literature and Culture Courses Conducted in German (300 Level)    Courses at this level provide a broad historical overview of specific periods in German literary and cultural development. Advanced German language skills are practiced, with particular emphasis on the ability to summarize and on the expression of supported opinion. Students read more texts of greater linguistic and conceptual complexity than those used at the 100 level, although readings consist primarily of short works and excerpts. Readings are drawn from literary and nonliterary sources.    It is recommended that students complete GERM-UA 152 or the equivalent before enrolling in courses at the 300 level.

Study of German novellas and drama from romanticism to realism and naturalism with a focus on form, genre, and narrativity.     Advanced Seminars Conducted in German (400 Level)    These courses examine authors, groups of works, and intellectual, aesthetic, and social movements of particular significance in the development of German literature and culture. These courses have a narrower focus than do those at the 300 level; the emphasis is on in-depth examination rather than on overview. Readings are longer and more linguistically demanding than those used at the previous level. Language work focuses on conjecture and the expression of abstract concepts, in both written and spoken German.    Goethe GERM-UA 455 Offered periodically. 4 points. Examines Goethe as the pivotal literary figure of his time. Considers Goethe's prose, poetry, and drama from the late Enlightenment through storm and stress to classicism and beyond.    The Age of Goethe GERM-UA 456 Offered periodically. 4 points. Examines German reaction to the Enlightenment in the literature of storm and stress and of classicism. Considers irrationalism, social protest, and Humanit\u00e4tsdichtung as successive stages of the expansion of consciousness in an age in which Goethe was the central, but not the only significant, literary figure. Readings include Herder, Von der Urpoesie der V\u00f6lker and selected poems; Lenz, Die Soldaten; Schiller, Die R\u00e4uber, Kabale und Liebe, Maria Stuart, and selected poems; and H\u00f6lderlin, selected poems.

Johann Fausten; Goethe's Urfaust and excerpts from his later dramatic versions (Faust, Ein Fragment; Faust I and II); and Thomas Mann's Doktor Faustus.    Literature of the Weimar Period GERM-UA 468 Offered periodically. 4 points. The chaotic Weimar period (1918-33) began with a revolution and ended with the takeover by the Nazis. During these few years, German modernism evolved from expressionism to the aesthetics of new sobriety (Neue Sachlichkeit). From the more traditional (Thomas Mann, Hermann Hesse) to the experimental and revolutionary (Bertolt Brecht, Anna Seghers), the works of this period draw into question its subsequent glorification as the golden '20s. Readings include works by Brecht, Hesse, Roth, Seghers, Klaus Mann, and Thomas Mann.    Minority Discourses GERM-UA 475 Offered periodically. 4 points. In recent years, literary productions have emerged that fall under the heading of \"minority\" literatures, often understood as texts written in German by so-called foreigners. This course examines this notion critically and also analyzes the impact of individual works in relation to current debates on multiculturalism, integration, and national identity.    Seminar on 19th-Century Authors GERM-UA 487 Offered periodically. 4 points.    Seminar on 20th-Century Authors GERM-UA 488 Offered periodically. 4 points. Each of these courses provides advanced students of German with an in-depth knowledge of one major author of either the 19th or 20th century.

Conversation and Composition is a   reading, writing, and speaking intensive course. Emphasis will be placed   on refining written and spoken expression, with particular focus on the   ability to articulate opinions, exchange substantive information, and   argue points of view; developing analytic and interpretive writing   skills; and encouraging flexibility of expression. In addition, a   thorough grammar review will be part of our work. During the course of   the semester we will explore the fascination with ghosts, ghostly   apparitions, scenes of dread, and haunted or scientifically inexplicable   events from the 1800s to today\u2014in particular, with the enduring   association of new technologies and electronic media with paranormal or   spiritual phenomena from a media or science and technologies studies   perspective. GERM-UA132 M, W 12:30 \u2013 1:45 Germany in Contemporary Cinema Alys George This post-intermediate course investigates how contemporary German cinema  has thematized recent German history. How have filmmakers approached topics  such as the resistance movements of World War II, postwar family life, East German  surveillance, the fall of the Berlin Wall, Jewish identity, social inequality  and injustice, the immigrant experience, and European unity? Directors\u2019  approaches to depicting 20th- and 21st-century Germany  history are diverse, surprising, deeply personal, and often humorous. You will  improve your language proficiency in speaking, writing, and listening, while  increasing your knowledge of German film, German history and culture, and film  techniques in general. Films by leading German directors will include Das  Leben der Anderen (2006), Berlin is in Germany (2001), Die  fetten Jahre sind vorbei (2004), Rosenstra\u00dfe (2003), Im  Juli (2000), and Das Wunder von Bern (2003). GERM-UA220 M, W 11:00 \u2013 12:15 Introduction to German Culture &amp; Thought: Luther to Nietzsche Christiane Frey How   is it that Martin Luther, the firebrand initiator of the Protestant   Reformation, could call for a liberation from the dogmatism of the   church and yet maintain that all men should obey secular authority? Why   do we generally hold that the philosopher and scientist G.W. Leibniz   stood at the beginning of modernity (and what, by the way, is   \u201cmodernity\u201d supposed to be?) despite the fact that he wrote a massive   volume on how to defend the existence of God? Is the Enlightenment   tolerant? Did Hegel really believe that the modern state should be   Christian? Could it be true that one can tell lies in an extra-moral   sense, to disfigure a title from Nietzsche? And last but not least: to   what use (or abuse) should one look into (intellectual) history? This   course will address these and other questions by exploring the history   of German thought and culture from the 16th to the 19th century.   Discussion will focus \u2013 at times perhaps in unconventional ways and   through the lens of modern theory \u2013 on some of the most prominent texts   of the canon of philosophy, theology, the sciences, and, of course,   literature. Beyond the authors mentioned, readings will also include   texts by Paracelsus, Johannes Kepler, Kant, Goethe, Kleist, and Rahel   Varnhagen. GERM-UA240 T, R 3:30 \u2013 4:45 Marx, Nietzsche, Freud Leif Weatherby This   course introduces students to the work of Marx, Nietzsche, and Freud,   three German-language authors who in different and decisive ways   provided radically new understandings of economics, philosophy, and the   psyche. Writing from the mid-19th century through the 1930s, the three   thinkers placed their indelible stamps on reformulating modern notions   of the state, the subject, knowledge, and the mind. The purpose of this   course is to provide a comprehensive engagement with the writings of   Marx, Nietzsche and Freud by bringing them into dialogue with each   other. That is, rather than reading the three authors chronologically,   the course is organized around six topoi \u2013 interpretation, history,   subjectivity, politics, religion, and art \u2013 in which a paradigmatic text   from each author is read. The seminar underscores their prevailing   actuality and thereby strives to delineate the origin of much modern   thinking. GERM-UA349 T, R 11:00 \u2013 12:15 German Romanticism: Speculative Technologies: The Literature of German Romanticism Leif Weatherby This   course introduces students to German Romanticism, a movement that   grasped itself as a literary, philosophical and scientific watershed in   human history. Rather than following the traditional division between   early, high, and late Romanticism, we will track three figures in   Romanticism\u2019s multifaceted corpus: reflexivity, depth, and the social.   We will start with the emergence of the movement in Jena and its roots   in biological and philosophical discourses, where reflexivity plays a   crucial role in the fragmentary and novelistic writings of Friedrich and   August Wilhelm Schlegel, as well as Novalis and Ludwig Tieck. The   troubling figure of \u201cdepth\u201d will make up the second unit of inquiry, in   such figures as Karoline von der G\u00fcnderrode, Friedrich Creuzer, and   Clemens Brentano. Deploying both of these techniques, Heinrich von   Kleist, E. T. A. Hoffmann and Heinrich Heine bring Romantic techniques   to bear on the changing fabric of the social, revealing Romanticism as a   technically concrete and simultaneously speculative response to the   increasingly complexity of modern life. GERM-UA283 (HBRJD-UA685 ) T, R 3:30-4:45 The Holocaust: The Third Reich and the Jews David Engel This   lecture course is an historical investigation of the evolution of Nazi   policies toward Jews; of Jewish behavior in the face of those policies;   and of the attitudes of other countries, both within and outside the   Nazi orbit, for the situation of Jews under the rule of the Third Reich.   GERM-UA999 T 9:30 - 12:30 Senior Honors Seminar Ara Merjian GERM-UA501 TBD Honors Thesis Alys George &amp; Leif Weatherby  SPRING 2014  GERM-UA133 -  German  Culture 1890 \u2013 1989: Nationalism,  Industrialization, and War: Germany, 1890-1945  - Chadwick Smith This course examines the interaction between German literature and other  social institutions in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. We will  investigateGerman responses to rapidly changing technological, economic, and  material conditions following the failed revolutions and continuing through  German unification and industrialization, and culminating in the First World  War. We will also consider how literature and theoretical writing provide a  site inwhich to imagine social change, as we examine a variety of conflicts  between traditional social norms and new conceptions of self and society, and  trace the evolution of conceptions of social class, gender and identity and the  anxiety such developments inspired. Readings will include selections from:  Benjamin, Brecht, Fontane, Freud, Musil, Nietzsche, Rilke, and Simmel.  GERM-UA152 -  Intro to German Literature  - Leif Weatherby Required for the German major. Introduces  students to representative authors and works of German literature, with  emphasis on the modern period. Students learn basic conventions of literature  and literary interpretation, as well as strategies for the effective reading of  shorter and longer prose works, drama, and poetry. Guided writing assignments  focus on developing the language skills necessary for effective written  analysis and interpretation of literary texts in German.  GERM-UA244 - German  Intellectual Tradition: The Myth of the Machine. From Divine Automata  to the Internet - Leif Weatherby We live in a world of technological mediation. Devices provide us with the  rules--for geographical orientation, fordating, for knowing the weather. Do we  use our devices, or do they use us? The question is old, and this course looks  at cultures of machines from the Early Modern period to the present. It will  proceed thematically, treating problems in historical technological cultures  like computers (Pascal, Babbage, Kittler), automata (Vaucanson, Hoffmann,  Helmholtz, Merimee, \u010capek), divine machines (Leibniz, Jean Paul, Wiener,  G\u00fcnther), the advent of film (M\u00fcnsterberg, Lang, Benjamin), animals/humans and  \"the tool\" (Geroi-Lourhan, Heidegger, Darwin/Marx, Engels, Kapp,  Samuel Butler) and the so-called \"megamachine\" of modern society  (J\u00fcnger, Mumford). The framework will be the negative anthropology tradition  between Herder and Gehlen and the reversal of the myth from the extension of  human powers to the primacy of the technological. The shared conviction of  nearly all these authors is that culture must reflect on its machines--and on  itself as a machine-like entity--in order to survive .  GERM-UA249 -  Intro to Theory : Critical Theory from Plato to  Adorno and Beyond  - Alan Itkin With Plato\u2019s Republic , critical theory begins with a bang: Plato  bans poets from his ideal republic, telling us that they are nothing but liars  corrupting those who read their works. Poetry, Plato writes, is misleading  because it is nothing but a copy of a copy, an imitation of the mere appearance  of reality. The two questions Plato links together\u2014what is literature, and what  is it good for?\u2014have been at the center of critical theory ever since, and the  answers theorists give to the one are almost always implicitly answers to the  other as well. In this course we will trace these questions from the classical  period to the present with the help of theorists including Plato, Aristotle,  Nietzsche, Marx, Freud, Lacan, Benjamin, Adorno, Derrida, and Zizek. We will  examine and develop the principles and methods we use to analyze and interpret  literature and the other arts, because there can be no interpretation without  theoretical assumptions. As another critical theorist, Paul de Man, has told  us, the resistance to theory is itself a form of theory.  GERM-UA487 -  Seminar on 19th Century Literature: Staging  Revolt in German Drama  - Chadwick Smith This course examines German drama from the late 18th and early 19th centuries,  when discourses of rights and the equal application of law supplant other  ethical and political discourses, a shift that requires a revised relationship  between the individual human subject and the state. Giving a political role to  aesthetics, the stage becomes the public venue in which these reconfigurations  are played out. The focus is on the partisans\u2014on G\u00f6tz von Berlichingen, Karl  Moor, Hermann, and Danton. An analysis of these figures allows for a  delineation of the borders of state violence. These works raise questions the  contours of sovereignty. What rights do citizens have over and above those  granted by the State? What right to revolt? What power do those outside of the  political order wield? How do states attempt to contain dissent or brand it  terror? These questions will structure the course and identify parallels to the  contemporary world.  FALL 2013 GERM-UA153 - Techniques of Translation - Andrea Dortmann This course introduces students to the history, theory, and practice of  translation through German and English texts taken from a variety of cultural backgrounds.  While engaging in the craft of translation first hand, students will encounter  diverse contrastive grammatical, syntactical, and stylistic problems, thus  gaining a deeper understanding of the German language. The course also stresses  the acquisition of vocabulary and complex idiomatic structures necessary for  effective reading comprehension as well as written expression. A background  reader in English will familiarize students with historical and theoretical  implications of translation.      Photocopies of primary texts in German (and English) to be translated will  be distributed by the instructor. Materials may include newspaper and magazine  articles; recipes; TV- and print advertisements; scientific and philosophical  articles; pop material such as hip hop and rap songs, cartoons; Literary texts:  prose, theater, poetry, libretti, among others. In addition to those weekly  translation assignments, which will be critically assessed in class, we will  translate one or more longer prose texts (TBD) from German to English as a  class. This work will accompany our course throughout the semester. GERM-UA111 - Conversation/Composition: Taking Sides in  Berlin - A Century of Debates in and about a Divided City -  Chadwick Smith  The course follows Berlin\u2019s course through the  tumultuous 20th century, in which Berlin can rightfully be said to have played  the central, starring role. By attending to a series of representative and  debates and divisions that came to define the century, we will tour a city  riven by the forces of industrialization and rapid growth, torn asunder by war,  physically divided in two during the cold war, and finally reunified to emerge  as a multicultural world capital. When possible, we will trace the historical public and private divisions  forward to the forms they take in contemporary Berlin, a magnet for an  international creative class and setting for very contemporary debates over  memorialization, race and ethnicity, and art. Toward this goal, we will engage  with and comment upon them through the lens of news and entertainment media.  We will work with a variety of written (short  stories, poetry, newspaper articles, feuilleton , and a novel) and visual  sources including film, visual art, and architecture and design. At the same  time, we will learn to write in various genres such as the news report,  commentary or feuilleton , and film or book review. Toward these goals, we will also  address the development of the various media\u2019s role in society, and the way in  which changing media technologies affect interaction with culture and language.   Conversation and Composition is designed for  students with a solid grasp on German grammar and vocabulary who wish to extend  their knowledge of German language, history, politics, and culture, through  reading, discussion, and writing. All readings, discussion, and written work  for the course will be in German. We will work on refining written and spoken  expression with particular focus on the ability to articulate opinions,  exchange substantive information, and argue points of view; developing analytic  and interpretive writing skills; and expanding students\u2019 linguistic toolkit. A  thorough grammar review will thus necessarily be part of our work.  GERM-UA244 - German Intellectual Tradition:  Literature, the Sciences &amp; Philosophy: Kepler to Kleist - Christiane  Frey  How did the  sciences, philosophy, and literature interact and influence one another on the  way to becoming the discrete pursuits they are today? This course will approach  this question by tracing a series of entanglements that challenge our sense of  what knowledge is. We will explore, for example, why Kepler wrote a dream  narrative to promote his scientific discoveries; how Leibniz\u2019s philosophy was  shaped by the microscope and romances; how the modern novel aligns with  statistics. We will retrace the birth of a new science called \u201caesthetics,\u201d  investigate how Goethe\u2019s affinity to chemistry changed his way of writing, and  discuss how the romantic concept of science might question our idea of the  humanities and the sciences as \u201ctwo cultures.\u201d Finally, we will ask how all  these \u201ccases\u201d are connected and what they tell us about the distinctions we  rely on to produce knowledge.   GERM-UA366 -  20th Century Prose: Women\u2019s Voices from Germany and Austria - Alys George  This course introduces you to prose works by a selection  of the most influential 20th-century women writers from Germany and Austria  (among them Lou Andreas-Salom\u00e9, Anna Seghers, Ingeborg Bachmann, Christa Wolf,  and the Nobel Prize-winners Elfriede Jelinek and Herta M\u00fcller). We consider  what constitutes Frauenliteratur, \u201cwomen\u2019s writing,\u201d but also think through  major historical topics of the past century as represented in literary texts by  female authors. These include: the role of women at the fin de si\u00e8cle; the New  Woman in the Weimar Republic; life under National Socialism; women\u2019s roles in  post-WWII reconstruction; gender roles in the Communist bloc; the women\u2019s  liberation movement; immigrant and minority discourses; and the status of  gender and sexuality as reflected by contemporary media. Genres covered will  include autobiography, short story, novella, and novel.   GERM-UA283 - Topics: The Portrait -  Christopher Wood A portrait is a depiction or description of a real individual. Portraiture  faces a series of conceptual challenges: how much information is necessary to  secure reference to the portrayed person? how is the effect of likeness  achieved? what is, in the end, \u201cindividual\u201d about a human being? All cultures  in all times have produced portraits. Portraiture reveals how a culture thinks  about persons, selves, and souls. Some portraits are also works of art; how  does this change the game? The seminar will approach a wide range of examples,  pictorial and textual, from a variety of perspectives. Topics will include:  portraits of holy men and women (icons); tomb portraits; portrait photography;  portraits and the state (royal effigies, defamatory portraits, ID cards);  verbal portraits; the portrait as a theme in fiction; biography and  autobiography; portraits and the performance of self; studio models.   GERM-UA999 \u2013  Senior Honors Seminar - Alys  George &amp; Leif Weatherby   GERM-UA501 \u2013  Honors Thesis - Alys  George &amp; Leif Weatherby  SPRING 2013  GERM-UA152 - Introduction to Literature - Arne Hoecker   This course has two major goals: (1) to introduce students to  a selection of representative authors and exemplary texts of literature written  in German language from the 18th to the 20th century and (2) to develop close  and critical reading skills while learning to express yourselves about literary  texts in German, both in writing and in speaking. Covering the three major  literary genres \u2013 poetry, prose, drama \u2013 some of the following issues will be  discussed: the depiction of otherness; the representation of time and history;  the uncanny; the relationship between form and content; the economy of human  relationships on the basis of hierarchy, love, authority, among others. All  readings in German.  GERM-UA185 - Introduction to German Poetry: Das Ich und  das Ding - Leif Weatherby  This course introduces the long tradition of German lyric  poetry. Lyric is usually associated with the sentimental and experiential  subject, longing for the completeness of nature or the embrace of a lover. The  lyric subject, however, is constantly confronted by a world of things, and  these things are inflected by the gender of the poet. From the thing-like  nature of the beloved in niedere (but also ebene ) Minne in  the medieval tradition to the \u201cthing-poems\u201d of Rainer Maria Rilke to the  eviscerated and partial objects of Paul Celan, lyric reveals itself as the  genre of the (gendered) subject in a world of objects. We will read poems from  one female and one male poet in five periods: Medieval (Hildegard von Bingen,  Walter von der Vogelweide); Early Modern (Catharina Regina von Greiffenberg,  Andreas Gryphius); Romanticism (Karoline von der G\u00fcnderrode, Friedrich  H\u00f6lderlin); Modernism (Else Lasker-Sch\u00fcler, Rainer Maria Rilke); and post-WWII  (Ingeborg Bachmann; Paul Celan). Throughout the German lyric corpus, we will  ask ourselves, what is an \u201cI\u201d? To whom and to what gender does this \u201cI\u201d belong?  And how is it mediated by the thing-world? All readings in German. GERM-UA240 -  Marx, Nietzsche, Freud - Arne Hoecker This course examines the work of Marx, Nietzsche, and Freud,  three German authors who in different and decisive ways provided a radically  new understanding of the notions of interpretation, history, the subject, politics,  religion, and art. The purpose of this course is to provide a comprehensive  engagement with and a dialogue between these three thinkers. The seminar  underscores their prevailing actuality and thereby strives to delineate the origin  of much modern thinking.  GERM-UA347 -  German Enlightenment: Vernunft und Schrecken - Leif Weatherby The German \u201cEnlightenment\u201d was and is a controversial hybrid.  The growth of communications technologies across Europe put the fragmented  German-speaking lands into self-perceived cultural, scientific, and  philosophical competition and dialogue with other European nations. In  literature, poets from Albrecht von Haller to Gotthold Ephraim Lessing to  Johann Wolfgang von Goethe struggled to establish a \u201cGerman\u201d paradigm to match  the philosophical and poetic cultures in France, England, and Scotland. From  the start, they maintained the combination of literature, philosophy, and  science, often mixing these apparently distinct spheres for the purposes of  fostering a unified \u201cnation.\u201d This course looks at Enlightenment as a  cross-disciplinary attempt to fashion a culture of \u201creason,\u201d and asks a  question: how does reason deal with its weightiest uncanny counterpart, terror?  Starting with Newton and Leibniz, we will read the philosophical-aesthetic  debates of the 1740s (Bodmer, Gottsched, von Haller), the attempt at  Germanification of tragedy as a philosophical form of literature in the 1750s  (Lessing, Mendelssohn, Nicolai), and the late but leading Enlightener Immanuel  Kant and his natural-scientific counterpart, Johann Blumenbach. We will also  discuss such reactions to \u201cEnlightenment\u201d as Wieland\u2019s \u201csensibility\u201d ( Empfindsamkeit )  movement, the Storm and Stress ( Sturm und Drang) , Lavater\u2019s Physiognomie ,  and Winckelmann's as well as Goethe's and Schiller\u2019s classicism. Throughout, we  will see how the emergent hybrid \u201creason\u201d confronts political and aesthetic  (and even natural-scientific) terrors, and how it\u2014perhaps\u2014produces some of its  own. All readings in German .  GERM-UA283 (This course originates in History-  cross-listed as HIST-UA 283 ) - The Origin of Humanity: History of a  Modern Obsession - Stefanos Geroulanos In its attempt to reexamine and reinterpret the sources and  consequences of human knowledge, the Enlightenment irrevocably displaced the  widely accepted biblical explanation of the origin of man, his creation in the  image and resemblance of God. With this displacement was born, or reborn, a largely  new set of questions: Where does man come from? What was early humanity like?  How has mankind changed or progressed since those early times? How long ago  were those early times? Did culture proper emerge in Greece? In India? At a  historical fount of races and nations? In \u201cprimitive\u201d culture? Which origin  should be taken most seriously\u2014that of the human species, or that of modern  culture? Were the \u201cearly times\u201d a kind of utopia that needs to be recaptured?  And given change and progress, where is mankind today, and where is it going?  What would be the effect of seeking to reconstitute, to bring about, a society  based on this origin? These questions, and the history of the answers offered to  them, will be at the heart of our course. At its most general level, the course  is an introduction and overview of major themes in modern European intellectual  history, focusing on the modern obsession with re-divining and often re-living the  origins of man. We will be concerned with both philosophical texts and  scientific efforts to identify and clarify this origin, with the political  implications of such origins, and not least with efforts to identify who (which  discipline? which political party?) should have authority for determining and  using \u201cthe origin.\u201d We will read some of the crucial texts in the period from  the 1750s to the 1960s, tracing the answers offered by philosophers,  anthropologists, biologists, linguists, and poets. FALL 2012 GERM-UA455 - Goethe - Arne H\u00f6cker This course offers insight into one of the big shots of  German literature: Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (1749-1832) is the icon of the  bourgeois artist and universal genius, an Enlightenment philosopher, a  researcher of nature, a poet, and a minister in the state of Weimar. This  course will examine Goethe as the pivotal literary figure of his time. We will  read and discuss Goethe\u2019s prose, poetry, and dramatic work from the late  Enlightenment through storm and stress to classicism and beyond. In addition,  we will acquaint ourselves with Goethe\u2019s autobiographic and scientific  writings. GERM-UA145 - Viennese Modernism: Love, Madness, Death   - Alys George This course offers an interdisciplinary introduction to the  culture of turn-of-the-century Vienna, one of the birthplaces of  twentieth-century modernism. The works of Austrian writers, artists,  architects, composers, and thinkers will be studied against the backdrop of the  political and social climate of the Habsburg monarchy\u2019s final years. Works from  a wide variety of fields\u2014including literary texts (poetry, prose, and drama),  film, music, art, architecture, philosophy, and psychology\u2014form the core of  this course. We will consider how cultural production is both shaped by  and reflects its historical context. Figures we will engage with include  Sigmund Freud, Arthur Schnitzler, Hugo von Hofmannsthal, Gustav Klimt, Arnold  Sch\u00f6nberg, Gustav Mahler, Adolf Loos, Theodor Herzl, and Berta Zuckerkandl.  This course is a 100-level, post-intermediate course in German, which will also  focus on language acquisition at the advanced level. A portion of the course  will involve visits to museums in New York. GERM-UA111 - Conversation and Composition: Von Geistern,  Gespenstern und anderen merkw\u00fcrdigen Gestalten/Of ghosts and other curious  creatures (taught in German) - Andrea Dortmann Conversation &amp; Composition is designed for students with  a solid grasp of German grammar and vocabulary who wish to extend their  knowledge of the German language, history, and culture through reading,  discussion, and writing. Conversation &amp; Composition is a reading and  writing intensive course. Emphasis will be placed on refining written  expression and developing the ability to discuss and argue opinions, as well as  a thorough review of grammar. This course explores the fascination with ghosts, ghostly  apparitions, and haunted scenes in the arts from the 1800s to today in a  variety of genres: narrative prose, poetry, theater, film, maybe opera,  paintings/photos, music, popular culture, etc. Authors will include Johann  Wolfgang von Goethe, Heinrich von Kleist, Johann Peter Hebel, E.T.A. Hoffmann,  Theodor Storm, Karl Marx, Sigmund Freud, Franz Kafka, Thomas Mann, Marie-Luise  Kaschnitz, Yoko Tawada, Inka Parei, among others. The question why we are fascinated  by the scientifically inexplicable and how it was treated in the arts to this  day will accompany us throughout the semester. Please don\u2019t be scared. GERM-UA244 - German Intellectual Tradition: Do the  Revolution: German Culture and Revolutionary Violence - Leif Weatherby Germany has never had a successful revolution. Its culture,  however, has been obsessed with violence and systemic political change from  Luther to the violent leftist groups of the Federal Republic. The external and  passive revolutions that dissolved the feudal system in Germany led the poet  H\u00f6lderlin to call the Germans \u201cthought-rich and deed-poor.\u201d This course will  make a positive of what Marx called the \u201cGerman Ideology,\u201d focusing on the  productive anxieties of a figure of fascination: revolutionary violence.  Starting with Luther\u2019s rejection of the Peasants\u2019 War, we will consider the  French Revolution among the Romantics, the revolutions of 1848 among the Young  Hegelians and Marx, the Russian revolutions among the Expressionists, violence  and art in and around National Socialism, and the anti-capitalist violence of  the RAF and the Baader-Meinhof Group, among others. We will finish the course  with theoretical considerations of the meaning of revolution in contemporary  geopolitics. Authors include: Luther, Hegel, Kleist, Marx, Luxemburg, Toller,  J\u00fcnger, Fassbinder, and Zizek.  SPRING  2012   GERM-UA.133  - German Culture 1890 - 1989: German/Jewish: Negotiating Identity in Post-1945  Literature &amp; Culture -   Alys George This course explores how authors of Jewish heritage in Germany and  Austria have probed the boundaries of identity after 1945. By introducing  students to a range of critical questions and forms of cultural production, the  course aims is to gain a deeper understanding of the complexities of  German-Jewish and Austrian-Jewish experience and their contemporary  representations. Central questions will include: can \u201cJewishness,\u201d \u201cGermanness,\u201d or  \u201cAustrianness\u201d be defined? What constitutes \u201cJewish writing\u201d? How are Jewish  identity, experience, and culture \u201ctranslated\u201d into literature and film? How do  Jewish authors perceive their role in contemporary German and Austrian society  and public discourse? What role do the remembrance of the past (in particular,  of the Shoah), the politics of the present, and day-to-day minority experiences  play in public/political discourse and cultural production?  This  questioning is set against the background of the exclusions and atrocities that  shaped German and Austrian society and their relation to those deemed \u2018other\u2019  in the twentieth century. The course will cover topics such as autobiography and exile, language and  gender, memory and \u201cpostmemory\u201d in the cultural production of writers of Jewish  heritage in the German language. Written and visual texts by first-generation  survivors such as Paul Celan, Nelly Sachs, Ilse Aichinger, Edgar Hilsenrath,  and Ruth Kl\u00fcger, as well as by second-generation writers like Barbara  Honigmann, Doron Rabinovici, Maxim Biller, and Esther Dischereit form the core  of the course. These texts will be discussed in connection with theoretical  approaches. Genres will include poetry, drama, autobiography and memoir, short  stories, non-fiction, the novel, and film.  GERM-UA.152  \u2013 Introduction to German Literature   -Arne Hoecker This course has two major goals: (1) to introduce students to a selection  of representative authors and exemplary texts of literature written in German  language from the 18th to the 20th century and (2) to develop close and  critical reading skills while learning to express yourselves about literary  texts in German, both in writing and in speaking. Covering the three major  literary genres \u2013 poetry, prose, drama \u2013 some of the following issues will be  discussed: the depiction of otherness; the representation of time and history;  the uncanny; the relationship between form and content; the economy of human  relationships on the basis of hierarchy, love, authority, among others.  GERM-UA244  \u2013 German Intellectual Tradition: The Failure of Human Dignity - Chadwick Smith During the long 19th century, literature and philosophy informed the  Enlightenment project of human freedom and emancipation while simultaneously  staging its failure. Starting with Hannah Arendt\u2019s The Origins of  Totalitarianism (1951) and taking the notion of the \u201cperplexities\u201d of modern  human rights as a guiding framework, we will read canonical 19th-century German  literary texts from Goethe to Kafka and place them into dialog with theoretical  and philosophical reflections from the 19th and 20th centuries (Hegel, Marx,  Ranciere, Agamben) in order to explore the problems inherent both within human  rights and in defining the category of the human itself.  GERM-UA.397  \u2013 Topics in 19th Century Literature: Literature and Criminality - Arne Hoecker This course will focus on 19th century German literature by examining the  various intersections between cultural, social and scientific discourse. We  will study literary representations of crime from Romanticism to Realism and  Naturalism, looking at questions of form, genre, and narrativity. In addition,  we will confront these literary representations with judicial and psychological  definitions of criminality, and study their interrelation at the level of  narrative strategies invoked in the portrayal of the criminal.  FALL  2011       GERM-UA.0111  - Conversation and Composition \u2013 Berlin: Metropolis &amp; Metamorphosis - Alys George  Conversation and Composition is designed for post-intermediate students  of German with a solid grasp of German grammar and vocabulary who wish to  expand on their knowledge of the German language, history, and culture through  reading, discussion, and writing. Conversation and Composition is a reading,  writing, and speaking intensive course. Emphasis will be placed on refining  written and spoken expression, with particular focus on the ability to  articulate opinions, exchange substantive information, and argue points of  view; developing analytic and interpretive writing skills; and encouraging  flexibility of expression. In addition, a thorough grammar review will be part  of our work. If  Walter Benjamin called Paris the capital of the nineteenth century, Berlin was  in many ways the capital of the twentieth century. The city became a stage for  remarkable shifts and ruptures that occurred between 1900 and 2000, and this  course explores a century of radical cultural, historical, and political  change. Berlin was, by turns, imperial capital; hothouse for the Weimar  Republic\u2019s avant-garde impulses; National Socialism\u2019s imagined \u201cGermania\u201d;  post-World War II divided city; Cold War capital of the GDR; and, today,  capital of a reunified Germany.  We  will take a cultural studies approach to twentieth-century Berlin and learn how  to effectively \u201cread\u201d and interpret textual and visual materials. This course  is designed to be interdisciplinary, so we will work with a variety of written  genres (poetry, short stories, novel, journalistic non-fiction), visual art,  architecture, and film. Authors will include Walter Benjamin, Alfred D\u00f6blin,  Inge Deutschkron, Stefan Heym, Christa Wolf, Peter Schneider, Katja  Lange-M\u00fcller, Durs Gr\u00fcnbein, Monika Maron, Zafer Senocak, and Wladimir Kaminer.  Film materials will include Berlin: Die Sinfonie der Gro\u00dfstadt [1927], Berlin  Alexanderplatz , Die M\u00f6rder sind unter uns , Der Himmel \u00fcber Berlin ,   Sonnenallee , Berlin: Sinfonie einer Gro\u00dfstadt [2002], and Das  Leben der Anderen .  GERM-UA.0153  - Techniques of Translation   - Andrea Dortmann This course introduces students to the history, theory, and practice of  translation through German and English texts taken from a variety of cultural  backgrounds. While engaging in the craft of translation first hand, students  will encounter diverse contrastive grammatical, syntactical, and stylistic  problems, thus gaining a deeper understanding of the German language. The  course also stresses the acquisition of vocabulary and complex idiomatic  structures necessary for effective reading comprehension as well as written  expression. A background reader in English will familiarize students with  historical and theoretical implications of translation. Photocopies  of primary texts in German (and English) to be translated will be distributed  by the instructor. Materials include newspaper and magazine articles; recipes;  TV- and print advertisements; scientific and philosophical articles; pop  material such as hip hop and rap songs, cartoons; Literary texts: prose,  theater, poetry, libretti, among others. In addition to those weekly  translation assignments, which will be critically assessed in class, we will  translate a longer prose text (TBD) from German to English as a class. This  work will accompany our course throughout the semester.  GERM-UA.0244  - The Age of angst : German and Austrian Intellectual History, 1890-1939 - Alys George  This course explores the profound sense of crisis, uncertainty, and  anxiety that pervaded German and Austrian experience in the late nineteenth and  early twentieth centuries. The era\u2019s radical changes\u2014among them the traumas of  war, rapid industrialization and urbanization, shifting gender roles, and the  political and economic instability of the interwar years\u2014seemed to shake the  very bedrock upon which society had been built. The intellectual and aesthetic  responses to this pervasive sense of angst and upheaval, as well as the  challenges and changes themselves, form the focus of this course. We will  reflect in depth on how the intellectual impulses informed aesthetic innovation  as we explore the meaning and nature of modernity and crisis in early  twentieth-century Germany and Austria. Readings will include Nietzsche, Freud,  Loos, Simmel, Weber, Benjamin, Heidegger, and Kracauer.  GERM-UA.0366  - 20th Century Prose: Miniatures of Modernity from Nietzsche to Benjamin - Arne H\u00f6cker German and Austrian writers from the turn of the century to the Weimar  Republic experimented with genres of short prose as a privileged literary form  to express philosophical thought and cultural criticism. Through close readings  of German short prose pieces from Nietzsche\u2019s aphorisms to Kafka\u2019s parables,  and Benjamin\u2019s thought-images ( Denkbilder ), this course explores the  thresholds between image and text, intuition and reflection, literature and  philosophy. Other modernist authors to be read include Hofmannsthal, Robert  Walser, D\u00f6blin, Benn, Musil, and Broch.  SPRING  2011       V51.0133  - German Culture 1890-1989: Fantasy &amp; Fiction - Viola Kolarov This course explores 20th century German culture, literature, and media. We will  focus on the metropolis as allegory of modern experience. Topics include  literary heritage, architecture, philosophy, and major 20th century genres:  autobiography, utopia/dystopia, sci-fi, and crime drama. An emphasis will be  placed on refining written expression, honing listening and reading skills, as  well as a review of grammar.  V51.0152  - Introduction to German Literature   - Paul Buchholz This course has two major goals: (1) to introduce students to a selection of  representative authors and exemplary texts of literature written in German  language from the 18th to the 20th century and (2) to develop close and  critical reading skills while learning to express yourselves about literary  texts in German, both in writing and in speaking. Covering the three major  literary genres \u2013 poetry, prose, drama \u2013 some of the following issues will be  discussed: the depiction of otherness; the representation of time and history;  the uncanny; the relationship between form and content; the economy of human  relationships on the basis of hierarchy, love, authority, among others.  V51.0240 \u2013 Marx, Nietzsche, Freud - Paul Fleming This course introduces students to the work of Marx, Nietzsche, and Freud,  three German-language authors who in different and decisive ways provided  radically new understandings of economics, philosophy, and the psyche. Writing  from the mid-19 th century through the 1930s, the three thinkers  placed their indelible stamps on reformulating modern notions of the state, the  subject, knowledge, and the mind. The purpose of this course is to provide a  comprehensive engagement with the writings of Marx, Nietzsche and Freud by  bringing them into dialogue with each other. That is, rather than reading the  three authors chronologically, the course is organized around six topoi \u2013  interpretation, history, subjectivity, politics, religion, and art \u2013 in which a  paradigmatic text from each author is read. The seminar underscores their  prevailing actuality and thereby strives to delineate the origin of much modern  thinking.  V51.0253 \u2013 Topics in German Cinema: Faust and Film - Viola Kolarov The course offers an overview of the theoretical responses to J. W. Goethe's  \"Faust I and II\" and the philosophy of tragedy. We will examine a  large body of cinematic work that re-releases the component parts of Goethe's  literary experiment. The course serves as an introduction to German studies,  media studies, and psychoanalysis. In English.  V51.0488  \u2013 Seminar on 20th Century Authors: Ingeborg Bachmann - Paul Buchholz The Austrian writer Ingeborg Bachmann (1926-1973) composed a striking array of  provocative writing across a variety of literary genres. Her work voices  a deep discomfort the conventional operations of language, but also continually  revisits the hope that writing can bring about changes in the world. From  her early poetry and stories to her later work on the uncompleted \u201cTodesarten\u201d  novel-cycle, Bachmann offers reflections on a vast array of interwoven  concerns: remembrance of and opposition to war, the nature of time and  historical experience, the making of feminine the voice, economic inequality  and the persistence of fascist structures within the family, the limits and  possibilities of the individual voice. Moreover, Bachmann's multi-voiced  writing engages in an intense dialogue with major 20th century philosophers of  history and time (Walter Benjamin and Martin Heidegger). We will begin  with a study of Bachmann's poetry before moving on to radio plays, short  stories, lectures on poetics, and one uncompleted novel.  FALL 2010       V51.0111  - Conversation and Composition: Tatorte/Crime Scenes- Andrea Dortmann Conversation &amp; Composition is designed for post Intermediate students of  German with a solid grasp of German grammar and vocabulary who wish to extend  their knowledge of the German language, history, and culture through reading,  discussion, and writing. Conversation &amp; Composition is a reading and  writing intensive course. Emphasis will be placed on refining written  expression and developing the ability to express, discuss, and argue opinions.  In addition, a thorough review of grammar will be part of our work. This  course explores narratives about crimes and crime scenes from the 1800s to  today in a variety of genres: narrative prose, poetry, theater, film, TV  series, paintings/photos, among others. Authors will include E.T.A.  Hoffmann, Franz Kafka, Friedrich D\u00fcrrenmatt, Bertolt Brecht, Andrea Maria  Schenkel, Feuerbach and others. Questions of guilt, social and historical  underpinnings of crime stories, motives for crime, and the fascination with  solving riddles will accompany us throughout the semester.  While  engaging in the topic of crimes, we will work on writing and speaking skills  and hopefully also write our own crime or detective story. So don\u2019t be scared.  V51.0132  \u2013 German Culture, Politics &amp; Society   - Paul Buchholz Spectres of 1968: Afterlives of Political and Social Revolt In German culture, the year 1968 continues to haunt, irritate and inspire as a  time when society was supposed to change, suddenly and utterly. The  utopian and anti-war student movements of 1960s West Germany emerged amongst a  wide array of \"alternative\" ideas of political action, cultural  expression, historical remembering and communal living.  To explore the diversity of these ideas, we will embark on close and thoughtful  readings of a variety of written and visual materials, including films,  political essays, newspaper articles, songs, poetry, ethnography, one short  novel and a theatre piece. Authors will include Hans Magnus Enzensberger,  Ingeborg Bachmann, Peter Weiss, Peter Schneider, the activist Rudi Dutschke,  and Peter Handke. Our explorations will carry us through the 1970s and  80s, into the present, with study of the alternative communities in the  Kreuzberg neighborhood in Berlin, and recent mainstream \"political\"  films that look back to the \"lost chances\" in German cultural history. In parallel to our readings, we will work to refine analytic and interpretive  writing in German through regular written assignments and a final paper.   This course is designed for students with a solid grasp of basic German  grammar and vocabulary, and will expand flexibility of expression in  German through ongoing and creative dialogue with the many voices that speak  about, and from within, a time of \"revolt.\" V51.0220 \u2013 Intro to German Thought &amp; Culture - Elke Siegel German thinkers and artists have exerted a profound influence upon the history  of philosophy, aesthetics, literature, and science. This course aims not only  at providing an introduction to crucial periods and events in German cultural  history since the Enlightenment, but also at familiarizing you with some of the  most important figures in modern intellectual and aesthetic history. The  philosophies of Kant and Nietzsche, the music of Mozart and Wagner, the  literary contributions of Lessing, Goethe, Fontane, and Brecht as well as the art  movements of Dada and Bauhaus will serve as the basis for a discussion of the  complex constellation of \u201cKultur,\u201d politics, and power in the German  intellectual tradition. V51.0298 \u2013 Topics in 20th Century Lit: Playing &amp; Reality: Hamlet  in German Letters - Viola Kolarov The course offers an overview of the German reception of Shakespeare's  \"Hamlet\" with an emphasis on its impact on 20th century thought. We  will consider general theoretical questions of translation in the German  context, the psychoanalytic paradigm of transference, ghostly transmission,  film and media responses, and common grounds between the German and  Anglo-American traditions. The course will serve as introduction to German  thought, comparative methods, psychoanalysis, and media analysis.  V51.0488 \u2013 Rilke\u2019s Lyrical Poetry - Eckart Goebel  This class is conceived to provide an introduction to the universe of Rilke\u2019s  Lyrical Poetry. By means of measured and careful close readings we will follow  the trajectory of Rilke\u2019s oeuvre, from the early poems to the late Duino  Elegies. Since Rilke excelled in many different forms and meters, this seminar  also serves as an introduction to \u201cVerslehre,\u201d including the study of random  phenomena like the prose poem. A special emphasis will be put on Rilke\u2019s theory  of \u201cthings\u201d as well on his art of description.  V51.0999  \u2013 Senior Honors Seminar   - Paul Fleming  SPRING 2010       V51.0152  - Introduction to German Literature - Eckart  Goebel This course has two major goals: (1) to introduce students to a selection of  representative authors and exemplary texts of literature written in German  language from the 18th to the 20th century and (2) to develop close and  critical reading skills while learning to express yourselves about literary  texts in German, both in writing and in speaking. Covering the three major  literary genres \u2013 poetry, prose, drama \u2013 some of the following issues will be  discussed: the depiction of otherness; the representation of time and history;  the uncanny; the relationship between form and content; the economy of human  relationships on the basis of hierarchy, love, authority, among others. V51.0133 - German Culture 1890-1989: Fantasy &amp; Fiction - Viola  Kolarov This course explores 20th century German culture, literature, and media. We  will focus on the metropolis as allegory of modern experience. Topics include  literary heritage, architecture, philosophy, and major 20th century genres:  autobiography, utopia/dystopia, sci-fi, and crime drama. An emphasis will be  placed on refining written expression, honing listening and reading skills, as  well as a review of grammar. V51.0253 - German Cinema: Crypto-fetishism and the Postwar Film - Viola  Kolarov We will focus on the psychoanalytic definition and evolution of the concept of  the fetish by examining the psychological effects of war on filmmaking in  Germany and beyond. As a product of trauma the techno-fetish contains a record  of failed mourning and a blueprint of group formation. We will base our  readings and discussion of psychoanalytic, philosophical, and literary texts on  postwar film made in the Federal Republic and Hollywood. V51.0216 - Scoring Literature: The Drug Culture - Avital Ronell This course is taught in English and originates in the Comparative Literature  Department and is crosslisted with the German Department. As a way to get  access to some of the most vital aspects of comparative literature and German  as fields, this course will explore the role of addiction, pharmacology,  intoxication, and poison in fiction, philosophy, and psychoanalysis. Our  readings will take us to places where the motifs linked to drug cultures are  often concealed or repressed. During the course of the semester we will take a  close look at the pharmacodependency with which literature has been associated  historically--as sedative, as cure, as escape conduit or euphorizing substance,  as mimetic poisoning. In the cases of Baudelaire, Flaubert and James Joyce the  literary text was legally treated as a drug and run off the market by outraged  judges. We will analyze the legal documents that first declared these literary  works illicit, and then turned around those decisions. Some  of the questions that will be raised in class discussion include: What is the  relation of literature to law? How does the literary work become a medical  problem? Why has fiction been identified as part of a self-destructive drive?  What are the rhetorical strategies that render the poetic word, since the time  of Plato, socially inadmissible? We will read the relevant stimulants and works  of Kant, Heidegger, Derrida in philosophy, Freud and Lacan on destructive  pleasure, and explore the terrains opened up by Thomas De Quincey's  \"Confessions of an Opium Eater\" to Flaubert's \"Madame  Bovary,\" and Boroughs' and Dennis Coopers' works to see how imaginary  worlds collide with acts of legal and social policing. Prepare for the  intellectual rush of a lifetime! V51.0488 \u2013 Seminar on 20th Century Authors: Bertolt Brecht - Elke  Siegel  Bertolt Brecht\u2019s profound and influential work as a poet and dramatist, as  theater director and theorist of the \u2018epic theater\u2019, as writer for radio and  film encapsulates history, political or literary-aesthetic, of the 20th  century, affording a unique perspective on the pervasive question of the  relationship between politics and art. Having celebrated his first successes in  the Weimar Republic, Brecht\u2019s major dramatic works were written in exile, while  upon his return to the GDR Brecht, with the Berlin Ensemble, was able to  realize a style of theatrical performance which is influential to this day. The  course aims, 1) to give an overview of Brecht\u2019s work in different genres \u2013  prose, poetry, drama, theory \u2013 ranging from the beginnings in the Weimar  Republic to the 1950s; 2) to touch upon trends and figures influencing Brecht  (e.g., the comedian Karl Valentin, avant-garde theater director Erwin Piscator,  mass sports events); and 3) to discuss the profound influence Brecht has  exerted on literature and theater (e.g., the dramatist and theater director  Heiner M\u00fcller).   FALL 2009  V51.0111  - Conversation/Composition: Berlin -   Elke Siegel Conversation &amp; Composition is designed for students with a solid grasp on  German grammar and vocabulary who wish to extend their knowledge of the German  language, history, politics, and culture through reading, discussion and  writing. Conversation &amp; Composition is a writing intensive course. This  course explores German culture, literature, and politics from the Weimar  Republic to the fall of the Wall and unification (1917-1990s) through an  examination of the city of Berlin. Topics include: the question of the  metropolis; the Weimar Republic; the Nazi dictatorship; rebuilding Berlin; two  Berlins; 1968; multiculturalism; the fall of the wall. An emphasis will be  placed on refining written expression, honing listening and reading skills,  developing the ability to discuss and argue opinions, as well as a thorough  review of grammar. We will work with a selection of written and visual  narratives, including literature (e.g., D\u00f6blin, Enzensberger, Delius, Brussig,  Wolf, \u00d6zdamar, Lange-M\u00fcller), historical, political and sociological texts  (e.g., Georg Simmel, Rudi Dutschke), journals, newspaper accounts, official  documents, architecture, and films/film clips (Berlin: Die Sinfonie der  Gro\u00dfstadt, Menschen am Sonntag, M, Kuhle Wampe, Berlin Alexanderplatz, Die  M\u00f6rder sind unter uns, Sonnenallee, Good Bye Lenin, Das Leben der Anderen).  V51.0153 - Techniques of Translation - Andrea Dortmann This course introduces students to the history, theory, and practice of translation  through German and English texts taken from a variety of cultural backgrounds.  While engaging in the craft of translation first hand, students will encounter  diverse contrastive grammatical, syntactical, and stylistic problems, thus  gaining a deeper understanding of the German language. The course also stresses  the acquisition of vocabulary and complex idiomatic structures necessary for  effective reading comprehension as well as written expression. A background  reader in English will familiarize students with historical and theoretical  implications of translation. Photocopies of primary texts in German (and English) to be translated will be  distributed by the instructor. Materials include newspaper and magazine  articles; recipes; TV- and print advertisements; scientific and philosophical  articles; pop material such as hip hop and rap songs, cartoons; Literary texts:  prose, theater, poetry, libretti, among others.  V51.0249  - Intro to Cultural Studies -   Kathrin DiPaola An interdisciplinary tool kit to read realities The terms \u201cCulture\u201d and \u201cCultural Studies\u201d have become magical formulas to  describe the intricacies of our presence. They are applied to explain and  investigate any angle of our multi-facetted social and historical realities  spanning from pop culture via business culture to even the culture of war. However, to fully understand the underlying definitions of the vast term  \u201cculture,\u201d it is necessary to comprehend its pluralistic lines of theoretical  tradition. Beginning with the framework of the Birmingham Center for Cultural  Studies in England and its most famous intellectual Stuart Hall, this course  brings together ideas from critical theory, cultural studies, film, and  literature to analyze the development and strategic use of discourses of race,  class, and gender in contemporary society. Bridging the gap between high  culture and street culture, the course offers students a basic,  interdisciplinary \u201ctool kit\u201d with which to read contemporary culture in its  literary, cinematic, and other popular forms.  V51.0244  - The German Intellectual Tradition: Critical Theory - Paul Fleming This course introduces students to German Critical Thought, beginning with its  roots in the 19th century (e.g., Marx and Nietzsche) and following its  trajectory to the Frankfurt School (e.g., Adorno, Benjamin) and beyond (e.g.,  Bakthin, Barthes). Established in 1930 at the Institute for Social Research,  the assorted circle of scholars comprising the Frankfurt School played a  pivotal role in the intellectual developments of post-war American and European  social sciences, and continues to exert influence in contemporary social theory  and cultural studies. Often known simply as \u201cCritical Theory,\u201d their key works  cover a vast array of intellectual and political concerns, from the critique of  state capitalism, industrial society, and instrumental reason to commentaries  on mass culture, aesthetics, fashion, fascism, and psychoanalysis. The  interdisciplinary undertakings span many academic subjects and traditions of  economics, sociology, philosophy, literature, art, psychology, pol itics, and  history. In this course, we will begin with an examination of the central precursors to  Critical Theory in the 19thc and will then undertake a broad survey of the  major writings associated with the Frankfurt School as well as those written in  their wake. This introduction to the programmatic statements and eclectic  reflections of various scholars will highlight the diverse historical  influences, collaborative efforts, and internecine debates that shaped the  intellectual tradition across continents and generations. Authors include:  Marx, Nietzsche, Freud, Adorno, Benjamin, Marcuse, and others.  V51.0390  - Topics in German Cinema: Creature    Features - Viola Kolarov We will examine some literary, philosophical, religious, and cinematic  contemplations of the creature while focusing on the ways in which the  individual and the mass media metabolize the creaturely in response to trauma.  V51.0999  - Senior Honors Seminar -   Dopico-Black  SPRING 2009  V51.0133  - German Culture 1890-1989: Fantasy &amp; Fiction - Viola Kolarov This course explores 20th century German culture, literature, and media through  an examination of the metropolis as a mirror of our contemporary media  experience. Topics include: the family; literary heritage; technical and occult  media; 20th century genres: thriller, dystopia, sci-fi, crime and drama. An  emphasis will be placed on refining written expression, honing listening and  reading skills, as well as a review of grammar .  V51.0152 - Intro to German Literature - Elke Siegel This course has two major goals: (1) to introduce students to a selection of  representative authors and exemplary texts of literature written in German  language from the 18th to the 20th century and (2) to develop close and  critical reading skills while learning to express yourselves about literary  texts in German, both in writing and in speaking. Covering the three major  literary genres \u2013 poetry, prose, drama \u2013 some of the following issues will be  discussed: the depiction of otherness; the representation of time and history;  the uncanny; the relationship between form and content; the economy of human  relationships on the basis of, e.g., hierarchy, love, authority.

This course aims not only  at providing an introduction to crucial periods and events in German cultural  history since the Enlightenment, but also at familiarizing you with some of the  most important figures in modern intellectual and aesthetic history. The  philosophies of Kant and Nietzsche, the music of Mozart and Wagner, the  literary contributions of Lessing, Goethe, Fontane, and Brecht as well as the  art movements of Dada and Bauhaus will serve as the basis for a discussion of  the complex constellation of \u201cKultur,\u201d politics, and power in the German  intellectual tradition.  V51.0253 - Topics in German Cinema: Media &amp; Psychoanalysis   - Viola Kolarov This course explores the intersections between psychoanalysis and the media  emerging at the time of its conception, most notably film. Since the course  serves as an introduction to the theory and practice of psychoanalysis we will  examine our daily involvements and investments in both the mass media and  therapeutic practices that rely on our ability to communicate. We will read  texts from the classic Freudian tradition, literary works that inhabit the  psychoanalytic corpus, and watch a number of films from Germany and Hollywood  that tell the story of their -- and our -- development.    V51.0401 - Great Books in German: Twilight of the Idols - Eckart Goebel This seminar, conducted in German, is conceived as a careful, introduction to Friedrich  Nietzsche\u2019s highly influential thinking, and style. The first part will, after  an introduction to Also Sprach Zarathustra, provide a close reading of the  first book of Day Break (Morgenr\u00f6te), where Nietzsche develops his idea of a  strictly historical philosophy, and confronts us with his theory of culture.  The second part of this seminar will go step by step through Nietzsche\u2019s  attempt to summarize his entire philosophy in The Twilight of the Idols  (G\u00f6tzend\u00e4mmerung). Finally we will read Nietzsche\u2019s essay on Truth and Lying  and conclude with the interpretation of some of his poems, the  Dionysos-Dithyramben. Copies of the German version of G\u00f6tzend\u00e4mmerung may be  purchased at the NYU Bookstore. The other texts will be available in a reader.  Course requirements: Three written reading responses (2 pages each) and one  final paper (5 pages long).   FALL 2008  V51.0297  \u2013 Jews &amp; Germans, an Intercultural History - Paul North The relationship between German and Jewish cultures has historically been much  more complex than the \u201cand\u201d in the title of this course would lead us to  believe. Influence between the \u201ctwo\u201d cultures often flowed in both directions.  For instance, Enlightenment ideas in Germany strongly influenced the Jewish  Enlightenment or Haskala, while philosophers of the Enlightenment\u2014such as  Immanuel Kant\u2014took cues from a Jewish thinker, Moses Mendelssohn. Similarly,  debates over Jewish emancipation in the early nineteenth century corresponded  to a general opening of society that was part of the coalescence of German  national identity. In this course we will explore the complexities of an  affiliation that spoils the conception of culture as single and unified, based  on proprietary treasures deposited in \u201ca\u201d culture. Beginning with the late  eighteenth century we will consider literary, political, theological, and  philosophical texts, along with films, plays, and operas produced up to the eve  of World War II\u2014all of which represent struggles to understand the association  of the two names \u201cGerman\u201d and \u201cJew.\u201d Regarding names, you might also conceive  of this course as an attempt to come to terms with a statement made by Franz  Kafka, a German-speaking Jewish writer living in Prague in the early 20th  century. \u201cI have nothing in common with the Jews,\u201d he wrote, and then added: \u201cI  have nothing in common with Franz Kafka.\u201d Whatever else it might mean, the  statement expresses ambivalence toward unquestioned acceptance of an identity  such as \u201cZionist,\u201d \u201cassimilationist,\u201d \u201canti-Semite,\u201d and so forth. Instead  Kafka asks a more basic question: what does it mean to have \u201csomething in  common with\u201d \u2026 any proper name? This question will help guide our discussions.  The  Devil\u2019s Lectures - Laurence Rickels Vampire Professor Larry Rickels from UCSB (UC Sucks Blood) presents: THE DEVIL in  Ernest Jones, Freud, and Vilem Flusser, among other masters of  the university. Consideration of the syndications of the Devil's reign  in literature and film completes this tempting offering. Sign up of  your own free will.The medley of texts includes excerpts from THE DEVIL'S  ELIXIRS, THE DAMNED, NEEDFUL THINGS, PARADISE LOST, and CHILDHOOD'S END,  among many others. We begin with film clips from SATAN'S SCHOOL FOR GIRLS  and THE RACE WITH THE DEVIL, rev up with clips from DEMONS and DEMONS 2,  and advance to the slow clip of such Luciferian works as INAUGURATION  OF THE PLEASURE DOME. In between we will also consider -- and exploit!  -- some of the better known Devil films.  Germany  Culture, Politics &amp; Society: Berlin 1900: Lifestyles - Viola Kolarov This course explores the culture, literature and language of Berlin at the turn  of the 20th century. Topics include mores and ethics, inheritance, mental  health, and contemporary tabloid culture. An emphasis will be placed on  refining written expression, honing listening and reading skills, and reviewing  grammar and vocabulary.  SPRING 2008  Introduction  to German Literature   - Sladja Blazan This course has two major goals: (1) to introduce students to a selection of  representative authors and exemplary texts of literature written in German  language from the 18th to the 20th century and (2) to develop close and  critical reading skills while learning to express yourselves about literary  texts in German, both in writing and in speaking. Covering the three major  literary genres \u2013 poetry, prose, drama \u2013 some of the following issues will be  discussed: the depiction of otherness; the representation of time and history;  the uncanny; the relationship between form and content; the economy of human  relationships on the basis of hierarchy, love, authority, among others.  German  Intellectual Tradition: Friendship   - Elke Siegel The topic of friendship in recent years has experienced a renaissance.  Disciplines as different as anthropology, literary studies, philosophy, and  sociology have developed a new and invigorated interest in the theory and  practice of friendship as a utopia of a community of individuals differing  radically from those communities based on family or nation. Whereas friendship  was once defined by proximity, similarity, and mutuality, in modern  manifestations and discussions friendship tends towards distance, difference,  and asymmetry (see Derrida\u2019s Politics of Friendship ). The course  explores crucial reflections on friendship in changing contexts and discourses:  Antiquity (Plato, Aristotle, Cicero), Montaigne\u2019s and Bacon\u2019s friendship essays  of the 17thcentury, the 18th century German \u2018cult of friendship\u2019 (Klopstock,  Schiller), and Romanticism(Tieck); the re-configurations of friendship in  modernity (Nietzsche, Kafka, Bernhard);sociology\u2019s investigation of the friend  as the locus of discretion and tact (Simmel); the notion of friendship as \u201ca  way of life\u201d (Foucault) and as a moral phenomenon (Blum) of particular  importance for feminism (Friedman).  Readings  in Contemporary Theory: Outrageous Texts   - Avital Ronell; Nicola Behrmann M.A. This class will explore over-the-top texts by means of contemporary theoretical  works of Walter Benjamin, Jacques Derrida, H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Cixous and other crucial  writers and philosophers. This much can be said in anticipation: readings will  be slow and intense, at once fabulous and frustrating, because we no longer believe  in wrapping up the meaning of inexhaustible texts or achieving transparency. If  you need subtitles to understand this description, the class will provide them  for you. The texts will be mostly culled from the French, German, and English  canon, ranging from Kleist\u2019s MARQUISE OF O to Kathy Acker\u2019s version of DON  QUIXOTE, and including Werner Herzog\u2019s movie MY BEST FIEND.  FALL 2007  Techniques  of Translation - Andrea Dortmann This course introduces students to the history, theory, and practice of  translation through German and English texts taken from a variety of cultural  backgrounds.

The course also stresses the acquisition of vocabulary and  complex idiomatic structures necessary for effective reading comprehension as  well as written expression.  Composition  &amp; Conversation: Berlin(s)   -Yevgeniy Pomerantsev This course explores 20th (and 21st) century German culture through a focus on  the city of Berlin and its multiple incarnations as capital (Imperial Reich,  Weimar Republic, Nazi Reich, divided city, GDR and reunified Germany). We will  examine the birth of Germany's first modern metropolis and its subsequent  division and reunification after 1989, focusing also on the post-unification  phenomenon of \"Ostalgie.\" We will work with a variety of written and  visual narratives, including short stories, poetry, film, Feuilleton pieces,  and a novel.  Modern  German Drama - Elke Siegel  V51.0999  Senior Honors Seminar -   Elke Siegel  SPRING 2007       Germany  Culture, Politics and Society: Minority Cultures and Media , - Janelle Blankenship The course explores contemporary German culture, politics, and society, with  special focus on minority cultures and media.

European  Avant-garde Cinema   - Janelle Blankenship This course examines the history, politics, and aesthetics of European  avant-garde film. We will discuss concepts of political modernism, the  culture industry, and the aesthetics of shock. Diverse movements will be  considered, including Expressionism, Soviet Agit-prop, Dada, and Surrealism.  Post  1945 Literature Erinnerungs/Kulturen/Memory Cultures - Christopher Clark This course provides an overview of German literature, film, and culture since  1945, with an emphasis on the topic of memory. German culture after 1945 has been  preoccupied the memory of war, National Socialism, and the Holocaust; debates  among historians are front-page news, particularly the Historikerstreit   of the 1980s and the Goldhagen-Debatte of the 90s. Literature has been  an important vehicle for the process of Vergangenheitsbew\u00e4ltigung , or  coming to terms with the past, and we will discuss texts that both thematize  and perform acts of memory. We will examine various strategies of remembering  and memorializing the past, always asking what the significance of memory is  for the present and future. Furthermore, we will examine a range of memory  cultures, considering memories of the 1950s \"economic miracle,\" the  60s student movement and 70s radicalism, and the GDR and its demise, all of  which coexist and compete with memories of the war and the Holocaust in the  same cultural space. We will read texts and view films by such authors and  directors as Anna Seghers, Elisabeth Langg\u00e4sser, Ingeborg Bachmann, Heinrich  B\u00f6ll, Rainer Werner Fassbinder, Margarethe von Trotta, Michael Verhoeven,  Benjamin Wilkomirski, W.G. Sebald, Thomas Brussig, Zafer Senocak, Bernhard  Schlink, and other contemporary writers. All readings, discussion, and writing  in German.

You are invited to read  a great variety of textual genres: ballads, poems, aphorisms, short stories, a  children\u2019s novel, and a theater play. Some of the following issues will guide  our investigation: difference between love and friendship, family and friends,  friends and foes; questions of gender [friendship between men and women, male  bonding, girlfriends], proof of friendship; betrayal, loyalty, idealization;  the question of power, and other problems that you may want to bring up.  Literature  and the Senses - Janelle  Blankenship This course explores twentieth-century German literature, as it strains to  hear, see, touch, and dream of new visions of time and space. We will study  fin-de-si\u00e8cle theories of perception, shock, and trauma (Freud, Ernst Mach,  Georg Simmel) and read naturalist novellas, fantasy novels, crime thrillers,  animal epics etc.  German  for Business - Cornelia Uhlenhaut This course is designed for students who have fulfilled their language  requirement and who wish to learn the terminology and conventions of German in  the business world. This is not a class on German economy per se; it rather  introduces students to the use of German language in professional situations,  thus emphasizing communicational and conversational language skills. In  addition to learning about contemporary Germany and its business culture, our  aim is to build and strengthen your vocabulary, your communication and  presentation skills and to refine your accuracy.   German  Poetry: Lyrical poetry from Goethe to Enzensberger - Eckart Goebel   SPRING 2006  German  Culture, Society, and Politics: From Ostzone to Ostalgie - Christopher Clark This course will explore the literature, culture, and politics of the German  Democratic Republic, commonly referred to as \"East Germany.\" From its  beginning as the Soviet-occupied zone to its foundation as a socialist republic  at the dawn of the Cold War, we will trace how artists and intellectuals  negotiated between their own utopian ideals and the often brutal reality of  daily life in a repressive regime. We will examine the Aufbaujahre of  the 1950s and the failed workers' uprising of 1953, as well as the massive flow  of people into the West, leading to the construction of the Berlin Wall, the  most (literally) concrete symbol of the Cold War. We will read the literature  of the relatively liberal early 70s and then explore the disastrous  consequences of the Wolf Biermann affair for artists and intellectuals in the  late 1970s. We will move on to the events leading to the fall of the Wall and  subsequent public debates over re/unification vs. a \"third way.\"  Finally, we will consider the cultural legacy of the GDR in the 1990s and  beyond, including the remainder of the so-called \"Mauer im Kopf\" and  the phenomenon of \"Ostalgie,\" a widespread nostalgia for many aspects  and artifacts of daily life in East Germany. Readings may include literature by  Bertolt Brecht, Stefan Hermlin, Anna Seghers, Stefan Heym, Christa Wolf,  Irmtraud Morgner, Charlotte Worgitzky, Monika Maron, and Thomas Brussig; the  films Coming Out , Sonnenallee , and Good Bye Lenin! ; and a  range of short historical and non-fiction texts. All readings, discussion, and  writing in German.  Introduction  to German Literature   - Martin Sch\u00e4fer This course has two major goals: (1) to introduce students to a selection of  representative authors and exemplary texts of literature written in German  language from the 18th to the 20th century and (2) to develop close and  critical reading skills while learning to express yourselves about literary  texts in German, both in writing and in speaking. Covering the three major  literary genres - poetry, prose, drama - some of the following issues will be  discussed: the depiction of otherness; the representation of time and history;  the uncanny; the relationship between form and content; the economy of human  relationships on the basis of hierarchy, love, authority, among others.  Marx,  Nietzsche, Freud - Paul Fleming This course examines the work of Marx, Nietzsche, and Freud, three German  authors who in different and decisive ways provided a radically new  understanding of the notions of interpretation, history, the subject, politics,  religion, and art. The purpose of this course is to provide a comprehensive  engagement with and a dialogue between these three thinkers. The seminar  underscores their prevailing actuality and thereby strives to delineate the  origin of much modern thinking.  Early  German Cinema: Science/Sensation/Spectacle   - Janelle Blankenship This course will focus on the sensational origins of cinema in Germany.   We will examine cinema as part of a wider exhibition culture that includes  phantasmagoria ghost projection, magic lanterns, and the  \"edutainement\" of microscopes, X-rays and stereoscopes. Our analysis  of German cinema starts with the body madness of the \"Boxing  Kangaroo\" (from Max and Emil Skladanowsky's 1895 Wintergarten film  program) and ends with colonial cinema (Im deutschen Sudan) and German horror  classics ( Caligari, Genuine, Nosferatu! ). Rare glimpses into the  Skladanowsky retrospective of the Third Reich and a screening of New German  cinema representations of forgotten film pioneers also illuminate the act of  creating a national film history and archive .  Great  Books in German Literature: Technology, Tricks, and the Supernatural - Janelle Blankenship This course considers uncanny moments of magical tricks, technology, and the  supernatural in German literature and film. Diverse historical periods, genres,  and aesthetic styles will be analyzed by way of attention to the overarching  theme of this seminar. Texts include Goethe\u2019s Faust and ETA Hoffmann\u2019s Der  Sandmann . Films include Murnau\u2019s Faust (1926) and Fritz Lang\u2019s Metropolis   (1927).                                                                                               Back to Top"}]}]
