The Department of Performance Studies is the first program in the world to focus on performance as the object of analysis. Our programs explore the ways that performance creates meaning and shapes social life. \"Performance\" is at the center of the theoretical, historical, and methodological courses offered. Courses train students to document, theorize, and analyze embodied practices and events. A provisional coalescence on the move, performance studies is more than the sum of its inclusions.    Performances    We study actual performances, from postmodern dance and Hip Hop to world's fairs and orature, from performance art and staged dramas to spirit possession, political rallies, and the law court, from Butoh and vaudeville to capoeira, Olympics and jazz.    Performance As Lens    We use performance as an organizing concept for studying a wide range of behaviors and situations, from museums and food to landscape and the aesthetics of everyday life. We use performance as a theoretical lens for thinking about how elections are organized or how gender, race, and sexuality are performative (and often performances).    Intercultural    We explore Latin/o-American, Caribbean, African and African-American, Asian and Asian-American, European, and American performance. Performance Studies challenges aesthetic hierarchies and analyzes how they are formed.    Interdisciplinary    We start with a set of concerns and objects and range widely for what we need by way of theory and method. By theorizing embodiment, event, and agency in relation to live (and mediated) performance, Performance Studies can contribute to other new fields, such as Cultural Studies and Visual Culture. We draw on such fields as anthropology, theatre, and history. Our courses explore feminist, queer, postcolonial, Marxist, psychoanalytic, and critical race theory. Our methods of research and analysis include fieldwork, interviews, archival research, and movement analysis.    Theory and Practice    We integrate theory and practice in workshops and courses in performance composition, performance writing, dramaturgy, theories of directing, and performance and technology. Guests artists have included Yvonne Rainer, August Boal, Holly Hughes, Carmelita Tropicana, Ricardo Dominguez, and Deborah Margolis.    New York City    We are situated in New York City's legendary Greenwich Village and encourage students to take full advantage of the city's unparalleled resources for seeing performances of all kinds, conducting research, and professional development. Several of our courses require students to use the city - with its many neighborhoods and subcultures - as a \"lab\" for exploring theories of everyday practice. Some courses also provide students with the opportunity to collaborate with New York City artists. Dramaturgy students have worked with prominent artists including Mabou Mines, Anne Bogart, Vito Acconci Studio, The Kitchen, and Denis O'Connor.

The Department of Performance Studies is the first program in the world to focus on performance as the object of analysis. Our programs explore the ways that performance creates meaning and shapes social life. \"Performance\" is at the center of the theoretical, historical, and methodological courses offered. Courses train students to document, theorize, and analyze embodied practices and events. A provisional coalescence on the move, performance studies is more than the sum of its inclusions.    Performances    We study actual performances, from postmodern dance and Hip Hop to world's fairs and orature, from performance art and staged dramas to spirit possession, political rallies, and the law court, from Butoh and vaudeville to capoeira, Olympics and jazz.    Performance As Lens    We use performance as an organizing concept for studying a wide range of behaviors and situations, from museums and food to landscape and the aesthetics of everyday life. We use performance as a theoretical lens for thinking about how elections are organized or how gender, race, and sexuality are performative (and often performances).    Intercultural    We explore Latin/o-American, Caribbean, African and African-American, Asian and Asian-American, European, and American performance. Performance Studies challenges aesthetic hierarchies and analyzes how they are formed.    Interdisciplinary    We start with a set of concerns and objects and range widely for what we need by way of theory and method. By theorizing embodiment, event, and agency in relation to live (and mediated) performance, Performance Studies can contribute to other new fields, such as Cultural Studies and Visual Culture. We draw on such fields as anthropology, theatre, and history. Our courses explore feminist, queer, postcolonial, Marxist, psychoanalytic, and critical race theory. Our methods of research and analysis include fieldwork, interviews, archival research, and movement analysis.    Theory and Practice    We integrate theory and practice in workshops and courses in performance composition, performance writing, dramaturgy, theories of directing, and performance and technology. Guests artists have included Yvonne Rainer, August Boal, Holly Hughes, Carmelita Tropicana, Ricardo Dominguez, and Deborah Margolis.    New York City    We are situated in New York City's legendary Greenwich Village and encourage students to take full advantage of the city's unparalleled resources for seeing performances of all kinds, conducting research, and professional development. Several of our courses require students to use the city - with its many neighborhoods and subcultures - as a \"lab\" for exploring theories of everyday practice. Some courses also provide students with the opportunity to collaborate with New York City artists. Dramaturgy students have worked with prominent artists including Mabou Mines, Anne Bogart, Vito Acconci Studio, The Kitchen, and Denis O'Connor.

It offers intensive training for students who wish to become the new leaders of the field. The program accepts up to 4 new students a year. All newly admitted Ph.D. students are offered a four-year comprehensive fellowship program that includes full tuition and fee remission, comprehensive health insurance coverage and a stipend.  Students complete 72 points of coursework, followed by comprehensive area examinations and culminating with the dissertation.  Together with a faculty advisor, students plan a program of study to meet their individual interests and to ensure adequate preparation for the area examinations and the dissertation.  Thanks to the Inter-University Doctoral Consortium, doctoral students can take a limited number of courses at Columbia University, New School University, Fordham University, CUNY Graduate Center, and Princeton University.

The program consists of three semesters of full-time course work, beginning with an exciting Summer Institute.    The curriculum includes two required courses--Introduction to Performance Studies and Projects in Performance Studies--which are complemented by seven courses chosen in consultation with the student\u2019s faculty adviser according to individual interests and needs. Students in the program are also encouraged to apply for internships in dramaturgy, museum curating, and other programs with which the department maintains contact.    Students who earn an interdisciplinary degree through the one-year M.A. program gain an academic edge for application into PhD. programs, not only in performance studies, cultural studies, and visual studies, but also in traditional disciplines such as English, anthropology, theatre, history, and sociology, as well as area studies such as Latin/o America and the Caribbean, African and African American, and Asian American studies.    Graduates of the M.A. program are currently pursuing careers as artists, writers, researchers, editors, performers, choreographers, directors, arts administrators, archivists, curators, radio broadcasters, and teachers.
