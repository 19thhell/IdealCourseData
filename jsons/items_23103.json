Advanced seminar courses are geared to furnish students with professionally relevant information on important publishing topics. The culminating capstone project requires comprehensive research on a key subject in publishing and the creation of a viable business plan that demonstrates the knowledge and the skills you have acquired throughout your program of study. An optional for-credit internship experience helps you to gain hands-on industry experience and to develop valuable professional contacts.   The program is structured to meet the needs of both working professionals and full-time students, allowing opportunities for either full-time or part-time evening study in any semester. Typically, students complete the degree within two years of full-time study or within two to five years of part-time study.
