The award supports a work of journalism in any medium on significant underreported subjects in the public interest. The Reporting Award's first recipient, Sarah Stillman , returned to Iraq -- and made her first trip to Afghanistan -- to pursue an investigative reporting project on the wars' third-country nationals. The second recipient, Jina Moore , investigated so-called \"vulture funds,\" distressed debt investors who purchase delinquent debt of sovereign nations, many of them poor.   Sarah Stillman's piece, \" The Invisible Army ,\" appeared in the June 6, 2011 issue of The New Yorker. Sarah was a visiting scholar and inaugural recipient in 2010 of the Journalism Institute's Reporting Award. Using funds from the Award, which funds articles on under-reported subjects in the public interest, she reported in Iraq and Afghanistan on the plight of foreign workers on U.S. military bases there.   Subsequent awards have supported reporting on the following topics: Haitian earthquake victims; California farm workers; social services denial of parental rights for the mentally ill; the business of medical data collection; and the effect of coastal zoning and climate change on residents in northern New England.   In establishing the award, the Carter Journalism Institute\u2019s faculty cited the need for encouraging enterprise journalism during a time of extensive layoffs and budget cuts throughout the journalism industry. The American Society of News Editors has reported the loss of 16,200 full-time newspaper editorial jobs from 2003 to 2012, while Ad Age reports the loss of 38,000 magazine positions. These numbers are only partially offset by the growth of about 5,000 jobs at digital news organizations, as reported by the Pew Research Center.   \"The severe reduction in resources has a negative impact on all kinds of reporting, but especially investigative because of the high cost of doing it well,\" said Stephen D. Solomon , associate director of the Institute. \"Support provided by the Reporting Award and other nontraditional sources can help fill in some of the gaps.\"   The Institute will select up to two winners of the Reporting Award. Each winner may receive a different amount of money, at the discretion of the Committee. The maximum award is $12,500. The award is divided into two payments. Each winner will receive an advance of $2,500 on acceptance of the proposal and the signing of the agreement, and is eligible to receive the balance of the agreed-upon award on completion and acceptance of the Work by the November 1, 2015 deadline, provided the Institute\u2019s Awards Committee judges the work acceptable.\u00a0The winner also has use of the Institute\u2019s facilities as well as NYU\u2019s libraries and other scholarly resources. The Institute expects that the completed work will be published in a reputable media outlet of wide circulation.   \u00a0   View the Reporting Award's recipients .

The award supports a work of journalism in any medium on significant underreported subjects in the public interest. The Reporting Award's first recipient, Sarah Stillman , returned to Iraq -- and made her first trip to Afghanistan -- to pursue an investigative reporting project on the wars' third-country nationals. The second recipient, Jina Moore , investigated so-called \"vulture funds,\" distressed debt investors who purchase delinquent debt of sovereign nations, many of them poor.   Sarah Stillman's piece, \" The Invisible Army ,\" appeared in the June 6, 2011 issue of The New Yorker. Sarah was a visiting scholar and inaugural recipient in 2010 of the Journalism Institute's Reporting Award. Using funds from the Award, which funds articles on under-reported subjects in the public interest, she reported in Iraq and Afghanistan on the plight of foreign workers on U.S. military bases there.   Subsequent awards have supported reporting on the following topics: Haitian earthquake victims; California farm workers; social services denial of parental rights for the mentally ill; the business of medical data collection; and the effect of coastal zoning and climate change on residents in northern New England.   In establishing the award, the Carter Journalism Institute\u2019s faculty cited the need for encouraging enterprise journalism during a time of extensive layoffs and budget cuts throughout the journalism industry. The American Society of News Editors has reported the loss of 16,200 full-time newspaper editorial jobs from 2003 to 2012, while Ad Age reports the loss of 38,000 magazine positions. These numbers are only partially offset by the growth of about 5,000 jobs at digital news organizations, as reported by the Pew Research Center.   \"The severe reduction in resources has a negative impact on all kinds of reporting, but especially investigative because of the high cost of doing it well,\" said Stephen D. Solomon , associate director of the Institute. \"Support provided by the Reporting Award and other nontraditional sources can help fill in some of the gaps.\"   The Institute will select up to two winners of the Reporting Award. Each winner may receive a different amount of money, at the discretion of the Committee. The maximum award is $12,500. The award is divided into two payments. Each winner will receive an advance of $2,500 on acceptance of the proposal and the signing of the agreement, and is eligible to receive the balance of the agreed-upon award on completion and acceptance of the Work by the November 1, 2015 deadline, provided the Institute\u2019s Awards Committee judges the work acceptable.\u00a0The winner also has use of the Institute\u2019s facilities as well as NYU\u2019s libraries and other scholarly resources. The Institute expects that the completed work will be published in a reputable media outlet of wide circulation.   \u00a0   View the Reporting Award's recipients .

Aspiring science reporters, authors, editors, producers, videographers, coders and bloggers (and various permutations thereof) who complete the intensive 16-month program receive a Master of Arts degree in Journalism and an Advanced Certificate in Science, Health and Environmental Reporting. They join an extended family of graduates (391 at last count!) committed to covering scientific, medical and environmental topics with precision, nuance and passion.   SHERP alumni have diverse backgrounds and beliefs and work in many types of digital, print and broadcast media in twenty-five countries. What unites them are two deeply held convictions: science is too important to leave only to scientists, and journalism is too important to leave only to the scientifically illiterate.   SHERP 's current students are the newest links in a chain that stretches back to the program's founding in 1982 by Bill Burrows , who retired in 2008 and was succeeded as SHERP director by Dan Fagin , a longtime science and environmental journalist who was awarded the 2014 Pulitzer Prize in General Nonfiction for his book, Toms River: A Story of Science and Salvation .\u00a0   What We Do: A Customized Curriculum, a Hands-On Approach   Humans are a storytelling species, and the scientific enterprise is the wellspring of many of our greatest contemporary narratives. But how many of us possess the skills to make these narratives our profession? SHERP 's customized curriculum is tailored to develop world-class science storytellers at a time of unprecedented change, challenge and opportunity in journalism. Our faculty of nationally prominent science journalists offers rigorous instruction in research, reporting, writing and editing through coverage of cutting-edge science, from nanotechnology and epigenetics to global climate change and cosmology. Coursework is built around case studies and learning by doing, not academic theory or rote memorization.   A key focus is reporting, writing and editing features and news for magazines and online sites , but students also dive into all forms of modern journalism, from books and long-form narratives to blogs , videos , audio podcasts , data visualization \u00a0and social media . Entrepreneurial skills, including self-marketing, are emphasized throughout the SHERP sequence and especially in a new class focusing on developing sound business models for digital science journalism projects. Investigative science journalism is also an important curricular focus, as evidenced by a recent investigation conducted by Professor Charles Seife and his SHERP students into fraudulent drug studies submitted to the Food and Drug Administration. The powerful results of this faculty-student collaboration\u00a0 were published \u00a0in 2015 in JAMA-Internal Medicine and Slate .   Visual journalism is woven into the curriculum from the first semester, when every SHERP student learns to shoot and edit video under the tutelage of an experienced videographer \u00a0who also provides advanced instruction during the second semester. There is also a workshop on data mining, analysis and visualization taught by graphics editors at the Times . We teach audio podcasting, too. The curriculum reflects our philosophy that twenty-first century journalism education should be platform-agnostic : the content of the story should dictate its form, not vice versa. Whether they do most of their work in print or online, our graduates thrive in the fast-changing science journalism landscape because they are comfortable telling stories on mulltiple platforms, in multiple ways.   The culture at SHERP is challenging but never cutthroat. We emphasize cooperative learning in an informal, intellectually rich  environment. SHERP students work hard and love what they do. Thanks to  the specialized curriculum and intimate atmosphere, \"sherpies\" form lifelong bonds during their sixteen months in the program, including eight marriages so far!   Where We Work: NYC, the World Capital of Science Journalism   SHERP takes full advantage of its home base at the center of the science journalism firmament: New York City, where there are more journalism job opportunities than anywhere else in the world. Our neighborhood is a particularly fertile one for science storytelling because\u00a020 Cooper Square is right in the middle of Lower Manhattan's booming Silicon Alley; Facebook and IBM's Jeopardy!-winning Watson computer are one block away.\u00a0A small program nested comfortably in a large research university, SHERP utilizes the vast intellectual resources of New York University, including the NYU School of Medicine, to enrich student experiences.\u00a0We also reach well beyond the university community.\u00a0In addition to two full-time professors with many years of experience in professional science journalism, Dan Fagin and Charles Seife , the program's superb faculty includes current or former editors and writers at Scientific  American , The New York Times , Science , Reuters ,  Nature and The Wall Street Journal , among other outlets. SHERP faculty work at the very highest levels of science journalism but are also deeply committed to the hard work of teaching well, with long track records of success in the classroom as well as the newsroom.     \u00a0        The curriculum also draws heavily on a roster of guest speakers constituting a who's who of science journalism and science research.  In a typical year, nearly one hundred journalists and scientists  visit SHERP to speak in classes or at evening seminars that have become gathering places for the New York science journalism community. There are also yearly field trips to Brookhaven National Laboratory, The New York Times , the American Museum of Natural History and CNN. When SHERP students go on a field trip, they do much more than tour; they pitch stories to editors and participate in seminars with leading researchers.   Science journalism internships at leading publications, programs and web sites are a crucial part of the SHERP experience and are fully integrated into the overall curriculum, not a tacked-on appendage. Every student completes two for-credit internships during the final eight months of the program, but the internship process actually begins much earlier. Starting in the first semester, SHERP's internship coordinator provides personalized support and advice, assisting students in landing positions and then making sure they get the most out of their internship experiences. SHERP interns don't get coffee, except for themselves; they get clips . Many choose to intern at outlets that have worked closely with SHERP for years ; their supervisors are often alumni or current or former faculty. Others take advantage of the flexibility of the our internship program to secure internships at exciting new digital publishing ventures or\u00a0 places \u00a0 a little \u00a0 farther off the beaten track \u00a0for science journalists.     \u00a0   &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;nbsp;   SHERP's popular Inside-Out speaker series features candid conversations with some of the world's most prominent science journalists.   Watch More &gt;   \u00a0   \u00a0        Our Focus: Building Skills and Portfolios   To thrive in today's convergent media environment, science journalists need diverse skills and a broad portfolio of published work. SHERP delivers both. By graduation, a typical SHERP student has written or edited dozens of stories of all lengths and types, produced several video and audio pieces, built data graphics and slide shows and even authored a book proposal -- all prepared in close collaboration with highly accomplished professors who are leaders in science journalism.\u00a0   The stories SHERP students produce for their classes are of such high quality that every year many are published in professional media. In addition, students gain invaluable experience by assigning, reporting, writing and editing stories for Scienceline , an award-winning webzine run entirely by SHERP students. Scienceline's mix of news, features, profiles , blogs , videos , audio podcasts and data visualizations attracts approximately 6,000 visitors per day (more than 2 million per year) from around the world. In addition, Scienceline stories are regularly syndicated to the web sites of Scientific American , Discover , Popular Science , LiveScience.com , Space.com , OnEarth , The Scientist and other outlets , generating even more clips, exposure and opportunities for SHERP students. Finally, SHERP's unrivalled internship program puts students in position to publish their work in places like The New York  Times , NOVA , Wired and dozens of other globally prominent outlets .   Life After SHERP   Job placement is a proven strength of SHERP. Every year, several graduating students go to work full-time at places where they were SHERP interns; other job-seeking graduates tap the close-knit and extensive SHERP alumni network, which operates its own busy email list. Over the years, editors have come to trust the SHERP \"brand,\" so graduates fare very well in the extremely competitive market for staff jobs and freelance work in science journalism.   SHERP alumni regularly return to Cooper Square for evening seminars and other special events , and as guest speakers in classes. They also assist their successors by generously contributing to the Bill Burrows SHERP Scholarship Fund. The tight bonds between current and former students and faculty (both present and past ) are a distinguishing feature of SHERP and a crucial asset for \"SHERPies\" new and old. (Long after they've graduated, SHERPies love to collaborate with each other, whether on serious editor-writer partnerships or this parody video .)   Join Us!

The award supports a work of journalism in any medium on significant underreported subjects in the public interest. The Reporting Award's first recipient, Sarah Stillman , returned to Iraq -- and made her first trip to Afghanistan -- to pursue an investigative reporting project on the wars' third-country nationals. The second recipient, Jina Moore , investigated so-called \"vulture funds,\" distressed debt investors who purchase delinquent debt of sovereign nations, many of them poor.   Sarah Stillman's piece, \" The Invisible Army ,\" appeared in the June 6, 2011 issue of The New Yorker. Sarah was a visiting scholar and inaugural recipient in 2010 of the Journalism Institute's Reporting Award. Using funds from the Award, which funds articles on under-reported subjects in the public interest, she reported in Iraq and Afghanistan on the plight of foreign workers on U.S. military bases there.   Subsequent awards have supported reporting on the following topics: Haitian earthquake victims; California farm workers; social services denial of parental rights for the mentally ill; the business of medical data collection; and the effect of coastal zoning and climate change on residents in northern New England.   In establishing the award, the Carter Journalism Institute\u2019s faculty cited the need for encouraging enterprise journalism during a time of extensive layoffs and budget cuts throughout the journalism industry. The American Society of News Editors has reported the loss of 16,200 full-time newspaper editorial jobs from 2003 to 2012, while Ad Age reports the loss of 38,000 magazine positions. These numbers are only partially offset by the growth of about 5,000 jobs at digital news organizations, as reported by the Pew Research Center.   \"The severe reduction in resources has a negative impact on all kinds of reporting, but especially investigative because of the high cost of doing it well,\" said Stephen D. Solomon , associate director of the Institute. \"Support provided by the Reporting Award and other nontraditional sources can help fill in some of the gaps.\"   The Institute will select up to two winners of the Reporting Award. Each winner may receive a different amount of money, at the discretion of the Committee. The maximum award is $12,500. The award is divided into two payments. Each winner will receive an advance of $2,500 on acceptance of the proposal and the signing of the agreement, and is eligible to receive the balance of the agreed-upon award on completion and acceptance of the Work by the November 1, 2015 deadline, provided the Institute\u2019s Awards Committee judges the work acceptable.\u00a0The winner also has use of the Institute\u2019s facilities as well as NYU\u2019s libraries and other scholarly resources. The Institute expects that the completed work will be published in a reputable media outlet of wide circulation.   \u00a0   View the Reporting Award's recipients .

Aspiring science reporters, authors, editors, producers, videographers, coders and bloggers (and various permutations thereof) who complete the intensive 16-month program receive a Master of Arts degree in Journalism and an Advanced Certificate in Science, Health and Environmental Reporting. They join an extended family of graduates (391 at last count!) committed to covering scientific, medical and environmental topics with precision, nuance and passion.   SHERP alumni have diverse backgrounds and beliefs and work in many types of digital, print and broadcast media in twenty-five countries. What unites them are two deeply held convictions: science is too important to leave only to scientists, and journalism is too important to leave only to the scientifically illiterate.   SHERP 's current students are the newest links in a chain that stretches back to the program's founding in 1982 by Bill Burrows , who retired in 2008 and was succeeded as SHERP director by Dan Fagin , a longtime science and environmental journalist who was awarded the 2014 Pulitzer Prize in General Nonfiction for his book, Toms River: A Story of Science and Salvation .\u00a0   What We Do: A Customized Curriculum, a Hands-On Approach   Humans are a storytelling species, and the scientific enterprise is the wellspring of many of our greatest contemporary narratives. But how many of us possess the skills to make these narratives our profession? SHERP 's customized curriculum is tailored to develop world-class science storytellers at a time of unprecedented change, challenge and opportunity in journalism. Our faculty of nationally prominent science journalists offers rigorous instruction in research, reporting, writing and editing through coverage of cutting-edge science, from nanotechnology and epigenetics to global climate change and cosmology. Coursework is built around case studies and learning by doing, not academic theory or rote memorization.   A key focus is reporting, writing and editing features and news for magazines and online sites , but students also dive into all forms of modern journalism, from books and long-form narratives to blogs , videos , audio podcasts , data visualization \u00a0and social media . Entrepreneurial skills, including self-marketing, are emphasized throughout the SHERP sequence and especially in a new class focusing on developing sound business models for digital science journalism projects. Investigative science journalism is also an important curricular focus, as evidenced by a recent investigation conducted by Professor Charles Seife and his SHERP students into fraudulent drug studies submitted to the Food and Drug Administration. The powerful results of this faculty-student collaboration\u00a0 were published \u00a0in 2015 in JAMA-Internal Medicine and Slate .   Visual journalism is woven into the curriculum from the first semester, when every SHERP student learns to shoot and edit video under the tutelage of an experienced videographer \u00a0who also provides advanced instruction during the second semester. There is also a workshop on data mining, analysis and visualization taught by graphics editors at the Times . We teach audio podcasting, too. The curriculum reflects our philosophy that twenty-first century journalism education should be platform-agnostic : the content of the story should dictate its form, not vice versa. Whether they do most of their work in print or online, our graduates thrive in the fast-changing science journalism landscape because they are comfortable telling stories on mulltiple platforms, in multiple ways.   The culture at SHERP is challenging but never cutthroat. We emphasize cooperative learning in an informal, intellectually rich  environment. SHERP students work hard and love what they do. Thanks to  the specialized curriculum and intimate atmosphere, \"sherpies\" form lifelong bonds during their sixteen months in the program, including eight marriages so far!   Where We Work: NYC, the World Capital of Science Journalism   SHERP takes full advantage of its home base at the center of the science journalism firmament: New York City, where there are more journalism job opportunities than anywhere else in the world. Our neighborhood is a particularly fertile one for science storytelling because\u00a020 Cooper Square is right in the middle of Lower Manhattan's booming Silicon Alley; Facebook and IBM's Jeopardy!-winning Watson computer are one block away.\u00a0A small program nested comfortably in a large research university, SHERP utilizes the vast intellectual resources of New York University, including the NYU School of Medicine, to enrich student experiences.\u00a0We also reach well beyond the university community.\u00a0In addition to two full-time professors with many years of experience in professional science journalism, Dan Fagin and Charles Seife , the program's superb faculty includes current or former editors and writers at Scientific  American , The New York Times , Science , Reuters ,  Nature and The Wall Street Journal , among other outlets. SHERP faculty work at the very highest levels of science journalism but are also deeply committed to the hard work of teaching well, with long track records of success in the classroom as well as the newsroom.     \u00a0        The curriculum also draws heavily on a roster of guest speakers constituting a who's who of science journalism and science research.  In a typical year, nearly one hundred journalists and scientists  visit SHERP to speak in classes or at evening seminars that have become gathering places for the New York science journalism community. There are also yearly field trips to Brookhaven National Laboratory, The New York Times , the American Museum of Natural History and CNN. When SHERP students go on a field trip, they do much more than tour; they pitch stories to editors and participate in seminars with leading researchers.   Science journalism internships at leading publications, programs and web sites are a crucial part of the SHERP experience and are fully integrated into the overall curriculum, not a tacked-on appendage. Every student completes two for-credit internships during the final eight months of the program, but the internship process actually begins much earlier. Starting in the first semester, SHERP's internship coordinator provides personalized support and advice, assisting students in landing positions and then making sure they get the most out of their internship experiences. SHERP interns don't get coffee, except for themselves; they get clips . Many choose to intern at outlets that have worked closely with SHERP for years ; their supervisors are often alumni or current or former faculty. Others take advantage of the flexibility of the our internship program to secure internships at exciting new digital publishing ventures or\u00a0 places \u00a0 a little \u00a0 farther off the beaten track \u00a0for science journalists.     \u00a0   &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;nbsp;   SHERP's popular Inside-Out speaker series features candid conversations with some of the world's most prominent science journalists.   Watch More &gt;   \u00a0   \u00a0        Our Focus: Building Skills and Portfolios   To thrive in today's convergent media environment, science journalists need diverse skills and a broad portfolio of published work. SHERP delivers both. By graduation, a typical SHERP student has written or edited dozens of stories of all lengths and types, produced several video and audio pieces, built data graphics and slide shows and even authored a book proposal -- all prepared in close collaboration with highly accomplished professors who are leaders in science journalism.\u00a0   The stories SHERP students produce for their classes are of such high quality that every year many are published in professional media. In addition, students gain invaluable experience by assigning, reporting, writing and editing stories for Scienceline , an award-winning webzine run entirely by SHERP students. Scienceline's mix of news, features, profiles , blogs , videos , audio podcasts and data visualizations attracts approximately 6,000 visitors per day (more than 2 million per year) from around the world. In addition, Scienceline stories are regularly syndicated to the web sites of Scientific American , Discover , Popular Science , LiveScience.com , Space.com , OnEarth , The Scientist and other outlets , generating even more clips, exposure and opportunities for SHERP students. Finally, SHERP's unrivalled internship program puts students in position to publish their work in places like The New York  Times , NOVA , Wired and dozens of other globally prominent outlets .   Life After SHERP   Job placement is a proven strength of SHERP. Every year, several graduating students go to work full-time at places where they were SHERP interns; other job-seeking graduates tap the close-knit and extensive SHERP alumni network, which operates its own busy email list. Over the years, editors have come to trust the SHERP \"brand,\" so graduates fare very well in the extremely competitive market for staff jobs and freelance work in science journalism.   SHERP alumni regularly return to Cooper Square for evening seminars and other special events , and as guest speakers in classes. They also assist their successors by generously contributing to the Bill Burrows SHERP Scholarship Fund. The tight bonds between current and former students and faculty (both present and past ) are a distinguishing feature of SHERP and a crucial asset for \"SHERPies\" new and old. (Long after they've graduated, SHERPies love to collaborate with each other, whether on serious editor-writer partnerships or this parody video .)   Join Us!

          Do you want to write about some of the most important stories in the world today?   Entrepreneurs starting hot new companies?   The introduction of the iPhone 6?   Diminished opportunities for millennials?   The economic rise of China?   The lagging economic performance in the European Union?   Come study in the Business and Economic Reporting program and start your career in the hottest area of journalism. Our graduates have gone on to jobs at places like The Wall Street Journal, Bloomberg, Reuters, Forbes, Dow Jones Newswires, CNN, CNBC , and many other top news organizations.   Our Graduates' Jobs &gt;         Cover the World's Most Interesting Stories   Go into business journalism and write stories the whole world will read. And they will extend far beyond Wall Street coverage and daily business reporting.   Interested in the nation's ongoing economic problems? Cover them while a student in the BER program. Our students write and produce for The Local East Village , the joint New York Times and Carter Institute news website. Also, see our own student publication, The Recovery Times .   That iPod or iPhone in your pocket? Obvious business story.   Interested in new media and Hollywood? You'll find endless stories to pursue in the entertainment industry, from the impact of digital technology on the movie business to the battle between copyright holders and video portals like YouTube.   Fascinated by the personalities of the people in power? Why not profile Rupert Murdoch or Bill Gates \u2014 or be the first to report on a rising fashion guru or a Silicon Valley whiz kid who thinks she's got the next MySpace.   Concerned about global warming and environmental issues? Take an assignment on hybrid cars, visit companies that are going green, and analyze the struggle between business and government as they battle over grizzly bears, salmon runs and oil drilling in pristine nature preserves.   Like to travel? Business news organizations send their writers on reporting trips all over the U.S. and abroad. Maybe you'll report in China for a week, as one of our alums did a year out of school (he couldn't speak the language, but that didn't stop him from writing a cover story on his trip for Forbes magazine).   To be a great reporter, no matter what you end up covering, you have to be able to follow the money. And that's what you will learn to do in the Business and Economic Reporting (BER) program at New York University.         Great Jobs Right out of School   Virtually all BER students have secured staff jobs at national business news organizations within a few months of graduating. Many of them started the program without any journalism experience. Starting salaries have ranged from the low $40's to the mid-$70's, compared to the $28,000* average starting pay for journalism graduates nationwide going into newspaper jobs. Where do our students get jobs? The Wall Street Journal , Dow Jones Newswires, Reuters, Bloomberg News, Forbes , Inc. , TheStreet.com, Money , CNBC, and numerous others. Many of them secured foreign postings in places such as Beijing, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Nepal, Vietnam, India, Singapore, Russia, and Canada.           Your Competitive Advantage   What do you have to offer when you graduate? What's your competitive advantage when your resume hits the desk of a key editor? Thousands of journalism students are trained in general assignment reporting and there usually isn't much to distinguish among them. In BER, however, students benefit from a unique interdisciplinary curriculum of both journalism courses and MBA courses at NYU 's prestigious Leonard N. Stern School of Business. The result: an education that sets you apart from your peers because you will have intellectual depth in a subject matter that is critical to news coverage today, whether on page one or the business section.           Mentoring Relationships in a Small Program   In BER, students don't get lost among hundreds of others as happens at other schools. Instead, we have a 5:1 student-to-faculty ratio,\u00a0 with BER enrolling just twelve to fifteen students each fall. A faculty of two full-time professors and an internship director/career counselor work with the students throughout their sixteen months at NYU, resulting in close mentoring relationships. The BER program also has two visiting scholars who will help mentor students: Leigh Gallagher, assistant managing editor of Fortune magazine; and Bethany McLean, a contributing editor at Vanity Fair and co-author of Smartest Guys in the Room: The Amazing Rise and Scandalous Fall of Enron , and All the Devils are Here: The Hidden History of the Financial Crisis .         \u00a0       BER Students Headed to London in May 2015!

Solomon, director of the program in Business and Economic Reporting, as the Marjorie Dean Professor of Financial Journalism . The professorship is made possible by generous contribution by the Marjorie Deane Financial Journalism Foundation.   The Foundation's support makes possible the following new benefits for students of the program:   Marjorie Deane Fellowships : The program will award fellowships to several excellent students accepted into the BER program for Fall 2014. Each fellowship will provide tuition, registration fees, and a stipend for one semester (or possibly more) of study. The admissions committee will notify an applicant of his or her selection at the time of acceptance into the BER program.   Study in London for a Week :\u00a0 Beginning in May 2014, The BER program will take its students each year to City University London for a week to study the financial systems of the United Kingdom and the European Union. The London program will deepen each student's understanding of international aspects of business and finance. The program will provide partial subsidies of travel expenses. The educational seminars themselves are provided without charge.   See NYU's Announcement &gt;           Visiting Scholar in the BER Program   The program welcomes Rebecca Blumenstein, deputy managing editor of The Wall Street Journal , as a Visiting Scholar. In addition to regular faculty, visiting scholars provide assistance to our students. Previously, Rebecca served as WSJ's China Bureau Chief, Page One editor, and managing editor of The Wall Street Journal Online.   Read her full bio &gt;       Lecture by Former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker   Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker delivered BER's first annual Marjorie Deane Lecture on April 23. BER students met privately with Mr. Volcker to talk about the recovery from the financial crisis and coverage by the business press. Later, there was a conversation and dinner attended by students, faculty, and financial journalists.   Read More &gt;       Other Reasons to Study in BER   Curriculum : An innovative curriculum of seven journalism courses and six MBA courses provides students with both skills and intellectual depth.   Internships : Students take a full-time job at a major news organization for ten weeks over the summer (not for one or two days a week during a regular semester, as at other schools). Many BER students have received job offers from their internship.   Bylines : Students develop an extensive portfolio while in BER, pick up multimedia skills in web video and audio podcast, learn to blog and post their own stories on the BER webzine.   Networking in New York City: Why not study in the business and financial capital of the country, where a quick subway ride leads you to reporting assignments as well as to job interviews and great internships at the top news organizations in the world? And BER has a regular speakers program that enables students to network with the top journalists in the field, including editors and reporters from The Wall Street Journal , Forbes , Wired , Vanity Fair , Marketwatch, Reuters, TheStreet.com, and many others.
