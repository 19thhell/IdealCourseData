Brief Description:  Search engines have become a core part of our daily lives. In this course, we will study the foundations of information retrieval and the technical aspects of modern Web search engines. We will also explore advanced/special topics that have emerged to become highly influential in relation to Web search.   You are expected to study the course material (textbook and research papers), participate in class discussion, and work on a class project that involves system design and implementation.
