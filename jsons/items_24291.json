It surveys the technical development of the telephone, from its roots in telegraphy to radio and portable phones to mobile computing. We will trace the history of &ldquo;telephonic principles&rdquo; such as interaction and universality, and telephony in various social contexts: national and transnational telephone cultures; genres of text messaging; the relationship of communication technology to public, private, and virtual space; and the appropriation of the medium for the purposes of art and activism.

We will trace the history of &ldquo;telephonic principles&rdquo; such as interaction and universality, and telephony in various social contexts: national and transnational telephone cultures; genres of text messaging; the relationship of communication technology to public, private, and virtual space; and the appropriation of the medium for the purposes of art and activism.
