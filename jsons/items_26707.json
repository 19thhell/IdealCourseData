In recent years Britain has undergone striking changes in its social makeup, political outlook and cultural activities. Rapid change also brings tensions around housing, the National Health Service and education all of which are increasingly facing pressures from immigration, larger numbers of unemployed and the economic squeeze. The most recent census suggested Polish was the second is spoken language in Britain. So what is happening and why and how does it affect you as a visiting student?    Global Orientation: British Culture is intended to introduce students to ideas formed by global and local issues and focus on concerns regarding politics, the media, migration, the free market, foreign policy, cultural homogeneity and democracy that are the keys to modern British national identity.  The course in based around a series of lectures and talks by prominent speakers from British politics, culture, economics and the arts, and incorporates various optional excursions into London to see some of what is being talked about in action.

This 15 week course will take an in-depth yet wide-ranging look at an important but curiously neglected aspect of modern western visual culture. Within a broadly chronological structure, topics to be dealt with will include the following: the relationship between art and atrocity, and the attendant problem of the aestheticisation of horror; the crucial influence of photography and the growth of mass communications; the issue of censorship, both external and internal, and the related issue of the &quot;limits of representation&quot; (above all, in relation to the Holocaust and Hiroshima); the distinction between official and unofficial war art, and between art and propaganda, between art that endorses and even glorifies war and an art of protest; issues of gender and sexuality; questions of cultural memory and the memorialization process, and the representation of war in contemporary art practice.   It will consist of a combination of informal lectures, student presentations, at least one gallery visit, and the occasional film showing.     Sample Syllabus                                                                    British Art in London - ARTH-UA 9011 - 4 points                               Students in the NYU Art History Dept: This course counts for Art History elective credit.   A survey of British painting, sculpture and architecture of the 17th through 20th centuries. Museums, galleries, churches, palaces and stately homes in and around London will be visited to examine and critique major works.     Sample Syllabus                                                                Contemporary Art in Britain - ARTH-UA 9675 - 4 points                                Students in the NYU Art History Dept: This course counts for Art History elective credit.   Contemporary art raises vigorous debate and criticism. But what is contemporary about contemporary art? This course introduces you to some of the key issues in dealing critically with contemporary art with a focus on work on display in exhibitions in London, both major national collections and private galleries. The course explores art produced since the late 1950s through case studies of the work of individual artists and through themes which include photography; representations of the body; gallery display; migration, visual imagery of political issues, video practice and installation art. Among other things we consider how contemporary art came to look as it does [with a focus on British art]; the different forms of material and presentation artists have employed; why and how diverse audiences are addressed; how markets, national prizes and private collections shape the kinds of art produced and inform public taste. We also look at the collection and display of contemporary art, on a private and a public scale; dealer galleries and issues of curation.   Sample Syllabus                                                                  Designing Britain - ARTH-UA 9650 - 4 points                                Students in the NYU Art History Dept: This course counts for Urban Design credit or Art History elective credit.   British designers are playing an increasingly important part on the world stage. This course examines changing attitudes to design in Britain: from the eighteenth century, when it played a central role in the modernisation of the country, to the Millennium and beyond, when it is being called upon to rekindle some lost glory. We will ask whether there are features about British design over the last 250 years which are distinctively British; and to what extent British designers have been informed by developments in the rest of the world.   Design now seems all-encompassing, and this very fact also raises broader questions. Have we overvalued this work of the mind over more traditional hand-skills? Are we becoming cynical in the face of endless &quot;rebrandings&quot; (which includes the rebranding of cities and whole countries)? Does design necessarily falsify, or paper over the cracks? And is it good for the planet?   The course format consists of Lectures and Visits to museums, London sites etc.   Sample Syllabus                                                                    Renaissance Art in London - ARTH-UA 9350 - 4 points                                Students in the NYU Art History Dept: This course counts for Art History elective credit.   London has some of the richest collections of renaissance art in the world. Students in this course will be brought into direct contact with a large variety of artefacts to be found in museums and galleries such as the National Gallery, the National Portrait Gallery, the Victoria and Albert Museum, the British Museum as well as the British Library. Works by Van Eyck, Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo, Raphael, Durer and Holbein will be examined alongside those of less well-known artists. Rather than provide a standard chronological narrative of European Art History c. 1400- c. 1600, focus will be placed on subject areas such as the altarpiece and the private devotional image, the renaissance portrait, graphic practices, print culture, the materials and functions of sculpture, myth and allegory, the cabinet of curiosities, the concept of the 'Renaissance' itself. These topics will not be organised around traditional national or regional 'schools' considered in isolation from one another but instead interconnections will be explored between the development of different types, technical processes and cultural practices across the Netherlands, France, Germany and Italy. A special case will be made of the English Renaissance, in order to place it within the wider European context through additional visits to Westminster Abbey and Hampton Court.   Sample Syllabus                                                                Seeing London's Architecture - ARTH-UA 9674 or SASEM-UG 9250 - 4 points                               Students in the NYU Art History Dept: This course counts for Architecture and Urban Design credit only.   London, like New York, is a rich and complicated city. Unlike New York however, it has been continuously occupied for just less than 2000 years. Almost every epoch of London\u2019s history can be detected in the city\u2019s architecture and distinctive streetscape.   This course is designed to work in three ways. Firstly it is an opportunity to learn about London\u2019s architecture and art by physically exploring it. Secondly, this class is an introduction to sketching and keeping a travel notebook, a basic and useful skill that any liberal arts student should have an experience of. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, this course teaches how to 'read' a town or city. The ability to visually make sense of a European-built environment should really help in understanding the architecture of New York City and, of course, towns and cities throughout the United States and anywhere else.   Sample Syllabus                          Biology                                                    Principles of Biology II - BIOL-UA 9012 - 4 points (Lecture & Recitation)                                Prerequisite: High school chemistry and BIOL-UA 11, Principles of Biology I or equivalent   Students registering for this course must register for the Lecture &amp; Recitation.

Sample Syllabus                                                                Principles of Biology Lab - BIOL-UA 9123 - 1 point (Laboratory)                               Note: Biology majors are not required to register for this lab course. All other students should consult with their advisor to determine if the lab is a requirement of their program of study.     Laboratory exercises illustrate the basics of experimental biology, molecular biology, and biochemistry as well as the diversity of life forms and organ systems.                                                                    Where the City Meets the Sea: Studies in Coastal Urban Environments - BIOL-UA 9140 or ENVST-UA 9275 - 4 points                               Over half of the human population lives within 100 km of a coast and coastlines contain more than two-thirds of the world\u2019s largest cities. As a result, the world\u2019s natural coastal environments have been substantially modified to suit human needs. This course will use the built and natural environments of coastal cities as laboratories to examine the environmental and cological implications of urban development in coastal areas. Using data from multiple coastal cities, student teams will use field-based studies and Geographic Information System (GIS) data to examine patterns and processes operating in coastal cities. This course uses the local terrestrial, marine, and built environments as a laboratory to address these issues, and team projects requiring field work form a core component of the learning experience. As part of the Global Network University initiative this course will be offered simultaneously in multiple locations and students will collaborate with their counterparts on other campuses.

The class focuses on the nature of financial management from a number of perspectives including the national, the corporate and the individual, but particularly the corporate. You will become familiar with the financial system, including that relating to banking, though there will be little overlap with courses that deal with the functioning of financial markets. The importance of behavioural finance will also be stressed during the course.   Sample Syllabus                                                                International Political Economy - BPEP-UB 9011 - 4 points                               The course is informed by the significant transformation the world economy is currently undergoing, paying particular attention to the evolving dynamics of international trade and the global distribution of power within a longer-term historical perspective. The result is a course strongly geared towards providing students with an understanding of contemporary international economic and political trends, issues and events alongside the requisite analytical skills to evaluate current economic and political policies.   This course is divided into two sections. The first section focuses on the political economy of international trade. It will examine the role of labour, land and capital in determining what is traded, by whom and for what purpose. The second section examines the key global issues in 21st century political economy. It will focus on cultural transformation in an age of globalization, the economic rise of Asia, the political economy of militant Islam and, most saliently, the future of Western hegemony in light of the global economic crisis.

Britain is a multi-national state, a union of 4 nations, each with their own distinctive culture and heritage. Three of the nations, Wales, Scotland and Ireland, have been brought under the English monarchy and political system, and, in the case of the first two, they have been long-term partners in the benefits accruing to the largest empire the world has seen, and the first and (for a long time) the most successful industrial nation. The height of that unity was probably in the period of the Second World War and its aftermath. Since then, with the collapse of the British Empire, Britain\u2019s membership of the European Union, and the devolution of power to Scotland and Wales, the union has come under increasing pressure from centrifugal forces. The course examines the image that Britain presents to the world, the myths on which the national identity of the component nations were formed and the institutions that might be considered to hold the union together today. This involves looking at the self-image of Britain in relation to empire, foreign policy, immigration and multiculturalism, monarchy, parliament, sport and media representations. British national identity is revealed as an increasingly contested concept in a globalised world.

The Gothic flourished especially in the nineteenth century, creating a whole vocabulary of new creatures and landscapes and two of the great books of the genre: Frankenstein and Dracula . This course concentrates on the great works of Gothic which are central to an understanding of literature, film, early Romanticism and popular culture. Specialising on the works of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries we will also explore how those texts were reinvented for film and what new elements were added in the twentieth century. Using a selection of texts and using a variety of approaches from the historical to the post modern and the feminist to queer theory we will explore the multifarious levels of meaning in Gothic texts as well as looking at narrative strategies and a variety of themes including the political and revolutionary, the erotic and the exotic, the Promethian and the undead, the role of religion, the role of women, the Wandering Jew and the 'mock' medieval.

We shall be concerned not only with topics of place and setting, but also with issues of individual and national identity, as well as with forms of verse, drama, and fictional narratives. We shall be seeing a performance of Marlowe\u2019s Dr Faustus at Shakespeare\u2019s Globe, witnessing justice in action in a London court, as well as visiting the houses of Dr Johnson and Charles Dickens, Tate Britain, and viewing screen versions of a couple of our chosen novels.

The course introduces students to some of the key texts of British cultural and educational policy in India. It also gives students the opportunity to examine a major ethnographic text. The course will then grapple with a cross-section of colonial and postcolonial literary representations of India. The focus here will be on issues of identity and strategies of narrative in colonialist and nationalist texts. The course concludes with an overall view of postcolonial studies as it relates to India and some suggestions as to its future developments.

Writing London - ENGL-UA 9182 - 4 points                               This course will study a variety of texts written at particular times in the history of London. The aims of the course are to encourage student to think historically, in terms of the way London and representations of the city have changed and developed over time; and theoretically, in terms of the way the city is mediated through different forms and genres (e.g. poetry, novels, essays, film). We will also examine the texts in relation to issues such as gender, the definition of the modern metropolis as a labyrinthine city of Babylon, the influence of metropolitan culture on Modernism and Modernity, assimilation versus multiculturalism, immigration, and the effects of new modern spaces on individuals.   Sample Syllabus                          Environmental Studies                                                    Where the City Meets the Sea: Studies in Coastal Urban Environments - BIOL-UA 9140 or ENVST-UA 9275 - 4 points                               Over half of the human population lives within 100 km of a coast and coastlines contain more than two-thirds of the world\u2019s largest cities. As a result, the world\u2019s natural coastal environments have been substantially modified to suit human needs. This course will use the built and natural environments of coastal cities as laboratories to examine the environmental and cological implications of urban development in coastal areas. Using data from multiple coastal cities, student teams will use field-based studies and Geographic Information System (GIS) data to examine patterns and processes operating in coastal cities. This course uses the local terrestrial, marine, and built environments as a laboratory to address these issues, and team projects requiring field work form a core component of the learning experience. As part of the Global Network University initiative this course will be offered simultaneously in multiple locations and students will collaborate with their counterparts on other campuses.

This 15 week course will take an in-depth yet wide-ranging look at an important but curiously neglected aspect of modern western visual culture. Within a broadly chronological structure, topics to be dealt with will include the following: the relationship between art and atrocity, and the attendant problem of the aestheticisation of horror; the crucial influence of photography and the growth of mass communications; the issue of censorship, both external and internal, and the related issue of the &quot;limits of representation&quot; (above all, in relation to the Holocaust and Hiroshima); the distinction between official and unofficial war art, and between art and propaganda, between art that endorses and even glorifies war and an art of protest; issues of gender and sexuality; questions of cultural memory and the memorialization process, and the representation of war in contemporary art practice.   It will consist of a combination of informal lectures, student presentations, at least one gallery visit, and the occasional film showing.     Sample Syllabus                                                                Fashion's Fictions: The Texts of Clothing - IDSEM-UG 9253 - 4 points                                Please note that students accepted to the Gallatin Fashion in London Program will be given registration priority for this course.   The topic of clothing and adornment embraces a broad spectrum, from the need for protective covering to the desire for individual expression to the profit goal of international industries. Clothing epitomizes the way a fundamental necessity has been transformed by cultural construction---as well as desire and creativity---into a complex social indicator, a matrix of culture, class, gender identity and aesthetics. This course looks at the ways clothing and fashion are used by story tellers, in print and on film, from the ancient world to the modern as indicators of civilization, individuality, sensuality, polymorphous gender, guilt, and conspicuous consumption. In order to establish a critical grid and vocabulary with which to discuss fiction\u2019s use of clothing/fashion our sources will also include readings in cultural studies, art, sociology, economics, fashion theory, and semiotics.

This interdisciplinary seminar serves as a broad overview for several centuries of British male and female fashion trends, from roughly the Tudor period to today. The course focuses on ways that modes and standards of dress evolved in response to political, economic and technological developments; empire and immigration; changing gender and class formations; and the vagaries of popular culture. In short, the course examines not only what people wore at different historical moments, but why they wore what they did, and how they felt about it. Readings come from the fields of literature, history, art history, gender studies, and sociology.

London, like New York, is a rich and complicated city. Unlike New York however, it has been continuously occupied for just less than 2000 years. Almost every epoch of London\u2019s history can be detected in the city\u2019s architecture and distinctive streetscape.   This course is designed to work in three ways. Firstly it is an opportunity to learn about London\u2019s architecture and art by physically exploring it. Secondly, this class is an introduction to sketching and keeping a travel notebook, a basic and useful skill that any liberal arts student should have an experience of. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, this course teaches how to 'read' a town or city. The ability to visually make sense of a European-built environment should really help in understanding the architecture of New York City and, of course, towns and cities throughout the United States and anywhere else.

Students will learn about London's changing economic and political role, and will understand how London grew to dominate the commerce, industry and culture of England. They will find out how London became the biggest city the world has ever known, and how it coped (or failed to cope) with the social and environmental problems created by its enormous size. Each week (unless there is a field trip) there will be a lecture and a discussion in which you will be able to present ideas and information gathered from lectures and from your weekly reading. There will also be four walking tours of parts of London which relate to the period we are studying at a particular time.

Using the cultural life of London as its focus, this course aims to enable students to report on the diversity of cultural and artistic activity in the British capital across the spectrum, with an inevitable focus on theatre and live performance (classical music/opera, classical and contemporary dance) given the professor's own ongoing career as a theatre critic; other art forms, including art, television, and film, are considered, as well, depending on what is on in the capital at any given time. Numerous forms and techniques will be explored through la mixture of lecture, discussion, and student presentations, and students will be required to follow the work of several critics throughout the term even as they develop their own critical voice and methodology. At every turn, the course aims to wed the specific cultural goings-on in London during the semester to the methods and practice necessary to respond to and evaluate the work on offer.

In recent years Britain has undergone striking changes in its social makeup, political outlook and cultural activities. Rapid change also brings tensions around housing, the National Health Service and education all of which are increasingly facing pressures from immigration, larger numbers of unemployed and the economic squeeze. The most recent census suggested Polish was the second is spoken language in Britain. So what is happening and why and how does it affect you as a visiting student?    Global Orientation: British Culture is intended to introduce students to ideas formed by global and local issues and focus on concerns regarding politics, the media, migration, the free market, foreign policy, cultural homogeneity and democracy that are the keys to modern British national identity.  The course in based around a series of lectures and talks by prominent speakers from British politics, culture, economics and the arts, and incorporates various optional excursions into London to see some of what is being talked about in action.

This 15 week course will take an in-depth yet wide-ranging look at an important but curiously neglected aspect of modern western visual culture. Within a broadly chronological structure, topics to be dealt with will include the following: the relationship between art and atrocity, and the attendant problem of the aestheticisation of horror; the crucial influence of photography and the growth of mass communications; the issue of censorship, both external and internal, and the related issue of the &quot;limits of representation&quot; (above all, in relation to the Holocaust and Hiroshima); the distinction between official and unofficial war art, and between art and propaganda, between art that endorses and even glorifies war and an art of protest; issues of gender and sexuality; questions of cultural memory and the memorialization process, and the representation of war in contemporary art practice.   It will consist of a combination of informal lectures, student presentations, at least one gallery visit, and the occasional film showing.     Sample Syllabus                                                                    British Art in London - ARTH-UA 9011 - 4 points                               Students in the NYU Art History Dept: This course counts for Art History elective credit.   A survey of British painting, sculpture and architecture of the 17th through 20th centuries.

Sample Syllabus                                                                Contemporary Art in Britain - ARTH-UA 9675 - 4 points                                Students in the NYU Art History Dept: This course counts for Art History elective credit.   Contemporary art raises vigorous debate and criticism. But what is contemporary about contemporary art? This course introduces you to some of the key issues in dealing critically with contemporary art with a focus on work on display in exhibitions in London, both major national collections and private galleries. The course explores art produced since the late 1950s through case studies of the work of individual artists and through themes which include photography; representations of the body; gallery display; migration, visual imagery of political issues, video practice and installation art. Among other things we consider how contemporary art came to look as it does [with a focus on British art]; the different forms of material and presentation artists have employed; why and how diverse audiences are addressed; how markets, national prizes and private collections shape the kinds of art produced and inform public taste. We also look at the collection and display of contemporary art, on a private and a public scale; dealer galleries and issues of curation.   Sample Syllabus                                                                  Designing Britain - ARTH-UA 9650 - 4 points                                Students in the NYU Art History Dept: This course counts for Urban Design credit or Art History elective credit.   British designers are playing an increasingly important part on the world stage. This course examines changing attitudes to design in Britain: from the eighteenth century, when it played a central role in the modernisation of the country, to the Millennium and beyond, when it is being called upon to rekindle some lost glory. We will ask whether there are features about British design over the last 250 years which are distinctively British; and to what extent British designers have been informed by developments in the rest of the world.   Design now seems all-encompassing, and this very fact also raises broader questions. Have we overvalued this work of the mind over more traditional hand-skills? Are we becoming cynical in the face of endless &quot;rebrandings&quot; (which includes the rebranding of cities and whole countries)? Does design necessarily falsify, or paper over the cracks? And is it good for the planet?   The course format consists of Lectures and Visits to museums, London sites etc.   Sample Syllabus                                                                    Renaissance Art in London - ARTH-UA 9350 - 4 points                                Students in the NYU Art History Dept: This course counts for Art History elective credit.   London has some of the richest collections of renaissance art in the world. Students in this course will be brought into direct contact with a large variety of artefacts to be found in museums and galleries such as the National Gallery, the National Portrait Gallery, the Victoria and Albert Museum, the British Museum as well as the British Library. Works by Van Eyck, Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo, Raphael, Durer and Holbein will be examined alongside those of less well-known artists. Rather than provide a standard chronological narrative of European Art History c. 1400- c. 1600, focus will be placed on subject areas such as the altarpiece and the private devotional image, the renaissance portrait, graphic practices, print culture, the materials and functions of sculpture, myth and allegory, the cabinet of curiosities, the concept of the 'Renaissance' itself. These topics will not be organised around traditional national or regional 'schools' considered in isolation from one another but instead interconnections will be explored between the development of different types, technical processes and cultural practices across the Netherlands, France, Germany and Italy. A special case will be made of the English Renaissance, in order to place it within the wider European context through additional visits to Westminster Abbey and Hampton Court.   Sample Syllabus                                                                Seeing London's Architecture - ARTH-UA 9674 or SASEM-UG 9250 - 4 points                               Students in the NYU Art History Dept: This course counts for Architecture and Urban Design credit only.   London, like New York, is a rich and complicated city. Unlike New York however, it has been continuously occupied for just less than 2000 years. Almost every epoch of London\u2019s history can be detected in the city\u2019s architecture and distinctive streetscape.   This course is designed to work in three ways. Firstly it is an opportunity to learn about London\u2019s architecture and art by physically exploring it. Secondly, this class is an introduction to sketching and keeping a travel notebook, a basic and useful skill that any liberal arts student should have an experience of. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, this course teaches how to 'read' a town or city. The ability to visually make sense of a European-built environment should really help in understanding the architecture of New York City and, of course, towns and cities throughout the United States and anywhere else.   Sample Syllabus                          Biology                                                    Principles of Biology II - BIOL-UA 9012 - 4 points (Lecture & Recitation)                                Prerequisite: High school chemistry and BIOL-UA 11, Principles of Biology I or equivalent   Students registering for this course must register for the Lecture &amp; Recitation.

Sample Syllabus                                                                Principles of Biology Lab - BIOL-UA 9123 - 1 point (Laboratory)                               Note: Biology majors are not required to register for this lab course. All other students should consult with their advisor to determine if the lab is a requirement of their program of study.     Laboratory exercises illustrate the basics of experimental biology, molecular biology, and biochemistry as well as the diversity of life forms and organ systems.                                                                    Where the City Meets the Sea: Studies in Coastal Urban Environments - BIOL-UA 9140 or ENVST-UA 9275 - 4 points                               Over half of the human population lives within 100 km of a coast and coastlines contain more than two-thirds of the world\u2019s largest cities. As a result, the world\u2019s natural coastal environments have been substantially modified to suit human needs. This course will use the built and natural environments of coastal cities as laboratories to examine the environmental and cological implications of urban development in coastal areas. Using data from multiple coastal cities, student teams will use field-based studies and Geographic Information System (GIS) data to examine patterns and processes operating in coastal cities. This course uses the local terrestrial, marine, and built environments as a laboratory to address these issues, and team projects requiring field work form a core component of the learning experience. As part of the Global Network University initiative this course will be offered simultaneously in multiple locations and students will collaborate with their counterparts on other campuses.

The class focuses on the nature of financial management from a number of perspectives including the national, the corporate and the individual, but particularly the corporate. You will become familiar with the financial system, including that relating to banking, though there will be little overlap with courses that deal with the functioning of financial markets. The importance of behavioural finance will also be stressed during the course.   Sample Syllabus                                                                International Political Economy - BPEP-UB 9011 - 4 points                               The course is informed by the significant transformation the world economy is currently undergoing, paying particular attention to the evolving dynamics of international trade and the global distribution of power within a longer-term historical perspective. The result is a course strongly geared towards providing students with an understanding of contemporary international economic and political trends, issues and events alongside the requisite analytical skills to evaluate current economic and political policies.   This course is divided into two sections. The first section focuses on the political economy of international trade. It will examine the role of labour, land and capital in determining what is traded, by whom and for what purpose. The second section examines the key global issues in 21st century political economy. It will focus on cultural transformation in an age of globalization, the economic rise of Asia, the political economy of militant Islam and, most saliently, the future of Western hegemony in light of the global economic crisis.

Britain is a multi-national state, a union of 4 nations, each with their own distinctive culture and heritage. Three of the nations, Wales, Scotland and Ireland, have been brought under the English monarchy and political system, and, in the case of the first two, they have been long-term partners in the benefits accruing to the largest empire the world has seen, and the first and (for a long time) the most successful industrial nation. The height of that unity was probably in the period of the Second World War and its aftermath. Since then, with the collapse of the British Empire, Britain\u2019s membership of the European Union, and the devolution of power to Scotland and Wales, the union has come under increasing pressure from centrifugal forces. The course examines the image that Britain presents to the world, the myths on which the national identity of the component nations were formed and the institutions that might be considered to hold the union together today. This involves looking at the self-image of Britain in relation to empire, foreign policy, immigration and multiculturalism, monarchy, parliament, sport and media representations. British national identity is revealed as an increasingly contested concept in a globalised world.

The Gothic flourished especially in the nineteenth century, creating a whole vocabulary of new creatures and landscapes and two of the great books of the genre: Frankenstein and Dracula . This course concentrates on the great works of Gothic which are central to an understanding of literature, film, early Romanticism and popular culture. Specialising on the works of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries we will also explore how those texts were reinvented for film and what new elements were added in the twentieth century. Using a selection of texts and using a variety of approaches from the historical to the post modern and the feminist to queer theory we will explore the multifarious levels of meaning in Gothic texts as well as looking at narrative strategies and a variety of themes including the political and revolutionary, the erotic and the exotic, the Promethian and the undead, the role of religion, the role of women, the Wandering Jew and the 'mock' medieval.

We shall be concerned not only with topics of place and setting, but also with issues of individual and national identity, as well as with forms of verse, drama, and fictional narratives. We shall be seeing a performance of Marlowe\u2019s Dr Faustus at Shakespeare\u2019s Globe, witnessing justice in action in a London court, as well as visiting the houses of Dr Johnson and Charles Dickens, Tate Britain, and viewing screen versions of a couple of our chosen novels.

The course introduces students to some of the key texts of British cultural and educational policy in India. It also gives students the opportunity to examine a major ethnographic text. The course will then grapple with a cross-section of colonial and postcolonial literary representations of India. The focus here will be on issues of identity and strategies of narrative in colonialist and nationalist texts. The course concludes with an overall view of postcolonial studies as it relates to India and some suggestions as to its future developments.

Writing London - ENGL-UA 9182 - 4 points                               This course will study a variety of texts written at particular times in the history of London. The aims of the course are to encourage student to think historically, in terms of the way London and representations of the city have changed and developed over time; and theoretically, in terms of the way the city is mediated through different forms and genres (e.g. poetry, novels, essays, film). We will also examine the texts in relation to issues such as gender, the definition of the modern metropolis as a labyrinthine city of Babylon, the influence of metropolitan culture on Modernism and Modernity, assimilation versus multiculturalism, immigration, and the effects of new modern spaces on individuals.   Sample Syllabus                          Environmental Studies                                                    Where the City Meets the Sea: Studies in Coastal Urban Environments - BIOL-UA 9140 or ENVST-UA 9275 - 4 points                               Over half of the human population lives within 100 km of a coast and coastlines contain more than two-thirds of the world\u2019s largest cities. As a result, the world\u2019s natural coastal environments have been substantially modified to suit human needs. This course will use the built and natural environments of coastal cities as laboratories to examine the environmental and cological implications of urban development in coastal areas. Using data from multiple coastal cities, student teams will use field-based studies and Geographic Information System (GIS) data to examine patterns and processes operating in coastal cities. This course uses the local terrestrial, marine, and built environments as a laboratory to address these issues, and team projects requiring field work form a core component of the learning experience. As part of the Global Network University initiative this course will be offered simultaneously in multiple locations and students will collaborate with their counterparts on other campuses.

This 15 week course will take an in-depth yet wide-ranging look at an important but curiously neglected aspect of modern western visual culture. Within a broadly chronological structure, topics to be dealt with will include the following: the relationship between art and atrocity, and the attendant problem of the aestheticisation of horror; the crucial influence of photography and the growth of mass communications; the issue of censorship, both external and internal, and the related issue of the &quot;limits of representation&quot; (above all, in relation to the Holocaust and Hiroshima); the distinction between official and unofficial war art, and between art and propaganda, between art that endorses and even glorifies war and an art of protest; issues of gender and sexuality; questions of cultural memory and the memorialization process, and the representation of war in contemporary art practice.   It will consist of a combination of informal lectures, student presentations, at least one gallery visit, and the occasional film showing.     Sample Syllabus                                                                Fashion's Fictions: The Texts of Clothing - IDSEM-UG 9253 - 4 points                                Please note that students accepted to the Gallatin Fashion in London Program will be given registration priority for this course.   The topic of clothing and adornment embraces a broad spectrum, from the need for protective covering to the desire for individual expression to the profit goal of international industries. Clothing epitomizes the way a fundamental necessity has been transformed by cultural construction---as well as desire and creativity---into a complex social indicator, a matrix of culture, class, gender identity and aesthetics. This course looks at the ways clothing and fashion are used by story tellers, in print and on film, from the ancient world to the modern as indicators of civilization, individuality, sensuality, polymorphous gender, guilt, and conspicuous consumption. In order to establish a critical grid and vocabulary with which to discuss fiction\u2019s use of clothing/fashion our sources will also include readings in cultural studies, art, sociology, economics, fashion theory, and semiotics.

This interdisciplinary seminar serves as a broad overview for several centuries of British male and female fashion trends, from roughly the Tudor period to today. The course focuses on ways that modes and standards of dress evolved in response to political, economic and technological developments; empire and immigration; changing gender and class formations; and the vagaries of popular culture. In short, the course examines not only what people wore at different historical moments, but why they wore what they did, and how they felt about it. Readings come from the fields of literature, history, art history, gender studies, and sociology.

London, like New York, is a rich and complicated city. Unlike New York however, it has been continuously occupied for just less than 2000 years. Almost every epoch of London\u2019s history can be detected in the city\u2019s architecture and distinctive streetscape.   This course is designed to work in three ways. Firstly it is an opportunity to learn about London\u2019s architecture and art by physically exploring it. Secondly, this class is an introduction to sketching and keeping a travel notebook, a basic and useful skill that any liberal arts student should have an experience of. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, this course teaches how to 'read' a town or city. The ability to visually make sense of a European-built environment should really help in understanding the architecture of New York City and, of course, towns and cities throughout the United States and anywhere else.

Students will learn about London's changing economic and political role, and will understand how London grew to dominate the commerce, industry and culture of England. They will find out how London became the biggest city the world has ever known, and how it coped (or failed to cope) with the social and environmental problems created by its enormous size. Each week (unless there is a field trip) there will be a lecture and a discussion in which you will be able to present ideas and information gathered from lectures and from your weekly reading. There will also be four walking tours of parts of London which relate to the period we are studying at a particular time.

Using the cultural life of London as its focus, this course aims to enable students to report on the diversity of cultural and artistic activity in the British capital across the spectrum, with an inevitable focus on theatre and live performance (classical music/opera, classical and contemporary dance) given the professor's own ongoing career as a theatre critic; other art forms, including art, television, and film, are considered, as well, depending on what is on in the capital at any given time. Numerous forms and techniques will be explored through la mixture of lecture, discussion, and student presentations, and students will be required to follow the work of several critics throughout the term even as they develop their own critical voice and methodology. At every turn, the course aims to wed the specific cultural goings-on in London during the semester to the methods and practice necessary to respond to and evaluate the work on offer.

In recent years Britain has undergone striking changes in its social makeup, political outlook and cultural activities. Rapid change also brings tensions around housing, the National Health Service and education all of which are increasingly facing pressures from immigration, larger numbers of unemployed and the economic squeeze. The most recent census suggested Polish was the second is spoken language in Britain. So what is happening and why and how does it affect you as a visiting student?    Global Orientation: British Culture is intended to introduce students to ideas formed by global and local issues and focus on concerns regarding politics, the media, migration, the free market, foreign policy, cultural homogeneity and democracy that are the keys to modern British national identity.  The course in based around a series of lectures and talks by prominent speakers from British politics, culture, economics and the arts, and incorporates various optional excursions into London to see some of what is being talked about in action.

British architecture is studied, from the Roman remains to the Post-Modern ITV Studios in London. Architecture, urban systems, preservation, and planning issues will be studied. While examining the past and present, the future of architecture will also be explored with an emphasis on the importance of renovating and refurbishing old buildings. There will be site visits in and around the City.

This 15 week course will take an in-depth yet wide-ranging look at an important but curiously neglected aspect of modern western visual culture. Within a broadly chronological structure, topics to be dealt with will include the following: the relationship between art and atrocity, and the attendant problem of the aestheticisation of horror; the crucial influence of photography and the growth of mass communications; the issue of censorship, both external and internal, and the related issue of the &quot;limits of representation&quot; (above all, in relation to the Holocaust and Hiroshima); the distinction between official and unofficial war art, and between art and propaganda, between art that endorses and even glorifies war and an art of protest; issues of gender and sexuality; questions of cultural memory and the memorialization process, and the representation of war in contemporary art practice.   It will consist of a combination of informal lectures, student presentations, at least one gallery visit, and the occasional film showing.     Sample Syllabus                                                                    British Art in London - ARTH-UA 9011 - 4 points                               Students in the NYU Art History Dept: This course counts for Art History elective credit.   A survey of British painting, sculpture and architecture of the 17th through 20th centuries. Museums, galleries, churches, palaces and stately homes in and around London will be visited to examine and critique major works.     Sample Syllabus                                                                Contemporary Art in Britain - ARTH-UA 9675 - 4 points                                Students in the NYU Art History Dept: This course counts for Art History elective credit.   Contemporary art raises vigorous debate and criticism. But what is contemporary about contemporary art? This course introduces you to some of the key issues in dealing critically with contemporary art with a focus on work on display in exhibitions in London, both major national collections and private galleries. The course explores art produced since the late 1950s through case studies of the work of individual artists and through themes which include photography; representations of the body; gallery display; migration, visual imagery of political issues, video practice and installation art. Among other things we consider how contemporary art came to look as it does [with a focus on British art]; the different forms of material and presentation artists have employed; why and how diverse audiences are addressed; how markets, national prizes and private collections shape the kinds of art produced and inform public taste. We also look at the collection and display of contemporary art, on a private and a public scale; dealer galleries and issues of curation.   Sample Syllabus                                                                  Designing Britain - ARTH-UA 9650 - 4 points                                Students in the NYU Art History Dept: This course counts for Urban Design credit or Art History elective credit.   British designers are playing an increasingly important part on the world stage. This course examines changing attitudes to design in Britain: from the eighteenth century, when it played a central role in the modernisation of the country, to the Millennium and beyond, when it is being called upon to rekindle some lost glory. We will ask whether there are features about British design over the last 250 years which are distinctively British; and to what extent British designers have been informed by developments in the rest of the world.   Design now seems all-encompassing, and this very fact also raises broader questions. Have we overvalued this work of the mind over more traditional hand-skills? Are we becoming cynical in the face of endless &quot;rebrandings&quot; (which includes the rebranding of cities and whole countries)? Does design necessarily falsify, or paper over the cracks? And is it good for the planet?   The course format consists of Lectures and Visits to museums, London sites etc.   Sample Syllabus                                                                    Renaissance Art in London - ARTH-UA 9350 - 4 points                                Students in the NYU Art History Dept: This course counts for Art History elective credit.   London has some of the richest collections of renaissance art in the world. Students in this course will be brought into direct contact with a large variety of artefacts to be found in museums and galleries such as the National Gallery, the National Portrait Gallery, the Victoria and Albert Museum, the British Museum as well as the British Library. Works by Van Eyck, Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo, Raphael, Durer and Holbein will be examined alongside those of less well-known artists. Rather than provide a standard chronological narrative of European Art History c. 1400- c. 1600, focus will be placed on subject areas such as the altarpiece and the private devotional image, the renaissance portrait, graphic practices, print culture, the materials and functions of sculpture, myth and allegory, the cabinet of curiosities, the concept of the 'Renaissance' itself. These topics will not be organised around traditional national or regional 'schools' considered in isolation from one another but instead interconnections will be explored between the development of different types, technical processes and cultural practices across the Netherlands, France, Germany and Italy. A special case will be made of the English Renaissance, in order to place it within the wider European context through additional visits to Westminster Abbey and Hampton Court.   Sample Syllabus                                                                Seeing London's Architecture - ARTH-UA 9674 or SASEM-UG 9250 - 4 points                               Students in the NYU Art History Dept: This course counts for Architecture and Urban Design credit only.   London, like New York, is a rich and complicated city. Unlike New York however, it has been continuously occupied for just less than 2000 years. Almost every epoch of London\u2019s history can be detected in the city\u2019s architecture and distinctive streetscape.   This course is designed to work in three ways. Firstly it is an opportunity to learn about London\u2019s architecture and art by physically exploring it. Secondly, this class is an introduction to sketching and keeping a travel notebook, a basic and useful skill that any liberal arts student should have an experience of. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, this course teaches how to 'read' a town or city. The ability to visually make sense of a European-built environment should really help in understanding the architecture of New York City and, of course, towns and cities throughout the United States and anywhere else.   Sample Syllabus                          Biology                                                    Principles of Biology II - BIOL-UA 9012 - 4 points (Lecture & Recitation)                                Prerequisite: High school chemistry and BIOL-UA 11, Principles of Biology I or equivalent   Students registering for this course must register for the Lecture &amp; Recitation.   Introductory course mainly for science majors designed to acquaint the student with the fundamental principles and processes of biological systems. Subjects include the basics of chemistry pertinent to biology, biochemistry and cell biology, genetics and molecular biology, anatomy and physiology, neurobiology, ecology, population genetics, and history and classification of life forms and evolution.   Sample Syllabus                                                                Principles of Biology Lab - BIOL-UA 9123 - 1 point (Laboratory)                               Note: Biology majors are not required to register for this lab course. All other students should consult with their advisor to determine if the lab is a requirement of their program of study.     Laboratory exercises illustrate the basics of experimental biology, molecular biology, and biochemistry as well as the diversity of life forms and organ systems.                                                                    Where the City Meets the Sea: Studies in Coastal Urban Environments - BIOL-UA 9140 or ENVST-UA 9275 - 4 points                               Over half of the human population lives within 100 km of a coast and coastlines contain more than two-thirds of the world\u2019s largest cities. As a result, the world\u2019s natural coastal environments have been substantially modified to suit human needs. This course will use the built and natural environments of coastal cities as laboratories to examine the environmental and cological implications of urban development in coastal areas. Using data from multiple coastal cities, student teams will use field-based studies and Geographic Information System (GIS) data to examine patterns and processes operating in coastal cities. This course uses the local terrestrial, marine, and built environments as a laboratory to address these issues, and team projects requiring field work form a core component of the learning experience. As part of the Global Network University initiative this course will be offered simultaneously in multiple locations and students will collaborate with their counterparts on other campuses.

The class focuses on the nature of financial management from a number of perspectives including the national, the corporate and the individual, but particularly the corporate. You will become familiar with the financial system, including that relating to banking, though there will be little overlap with courses that deal with the functioning of financial markets. The importance of behavioural finance will also be stressed during the course.   Sample Syllabus                                                                International Political Economy - BPEP-UB 9011 - 4 points                               The course is informed by the significant transformation the world economy is currently undergoing, paying particular attention to the evolving dynamics of international trade and the global distribution of power within a longer-term historical perspective. The result is a course strongly geared towards providing students with an understanding of contemporary international economic and political trends, issues and events alongside the requisite analytical skills to evaluate current economic and political policies.   This course is divided into two sections. The first section focuses on the political economy of international trade. It will examine the role of labour, land and capital in determining what is traded, by whom and for what purpose. The second section examines the key global issues in 21st century political economy. It will focus on cultural transformation in an age of globalization, the economic rise of Asia, the political economy of militant Islam and, most saliently, the future of Western hegemony in light of the global economic crisis.   Sample Syllabus                                                                Foundations of Finance - FINC-UB 9002 - 4 points                                Prerequisites: (1) STAT-UB 103 Statistics for Business Control and Regression/Forecasting Models OR ECON-UA 18 Statistics (6 credits) OR ECON-UA 18 Statistics (4 credit) plus ECON-UA 19/STAT-UB 3 Regression/Forecasting (2 credit) OR STAT-UB 1 Statistics for Business Control (4 credit) plus STAT-UB 3 Regression/Forecasting (2 credit) AND (2) one of the following: ECON-UB 1 Microeconomics OR ECON-UA 2 Economic Principles II, OR ECON-UA 5 Introduction to Economic Analysis, AND (3) ACCT-UB 1 Principles of Financial Accounting AND (4) At least Sophomore Standing.   A rigorous course developing the basic concepts and tools of modern finance. Basic concepts of return and risk are explored in detail with a view to understanding how financial markets work and how different kinds of financial instruments are valued. These instruments, including equities, fixed income securities, options, and other derivative securities become vehicles for exploring various financial markets and the utilization of these markets by managers in different kinds of financial institutions to enhance return and manage risk. The course includes a segment on the use and application of computer-based quantitative technology for financial modeling purposes.   Sample Syllabus                                                                Introduction to Marketing - MKTG-UB 9001 - 4 points                                This course carries an additional fee of \u00a320 to cover the cost of course materials.

The first part of the course will provide a brief overview of human rights, child development, social determinants of mental health, trauma and resilience, and the global public health significance of mental illness. Using this framework, the impact of selected cross-cultural salient factors affecting mental health (i.e. poverty, war and conflict, and gender-based exploitation) on children\u2019s development and wellbeing will be studied. Throughout the course, various perspectives will be considered, while dominant paradigms will be recognized and critically examined. Lastly, the course will conclude on a pragmatic level\u2014deliberating specific settings, available resources, barriers, and preventative proposals. Through lectures, readings, documentaries, and active discussion this course will provide an engaging milieu to consider the scope and magnitude of child and adolescent mental health issues globally. Selected case studies from the Americas, Africa, Europe, Asia, and the Middle East will be used to illustrate key concepts.

Britain is a multi-national state, a union of 4 nations, each with their own distinctive culture and heritage. Three of the nations, Wales, Scotland and Ireland, have been brought under the English monarchy and political system, and, in the case of the first two, they have been long-term partners in the benefits accruing to the largest empire the world has seen, and the first and (for a long time) the most successful industrial nation. The height of that unity was probably in the period of the Second World War and its aftermath. Since then, with the collapse of the British Empire, Britain\u2019s membership of the European Union, and the devolution of power to Scotland and Wales, the union has come under increasing pressure from centrifugal forces. The course examines the image that Britain presents to the world, the myths on which the national identity of the component nations were formed and the institutions that might be considered to hold the union together today. This involves looking at the self-image of Britain in relation to empire, foreign policy, immigration and multiculturalism, monarchy, parliament, sport and media representations. British national identity is revealed as an increasingly contested concept in a globalised world.

The Gothic flourished especially in the nineteenth century, creating a whole vocabulary of new creatures and landscapes and two of the great books of the genre: Frankenstein and Dracula . This course concentrates on the great works of Gothic which are central to an understanding of literature, film, early Romanticism and popular culture. Specialising on the works of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries we will also explore how those texts were reinvented for film and what new elements were added in the twentieth century. Using a selection of texts and using a variety of approaches from the historical to the post modern and the feminist to queer theory we will explore the multifarious levels of meaning in Gothic texts as well as looking at narrative strategies and a variety of themes including the political and revolutionary, the erotic and the exotic, the Promethian and the undead, the role of religion, the role of women, the Wandering Jew and the 'mock' medieval.

We shall be concerned not only with topics of place and setting, but also with issues of individual and national identity, as well as with forms of verse, drama, and fictional narratives. We shall be seeing a performance of Marlowe\u2019s Dr Faustus at Shakespeare\u2019s Globe, witnessing justice in action in a London court, as well as visiting the houses of Dr Johnson and Charles Dickens, Tate Britain, and viewing screen versions of a couple of our chosen novels.

The course introduces students to some of the key texts of British cultural and educational policy in India. It also gives students the opportunity to examine a major ethnographic text. The course will then grapple with a cross-section of colonial and postcolonial literary representations of India. The focus here will be on issues of identity and strategies of narrative in colonialist and nationalist texts. The course concludes with an overall view of postcolonial studies as it relates to India and some suggestions as to its future developments.

Writing London - ENGL-UA 9182 - 4 points                               This course will study a variety of texts written at particular times in the history of London. The aims of the course are to encourage student to think historically, in terms of the way London and representations of the city have changed and developed over time; and theoretically, in terms of the way the city is mediated through different forms and genres (e.g. poetry, novels, essays, film). We will also examine the texts in relation to issues such as gender, the definition of the modern metropolis as a labyrinthine city of Babylon, the influence of metropolitan culture on Modernism and Modernity, assimilation versus multiculturalism, immigration, and the effects of new modern spaces on individuals.

As a result, the world\u2019s natural coastal environments have been substantially modified to suit human needs. This course will use the built and natural environments of coastal cities as laboratories to examine the environmental and cological implications of urban development in coastal areas. Using data from multiple coastal cities, student teams will use field-based studies and Geographic Information System (GIS) data to examine patterns and processes operating in coastal cities. This course uses the local terrestrial, marine, and built environments as a laboratory to address these issues, and team projects requiring field work form a core component of the learning experience. As part of the Global Network University initiative this course will be offered simultaneously in multiple locations and students will collaborate with their counterparts on other campuses.

This 15 week course will take an in-depth yet wide-ranging look at an important but curiously neglected aspect of modern western visual culture. Within a broadly chronological structure, topics to be dealt with will include the following: the relationship between art and atrocity, and the attendant problem of the aestheticisation of horror; the crucial influence of photography and the growth of mass communications; the issue of censorship, both external and internal, and the related issue of the &quot;limits of representation&quot; (above all, in relation to the Holocaust and Hiroshima); the distinction between official and unofficial war art, and between art and propaganda, between art that endorses and even glorifies war and an art of protest; issues of gender and sexuality; questions of cultural memory and the memorialization process, and the representation of war in contemporary art practice.   It will consist of a combination of informal lectures, student presentations, at least one gallery visit, and the occasional film showing.

The topic of clothing and adornment embraces a broad spectrum, from the need for protective covering to the desire for individual expression to the profit goal of international industries. Clothing epitomizes the way a fundamental necessity has been transformed by cultural construction---as well as desire and creativity---into a complex social indicator, a matrix of culture, class, gender identity and aesthetics. This course looks at the ways clothing and fashion are used by story tellers, in print and on film, from the ancient world to the modern as indicators of civilization, individuality, sensuality, polymorphous gender, guilt, and conspicuous consumption. In order to establish a critical grid and vocabulary with which to discuss fiction\u2019s use of clothing/fashion our sources will also include readings in cultural studies, art, sociology, economics, fashion theory, and semiotics.

This interdisciplinary seminar serves as a broad overview for several centuries of British male and female fashion trends, from roughly the Tudor period to today. The course focuses on ways that modes and standards of dress evolved in response to political, economic and technological developments; empire and immigration; changing gender and class formations; and the vagaries of popular culture. In short, the course examines not only what people wore at different historical moments, but why they wore what they did, and how they felt about it. Readings come from the fields of literature, history, art history, gender studies, and sociology.

London, like New York, is a rich and complicated city. Unlike New York however, it has been continuously occupied for just less than 2000 years. Almost every epoch of London\u2019s history can be detected in the city\u2019s architecture and distinctive streetscape.   This course is designed to work in three ways. Firstly it is an opportunity to learn about London\u2019s architecture and art by physically exploring it. Secondly, this class is an introduction to sketching and keeping a travel notebook, a basic and useful skill that any liberal arts student should have an experience of. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, this course teaches how to 'read' a town or city. The ability to visually make sense of a European-built environment should really help in understanding the architecture of New York City and, of course, towns and cities throughout the United States and anywhere else.

Students will learn about London's changing economic and political role, and will understand how London grew to dominate the commerce, industry and culture of England. They will find out how London became the biggest city the world has ever known, and how it coped (or failed to cope) with the social and environmental problems created by its enormous size. Each week (unless there is a field trip) there will be a lecture and a discussion in which you will be able to present ideas and information gathered from lectures and from your weekly reading. There will also be four walking tours of parts of London which relate to the period we are studying at a particular time.

Event Date and Time: February 11, 2015 6:15pm Location: Department of Cinema Studies, Michelson Theater 721 Broadway, 6th Floor New York, NY 10003 To celebrate the recent release by Icarus Films of one of Chantal Akerman's lesser-known films, One Day Pina Asked... (Belgium, 1983), the Department of Cinema Studies in partnership with Dance Film Association will host a screening and panel discussion on the topic of Dance and the Documentary. Akerman's film follows German choreographer Pina Bausch with her company Tanzteater Wuppertal on a five-week tour in Europe. Close-ups and static shots present an intimate journey through Bausch's world, as Akerman withholds voice-over narration and lets the images speak for themselves. Shot by Babette Mangolte, Akerman's frequent collaborator and prominent documenter of New York's downtown dance scene, One Day Pina Asked... collects the gestures of everyday life, lingering on details like a hand buttoning a shirt, high heels walking across the floor or a tear rolling down a cheek. Panelists: Allyson Green , Dean of Tisch School of the Arts, New York University Antonia Lant , Chair of the Department of Cinema Studies, NYU Paul Galando , Director of Dance and New Media at NYU Brighid Greene , Programmer at Dance Films Association Programmer and Moderator: Sylvie Vitaglione , NYU Cinema Studies This event is free and open to the public, but seating is limited.
