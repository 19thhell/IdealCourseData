Center-based child care programs often provide a full day of care, generally from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. Part-day and school day programs, often referred to as nursery schools, are also available.   Ages Served     Early childhood centers in NYC can care for children as young as 8 weeks however it is more common that a child care program programs education and care for children beginning at 2 years 9 months. Some centers offer services to school-age children as well.   Hours Served     Center-based programs providing a full day of care are generally in operation from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. Some programs offer parents other scheduling options including: part-time, full day/part week, part day/full week, or part day/part week.   Average Cost     The average cost for full time care in NYC ranges from $1,300-$2,500/month. Centers typically charge more for younger children because they require more care and attention (diaper changes, feeding help, etc.). Costs for infant and toddler care averages $1,800/month in NYC.   In New York City and elsewhere group child care services are a licensed form of care. The following is a summary of key regulations in NYC. Links to regulations for family child care services in New York State, New Jersey, and Connecticut follow.

Assistant Teacher Qualifications     An assistant teacher must be a mature person, 19 years of age or older, have a High School Diploma, or 60 college credits, or a Child Development Associate (CDA) credential approved by NAEYC.   General Licensing and Facility Requirements     General Licensing Requirements     A license is required for any center caring for 7 or more children under the age of 6.

Types of Child Care     There are three primary forms of child care services for children newborn through five years of age. They are: center-based, family child care, and in-home care. Center-based and family child care are both regulated by the City of New York. Because of the short supply of center-based care for infants and toddlers, and two-year olds the majority of families seeking care for this age group tend to rely on family child care or in-home care.   Start Your Search Early     It is important to start your search for child care early. Beginning early will provide you with an opportunity to have a sense of the available care options, give you the time you need to determine your preference in the type of care available, and alleviate the potential stress of making this decision when you need to return to work.   Help Finding Child Care     In NYC, as elsewhere across the country, center-based care or preschool aged children (2.5-4 years) is readily available. On the other hand, services for infants (newborn-12 months) and toddlers (18-24 months) are scarce. In the Chelsea, Greenwich Village, and lower Manhattan neighborhoods waitlists for children in this age group average 12-18 months.   Therefore, if you are seeking care for your young child, a very compelling reason to look for care early is that you will want to place your name on a waitlist. Full-time child care centers programs are accustomed to accepting applications from expectant and adopting parents. The majority of programs do not require a deposit however some program do have a practice of requiring non-refundable deposits to secure your place.
