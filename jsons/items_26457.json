The toolkit of skills of the business professional must include an understanding of the fundamentals of IT and its impacts on the other functional areas of business: strategic management, finance, accounting, marketing, and operations. This course is intended to provide this base set of skills and understandings.     This course introduces you to information technology in business. Broadly, the objectives of the course are:         First, as a future knowledge worker you will use personal systems in your work every day. You need to know how to publish information on the Internet, model and analyze decisions using a spreadsheet, and get information from relational databases. Over this course, your in-class conceptual learning of these topics will be complemented by a set of computer-based self-learning tools.       Second, in the digital firm, you will be involved increasingly in decisions about information systems. You will therefore need to understand how information systems contribute to effective business strategy, how they are developed and implemented by organizations, and how to participate effectively in the roles you might play in this regard.       Third, you must know how to evaluate and analyze information-based products and services in industries that have a growing digital or technology-based component. You will learn about the unique economics of information pricing, technological lock-in and network effects, so that you can perform informed business analysis and formulate effective strategy in the digital economy.       We will also discuss a set of special topics, including digital music, information privacy, interactive gaming, data mining and digital piracy. Assignments and projects through the course will reinforce your learning of how to use information technology to solve business problems.

There is also an optional textbook for the class, titled Management Information Systems is available in the main NYU bookstore. It contains the following material:         A complete copy of Management Information Systems for the Information Age, 8th Edition.       Chapters 2, 5 and 7 from Information Rules, by Carl Shapiro and Hal Varian.       The article How Competitive Forces Shape Strategy by Michael Porter.       The case The iPremier Company: Denial of Service Attack.       These readings will be supplemented by selected online content, available through the Course Documents section of this site.The textbook is also available on reserve in the Bobst library, for those of you who prefer to use the textbook only occasionally.     You can also get (optionally) the SimNet software for Office 2007, which contains instructional material for learning how to use the Office 2007 suite. We will also offer recitations on Excel, Access, and on web page development. Many students prefer the live recitations to the SimNet software, while others consider SimNet a useful complement as well.     Make sure that you check the Course Documents section of the course web site before every session -- you will find a document for every classroom session, which will contain detailed information about pre-class readings, a copy of the class slides, information about assignments or projects, and pointers to how far you should have progressed on your SimNet Tutorial lessons.          Assessment Components     The breakdown of points (out of a total of 500) is as follows:         Participation (50 points)       Assignments (50 points)       2 Group Projects + 1 Semester Project (150 points)       1 Midterm examination (100 points each)       Final examination (150 points)       Each assignment and project will provide you with a set of instructions and guidelines. Expect to use Excel, Access and the Web extensively.     Examinations are closed book/notes/computer/PDA/iPod (the idea should be clear). We will discuss their format in due course.     Late submissions will be accepted and graded, if submitted within 3 days of the deadline, but you will only be given credit for 50% of your score.     Group projects should be done in groups of 5 students. During the semester, your TA\u0092s will facilitate this team formation process, and we will give you a set of detailed guidelines about working in teams. You will also be asked to evaluate the contribution of each of your team members after each group project.     The classroom discussion presents a unique opportunity for you to develop and enhance your confidence and skills in articulating a personal position, sharing your knowledge, and reacting to new ideas. All of you have personal experience with information technology that can enhance our understanding of the subject, and that we want to encourage you to share.     The grade we assign for your class participation is a careful, subjective assessment of the value of your input to classroom learning. We keep track of your contributions towards each class session, and these contributions can include (but are not restricted to) raising questions that make your classmates think, providing imaginative yet relevant analysis of a situation, contributing background or a perspective on a classroom topic that enhances its discussion, and simply answering questions raised in class. Emphasis is placed on the quality of your contribution, rather than merely on its frequency. A lack of preparation, negative classroom comments or improper behavior ( such as talking to each other, sleeping in the class or walking out of the class while the lecture is in progress ) will lower this grade .          Participation and Attendance     This course, like many other courses at Stern, uses learning methods that require active involvement (e.g., discussions and exercises). Not only is this the best way to learn, but it also develops your communication skills. Regular attendance and participation are very important. Active participation requires good preparation -- thoughtful reading of the assigned material and completion of assignments, quizzes, and projects before class is essential. I recognize that expressing viewpoints in a group is difficult, but it is an important skill for you to develop. I will do what I can to make this as easy as possible. If you feel that contributing on-line is easier for you than contributing in-class, please feel free to do so. Remember though that only regular and insightful contributions will be rewarded (e.g., asking a HW question does not count).     In addition to in-class participation, you should also participate in the discussion board on Blackboard, where we will discuss topics from the news as well as from the class material. The participation should be substantive: read what others have said, reply to their remarks, but do not repeat their points. You can also ask questions of each other. This will help you learn and prepare for exams. In addition to the material discussion, board will be used to ask me or TAs questions about assignments and exams as well as to facilitate group formation. All administrative questions should also be posed there rather than sent to us in email. You can post feedback anonymously.          Group Projects      Guidelines for Group Projects          Business activities involve group effort. Consequently, learning how to work effectively in a group is a critical part of your business education.        Every member is expected to carry an equal share of the group&rsquo;s workload. As such, it is in your interest to be involved in all aspects of the project. Even if you divide the work rather than work on each piece together, you are still responsible for each part. The group project will be graded as a whole: its different components will not be graded separately. Your exams may contain questions that are based on aspects of your group projects.        It is recommended that each group establish ground rules early in the process to facilitate your joint work including a problem-solving process for handling conflicts. In the infrequent case where you believe that a group member is not carrying out his or her fair share of work, you are urged not to permit problems to develop to a point where they become serious. If you cannot resolve conflicts internally after your best efforts, they should be brought to my attention and I will work with you to find a resolution.          You will be asked to complete a peer evaluation form to evaluate the contribution of each of your group members (including your own contribution) at the conclusion of each project. If there is consensus that a group member did not contribute a fair share of work to the project, I will consider this feedback during grading.         Grading      At NYU Stern we seek to teach challenging courses that allow students to demonstrate their mastery of the subject matter. In general, students in undergraduate core courses can expect a grading distribution where:              25-35% of students can expect to receive A&rsquo;s for excellent work         50-70% of students can expect to receive B&rsquo;s for good or very good work           5-15% of students can expect to receive C&rsquo;s or less for adequate or below work          Note that while the School uses these ranges as a guide, the actual distribution for this course and your own grade will depend upon how well you actually perform in this course.         Re-Grading     The process of assigning grades is intended to be one of unbiased evaluation. Students are encouraged to respect the integrity and authority of the professor&rsquo;s grading system and are discouraged from pursuing arbitrary challenges to it.     We publish the grading guide for the assignments and projects, so that students can learn from their mistakes and judge the fairness of the grade. If you believe that the grade you received was unjustified, you can appeal the grade. To appeal the grade you must write a one page explanation as to the reason for your appeal and hand it along with your graded assignment back to your section&#39;s TA . Please think twice before appealing a grade: the TA will completely re-grade the assignment, which may increase or lower your grade (if the TA caught more mistakes second time around). If again you consider that your grade was unjustified, you can appeal the grade with the instructor.              Professional Responsibilities For This Course      Attendance            Class attendance is essential to your success in this course and is part of your grade. An excused absence can only be granted in cases of serious illness, grave family emergencies, or religious observance and must be documented. Job interviews and incompatible travel plans are considered unexcused absences. Where possible, please notify me in advance of an excused absence.             Participation        In-class contribution is a significant part of your grade and an important part of our shared learning experience. Your active participation helps me to evaluate your overall performance.   You can excel in this area if you come to class on time and contribute to the course by:         Providing strong evidence of having thought through the material.       Advancing the discussion by contributing insightful comments and questions.       Listening attentively in class.       Demonstrating interest in your peers&#39; comments, questions, and presentations.       Giving constructive feedback to your peers when appropriate.             Assignments            Late assignments will either not be accepted unless due to documented serious illness or family emergency. Exceptions to this policy for reasons of religious observance or civic obligation will only be made available when the assignment cannot reasonably be completed prior to the due date and you make arrangements for late submission in advance.             Classroom Norms            Arrive to class on time and stay to the end of the class period. Chronically arriving late or leaving class early is unprofessional and disruptive to the entire class. Repeated tardiness will have an impact on your grade.       Turn off all electronic devices prior to the start of class. Laptops, cell phones and other electronic devices are a distraction to everyone.            Stern Policies      General Behavior   The School expects that students will conduct themselves with respect and professionalism toward faculty, students, and others present in class and will follow the rules laid down by the instructor for classroom behavior. Students who fail to do so may be asked to leave the classroom.           Collaboration on Graded Assignments   Students may not work together on graded assignment unless the instructor gives express permission. Collaborating on graded assignments with students from other sections, is a violation of the Stern Honor Code. Similarly, getting help to complete the graded assignments from students that attended the class in the past is also a violation of the Stern Honor Code. Violating the Stern Honor Code results will be referred to the Stern Discipline Committee for further examination. The first violation results, at a minimum, in a decrease of one letter grade from the grade that would be normally assigned to the student for the course. Depending on the severity, it may also results in an immediate expulsion from the course and potentially from the university.           Course Evaluations   Course evaluations are important to us and to students who come after you. Please complete them thoughtfully.          Academic Integrity      Integrity is critical to the learning process and to all that we do here at NYU Stern. As members of our community, all students agree to abide by the NYU Stern Student Code of Conduct, which includes a commitment to:              Exercise integrity in all aspects of one&#39;s academic work including, but not limited to, the preparation and completion of exams, papers and all other course requirements by not engaging in any method or means that provides an unfair advantage.         Clearly acknowledge the work and efforts of others when submitting written work as one&rsquo;s own. Ideas, data, direct quotations (which should be designated with quotation marks), paraphrasing, creative expression, or any other incorporation of the work of others should be fully referenced.         Refrain from behaving in ways that knowingly support, assist, or in any way attempt to enable another person to engage in any violation of the Code of Conduct. Our support also includes reporting any observed violations of this Code of Conduct or other School and University policies that are deemed to adversely affect the NYU Stern community.            The entire Stern Student Code of Conduct applies to all students enrolled in Stern courses and can be found here:       Undergraduate College: http://www.stern.nyu.edu/uc/codeofconduct     Graduate Programs: http://w4.stern.nyu.edu/studentactivities/involved.cfm?doc_id=102505       To help ensure the integrity of our learning community, prose assignments you submit to Blackboard will be submitted to Turnitin. Turnitin will compare your submission to a database of prior submissions to Turnitin, current and archived Web pages, periodicals, journals, and publications. Additionally, your document will become part of the Turnitin database.         Recording of Classes      Your class may be recorded for educational purposes           Students with Disabilities      If you have a qualified disability and will require academic accommodation of any kind during this course, you must notify me at the beginning of the course and provide a letter from the Moses Center for Students with Disabilities (CSD, 998-4980, www.nyu.edu/csd ) verifying your registration and outlining the accommodations they recommend. If you will need to take an exam at the CSD, you must submit a completed Exam Accommodations Form to them at least one week prior to the scheduled exam time to be guaranteed accommodation."}]}]
