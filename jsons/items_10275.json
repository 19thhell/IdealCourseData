Students must have a minimum 3.0 grade point average (GPA). Topics in Cuban Culture provides a multifaceted exploration of Cuban history, culture and society from the period of Spanish colonialism, through the wars of independence and the Revolution, and into the \"special period\" of the 1990s, all the way to the present day. This course is offered in collaboration with the Ludwig Foundation of Cuba, the Cuban National Institute of Film and Television (ICAIC), and the University of Havana. The class will be composed of three parts: (i) the class seminar/recitation, (ii) the study trip, and (iii) final project presentations. Weekly class sessions are in New York and there is a one-week study trip to Cuba during winter break (exact dates to be announced) with visits to Havana, Trinidad and Cienfuegos. Through guest lectures, screenings, workshops and discussions, students will engage the arts and culture of Cuba, paying particular attention to topics such as Afro-Cuban identity, architecture, film, dance, photography, music, Santeria, theatre and politics. The class will also be able to take advantage of local exhibits, performances, theatre, film, and other cultural events current during the spring. On the study trip, students will have an opportunity to experience life in Cuba and to interact with leading Cuban artists, writers, performers and scholars. Students are expected to keep a weekly journal with entries relating to assigned readings and guest lecturers. The final research paper and presentation is on an approved theme. Note: The course has a nonrefundable program fee which covers airfare, accommodations, some meals and all program related activities. The fee is to be announced.
