Human activities have impacted the balance of the Carbon Cycle since the Industrial Revolution. The great increase in use of fossil fuels such as coal, which was used to heat water for the first steam engines and continues to be a major source of energy, has released a great amount of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.   The carbon cycle is the biogeochemical cycle by which carbon is exchanged among the terrestrial biosphere, pedosphere, geosphere, hydrosphere, and atmosphere of the Earth. These spheres comprise the major carbon pools on earth. Carbon in the ocean is dissolved in water in the form of bicarbonate, and ocean organisms absorb carbon from the water and atmosphere.\u00a0 Carbon is absorbed from the atmosphere by photosynthetic organisms in the biosphere and hydrosphere. Carbon in the forms of methane and carbon dioxide is released into the atmosphere by biological organisms in the biosphere, pedosphere, and hydrosphere, and by human consumption of fossil fuels.   The atmosphere is thus one of the most dynamic carbon pools. The increase (or decrease) of carbon in the atmosphere affects carbon levels in the ocean, and affects global warming.

Carbon cycles through the Biosphere, Pedosphere, Geosphere, Hydrosphere, and Atmosphere through respiration emissions, photosynthesis, and ocean uptake. Photoplankton absorbs carbon and transfers it through the sea&#8217;s ecosystem. I also learned about the difference between Local, Whole, and Organic foods. Local food is food made in the neighborhood. Whole food is food shipped from outside the state or country. Organic food is food without preservatives and pesticides. Finally,\u00a0I learned about City food and resources, essentially, the things required or needed to create a functionally operating city. Markets, government , and reactions to disasters are important parts of a city as one provides food, leadership and ways to deal with problems we cannot control.
