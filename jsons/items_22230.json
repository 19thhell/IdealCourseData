Each year more than 130 NYU School of Law graduates work as judicial clerks. Some graduates obtain clerkships during their 3L year and, in keeping with recent hiring preferences of judges, some obtain clerkships after working for a year or more. The last two academic years have been very successful judicial clerkship seasons for NYU Law: more than 320 students and alumni secured clerkships, 98 of which were with federal appellate judges.   During the fall 2014 clerkship term, 166 NYU alumni are clerking: 47 are clerking on the federal Courts of Appeals, including seven on the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit and eight on the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. In addition, six alumni are clerking for state Supreme Court justices and one is clerking on the Delaware Court of Chancery, the nation\u2019s preeminent forum for resolving business disputes. Since 2004, 14 NYU graduates have clerked on the US Supreme Court, and many JD and LLM graduates have clerked on the International Court of Justice in the Hague.   Where NYU Alums Clerk: Locations of Clerkships     Clerkship Application Process   To assist students and alumni with the application process, the Judicial Clerkship Office (JCO) publishes a Judicial Clerkship Handbook which thoroughly details the value of a clerkship, where to clerk, how to apply, when to apply, etc. (see table of contents ). In addition, the JCO publishes an Appendix to the Handbook which lists all past, current, and future NYU clerks of active judges, along with the contact information for the clerks. Most importantly, the JCO offers individualized counseling with our dedicated clerkship career counselor Michelle Cherande \u201997.   NYU students and alumni can access the Judicial Clerkship Handbook and Appendices, as well as other valuable resources, by logging on to your Career Services Manager (CSM) account and clicking the \u201cClerkships\u201d top link.
