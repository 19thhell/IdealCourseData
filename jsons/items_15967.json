Science program and to use the contemporary tools and approaches that are available to solve problems in areas of the current life sciences. Intermediate and advanced courses provide a broad and intensive background in modern biology for those interested in careers in research, health-related fields, biotechnology, and education, among others. The advanced courses emphasize the fundamental concepts and principles mastered in the Foundations of Science sequence, continuing the emphasis on using interdisciplinary approaches to understand the natural world.     The major in Biology is taught by faculty who carry out research in state-of-the-art laboratories in various areas in the life sciences. The Biology program at NYUAD has strong interactive ties with the Department of Biology, the Center for Genomics and Systems Biology, and other laboratories located at NYU in New York and within the NYU Global Network.

BCS investigates some of the deepest mysteries facing science in the 21st century, which concern the higher functions of the central nervous system: perception, memory, attention, learning, language, emotion, personality, social interaction, decision-making, motor control, and consciousness. All psychiatric disorders (e.g., anxiety disorders and depression), neurological diseases (e.g., Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases), and developmental disorders (e.g., dyslexia and autism) are characterized by dysfunction of the neural systems in the brain.     Experimental approaches in BCS vary from analyses of molecular and cellular mechanisms in nerve cells and groups of nerve cells to behavioral studies of whole organisms. Theoretical tools include mathematical and computational modeling approaches that have proved useful in other areas of science. Experimental questions include issues related to biophysical and neurochemical mechanisms within single nerve cells, functional neural circuits consisting of small numbers of neurons, the behavior of large systems of neurons, and the relationship between the activity of elements of the nervous system and the behavior of organisms, as well as the neural substrate of cognitive processes.     To complete the specialization, students take three of their four Biology electives in the BCS area, one of which must be The Brain. The fourth elective must be outside the BCS electives, and finally students specializing in BCS must take Cognition (in Psychology).

This course uses fundamental concepts from the Foundations of Science curriculum to examine essential elements of physiology, with a particular emphasis on humans and disease. This course develops an understanding of the relationship between structure and function of the organism; how structure develops through evolutionary and developmental processes; and how structure is related to the environment surrounding the organism.

What&rsquo;s the microbiome, and why should you care? How do we know about human migration patterns in ancient times, or the domestication of plants? What can our DNA tell us about heritable diseases? Fueled largely by the Human Genome Project, modern biological science has entered a new, revolutionary era in the 21st century. Genomics and Bioinformatics &ndash; the collection and analysis of vast amounts of sequence and functional data &ndash; are transforming the way we think, enabling us to solve long-standing mysteries and ask new kinds of questions. New scientific discoveries from genome sciences are impacting society, and our every day lives, on all levels: public policy, medicine, health, and the environment. Familiarity with these fields is thus vital for any educated citizen in our globally interconnected world. This course introduces students to fundamental concepts and hot topics in genome science through seminars, critical review of current research articles, student presentations, and interactive discussion. In Spring 2015, Genome Biology will be held as a joint course between New York and Abu Dhabi, enabling students to get to know their peers across the Global Network University.    *Note : (Spring 2015) will be co-taught with an instructor from New York (Manpreet, Katari).

The guiding principal in designing synthetic projects is often derived from a systems level understanding of cellular networks, with metabolic network analyses playing a key role in offering informed hypotheses on how to modify cellular wirings for a desired outcome. This course combines lectures, class discussions, and lab experiments (both wet and computational) to explore applications of advanced genomics and molecular biology tools to alter the metabolic circuits of E. coli . The course engages students in a guided research project to learn advanced molecular techniques, such as gene silencing through CRISPR/Cas or TALEN systems, and systems level analysis of metabolism through pathway and flux balance analysis using integrated computational tools such as PathwayTools. Students will become familiar with engineering concepts such as defining biological components as &ldquo;parts&rdquo; and cataloging them in synthetic biology parts registries. Students will also design novel genetic circuits, assemble new constructs and transform competent cells with in house cloned vectors. In addition, students will develop skills to formulate systems based hypotheses and write scientific research proposals.

Through exposure to NYUAD faculty research, students will identify areas of interest for their own capstone research and develop and write an in-depth research proposal over the course of the semester. The final capstone proposal is due at the end of the seminar series so that students can begin the Capstone Project in the fall semester of their senior year. Beginning in 2015-16 all science majors are expected to take this course in their junior year.

Bats fly with great precision in total darkness. Honeybees find their way home using a path they have never seen before. Baby songbirds retain the memory of hearing their father&rsquo;s song for several months before they actually are able to sing that song themselves. All these animals rely on specific mechanisms in their brains to endow them with these remarkable abilities. Understanding these mechanisms can provide deep insights into how all brains, including our own, are shaped by evolution to be fantastic problem solving machines. In this course we will explore the unique worlds of several animals, highlighting first the specific environmental problems that a particular animal must solve, and second, the amazing ways the brains of these animals implement imaginative solutions to these problems. This course does not presume a strong background in biology, but two things help: an appreciation of the beauty of the animals around us and a genuine curiosity about how in the world they are able to do what they do.

Organic Chemistry 1 presents the structure and bonding, conformational analysis, stereochemistry, and spectroscopy of organic materials, subjects that partly trace their roots to the development of quantum theory. The topics covered include basic reaction mechanisms, such as substitution and elimination, and the reactions of aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons, alcohols, ethers, carbonyl compounds, and carboxylic acids.

Indeed, the very principles of chemistry, biology, physics, and math converge in the field of biochemistry, and biochemical concepts provide a focal point for many disciplines, including biology, healthcare, the pharmaceutical industry, environmental studies and ecology, and our understanding of evolution. This course opens the study of biochemistry with a rigorous investigation of biological macromolecules, including the structure and function of proteins, nucleic acids, carbohydrates, and lipids. This then leads to the investigation of enzyme structure, including their mechanism of action and their regulation, moving toward a deep understanding of information flow in cells via detailed biochemical studies of replication, transcription, and translation.

This course opens the study of metabolic pathways by which cells catabolize and metabolize carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins. We will examine the mechanisms of the different reactions that constitute these pathways and the regulatory mechanisms that control their efflux in living systems. Review of scientific literature will broaden our understanding of metabolism in the human body with special focus on human diseases as a result of defects in metabolic pathways.

Applications to other disciplines are emphasized. Since the derivative measures the instantaneous rate of change of a function and the definite integral measures the total accumulation of a function over an interval, these two ideas form the basis for nearly all mathematical formulas in science, engineering, economics, and other fields. This course also provides instruction in how to model situations in order to solve problems. Applications include graphing, and maximizing and minimizing functions. In addition to two weekly lectures, students attend a weekly recitation focused on applications. Placement into Calculus with Applications is decided by discussion with mentors and the results of a mathematics placement examination.    May not be taken if MATH-AD 110 Calculus is completed    This is a required course for Economics majors until the class of 2017. This course can be substituted with MATH-AD 110 Calculus.                                   This course has a discussion section .

Integration and differentiation of functions of several variables require new concepts and techniques. The course has applications to science and engineering as well as economics. Specific topics include vectors in the plane and space; partial derivatives with applications; double and triple integrals; spherical and cylindrical coordinates; surface and line integrals; and divergence, gradient, and curl. In addition, the theorems of Gauss and Stokes are rigorously introduced.

This course provides a better understanding of how we humans perceive and think about ourselves and about the world. This is relevant to psychology because our perception and thought processes are fraught with biases that nonetheless routinely inform human actions. Knowing about these biases and understanding their effects is crucial in a world in which human societies are becoming increasingly more interconnected. The course covers perception, attention, memory, language, concepts, reasoning, problem solving, expertise, creativity, and decision-making, while emphasizing how psychologists use experiments to learn about the structure of the human mind, including how the mind and human thinking works, with all its successes and pitfalls.

Concurrently, atomic theory, the theory of molecular bonding, and atomic and molecular structures and shapes, in which forces and energy play a role, are investigated. Students apply these concepts to understanding molecules related to the life sciences. Laboratory exercises focus on acquisition of data and analysis with a continued emphasis on technical presentation. Weekly discussion sections are designed to hone proficiency at solving problems in a collaborative, team environment.

Capacitors, current, and basic circuits are explored with an eye toward understanding their applications to chemical reactions and the behavior of living cells. The rates and directions of chemical reactions are explored as chemical kinetics and chemical equilibrium are investigated with a special focus on acid-base chemistry. These fundamental physical and chemical principles are used to describe basic cellular monomers and polymers including DNA, RNA, and protein, and the sequence of events that leads to information flow and its regulation in the cell nucleus. They are also applied to macroscopic systems found in the biosphere. Laboratory exercises focus on fundamental protocols and tools needed to sharpen basic laboratory skills. Weekly discussion sections are designed to hone proficiency at solving problems in a collaborative, team environment.

This leads to another question: If a specific function is desired, can a form or shape be engineered or modified to execute or improve that function? The course examines the form/function concept in magnetic and electrical fields, the behavior and design of small molecules, and the activity of proteins as the workhorse in biological systems. Laboratory exercises require students to design experiments related to crystals and crystallography, and to examine chemical forms at the macroscopic and microscopic levels. Weekly discussion sections are designed to hone proficiency at solving problems in a collaborative, team environment.

In physics, disturbances generate waves that are associated with the transmission of light and sound. These same waves generate responses in living organisms as sensory systems detect them, including nerves in some species. Electromagnetic waves, interactions among light, matter, and living systems are examined. Change during the growth of cells is explored at the molecular level as well. Laboratory exercises fuse physics, chemistry, and biology as students engage in projects related to recombinant DNA technology, gene cloning, and protein synthesis and characterization.

This is embodied in physics and chemistry in quantum theory and the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. But living systems provide countless examples of oscillatory events that possess inherent uncertainty when scientists try to predict outcomes. Indeed, this final chapter in Foundations of Science challenges students to consider the very nature of studying complex problems and systems and assessing the uncertainty associated with the scientific method. The laboratory exercises involve collaborative projects in which teams of students must apply their acquired knowledge and skills to design experiments focused on answering a question or solving a problem, keeping uncertainty in mind as they report their results and discuss additional data that would be need to provide a better answer or solution.
