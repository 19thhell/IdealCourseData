Establish criteria for development within the existing NYU footprint in the University\u2019s core location, and the surrounding neighborhoods that would prioritize.                       &mdash; Identifying opportunities to       decentralize facilities and actively       pursuing these opportunities;                            &mdash; Contextual development that is       sensitive to building heights, densities,       and materials;                            &mdash; Reuse before new development.                     &mdash; Considering mixed-use facilities that       complement Manhattan\u2019s mixed       neighborhoods, particularly in regard       to ground-floor uses.                       Identify solutions to maximize utilization of existing assets by consulting with the     community on:                           &mdash; The types of facilities that can be decentralized from the Village core and surrounding neighborhoods and cultivating locations outside these areas;                            &mdash; Preferences for appropriate places for vertical additions;                            &mdash; Encouraging programmatic and scheduling efficiencies; and                            &mdash; Opening new and reenvisioning existing recreational spaces to better serve both the student population as well as the community at large.                                      Make thoughtful urban and architectural design a priority by:                           &mdash; Respecting the limitations of the urban environment, including the impact on       New York City\u2019s infrastructure;                                   &mdash; Improving the quality of open spaces; and                            &mdash; Actively soliciting, utilizing, and implementing input from the community in the design process.                                            Support community sustainability by:                           &mdash; Preserving existing diverse social and economic character through the support of community efforts to sustain affordable housing and local retail;                                  &mdash; Exploring the utilization of ground floors of buildings for community-oriented uses such as local retail, gallery spaces for local artists, nonprofit users and other providers of community services; and                            &mdash; Generating a tenant relocation policy for legal, residential tenants, in the event that construction or conversion necessitates the relocation of tenants.                                            Respect for the community\u2019s existing qualities of life including, but not limited to:                           &mdash; Taking measures to mitigate effects of construction such as noise, dust, work hours; sound mitigation for mechanical equipment; and construction staging;                                  &mdash; Reaching out early and often for community consultation related to major construction;                            &mdash; Creating a Web site for ongoing constructions; and                            &mdash; Committing to a community-oriented public process for reviewing NYU\u2019s proposed projects and developments.
