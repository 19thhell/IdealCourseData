GIPH is invested in producing research of the highest caliber and houses a global public health research center, serving as a University-wide resource for large scale, multi-school, multi-disciplinary and multi-site research projects. GIPH research draws from faculty expertise on multiple topics in multiple geographic settings; coordinates administrative support; works collaboratively with community partners and constituents; and takes a comprehensive approach to research problems, incorporating complimentary perspectives and approaches from across disciplines.            Research Profile: NYU/Ghana Health Partnership                                   New York University and its affiliated public hospital, Bellevue Hospital Center , and the University of Ghana and its affiliated public hospital, the Korle Bu Teaching Hospital , have developed a multi-disciplinary collaboration for health professional development that will result in sustained and significant improvements in health and health care in Ghana and the United States. More recently, this NYU/Ghana Health partnership has expanded to include the new University of Health &amp; Allied Sciences (Volta) as well as the Ministry of Health and the Ghana Health Service.           A variety of projects are underway, involving faculty from several of NYU's schools (Dentistry, Medicine, Nursing, Steinhardt, Wagner). The partnership addresses a variety of topics, including but not limited to:     increasing the midlevel provider workforce in sub-saharan Africa   improving access to qualified health providers   improving health outcomes (including nutrition, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, oral health)     creating cost effectivenss to lower the financial burden on national financing systems   stengthening emergency medicine systems and services in Ghana            Research Highlights          Faculty who participate in the Global Institute of Public Health engage in a diverse and impressive array of research across the university.

Located in a school of public service rather than in a medical or public health school, our program crosses traditional boundaries, linking management, finance, policy, and providing students with the cutting-edge concepts and skills needed to shape the future of health policy and management.   Students receive a set of tools and experiences that allow them to understand both the delivery of health care services and the broader social, cultural, and economic factors that influence health outcomes. Our students experience firsthand the importance of health care delivery and health promotion in one of the most interesting, diverse, and complex cities in the world, and our graduates work in every sector of the health care system.

GIPH is invested in producing research of the highest caliber and houses a global public health research center, serving as a University-wide resource for large scale, multi-school, multi-disciplinary and multi-site research projects. GIPH research draws from faculty expertise on multiple topics in multiple geographic settings; coordinates administrative support; works collaboratively with community partners and constituents; and takes a comprehensive approach to research problems, incorporating complimentary perspectives and approaches from across disciplines.            Research Profile: NYU/Ghana Health Partnership                                   New York University and its affiliated public hospital, Bellevue Hospital Center , and the University of Ghana and its affiliated public hospital, the Korle Bu Teaching Hospital , have developed a multi-disciplinary collaboration for health professional development that will result in sustained and significant improvements in health and health care in Ghana and the United States. More recently, this NYU/Ghana Health partnership has expanded to include the new University of Health &amp; Allied Sciences (Volta) as well as the Ministry of Health and the Ghana Health Service.           A variety of projects are underway, involving faculty from several of NYU's schools (Dentistry, Medicine, Nursing, Steinhardt, Wagner).

Located in a school of public service rather than in a medical or public health school, our program crosses traditional boundaries, linking management, finance, policy, and providing students with the cutting-edge concepts and skills needed to shape the future of health policy and management.   Students receive a set of tools and experiences that allow them to understand both the delivery of health care services and the broader social, cultural, and economic factors that influence health outcomes. Our students experience firsthand the importance of health care delivery and health promotion in one of the most interesting, diverse, and complex cities in the world, and our graduates work in every sector of the health care system.
