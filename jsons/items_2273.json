Home Since its establishment in 1923, the Department of Music at New York University has held a central position in American music scholarship and creativity. NYU faculty member Gustave Reese was one of the founding members of The American Musicological Society in 1934, and by mid-century the department had attracted a world-renowned group of scholars and musicians, from the pioneering musicologist Curt Sachs to composers of both concert and popular music such as Marion Bauer and Percy Grainger. Building on this legacy, the Department established its ethnomusicology sub-field in 1978, and a composition and theory sub-field in 1992. It has since grown into one of the country\u2019s most exciting, intellectually vibrant centers for the interdisciplinary study of music and sound. The NYU Department of Music offers studies in historical musicology, ethnomusicology, and composition and theory at both the undergraduate and graduate levels. With its leading research faculty, the Department grants degrees of Bachelor of Arts and Doctor of Philosophy. The Department also sponsors a colloquium series, musical ensembles, graduate and undergraduate concerts, the Washington Square Contemporary Music Society concert series, and a range of interdisciplinary symposia/conferences. Our facilities include early and world music instrument collections, the Avery Fisher Center for Music and Media , and the Waverly Labs for Music and Computing , which provide faculty and students with equipment, lab and workshops spaces for research and creation in music and sound art.

Home Since its establishment in 1923, the Department of Music at New York University has held a central position in American music scholarship and creativity. NYU faculty member Gustave Reese was one of the founding members of The American Musicological Society in 1934, and by mid-century the department had attracted a world-renowned group of scholars and musicians, from the pioneering musicologist Curt Sachs to composers of both concert and popular music such as Marion Bauer and Percy Grainger. Building on this legacy, the Department established its ethnomusicology sub-field in 1978, and a composition and theory sub-field in 1992. It has since grown into one of the country\u2019s most exciting, intellectually vibrant centers for the interdisciplinary study of music and sound. The NYU Department of Music offers studies in historical musicology, ethnomusicology, and composition and theory at both the undergraduate and graduate levels. With its leading research faculty, the Department grants degrees of Bachelor of Arts and Doctor of Philosophy. The Department also sponsors a colloquium series, musical ensembles, graduate and undergraduate concerts, the Washington Square Contemporary Music Society concert series, and a range of interdisciplinary symposia/conferences. Our facilities include early and world music instrument collections, the Avery Fisher Center for Music and Media , and the Waverly Labs for Music and Computing , which provide faculty and students with equipment, lab and workshops spaces for research and creation in music and sound art.

Recordings:        Plekto - Iannis Xenakis    Plekt&oacute; is one of Xenakis&rsquo; lesser-known works, composed in the later part of his career. The piece was premiered in 1994 at the Wittener Tage f&uuml;r Neue Kammermusik, by the Ensemble K&ouml;ln. The title stems from the Greek verb &ldquo;plek,&rdquo; which means, &ldquo;to weave.&rdquo; Throughout the work, a variety of contrapuntal shapes and textures are woven together, although unlike many of Xenakis&rsquo; works where these lines contribute to an overall mass of sound, he seems to have placed much more emphasis on the individual in Plekt&oacute;. In addition, the work features a multi-metric section in which each of the six performers are playing at different tempi, similar to one of Xenakis&rsquo; earlier pieces, Persephassa.        Miss Donnithorne's Maggot was conceived at the party following the first performance in 1969 of Eight Songs for a Mad King . Randolph Stow, who wrote the text for the very serious and tragic Eight Songs said, &ldquo;Let's write a funny one, as a sequel.&rdquo; Miss Donnithorne was born five years later, and her music is more introvert, more contemplative, and, I would think, ultimately more disturbing than that written for George III, the Mad King, certainly only &ldquo;funny&rdquo; in a most qualified manner. The music refers constantly to the Victorian salon music with which one must assume Miss Donnithorne was familiar. After the Prelude, her song Green Mooned the White Lady is even strophic, in the manner of a Victorian ballad. The next song starts with a quotation from Shakespeare's Hamlet, &ldquo;They say the owl was a baker's daughter,&rdquo; and the ensemble evokes an empty house full of clocks, at first ticking, and eventually chiming and jangling through the protagonist's disturbed, distorted memories of her tragic wedding day. The Harbour Lay on Her Indigo Back is based on a dump, an Elizabethan dance form, but the surface is close to a Victorian quadrille. The purely instrumental Nocturne that follows is a dreamy distant cousin of Gustav Lange's Blumenlied, a very popular display piece for aspiring late nineteenth-century lady pianists. In Her Rant (On the Doorsills of My Cake) Miss Donnithorne hears sailors drill-marching: her betrothed was a sailor, the music is essentially military - except for her vulgar excursions into Jenny Lind-like operatic recitative. In the following recitative, In the Dusty Afternoon, the Victorian piano style becomes even more distorted into her over-heated personal memories and fantasies, while the violin accompaniment to her actual words suggests the theatrical traditions of Victorian music hall. (Could such a well-bred Victorian lady ever have visited such a common establishment?) Her final reel (Hark, Hark, His Voice!) refers to both Mendelssohn's and Wagner's Wedding March, and quite literally has the lady reeling drunk on her own dandelion wine, as her fantasies about her betrothed become ever more lurid. In her ramblings she hears a bosun's whistle (is it the wind through the trees?), evoking the presence of the betrothed in the next room. She ecstatically rushes into his imagined arms, to a cheap tune summing up the whole masquerade, and we realize that she is imprisoned absolutely in these imaginings in this music, forever estranged and alone. (Peter Maxwell Davies)                          Bash for flute, clarinet, percussion, piano, violin, viola, cello, bass is a joyful party of clashing ideas, Bash is the third piece of a trilogy for quartet, duo and octet of similar instrumentation, in which the musical theme originates in Headspring, wanders around in Wander &amp; Wonder, and clashes with itself in Bash . (Ruben Naeff) After studying mathematics and music in Amsterdam and working some years as an economist, Ruben Naeff is currently enrolled in a graduate program at New York University, where he studies composition with Michael Gordon. Ruben&rsquo;s broad interest led to many interdisciplinary pieces like De B&egrave;tacanon (about the hard sciences), The Dancing Dollar (about the current financial crisis), and the YouOpera .
