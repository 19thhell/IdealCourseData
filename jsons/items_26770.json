While science seeks to grasp phenomena by bringing them under general concepts and laws, the historian and the appreciative spectator seek to make sense of their objects of study in all their individuality. This project will investigate the idea of individualizing understanding, and how far it characterizes aesthetic and historical practice. It will attempt to articulate various options for what individualizing understanding might be. It will do so by considering the aesthetic case, and then ask how far the historical case fits those options. Although it is not likely that historical understanding, in particular, can be understood solely in these terms, this project&rsquo;s working hypothesis is that some important strands in historical inquiry, and perhaps the central aspects of aesthetic interrogation, are usefully conceived in these ways. Click here for a more detailed description.            The project will feature three workshops and a final conference hosted at New York University and the University of Sheffield. Participants will include philosophers of art and history, archaeologists, and historians, including historians of both philosophy and of history itself.

The course is structured thematically,        and as a result we discuss a number of interrelated aspects        of photographic history without following a linear &quot;time        line.&quot;         Aesthetic        History, by contrast, is structured chronologically, and        will provide a totally different historical perspective.        We will be focusing on the development of art photography,        which is ONE of many photographic traditions, and examining        the evolution of that singular tradition &#8211; mainly,        but not exclusively, in Europe and North America -- over        the past 150 years. We will read a cross-section of photographic        criticism and theory, but we will also look closely at        a number of individual artists in order to ascertain how        they felt about their medium, how they defined &quot;art,&quot;        and how they related to other, more established visual        traditions. I want students to understand how artists        learn from and respond to their peers, and how this interchange        has shaped a separate, self-conscious and highly elitist        tradition within the history of a democratic medium.        I've        attached a reading list, which consists of selections        from Trachtenberg's Classic Essays on Photography ,        Goldberg's Photography in Print and a packet of        Xeroxes that have been placed on reserve in The Art History        Department Library (Silver Center, 3rd Floor) and that        are also available for purchase at the NYU Bookstore (726        Broadway). These essays must be supplemented by independent        readings in Naomi Rosenblum&#8217;s World History of        Photography (which is available at the bookstore)        or any one of the other basic photo history books by Frizot,        Newhall or Marien (all are on reserve, take your pick).        You will be responsible for one exam and two papers that        will test your understanding of both images and ideas.        Studying for these will be made much easier if you use        the class web site: www.nyu.edu/classes/ finearts/photo.        To enter the site you need the ID (photo) and the Password        (rice).
