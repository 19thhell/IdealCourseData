For three decades, NYU has prepared students for successful careers as archivists, manuscript curators, documentary editors, oral historians, cultural resource managers, historical interpreters, and new media specialists. The program emphasizes a solid grounding in historical scholarship, intense engagement with new media technologies, and close involvement with New York\u2019s extraordinary archival and public history institutions.

As part of their core coursework , students have the opportunity to embark on independent research (capstone projects) using the unique resources of New York City as their public history and archives laboratory. In addition, internships are integrated with coursework, contributing to a professionalized and constructive learning environment.    See the Program page for information on application procedures and requirements, financial aid, advanced certificates in archives and public history, and the dual-degree program with Long Island University. See also the program brochure . For additional information, contact the director of the program, Professor Peter J. Wosh .
