interdisciplinary, three-year program with the NYU Global Institute of Public Health is for students who seek to combine social work and public health with a global focus. At completion of the program, students will have earned a Master of Social Work degree (MSW) and a Master of Public Health degree (MPH). Courses are taught by professors drawn from relevant programs across five schools at NYU, including the Silver School of Social Work; the Robert F. Wagner Graduate School of Public Service; the School of Medicine; the College of Dentistry (including the College of Nursing); and the Steinhardt School of Culture, Education and Human Development.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          The dual degrees are designed to provide the necessary skill sets for graduating students to pursue professional careers in both social work and public health, and prepare them for leadership roles in community healthcare settings, government agencies, and non-profit organizations in the United States and internationally.   Students in the MSW/MPH program would enroll as full-time students taking courses within each program concurrently. The MSW/MPH option is available to those choosing the Global Health Leadership MPH concentration.   Please note that neither degree is conferred until the requirements for both degrees are fulfilled.

interdisciplinary, three-year program with the NYU Global Institute of Public Health is for students who seek to combine social work and public health with a global focus. At completion of the program, students will have earned a Master of Social Work degree (MSW) and a Master of Public Health degree (MPH). Courses are taught by professors drawn from relevant programs across five schools at NYU, including the Silver School of Social Work; the Robert F. Wagner Graduate School of Public Service; the School of Medicine; the College of Dentistry (including the College of Nursing); and the Steinhardt School of Culture, Education and Human Development.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          The dual degrees are designed to provide the necessary skill sets for graduating students to pursue professional careers in both social work and public health, and prepare them for leadership roles in community healthcare settings, government agencies, and non-profit organizations in the United States and internationally.   Students in the MSW/MPH program would enroll as full-time students taking courses within each program concurrently. The MSW/MPH option is available to those choosing the Global Health Leadership MPH concentration.   Please note that neither degree is conferred until the requirements for both degrees are fulfilled.

The internship is a culminating experience that broadens students' exposure to public health practice, facilitates valuable work experience, and increases students' knowledge of specific career opportunities. Placements are semester long (180 hours) and are meant to provide students with the opportunity to observe a public health professional in practice, complete a public health project that is mutually beneficial to the student and the organization, and synthesize knowledge and skills into public health practice. In addition, students attend mandatory seminars where the principles and practices of public health are examined and student\u00e2\u0080\u0099s awareness of the needs, challenges, and career opportunities in the field are further broadened.   Course Goal: To provide practical situations where students can apply the knowledge and theoretical concepts from coursework into practice settings, strengthen existing skills and apply public health core competencies in a new setting and/or on a public health topic or population of interest.    Objectives:     To allow students to gain exposure and practice in the ASPH core competencies in public health expected of Master-level public health professionals which are divided into Discipline-specific and Interdesciplinary/Cross-cutting Competencies :    a. Discipline Specific Competencies: Biostatistics, Environmental Health Sciences, Epidemiology, Health Policy &amp; Management, Social &amp; Behavioral Sciences    b. Interdisciplinary/Cross-cutting Competencies: Communication &amp; Informatics, Diversity &amp; Culture, Leadership, Public Health Biology, Professionalism, Program Planning, Systems Thinking   To provide an environment that encourages students to integrate learned behaviors, research and community service activities.   To allow students to be able to identify methods for describing and analyzing the structure and governance of public health organizations.   To allow students to be able to identify and apply methods used by organizations to improve the health of their target populations.   To allow students to be able to describe factors that lead to the effectiveness and stability of national or international public health organizations.   To give students an opportunity to determine requirements of information, personnel, time, and equipment needed to implement programs that address public health needs.

Click here for more information about the Capstone culminating experience   Capstone is learning in action. Serving as the culminating experience for the Global Health Leadership concentration, it provides students with both a critical learning experience and an opportunity to perform a public service. Over the course of an academic year, students work in teams -- either to address challenges, solve problems and identify opportunities for a client organization or to conduct research on a pressing social question. Ultimately, Capstone contributes not only to the students' education, but is a university resource for the public good. In architecture, the capstone is the crowning piece of an arch, the center stone that holds the arch together, giving it shape and strength. The Capstone program plays a similar role, by integrating and enhancing student learning in several different arenas: a content or issue area, key process skills including project management and teamwork, and methods for gathering, analyzing and reporting data. Capstone requires students to interweave their learning in all these areas, and to do so in real time, in an unpredictable, complex real world environment. Although each student will be assigned to a team, the class will work as a learning community dedicated to the success of all the projects.

interdisciplinary, three-year program with the NYU Global Institute of Public Health is for students who seek to combine social work and public health with a global focus. At completion of the program, students will have earned a Master of Social Work degree (MSW) and a Master of Public Health degree (MPH). Courses are taught by professors drawn from relevant programs across five schools at NYU, including the Silver School of Social Work; the Robert F. Wagner Graduate School of Public Service; the School of Medicine; the College of Dentistry (including the College of Nursing); and the Steinhardt School of Culture, Education and Human Development.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          The dual degrees are designed to provide the necessary skill sets for graduating students to pursue professional careers in both social work and public health, and prepare them for leadership roles in community healthcare settings, government agencies, and non-profit organizations in the United States and internationally.   Students in the MSW/MPH program would enroll as full-time students taking courses within each program concurrently. The MSW/MPH option is available to those choosing the Global Health Leadership MPH concentration.   Please note that neither degree is conferred until the requirements for both degrees are fulfilled.

The internship is a culminating experience that broadens students' exposure to public health practice, facilitates valuable work experience, and increases students' knowledge of specific career opportunities. Placements are semester long (180 hours) and are meant to provide students with the opportunity to observe a public health professional in practice, complete a public health project that is mutually beneficial to the student and the organization, and synthesize knowledge and skills into public health practice. In addition, students attend mandatory seminars where the principles and practices of public health are examined and student\u00e2\u0080\u0099s awareness of the needs, challenges, and career opportunities in the field are further broadened.   Course Goal: To provide practical situations where students can apply the knowledge and theoretical concepts from coursework into practice settings, strengthen existing skills and apply public health core competencies in a new setting and/or on a public health topic or population of interest.    Objectives:     To allow students to gain exposure and practice in the ASPH core competencies in public health expected of Master-level public health professionals which are divided into Discipline-specific and Interdesciplinary/Cross-cutting Competencies :    a. Discipline Specific Competencies: Biostatistics, Environmental Health Sciences, Epidemiology, Health Policy &amp; Management, Social &amp; Behavioral Sciences    b. Interdisciplinary/Cross-cutting Competencies: Communication &amp; Informatics, Diversity &amp; Culture, Leadership, Public Health Biology, Professionalism, Program Planning, Systems Thinking   To provide an environment that encourages students to integrate learned behaviors, research and community service activities.   To allow students to be able to identify methods for describing and analyzing the structure and governance of public health organizations.   To allow students to be able to identify and apply methods used by organizations to improve the health of their target populations.   To allow students to be able to describe factors that lead to the effectiveness and stability of national or international public health organizations.   To give students an opportunity to determine requirements of information, personnel, time, and equipment needed to implement programs that address public health needs.

Click here for more information about the Capstone culminating experience   Capstone is learning in action. Serving as the culminating experience for the Global Health Leadership concentration, it provides students with both a critical learning experience and an opportunity to perform a public service. Over the course of an academic year, students work in teams -- either to address challenges, solve problems and identify opportunities for a client organization or to conduct research on a pressing social question. Ultimately, Capstone contributes not only to the students' education, but is a university resource for the public good. In architecture, the capstone is the crowning piece of an arch, the center stone that holds the arch together, giving it shape and strength. The Capstone program plays a similar role, by integrating and enhancing student learning in several different arenas: a content or issue area, key process skills including project management and teamwork, and methods for gathering, analyzing and reporting data. Capstone requires students to interweave their learning in all these areas, and to do so in real time, in an unpredictable, complex real world environment. Although each student will be assigned to a team, the class will work as a learning community dedicated to the success of all the projects.

Part of the core curriculum of the Masters program in Global Public Health, it provides students with both a critical learning experience and an opportunity to perform a public service. Over the course of an academic year, students work in teams -- either to address challenges, solve problems and identify opportunities for a client organization or to conduct research on a pressing social question. Ultimately, Capstone contributes not only to the students' education, but is a university resource for the public good. In architecture, the capstone is the crowning piece of an arch, the center stone that holds the arch together, giving it shape and strength.
