Based on this information, you will learn how to evaluate a company&rsquo;s operating and financial performance; how to develop an appropriate capital structure by structuring debt and equity transactions which not only protect both the creditors and shareholders, but also create an appropriate risk and reward equilibrium; and how to formulate an educated investment opinion.

BACK TO TOP  International Reporting and Analysis ACCT.GB-6335  3 credits. Fall and spring terms. Prerequisites:    ACCT.UB-0003 Financial Statement Analysis  International business and the integration of capital markets around the globe have spurred a growing interest among financial managers and investors in the fortunes of international business enterprises. For the most part, financial information about these entities are contained in published financial statements. The problem is that readers removed from the local scene must often read and interpret financial accounts that have been prepared in an environmental context that is different from their own. This invariably leads to problems of understanding and interpretation. The objective of this course is to introduce you to the international dimensions of financial statement analysis. We will examine differences in measurement practices that exist internationally, the reasons for these differences, their resultant financial statement effects and methods that analysts and financial managers can use to deal with such differences. We will also examine some of the institutional structures that are evolving to deal with the issue of international accounting diversity.

BACK TO TOP  International Reporting and Analysis ACCT.GB-6335  3 credits. Fall and spring terms. Prerequisites:    ACCT.UB-0003 Financial Statement Analysis  International business and the integration of capital markets around the globe have spurred a growing interest among financial managers and investors in the fortunes of international business enterprises. For the most part, financial information about these entities are contained in published financial statements. The problem is that readers removed from the local scene must often read and interpret financial accounts that have been prepared in an environmental context that is different from their own. This invariably leads to problems of understanding and interpretation. The objective of this course is to introduce you to the international dimensions of financial statement analysis. We will examine differences in measurement practices that exist internationally, the reasons for these differences, their resultant financial statement effects and methods that analysts and financial managers can use to deal with such differences. We will also examine some of the institutional structures that are evolving to deal with the issue of international accounting diversity.
