Ranging from projects as awesome as the human genome study to the quotidian changes wrought by the personal computer, the scope and impact of science is unparalleled. We have come to expect constant innovation and paradigmatic revolution, but are still regularly challenged by scientific discovery. Science Studies explores the historical and contemporary ramifications of science and the scientific mode of inquiry. Drawing on the major research arms of the Graduate School, Science in Society develops technological familiarity and scientific literacy while investigating ways of discussing and better interpreting science and technology.  Sample Courses: Students should refer to a current class schedule each semester to   determine current course offerings.The list below is representative, not exhaustive. Introduction to Science Studies I G65.1109 Surveys   science from a variety of philosophical, sociological, historical,   linguistic, anthropological, and critical perspectives. Explores debates   over constructivism, relativism, and the uses to which scientific   knowledge is put by examining how cultural boundaries between science   and nonscience are constructed and maintained. Introduction   to Science Studies II G65.1110 Examines how new and   emerging knowledges and technologies, such as cold fusion, genetics,   cloning, organ transplantation, and assisted conception, are   problematizing boundaries that are assumed to be natural and fixed,   while at the same time remaking the social structures that support   science. Topics in Science Studies: Thinking About Tomorrow G65.3007 Focuses   on the many roles of the future in Western cultures over the last   several centuries. Its ability to serve as a blank canvas has made it an   ideal location for projecting and working out today\u2019s concerns and   anxieties. Such projections, meanwhile, often feed back into the   present, becoming the basis for restructuring social and cultural   relationships that, in turn, give rise to the world of tomorrow. Over   the course of the semester, students assemble some basic conceptual   tools for understanding discussion of the future, as well as talk about   why modern societies encourage so many predictions of things to come.   The course looks into particular sites of futuristic imagery, including   fiction, space travel, warfare, urban planning, nanotechnology, and the   end of the world, and touches on the characteristics and implications of   future predictions that failed.  Topics in Science Studies   seminars examine particularly focused subject matter and themes, which   change frequently. Previous seminars have included \u201cRace, Science, and   Technology\u201d and \u201cScience, Religion, and the Modern State.\u201d A History of Media Theory G65.2193 It   has become commonplace for theories of media to attribute massive   psycho-cultural transformations to their influence. Homeric Greeks (like   other \u201ctribal\u201d peoples) lacked an interior self because they lived in   an \u201coral\u201d world. The phonetic alphabet made philosophy possible. Print   underlies bureaucracy and mechanization. TV creates a \u201cglobal village.\u201d   Multimedia technologies on the Internet undermine (or realize)   centralized attempts to control social meaning. And so on. The primary   aim of this course is to raise the underlying, and as yet unanswered,   questions upon which all such media theory depends: To what extent does   the emerging age, the age we live in now (postindustrial,   postphilosophical, postmodern, post-Western, information age, late   capitalism), recover certain characteristics of oral/traditional   culture? To what extent does it preserve or intensify or dilute   characteristics of print/modern culture? To what extent is it   constituting something entirely new?
