What are the ethical, political, cultural, legal and  personal stakes in witnessing? Can photography and other media turn us into  witnesses, or do we have to witness events personally for our testimony to be  valid? What is the difference between documenting and witnessing an event? What  is the difference between rendering an account and giving testimony? What role  has photography played in the formation of our contemporary understanding of  witnessing, and how does contemporary photography bear witness?      Witnessing  is a critical concept in religion, law and science that has received renewed  attention in recent years in the fields of art, photography, literature and  cultural studies as well. The course will examine foundational texts on the  notion of witnessing to arrive at a working definition that distinguishes  witnessing from documentation. A parallel focus will be on photography\u2019s  particular function as witness, and on the changing nature of both the medium  and the needs for historical witnessing in our time.      Readings by  Jorge Borges, Walter Benjamin, Emmanuel Levinas, Jacques Derrida, Nadine  Gordimer, John Berger, Roland Barthes, Shoshana Felman, Cathy Caruth, Dora  Apel, Hilton Als, Judith Butler, Tim O\u2019Brien, Susan Sontag, Barbie Zelizer and  others.      Photographers  include Jacob Riis, Lewis Hine, Alexander Gardner, Dorothea Lange, Diane Arbus,  Glen Ligon, Helen Levitt, Walter Evans, Robert Frank, James Nachtwey, Margaret  Bourke-White, Ernest Cole, Mikael Levin, Gilles Peress, Susan Meiselas,  Sebastiao Salgado, Gary Winogrand, Carrie Mae Weems and others.      Seminar on post-Symbolist Poetry: Ezra Pound Sieburth Designed to introduce students to Pound\u2019s oeuvre as a whole\u2014and to its central place within ongoing debates about modernism and post-modernism\u2014the course will include readings from Personae, The Cantos, and The Translations, as well as from The Chinese Written character, Literary Essays, Selected Prose, Guide to Kulchur, and selected wartime radio broadcasts. Background readings will include not only such standard works as Kenner\u2019s The Pound Era, but also more recent reassessments of Pound\u2019s poetics, politics, and economics. Pound= \u201can enclosure for stray animals.\u201d Special Topics in Theory: The Subject of Freedom Basterra      Freedom,  writes Kant, manifests itself through the moral law, which \u201cthrusts itself upon  us on its own.\u201d Freedom, Levinas would  write almost two centuries later, is \u201cineluctably invoked\u201d by a command that  \u201cslips in me like a thief.\u201d Should we understand freedom as being inseparable  from obligation, from a responsibility one has not chosen to take in any  present? And if the law that obligates  us does not exactly originate in ourselves, would autonomy consist in believing  oneself the author of \u2013 and thus becoming responsible for \u2013 something one has  received?      This  seminar explores freedom theoretically as a concept that enables thinking by  introducing a boundary, and practically as something other that animates  subjectivity. It begins by analyzing the  possibilities the exceptional concept of freedom opens up for theoretical  reason in Kant\u2019s Critique of Pure Reason.    But freedom would be inconceivable without presupposing the idea of a  subject through which freedom would manifest itself. For there to be freedom, there have to be  subjects animated by freedom, subjects which, traversed by freedom, could  introduce its effects in the world. In  being constituted by freedom, the subject could then be imagined to play the  role of limit that enables theoretical thinking, but the ability to undestand  how freedom affects subjects and motivates the power of desire lies beyond  theoretical reason\u2019s reach.      Careful  readings of Kant\u2019s \u201cAttempt to Introduce the Concept of Negative Magnitudes  into Philosophy\u201d (1763), and of selections from Dreams of a Spirit-Seer (1766),  Critique of Pure Reason (1781/87), Critique of Practical Reason (1788), and  Religion within the Bounds of Bare Reason (1793) will structure our  discussions. We will put them in  conversation with works by Rousseau, Heidegger, Deleuze, Nancy, Levinas.      Topics in Black Literature: Fanon and Glissant Diawara The  purpose of this course is to explore the historical, political and esthetic  contexts which led to the emergence of Fanon\u2019s seminal texts of decolonization and  cultural nationalism ( Black Skin White  Mask and The Wretched of the Earth )  and Glissant\u2019s theories of Creolization and Tout-Monde ( Caribbean Discourse , The  Poetics of Relation , and The  Philosophy of Relation ). It is important to bear in mind that Fanon (1925) and  Glissant (1928) were contemporaries, from the same Island, Martinique, and exposed  to the same French assimilationist education, which was already put to test by  Sartrean readings of Marx and Freud, the affirmations of essential African  identities by the Negritude movement, and the postwar agitations against racism  and colonization.  Discourse and Society: The Renaissance Spatial Turn Duffy This seminar will explore two linked intellectual revolutions: the cosmographic revolution of the European Renaissance and the Postmodern Spatial turn in twentieth and twenty-first-century critical theory and philosophy. Starting from the spatial arguments in Aristotle and Plato through the works of Ortelius, Oronce Fine, Kepler, Mercator, Bruno, and others, we will establish a context in which to consider the spatial turn in the work of philosophers and critics including Foucault, Lefebvre, Deleuze, Soja, Casey, and Conley. Throuhgout the course, we will work to apply this long history of spatial thinking to some major works of European Renaissance literature including Petrarch's Canzoniere and Familiares , Bartolome de las Casas's writings, Joachim du Bellay's Roman poetry, Spenser's Faerie Queene, Donne's lyrics, and Milton's Paradise Lost.      Prisms of Modernity: Bare Life, Fascism, Post-dictatorship &amp; Neoliberalism in Spain Matos-Martin Recent transformative events such  as the financial collapse, the Eurozone crisis, the dismantling of the social  welfare system, labor reforms, austerity measures or massive unemployment have  opened a historical temporality in Spain in which large sectors of society have  been progressively degraded to an \u201cunworthy\u201d and unprotected life, a life with  no proper juridical or socially recognized status\u2014a \u201cbare\u201d life (Agamben). The  existence of such lives, however, are nothing new in Spain. In fact, they have  been widespread with different intensities, of course, not only in times of  hardship but also in periods of economic prosperity. This course proposes an  examination of contemporary Spanish culture following that thread of bare life  and tracing it back to the Spanish Civil War. By comparing and relating today\u2019s  massive precarization of bodies with memories of previous experiences of  marginalization, abandonment or exclusion (Franco\u2019s regime, the so-called  transition to democracy, and post-dictatorial Spain), we might study the dark  side of Spanish Modernity. Theoretical readings might include, among others,  Benjamin, Arendt, Schmitt, Foucault, Agamben, Esposito, Butler, Negri and  Ranci\u00e8re.     Documents and Documentary Modes in Literature, Film, and Visual Culture Vatulescu      What do we mean by document,  documentary, and fiction? How have these concepts and their relationships  changed through time? This course starts by considering the beginnings of  documentary in literature, film, and the visual arts, from the controversial  coining of the term in 1926. We will explore representative works from  foundational moments in the evolution of documentary\u2014the beginnings of the  newsreel, Soviet and Nazi propaganda, American depression era documentary  books, the cin\u00e9ma-v\u00e9rit\u00e9 movement, and the rise of autobiographical/personal  documentary films. How has the emergence of this new term and its development  affected our other key concepts\u2014document and fiction? What is the relationship  between documentary modes and particular media and technologies\u2014print,  photography, cinema, video, and digital? Other topics include the role of the  artist, indexicality and representation, literature as historical document,  \u201cfiction in the archives,\u201d false documents and forgery, collage, illustration,  and other uses of the document in twentieth century art. Critical and  theoretical readings by Paula Amad, Eric Barnouw, Roland Barthes, Stella Bruzzi,  Jane Gaines, Carlo Ginzburg, Jacques Derrida, Giorgio Agamben, Barbara Johnson,  Bill Nichols, Philip Rosen, Vivian Sobchack, Susan Sontag, Jacques Ranci\u00e8re,  Edward Said, Alan Sekula, Sven Spieker, Ann Stoler, Diana Taylor, and others. This semester's special topics are 1) word/image relations and 2) the archive. Theoretical forays around and into the archive will be complemented by hands-on research in the Tamiment archive or in an archive of your choice.      Topics in Lit &amp; Modern Culture: Queer Critique Huber      This seminar begins with a brief genealogy  of critique, focusing primarily on its modern itinerary as a practice or ethos  that exposes the complexity, contingency and violence in the given order of  things. At the outset, we will rely on Kant\u2019s model of critique as a patient  reflection on the limits of reason, but we will follow the practice as it  deviates and disperses, tending toward an attitude that seeks not simply to  limn limits, but to radically question them. Critique begins then to ask after  other ways of being, doing and thinking. We will read Foucault and Butler for  their accounts of critique as a richly embodied, urgent and often risky  practice, paying particular attention to the elaboration of an ethics and  critical practice enabled by one\u2019s perspectives and unruly investments, shaped  as these are by larger sexual, racial and class formations. How might our  desires incite critique, and how might critique, in turn, incite our desires?  Queer and critique are terms that slide with great latitude; we will ask if  there is a tacit traffic between them. Is there something decidedly queer about  critique? In the seminar\u2019s final  section, we will focus on queer of color critique (Mu\u00f1oz, Ferguson, Reddy, and  Chen), in order to move toward a fuller consideration of those powers that  produce, organize, constrain, differentiate and mobilize us.       Readings will include: Plato, Kant, Marx, Nietzsche, Gramsci,  Luk\u00e1cs, Benjamin, Koselleck, Foucault, Butler, Mbembe, Spivak, Brown, Asad, Mahmood, Eng, Shah,  Mu\u00f1oz, Ferguson, Chen among others.

What are the ethical, political, cultural, legal and  personal stakes in witnessing? Can photography and other media turn us into  witnesses, or do we have to witness events personally for our testimony to be  valid? What is the difference between documenting and witnessing an event? What  is the difference between rendering an account and giving testimony? What role  has photography played in the formation of our contemporary understanding of  witnessing, and how does contemporary photography bear witness?      Witnessing  is a critical concept in religion, law and science that has received renewed  attention in recent years in the fields of art, photography, literature and  cultural studies as well. The course will examine foundational texts on the  notion of witnessing to arrive at a working definition that distinguishes  witnessing from documentation. A parallel focus will be on photography\u2019s  particular function as witness, and on the changing nature of both the medium  and the needs for historical witnessing in our time.      Readings by  Jorge Borges, Walter Benjamin, Emmanuel Levinas, Jacques Derrida, Nadine  Gordimer, John Berger, Roland Barthes, Shoshana Felman, Cathy Caruth, Dora  Apel, Hilton Als, Judith Butler, Tim O\u2019Brien, Susan Sontag, Barbie Zelizer and  others.      Photographers  include Jacob Riis, Lewis Hine, Alexander Gardner, Dorothea Lange, Diane Arbus,  Glen Ligon, Helen Levitt, Walter Evans, Robert Frank, James Nachtwey, Margaret  Bourke-White, Ernest Cole, Mikael Levin, Gilles Peress, Susan Meiselas,  Sebastiao Salgado, Gary Winogrand, Carrie Mae Weems and others.      Seminar on post-Symbolist Poetry: Ezra Pound Sieburth Designed to introduce students to Pound\u2019s oeuvre as a whole\u2014and to its central place within ongoing debates about modernism and post-modernism\u2014the course will include readings from Personae, The Cantos, and The Translations, as well as from The Chinese Written character, Literary Essays, Selected Prose, Guide to Kulchur, and selected wartime radio broadcasts. Background readings will include not only such standard works as Kenner\u2019s The Pound Era, but also more recent reassessments of Pound\u2019s poetics, politics, and economics. Pound= \u201can enclosure for stray animals.\u201d Special Topics in Theory: The Subject of Freedom Basterra      Freedom,  writes Kant, manifests itself through the moral law, which \u201cthrusts itself upon  us on its own.\u201d Freedom, Levinas would  write almost two centuries later, is \u201cineluctably invoked\u201d by a command that  \u201cslips in me like a thief.\u201d Should we understand freedom as being inseparable  from obligation, from a responsibility one has not chosen to take in any  present? And if the law that obligates  us does not exactly originate in ourselves, would autonomy consist in believing  oneself the author of \u2013 and thus becoming responsible for \u2013 something one has  received?      This  seminar explores freedom theoretically as a concept that enables thinking by  introducing a boundary, and practically as something other that animates  subjectivity. It begins by analyzing the  possibilities the exceptional concept of freedom opens up for theoretical  reason in Kant\u2019s Critique of Pure Reason.    But freedom would be inconceivable without presupposing the idea of a  subject through which freedom would manifest itself. For there to be freedom, there have to be  subjects animated by freedom, subjects which, traversed by freedom, could  introduce its effects in the world. In  being constituted by freedom, the subject could then be imagined to play the  role of limit that enables theoretical thinking, but the ability to undestand  how freedom affects subjects and motivates the power of desire lies beyond  theoretical reason\u2019s reach.      Careful  readings of Kant\u2019s \u201cAttempt to Introduce the Concept of Negative Magnitudes  into Philosophy\u201d (1763), and of selections from Dreams of a Spirit-Seer (1766),  Critique of Pure Reason (1781/87), Critique of Practical Reason (1788), and  Religion within the Bounds of Bare Reason (1793) will structure our  discussions. We will put them in  conversation with works by Rousseau, Heidegger, Deleuze, Nancy, Levinas.      Topics in Black Literature: Fanon and Glissant Diawara The  purpose of this course is to explore the historical, political and esthetic  contexts which led to the emergence of Fanon\u2019s seminal texts of decolonization and  cultural nationalism ( Black Skin White  Mask and The Wretched of the Earth )  and Glissant\u2019s theories of Creolization and Tout-Monde ( Caribbean Discourse , The  Poetics of Relation , and The  Philosophy of Relation ). It is important to bear in mind that Fanon (1925) and  Glissant (1928) were contemporaries, from the same Island, Martinique, and exposed  to the same French assimilationist education, which was already put to test by  Sartrean readings of Marx and Freud, the affirmations of essential African  identities by the Negritude movement, and the postwar agitations against racism  and colonization.  Discourse and Society: The Renaissance Spatial Turn Duffy This seminar will explore two linked intellectual revolutions: the cosmographic revolution of the European Renaissance and the Postmodern Spatial turn in twentieth and twenty-first-century critical theory and philosophy. Starting from the spatial arguments in Aristotle and Plato through the works of Ortelius, Oronce Fine, Kepler, Mercator, Bruno, and others, we will establish a context in which to consider the spatial turn in the work of philosophers and critics including Foucault, Lefebvre, Deleuze, Soja, Casey, and Conley. Throuhgout the course, we will work to apply this long history of spatial thinking to some major works of European Renaissance literature including Petrarch's Canzoniere and Familiares , Bartolome de las Casas's writings, Joachim du Bellay's Roman poetry, Spenser's Faerie Queene, Donne's lyrics, and Milton's Paradise Lost.      Prisms of Modernity: Bare Life, Fascism, Post-dictatorship &amp; Neoliberalism in Spain Matos-Martin Recent transformative events such  as the financial collapse, the Eurozone crisis, the dismantling of the social  welfare system, labor reforms, austerity measures or massive unemployment have  opened a historical temporality in Spain in which large sectors of society have  been progressively degraded to an \u201cunworthy\u201d and unprotected life, a life with  no proper juridical or socially recognized status\u2014a \u201cbare\u201d life (Agamben). The  existence of such lives, however, are nothing new in Spain. In fact, they have  been widespread with different intensities, of course, not only in times of  hardship but also in periods of economic prosperity. This course proposes an  examination of contemporary Spanish culture following that thread of bare life  and tracing it back to the Spanish Civil War. By comparing and relating today\u2019s  massive precarization of bodies with memories of previous experiences of  marginalization, abandonment or exclusion (Franco\u2019s regime, the so-called  transition to democracy, and post-dictatorial Spain), we might study the dark  side of Spanish Modernity. Theoretical readings might include, among others,  Benjamin, Arendt, Schmitt, Foucault, Agamben, Esposito, Butler, Negri and  Ranci\u00e8re.     Documents and Documentary Modes in Literature, Film, and Visual Culture Vatulescu      What do we mean by document,  documentary, and fiction? How have these concepts and their relationships  changed through time? This course starts by considering the beginnings of  documentary in literature, film, and the visual arts, from the controversial  coining of the term in 1926. We will explore representative works from  foundational moments in the evolution of documentary\u2014the beginnings of the  newsreel, Soviet and Nazi propaganda, American depression era documentary  books, the cin\u00e9ma-v\u00e9rit\u00e9 movement, and the rise of autobiographical/personal  documentary films. How has the emergence of this new term and its development  affected our other key concepts\u2014document and fiction? What is the relationship  between documentary modes and particular media and technologies\u2014print,  photography, cinema, video, and digital? Other topics include the role of the  artist, indexicality and representation, literature as historical document,  \u201cfiction in the archives,\u201d false documents and forgery, collage, illustration,  and other uses of the document in twentieth century art. Critical and  theoretical readings by Paula Amad, Eric Barnouw, Roland Barthes, Stella Bruzzi,  Jane Gaines, Carlo Ginzburg, Jacques Derrida, Giorgio Agamben, Barbara Johnson,  Bill Nichols, Philip Rosen, Vivian Sobchack, Susan Sontag, Jacques Ranci\u00e8re,  Edward Said, Alan Sekula, Sven Spieker, Ann Stoler, Diana Taylor, and others. This semester's special topics are 1) word/image relations and 2) the archive.

Topics in Lit &amp; Modern Culture: Queer Critique Huber      This seminar begins with a brief genealogy  of critique, focusing primarily on its modern itinerary as a practice or ethos  that exposes the complexity, contingency and violence in the given order of  things. At the outset, we will rely on Kant\u2019s model of critique as a patient  reflection on the limits of reason, but we will follow the practice as it  deviates and disperses, tending toward an attitude that seeks not simply to  limn limits, but to radically question them. Critique begins then to ask after  other ways of being, doing and thinking. We will read Foucault and Butler for  their accounts of critique as a richly embodied, urgent and often risky  practice, paying particular attention to the elaboration of an ethics and  critical practice enabled by one\u2019s perspectives and unruly investments, shaped  as these are by larger sexual, racial and class formations. How might our  desires incite critique, and how might critique, in turn, incite our desires?  Queer and critique are terms that slide with great latitude; we will ask if  there is a tacit traffic between them. Is there something decidedly queer about  critique? In the seminar\u2019s final  section, we will focus on queer of color critique (Mu\u00f1oz, Ferguson, Reddy, and  Chen), in order to move toward a fuller consideration of those powers that  produce, organize, constrain, differentiate and mobilize us.       Readings will include: Plato, Kant, Marx, Nietzsche, Gramsci,  Luk\u00e1cs, Benjamin, Koselleck, Foucault, Butler, Mbembe, Spivak, Brown, Asad, Mahmood, Eng, Shah,  Mu\u00f1oz, Ferguson, Chen among others.
