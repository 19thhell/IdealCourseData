Comments (0)                                         3 things to remember!                 When using article databases, remember there are always three stages in your workflow (the \"three Ds\"):   1) Discovery: Do (and redo!) your searching, using varying terms and combining using the Boolean operators \" and, or, not \" to get good results. Your first search is not your best search, but rather an opportunity to learn how to immediately do a better search   2) Delivery: For items that you like, select the link to the fulltext if available, or click on the button to see if we own the item. If you want to keep this item, either save it to your own computer, email it to yourself, or print it.   3) Database it: Keep the \"meta-information\" about all that good resources you found for your records and to make your bibliographies. You will find yourself returning to resources so having a system in place will save you time and aggravation later. The NYU Libraries offer a number of tools to our users to help with this, in particular a tool called RefWorks , which you can learn about here.

Are you looking for several recent  articles, or writing a paper and need background information from  textbooks plus journal articles?      Once you've answered these questions you're ready to locate books or select a database to locate journal articles.      ***Keep in mind that you will use Bobcat's \"Books and More\" tab to locate TITLES of books, journals, and videotapes.     To locate THE ARTICLES themselves you will need to find a citation in an index , either by using Bobcat's \"Article's &amp; Databases\" tab or following the link in BobCat.

The primary Library of Congress subject heading is   \"Emigration and immigration\"*   This is a the most general classification. Some notes from the Library of Congress:     \" Here are entered works on migration across national borders in modern times. Works on the movement of population within the borders of a single country are entered under Migration, Internal . Works on the spread of population, largely in prehistoric times, are entered under Human beings -- Migrations . Works on the mass migrations of peoples are entered under Migrations of nations . \"     In order to search and browse NYU's catalog using subject headings, you'll want to use BobCat Standard  rather than the current version of BobCat. The catalog is the same between these search systems, but Standard allows you to actually search by subject classification , which can help you hone your search results toward your research topic. There are quite a few subheadings under the general subject class of \"Emigration and immigration\" which are in the List of Common Subheadings in the box to the right and can help you narrow your searches.   Works under the general classification of \"Emigration and immigration\" are not sub-limited geographically. To search for works on topics on emigration and immigration within a particular geographic area (country, city, region, etc.), please s ee the box below.   -------- *NOTE : The subject heading \"Emigration and immigration\" means that works listed under this subject search may be about either people migrating to a particular place and from a particular place .  There is no Library of Congress subject classification for just \"Immigration\", so you'll have to account for this while you are searching.           BobCat Standard                    Comments (0)                                         Location, location, location                 How to search within a particular geographic area   Works under the general classification of \"Emigration and immigration\" are not sub-limited geographically. This means that if you want to find works on immigration within a certain geographic area (a country, a city, a region, etc.), they will be listed under the primary subject heading of the geographic area, which will look like this     \"[geographic area] -- Emigration and immigration\"    Examples of this kind of subject search are \" Europe - Emigration and immigration \" , \" France -- Emigration and immigration \" or \" Rome (Italy) -- Emigration and immigration \" . There will generally be city-specific subject headings for the major cities in a country, but you must always use the form \"[City] ([Country])...\" when searching for them.*   Remember, you can always use the List of Common Subheadings to the right to sublimit here as well!   -------- *NOTE : Works listed under the city-specific classification will not appear under searches of the country, generally speaking. This means that works under the class \"Paris (France) -- Emigration and immigration\" will not show up under searches for \"France -- Emigration and immigration\". The same goes for \"France...\" under the \"Europe...\" classification.

It's a bit slower process but perhaps easier than trial and error.   Other related primary subject headings which you may want to look at include:     \"Immigrants\" which does limit by geographic region. This means that listings for British immigrants will be under \"Immigrants -- Great Britain\" or \"Immigrants -- England\".   \"Emigration and immigration law\" has its own subject classification. You can also sub-limit this using the same sub-limits as in the List of Common Subheadings.   Others Library of Congress primary headings include \"Emigration and immigration in art\" , \"...in literature\" , \"...in motion pictures\" , \"...in the Bible\" , and \"...in the Koran\" .

Based on the \"action research model for reflective Internet searching\" from Edwards, Sylvia and Bruce, C. \"Reflective Internet Searching,    an Action Research Model.\"    A good scholar's research process will be more cyclical than linear. This is important to bear in mind as you progress toward the answer you expect to give to your research question, because as you probably already know, the more you learn about a particular subject, the more you may find that you do not know or  what questions your sources or data can't or haven't answered. But don't get discouraged! Even as you focus your topic to a manageable research question and a particular answer, you will want to note those other related or foundational questions related to your research in the crucial \"Evaluate and Reflect\" stage, even though you may ultimately set them aside from your particular inquiry.   No piece of scholarship can answer every question surrounding a given subject and the best examples are those that explain:   1) what assumptions have been made by scholars who have attempted to answer this or related questions,   2) what assumptions are being made in this inquiry ,   and perhaps most important,   3) why these assumptions are or are not illuminating, ideal or correct for answering this particular question.   This is why the \"Evaluate and Reflect\" stage (often part of revising and redrafting your write-up of the research) is such a critical stage because it means figuring out both what you don't know and what you need to know . The questions and assumptions that you identify in your self-evaluation represent openings for new research questions which you may deem irrelevant to answering the question, you may not have the information for, or, understandably, the time and space to answer! This limitation doesn't make your research worthless; in fact, it is a clear understanding and explanation of these limitations that helps us truly understand how your contribution fits in to the vast collection of knowledge and perspectives around your chosen topic.

Bobcat Standard allows one to browse the the subject headings and click on the list to see the list of items with the subject heading.   Generally, subject headings for books in history follow a specific pattern: Place name -- Subdivision -- Time period .           Place names can be names of countries, regions or cities.   Subdivisions , as listed below in the examples, are standard and can be used with various place names.  They describe the particular emphasis of the book.   Time period refers to the years covered by the book; time period designations vary according to place.       The following examples illustrate possible subject searches for the history of 19-century Great Britain:           Place Name       Subdivision       Time Period           s = Great Britain        History --      History --      Intellectual life --      Social conditions --      Economic conditions --      Politics and government --      Foreign relations --             19th century      Victoria, 1837-1901      19th century      19th century      1760-1860      19th century      1800-1837                 You can find information on the European countries by following this general pattern.       Also find information on interdisciplinary subjects with the alternate pattern:           Subject       Place Name       Subdivision       Time Period                s = Women --      s = Middle classes --             France --      England --             History --      History --             19th century      19th century                 For more information, click to consult the Library of Congress Authorities or go to http://authorities.loc.gov/. This is an online index of the offical subject headings used in BobCat and  other library catalogs. Look under the place name or subject to see the  appropriate subdivisions and time periods.

Boolean Operator       Search Example       Retrieves             AND     A good way to limit/refine your search.   Decreases your results.       rivers AND salinity     Retrieves articles that contain both the words river and salinity.                 OR     A good way to expand your search   Useful if you have synonyms that you would like to search for.   Increases your results.           fruit OR vegetables       Returns articles that contain either the word fruits or vegetables .           Not     A good way to limit your search   Allows you to exclude terms from your search results       fruit NOT apples   Returns articles that contain the word fruits but do not contain the word apples .             Advanced Boolean: Putting It All Together   In the above examples, we showed the use of boolean operators with 2 search terms; however, you can join any number of terms with boolean operators.   Parentheses! In the examples below, you'll notice that we use parentheses to group search terms and operators. The parentheses tell the search engine how to read your search statement. Remember when you learned about order of operations in math and using parentheses? Same concept.           Search Example       Retrieves           Europe AND dairy products AND export   Articles that contain all of the following words: dairy products, Europe, and export.         canoeing AND (kayaking OR sculling)   Articles that contain the both of the words canoeing and sculling ; also brings back articles that contain both of the words canoeing and kayaking.         South America AND (puma OR panther) NOT Brazil   Articles that contain the terms South America and Puma ; articles that contain the terms South America and Panther .

If in doubt, check the Help section of the database.           Search Technique       Symbol       Example       Retrieves           Phrase Searching   Useful when you have a string of words that must appear next to each other in your search statement.       Most search engines use quotation marks around phrases.   &ldquo;mad cow disease&rdquo;   Articles where the exact phrase \"mad cow disease\" is present.         Truncation   Allows you to search for variant endings of a word. Remember that when you search, the database is looking for an exact match for your term so using truncation can increase the flexibility of your search.        Most databases use the asterisk however, some use a different symbol. Most notably, LexisNexis uses the exclamation point.   parent*   Articles with any of the following words: parent, parents, parenting, parental         Wildcards   Allows you to search for different variants of a word where the difference may be within the word as opposed to at the end of the word. This technique is most useful when searching for plurals that do not use an \"s\" (ex. woman vs. women) or when searching for articles in which there may be slightly different British spelling (ex. color vs. colour)       Some databases use the asterisk ; others use the question mark . Check the help section to determine which symbol is use.   wom*n   Articles that contain either the word woman or women.

If there is no full-text in the database you are searching, click on the Find at NYU or SFX symbol ( ), which will tell you if NYU Libraries has a full-text electronic version of the article.   If we do not, check BobCat for other versions (print, microform, etc.). Many journals published before 1995 are only available in print format. Back issues of journals in print format are shelved with books in the stacks so you will need to search for the journal title in BobCat to get a call number so you can find the bound journal on the shelf.

Some of these are subscription services, some have archives, however most do not.   In Bobcat you can search for more information on Spanish newspapers using the subject \"Spanish newspapers -- Spain\" which also has sub-divisions.

But Google actually works as an excellent substitute. Read the PC Magazine article \" 20 Great Google Secrets \" for tips, here are a few adopted from the article.       Search Within a Website: Try using \" site:\" (which restricts results to top-level domains)   with \" intitle: \" to find certain types of pages. For example, get  scholarly pages about Mark Twain by searching for \" intitle:\"Mark  Twain\"site:edu \". Experiment with mixing various elements; you'll develop  several strategies for finding the stuff you want more effectively. The  site: command is very helpful as an alternative to the mediocre search  engines built into many sites.        Search Within a Timeframe: \" Daterange: (start date&ndash;end date) \". You can restrict your searches to  pages that were indexed within a certain time period. Daterange:   searches by when Google indexed a page, not when the page itself was  created. This operator can help you ensure that results will have fresh  content (by using recent dates), or you can use it to avoid a topic's  current-news blizzard and concentrate only on older results. Daterange:   is actually more useful if you go elsewhere to take advantage of it,  because daterange: requires Julian dates, not standard Gregorian dates.  You can find converters on the Web (such as http://aa.usno.navy.mil/data/docs/JulianDate.html ), but an easier way is to do a Google daterange: search by filling in a form at www.researchbuzz.com/toolbox/goofresh.shtml or www.faganfinder.com/engines/google.shtml .  If one special syntax element is good, two must be better, right?  Sometimes. Though some operators can't be mixed (you can't use the link:   operator with anything else) many can be, quickly narrowing your  results to a less overwhelming number.         Receive Updates When Search Terms Appear on the Web or in the New s : Giga Alert ( www.googlealert.com ) monitors your search terms and e-mails you information about new additions to  Google's Web index. (Giga Alert is not affiliated with Google; it uses  Google's Web services API to perform its searches.) If you're more interested in news stories than general  Web content, check out the beta version of Google News Alerts ( www.google.com/newsalerts ).  This service (which is affiliated with Google) will monitor up to 50  news queries per e-mail address and send you information about news  stories that match your query. (Hint: Use the intitle: and source:  syntax elements with Google News to limit the number of alerts you get.)
