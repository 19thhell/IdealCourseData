The focus of the undergraduate program is primarily on language, history and literature and the way in which these three civilizations have interacted with the Western world to reconstitute received cultures into modern societies. By intensive study of Asian culture, the student is encouraged to reflect on the global interrelatedness of human society. At present, three language sequences are offered: a six-semester Chinese language sequence, a six-semester Japanese language sequence, and a six-semester Korean language sequence. Fourth-year study is also offered in all three languages. In addition, various courses in Asian culture are offered in the Program in East Asian Studies, while courses in history, politics, and art are available in other departments.

It is a CAS minor and can be taken by students in any NYU   school. It provides a broad perspective on South Asia and opportunities   to concentrate on specific areas of interest. Students have many   choices of courses and course combinations. The course list (located   below) represents current offerings in 2011, and the list may change in   the years to come. There are a wide range of options. Students might   choose to study a language and its literature, colonial and postcolonial   histories, art and architecture, contemporary politics, literary forms,   cinema, and the South Asian diaspora, among other topics. The South   Asia curriculum is constantly expanding across departments and schools,   and now includes courses in anthropology, history, political science,   fine art, film studies, cultural studies, literature, and two modern   languages (Hindi and Urdu). Through a consortium with Columbia   University, students may also study other of the region\u2019s many modern or   classical languages.                             Declaring the Minor:                                In order to declare  the South Asian Studies minor, you must complete the South Asian Minor declaration form  and  submit it to the Undergraduate Administrative Assistant in the History Department.                        Requirements:              The minimum requirement for completion of a minor is four 4-point courses (16 points) chosen in consultation with the South Asian studies advisor. Students are encouraged to register for the minor and consult the advisor before completing their course requirements.    One CORE/MAP \u201cCultures and Contexts\u201d course on South Asia may be counted toward the non-language minor requirement. At least two of the four non-language courses must be above the introductory level in their respective disciplines. With prior approval, one independent study course can count toward the four courses required for a minor. At least three of the four courses must be completed at NYU.    The South Asian studies Faculty Advisor, Prof. David Ludden, will determine the eligibility of courses taken in study abroad programs of institutions not part of the consortial exchange, or other courses that students think might be applied to the minor.    Students can pursue three broad areas of concentration with four 4-point courses (16 points):    Track A: Language and Literature. This track provides students with a solid foundation in a modern Indian language. Students must complete a four-semester sequence of either Hindi or Urdu, provided that these courses are not also used to satisfy the CAS foreign language requirement.    Track B: History, Culture, and Politics: This track fosters a broad interdisciplinary perspective on South Asia. All four courses must be non-language courses. At least two courses must be above the introductory level in their respective disciplines.    Track C: Culture and Language, combining Tracks A and B. Students must take two language courses at the intermediate level (provided that these courses are not also used to satisfy the CAS foreign language requirement) or advanced level, plus two non-language South Asian studies courses.         *Students may apply any course offered  by one of the South Asian faculty with the Faculty Advisor\u2019s approval      South Asian Studies Course Offerings:    *Please note that this list is subject to change, and available courses may vary depending upon the semester.
