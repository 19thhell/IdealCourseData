South Asian  history has been the locus for key debates --- from those on the origins of  early trans-oceanic merchant networks to those on the making of new forms of  imperial rule, on nationalism and decolonization, and on subaltern studies,  postcolonialism, and globalization --- which have had a broad comparative and  methodological reach. The history of early modern and modern South Asia has been  approached by multiple perspectives. Our South Asian history faculty offers a  temporally, regionally, and conceptually diverse illustration of existing and  emergent perspectives. The core historians of South Asia in the department are Manu  Goswami, David Ludden, and Andrew Sartori. Their research spans regional (north  and south), linguistic (Bengali, Tamil, Hindi, Urdu), epochal (pre-modern and  modern) and thematic (social, intellectual, cultural) divisions of conventional  historical studies. The graduate program encourages the forging of comparative  and global approaches to the social, intellectual, and cultural history of  South Asia. It builds upon and bolsters existing department interests in  comparative and international history, imperial and post-imperial formations,  social and intellectual history. Beyond the department, graduate studies of  South Asia at NYU galvanize the inter-disciplinary strength of faculty across  schools (Steinhardt, Arts and Sciences, Gallatin, Stern, Tisch, and Law) and  departments (Anthropology, Media and Communication, Political Science,  Sociology, Social and Cultural Analysis). With the help of our colleagues inside  and outside the Department of History, we encourage students to undertake  methodologically innovative and interdisciplinary historical research based on  multiple regional and linguistic archives.      South Asian Languages : At present beginner  and advanced courses in Hindi, Urdu and Persian are offered at NYU. Columbia  University and University of Pennsylvania offer a wider range of language  training (Tamil, Telegu, Bengali) and there are several summer programs at  various centers around the country. Students are expected to enter the program  with demonstrable proficiency in at least one South Asian language.      Workshops and Seminars : South Asian Studies at NYU provides is expansive academic  opportunities, connecting faculty and scholars in many schools, and including  weekly seminars and other events on most Fridays during the school year, as  well as an annual conference, in February, on Global South Asia. We have an  interdisciplinary Graduate Student Workshop specifically for students in South  Asian Studies working in various departments and schools. A number of thematic  other workshops provide students and faculty with a forum to present ongoing  research, host outside speakers, and collectively read works of interest across  regions and fields. Existing workshops organized by South Asia history faculty  include Social Theory and History and the Global Caf\u00e9 (administered by the  Institute of Public Knowledge). We also strongly encourage students to  participate in other South Asia related and trans-regional events at area  universities.

Focusing on the early-modern to modern period of Chinese and Japanese history (17 th century onwards), the field aims to locate East Asia within a larger global framework. It intends to encourage students to engage broadly with historical questions that emerged from within and that have helped shape the various East Asian societies, in their interactions with each other and in the larger worlds of global commerce, culture, and capitalism.    Specific course guidelines are flexible and are tailored to the needs and abilities of each student. To qualify as PhD candidates, students normally take exams in three fields: a major field, a minor field, and a thematic field. The major and minor can be two separate chronologies of the same national history (e.g. Ming/Qing China, modern China), or two national histories (e.g. modern China and modern Japan). The thematic field should be a theoretical area of interest (e.g. gender studies, social theory, theories of nationalism, etc.); this latter field can be constructed in accordance with student interests and in consultation with a faculty advisor. The exam committee normally consists of three faculty, two of whom should be from the History Department and one of whom can be from a closely affiliated Department or another University (if necessary).    Language Requirement : It is strongly suggested that students already have facility in one Asian language prior to enrollment; summer funding is not normally available for language acquisition and using graduate credits for non-advanced language learning at NYU is not permitted. Students are required to know one Asian language to a degree of research fluency in reading, speaking, and listening and should be able to pass a written translation exam in another language (Asian or European or African). Language exams should be passed by the time students sit for qualifying exams (normally the end of the second year or beginning of third year of study).
