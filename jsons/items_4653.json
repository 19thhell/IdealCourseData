Courses range broadly over the Irish Studies field, and include topics in Irish literature, early and modern Irish history, politics, film, music, popular culture, and the Irish language. In addition to the permanent NYU Irish Studies faculty, the Irish Studies Program brings distinguished scholars from Ireland and other American universities to enrich the undergraduate and graduate offerings. In addition, NYU's Summer in Dublin at Trinity College gives students the opportunity to study in Ireland during the summer.    Ireland and its Diaspora present an extraordinarily significant and rewarding area of intellectual inquiry. The study of Irish society and culture provides students with an understanding of Ireland's historical experience; its colonial past in relation to England; its contribution to literature, both ancient and modern; its far-reaching effect in the modern world through its Diaspora, as well as its dual language tradition and rival national narratives. Irish scholars, playwrights, novelists, poets, and critics have made outstanding contributions to the humanities, and Celtic folklore and mythology are unparalleled in their richness.    New York University offers a minor in Irish Studies for students wishing to pursue a systematic study of Irish culture, including language, literature, drama, history, music, popular culture, and politics.    NYU is a perfect location for pursuing Irish Studies in a global interdisciplinary context, and Glucksman Ireland House provides a welcoming intellectual and social milieu for students in all disciplines in this area.    Please use the tabs at left to learn more about NYU's undergraduate program, including course offerings and requirements for the minor.                                 &Aacute;ras Glucksman na h&Eacute;ireann                      Ollscoil Nua Eabhrac                  Glucksman Ireland House                  New York University                  One Washington Mews                  New York, NY 10003                  U.S.A.
