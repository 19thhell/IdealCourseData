He also noted that the CCN is on track to receive a record level of funding this year, despite dismal prospects of the sequestration. In addition, Dr. Nixon honed-in on the importance of advocacy and encouraged the audience to be part of our outreach effort. Following the opening remarks, Dr. Nixon presented the Blas Frangione Young Investigator Merit Award to Charles Hoeffer, Ph.D, for his novel and ground-breaking research on the tau protein, synaptic plasticity and GABAergic function.   \u00a0   Key presenters were:   \u00a0   o Charles Hoeffer, PhD, Assistant Professor, Department of Neuroscience and Physiology;   o Donald Wilson, PhD Research Professor, Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Senior Research Scientist, Emotional Brain Institute, Nathan Kline Institute;   o Caroline Blaum, MD, MS, Diane and Arthur Belfer Professor of Geriatrics, Director, Division of Geriatrics, Department of Medicine;   o Peter Davies, PhD, Judith and Burton P.

Designed to promote research and foster collaboration on broad scale research projects focused on brain aging, geriatrics, dementia science and neurodegenerative diseases, the program was attended by more than 150 guests and the poster session included nearly 40 posters representing 10 departments and schools spanning the NYU Langone network.   The introduction by Ralph A. Nixon, Ph.D., M.D., Director of the CCN, focused on the expansion of the Center and the achievements accomplished within the past year. Opening remarks were made by Richard Tsien, D.Phil., Druckenmiller Professor of Neuroscience and Neural Science; Director of the NYU Neuroscience Institute; and Chair, Department of Physiology and Neuroscience.

Designed to promote research and foster collaboration on broad scale research projects focused on brain aging, geriatrics, dementia science and neurodegenerative diseases, the program was attended by approximately 200 guests, including investigators, clinicians and faculty spanning the NYU Langone network.   The introduction by Ralph A. Nixon, Ph.D., M.D., Director of the CCN, focused on the expansion of the CCN and the achievements accomplished within the past year. He also honed-in on the 22 percent increase in the grant base, from 2009-2010, which by all accounts is significant given the downturn in the economy and its effect on research funding.   Vice Dean for Science, Vivian S. Lee, M.D., Ph.D., M.B.A., provided opening remarks which focused on the key role the CCN plays within NYU Langone and she praised members of the CCN and Dr. Nixon for its success.

Only recently did a field of medicine dedicated to sleep emerge.   Recent advances in neuroimaging and the development of new plasma and cerebrospinal biomarkers are increasing the prominence of a neuroscientific perspective in sleep research. The fundamental questions in the study of sleep remain largely to be clarified:   Why do we sleep?   What happens in the brain during sleep?   What are the consequences of disturbed sleep on the brain?   The Sleep, Aging, and Memory (SAM) Lab is a program developed by a consortium lead by three groups of investigators from the Center for Brain Health ( Ricardo Osorio, MD ), NYU Sleep Disorders Center (Indu Ayappa, PhD), and the Center for Neural Science (Andrew Varga, MD, PhD). Our mission is to try to solve these and other issues related to sleep, normal aging, memory processing, and the risk for Alzheimer\u2019s disease.
