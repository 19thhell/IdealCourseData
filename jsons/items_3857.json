Candidates for the dual degree program submit separate applications to the Graduate School of Arts and Science (GSAS) and to the Law School. The Law School and GSAS admit applicants independently, on the basis of their usual standards: no special admission standards would apply to dual degree applicants. Applications to the two schools can be made simultaneously, but students already enrolled in their first year at the Law School may also apply to the Graduate School to commence the dual degree program during their second year.   The dual degree program can be completed in three to four years with the guidance of advisors from both programs. Students take a total of 94 credits for the two degrees. Students may obtain program details from the appropriate advisor in each school.   For more information, please contact Amalia Cordova, Assistant Director of the Center for Latin American and Caribbean Studies at (212) 998-8685. At the Law School, please contact Amy Chu, Senior Director of Academic Services and Registration ( acadservices@exchange.law.nyu.edu or 212-998-6020), to discuss items regarding academics or the JD program. For questions regarding admission to the JD program, please contact the Office of JD Admissions at law.moreinfo@nyu.edu or (212) 998-6020.
