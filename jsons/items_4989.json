Tutorials are student-generated projects, and like independent studies, ideas for tutorials typically follow from questions raised in a particular course. Students may collaborate on creative projects as well. Students work together with the instructor to formulate the structure of the tutorial, the details of which are described in the tutorial proposal and submitted to the Faculty Committee on Individualized Studies for review and approval. The tutorial group meets regularly throughout the semester, and students follow a common syllabus: all participants complete the same readings, write papers on similar topics, etc. At the end of the semester all students are evaluated by the instructor and assigned a letter grade (A through F).   Students in the same tutorial must register for the same number of units. Credit is determined by the amount of work (readings and other types of assignments) entailed in the tutorial and should be comparable to that of a Gallatin classroom course. Tutorials range from 2 to 4 units. Meeting hours correspond to course units; a 4-unit tutorial requires at least 14 contact hours per term between the instructor and students. Students and instructors may establish meeting times and places for the tutorial, however, long distance tutorials (where the students and instructor cannot meet together) are not generally permitted.   Tutorial groups must include at least two students, but no more than a total of five students. At least one member of a Tutorial group must be a Gallatin student.        While students are encouraged to engage in independent work with University faculty, the Gallatin program is designed for a careful balance between independent and classroom experience. Undergraduate students therefore may register for no more than 8 units per semester in any combination of independent study and/or tutorial.        Faculty members (both full-time and part-time) are limited to supervising no more than one tutorial per term (Fall, Spring, or Summer).        Below is an outline of the process that students follow to set up a Tutorial. Because the student and the instructor are designing a course, students must begin this process a full semester in advance. Students can refer to the Student Checklist to investigate the planning timeline for these steps:     Obtain faculty adviser approval: Students should discuss with their faculty adviser the possibility of conducting a tutorial.   Generate a basic idea: At least two students should work together to identify a problem or a question, a time period, a literary genre, a natural phenomenon, a philosophical theme, or a creative skill.     Organize the student group: Identify all of the students (at least two, but no more than five, and at least one must be a Gallatin student) who will be participating in the tutorial.     Identify an appropriate instructor (one of the student\u2019s academic advisers, a Gallatin or other NYU faculty member, or with special approval, a professor from another university or college) to work with the group. Contact the prospective instructor to propose the study and to discuss the plans for the work of the group.   Complete and submit a Tutorial Proposal form: Each member of the tutorial must submit a proposal form for review and approval by Gallatin's Faculty Committee on Individualized Studies. Please note that submitting a proposal does not guarantee approval.     All students should identify an alternate course to take in case the tutorial proposal is not approved              Tutorial Policies     Generally, the work for a tutorial should be comparable to a Gallatin classroom course. The specific format of the work will be determined by the students and the instructor who will evaluate it. The work for the study should be submitted according to the schedule of due dates agreed upon at the outset, and as with a classroom course, late work may be penalized.   Tutorials may be taken for two, three or four credits. The number of credits is determined the amount of work to be completed.   Instructors and students must meet for a minimum number of hours per semester: for a 4-credit Tutorial, the minimum number of contact hours is fourteen (14). Contact hours for a Tutorial which is less than 4 credits should be prorated accordingly (e.g., a 2-credit tutorial should meet for a minimum of seven (7) hours).   All students enrolled in the same tutorial must register for the same number of credits and follow the same syllabus.   Tutorial groups must include at least two students, but no more than a total of five students. At least one member of a Tutorial group must be a Gallatin student.     An instructor for a Gallatin Tutorial should be an NYU faculty member. In rare cases a professor from another university or college might be approved to instruct a Tutorial.   Tutorials are graded with letter grades (A through F).            Undergraduate students may register for no more than 8 credits per semester in any combination of independent study and/or tutorial.            Long distance tutorials (where the students and instructor cannot meet together) are not permitted.   Students enrolled in another NYU school might be permitted to join an existing Gallatin Tutorial. In all cases, students enrolled in other NYU schools should contact KatheAnn Joseph for more information.   Faculty members (both full-time and part-time) are limited to supervising no more than one tutorial per term (Fall, Spring, or Summer).   The completed tutorial proposal consists of:   adviser\u2019s approval     instructor\u2019s approval     completed proposal form     description of the study   syllabus   booklist           Students must submit all of the above components by the appropriate semester deadline .     Please note that tutorials do not fulfill any area of the Gallatin foundation requirement (liberal arts requirement or historical and cultural requirement).            Students interested in pursuing a Tutorial should review the Tutorial Proposal Guidelines and the Student Checklist.

A: Anyone submitting an application to the NYU University Committee on Activities Involving Human Subjects (referred to as UCAIHS or the Committee) must complete this tutorial and pass the certification exam prior to review of the application. Applicants need to pass the exam once; subsequent applications to the UCAIHS do not require retesting.    Tutorial Overview    Each of the 18 chapters can be completed independently. To get the most out of a chapter, you should:         Complete the case study (for certain chapters) to test your current understanding.    Work through the content of the section, paying particular attention to the areas that address the gaps in your knowledge.    Answer the chapter review questions to test your knowledge. Immediate feedback will be given to each answer &#151; use this as an opportunity to review the content, especially if you were not sure of the answer.       Once you have completed all the chapters and feel comfortable with the material, take the exam. The certification exam consists of 20 primary questions and 20 secondary questions. The primary questions (worth 3 points) are always on the exam while the secondary questions (worth 2 points) are randomly selected each time you take the exam. You must receive a score of 80 (out of 100) to be certified.

Tutorials are student-generated projects, and like independent studies, ideas for tutorials typically follow from questions raised in a particular course. Students may collaborate on creative projects as well. Students work together with the instructor to formulate the structure of the tutorial, the details of which are described in the tutorial proposal and submitted to the Faculty Committee on Individualized Studies for review and approval. The tutorial group meets regularly throughout the semester, and students follow a common syllabus: all participants complete the same readings, write papers on similar topics, etc. At the end of the semester all students are evaluated by the instructor and assigned a letter grade (A through F).   Students in the same tutorial must register for the same number of units. Credit is determined by the amount of work (readings and other types of assignments) entailed in the tutorial and should be comparable to that of a Gallatin classroom course. Tutorials range from 2 to 4 units. Meeting hours correspond to course units; a 4-unit tutorial requires at least 14 contact hours per term between the instructor and students. Students and instructors may establish meeting times and places for the tutorial, however, long distance tutorials (where the students and instructor cannot meet together) are not generally permitted.   Tutorial groups must include at least two students, but no more than a total of five students. At least one member of a Tutorial group must be a Gallatin student.        While students are encouraged to engage in independent work with University faculty, the Gallatin program is designed for a careful balance between independent and classroom experience. Undergraduate students therefore may register for no more than 8 units per semester in any combination of independent study and/or tutorial.        Faculty members (both full-time and part-time) are limited to supervising no more than one tutorial per term (Fall, Spring, or Summer).        Below is an outline of the process that students follow to set up a Tutorial. Because the student and the instructor are designing a course, students must begin this process a full semester in advance. Students can refer to the Student Checklist to investigate the planning timeline for these steps:     Obtain faculty adviser approval: Students should discuss with their faculty adviser the possibility of conducting a tutorial.   Generate a basic idea: At least two students should work together to identify a problem or a question, a time period, a literary genre, a natural phenomenon, a philosophical theme, or a creative skill.     Organize the student group: Identify all of the students (at least two, but no more than five, and at least one must be a Gallatin student) who will be participating in the tutorial.     Identify an appropriate instructor (one of the student\u2019s academic advisers, a Gallatin or other NYU faculty member, or with special approval, a professor from another university or college) to work with the group. Contact the prospective instructor to propose the study and to discuss the plans for the work of the group.   Complete and submit a Tutorial Proposal form: Each member of the tutorial must submit a proposal form for review and approval by Gallatin's Faculty Committee on Individualized Studies. Please note that submitting a proposal does not guarantee approval.     All students should identify an alternate course to take in case the tutorial proposal is not approved              Tutorial Policies     Generally, the work for a tutorial should be comparable to a Gallatin classroom course. The specific format of the work will be determined by the students and the instructor who will evaluate it. The work for the study should be submitted according to the schedule of due dates agreed upon at the outset, and as with a classroom course, late work may be penalized.   Tutorials may be taken for two, three or four credits. The number of credits is determined the amount of work to be completed.   Instructors and students must meet for a minimum number of hours per semester: for a 4-credit Tutorial, the minimum number of contact hours is fourteen (14). Contact hours for a Tutorial which is less than 4 credits should be prorated accordingly (e.g., a 2-credit tutorial should meet for a minimum of seven (7) hours).   All students enrolled in the same tutorial must register for the same number of credits and follow the same syllabus.   Tutorial groups must include at least two students, but no more than a total of five students. At least one member of a Tutorial group must be a Gallatin student.     An instructor for a Gallatin Tutorial should be an NYU faculty member. In rare cases a professor from another university or college might be approved to instruct a Tutorial.   Tutorials are graded with letter grades (A through F).            Undergraduate students may register for no more than 8 credits per semester in any combination of independent study and/or tutorial.            Long distance tutorials (where the students and instructor cannot meet together) are not permitted.   Students enrolled in another NYU school might be permitted to join an existing Gallatin Tutorial. In all cases, students enrolled in other NYU schools should contact KatheAnn Joseph for more information.   Faculty members (both full-time and part-time) are limited to supervising no more than one tutorial per term (Fall, Spring, or Summer).   The completed tutorial proposal consists of:   adviser\u2019s approval     instructor\u2019s approval     completed proposal form     description of the study   syllabus   booklist           Students must submit all of the above components by the appropriate semester deadline .     Please note that tutorials do not fulfill any area of the Gallatin foundation requirement (liberal arts requirement or historical and cultural requirement).            Students interested in pursuing a Tutorial should review the Tutorial Proposal Guidelines and the Student Checklist.

A: Anyone submitting an application to the NYU University Committee on Activities Involving Human Subjects (referred to as UCAIHS or the Committee) must complete this tutorial and pass the certification exam prior to review of the application. Applicants need to pass the exam once; subsequent applications to the UCAIHS do not require retesting.    Tutorial Overview    Each of the 18 chapters can be completed independently. To get the most out of a chapter, you should:         Complete the case study (for certain chapters) to test your current understanding.    Work through the content of the section, paying particular attention to the areas that address the gaps in your knowledge.    Answer the chapter review questions to test your knowledge. Immediate feedback will be given to each answer &#151; use this as an opportunity to review the content, especially if you were not sure of the answer.       Once you have completed all the chapters and feel comfortable with the material, take the exam. The certification exam consists of 20 primary questions and 20 secondary questions. The primary questions (worth 3 points) are always on the exam while the secondary questions (worth 2 points) are randomly selected each time you take the exam. You must receive a score of 80 (out of 100) to be certified.

Readings    Tutorials should carry a reading load comparable to that of a similar classroom course (e.g., a typical interdisciplinary seminar usually assigns 6\u201310 books, but a writing-intensive course or an arts workshop may require fewer readings). Please list authors and titles.                      Work to be Evaluated by the Instructor    Work to be Evaluated by the Instructor: Assignments should also be comparable to a similar classroom course (e.g., interdisciplinary seminars require approximately 20 to 30 pages of writing over the course of the semester). Be more specific than \"papers,\" \"essays,\" or \"portfolio\": indicate how many papers, what length they will be, whether research will be involved, when they will be due, etc.                      Syllabus    A schedule of meetings should be produced to specify the topics and readings to be covered at each session, as well the expected deadlines for assignments.
