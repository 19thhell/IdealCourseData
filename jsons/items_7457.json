Certificate Program in Culture and Media     The Departments of Anthropology and Cinema Studies offer a specialized joint course of study leading to a New York State Certificate in Culture and Media for NYU graduate students who are also pursuing their PhD degrees in Anthropology or Cinema Studies. The program\u2019s philosophy takes a broad approach to the relationships   between culture and media in a number of domains including: ethnographic   film\u2019s significance for the fields of anthropology and cinema/media   studies; problems in representation of cultures through media; the   development of media in indigenous, Diaspora, and non-Western   communities; the emerging social and cultural formations shaped by new   media practices; the political economy shaping the production,   distribution and consumption of media worldwide; and the impact of new   media technologies on these processes.   This graduate program provides a focused course of studies   integrating production with theory and research. Training in this   program will enable students to pursue the following:   -Production work in state-of-the-art digital video based on their   own research, resulting in a twenty-thirty minute documentary. Student   works have shown in festivals worldwide, won multiple awards, and are in   distribution.  For a list of recent student documentaries click here .      -Ethnographic research into the social practice of media in a range of   communities and cultures. Students from the program have done PhD   research on the development of media in diverse settings, from the   emergence of film and TV in Papua New Guinea, to circulation of   religious media in Northern Nigeria.    -Teaching the history, theory, and production of ethnographic documentary and related issues.    -A career in media requiring an understanding of anthropology, such as   specialized programming and distribution of ethnographic film and   video, community-based documentary production, management of   ethnographic film/video libraries and archives, or work in new media.  Each year, two student works are selected for a pitch session at the prestigious SILVERDOCS documentary festival. http://silverdocs.com/ .

[7]/[8] ANTH GA 1218-19 &amp; ANTH GA 1218-19    VIDEO PRODUCTION SEMINAR (Stout/Furjanic/Vail) 8 PTS   (Prerequisite: Sight and Sound Documentary or equivalent)         COURSE DESCRIPTIONS (REQUIRED)    CULTURE &amp; MEDIA I (Ganti/Ginsburg)    This course offers a critical revision of the history of the genre of ethnographic film, the central debates it has engaged around cross-cultural representation, and the theoretical and cinematic responses to questions of the screen representation of culture, from the early romantic constructions of Robert Flaherty to current work in film, television and video on the part of indigenous people throughout the world. Ethnographic film has a peculiar and highly contested status within anthropology, cinema studies, and documentary practice. In this seminar, we will situate ethnographic film within the wider project of the representation of cultural lives, and especially \"natives\". Starting with what are regarded as the first examples of the genre, we will examine how these emerged in a particular intellectual context and political economy. We will then consider the key works that have defined the genre, and the epistemological and formal innovations associated with them, addressing questions concerning social theory, documentary, as well as the institutional structures through which they are funded, distributed, and seen by various audiences. Throughout the course we will keep in mind the properties of film as a signifying practice, its status as a form of anthropological knowledge, and the ethical and political concerns raised by cross-cultural representation.   CULTURE &amp; MEDIA II: ETHNOGRAPHY OF MEDIA (Ginsburg/Ganti)    In the last decade, a new field \u2014 the ethnography of media \u2014 has emerged as an exciting new arena of research. While claims about media in peoples lives are made on a daily basis, surprisingly little research has actually attempted to look at how media is part of the naturally occurring lived realities of people\u2019s lives. In the last decade, anthropologists and media scholars interested in film, television, and video have been turning their attention increasingly beyond the text and empiricist notions of audiences, (stereotypically associated with the ethnography of media), to consider, ethnographically, the complex social worlds in which media is produced, circulated and consumed, at home and elsewhere. This work theorizes media studies from the point of view of cross-cultural ethnographic realities and anthropology from the perspective of new spaces of communication focusing on the social, economic and political life of media and how it makes a difference in the daily lives of people as a practice, whether in production, reception, or circulation.    The class will be organized around case studies that interrogate broader issues that are particularly endemic to questions of cross-cultural media including debates over cultural imperialism vs. the autonomy of local producers/consumers, the instability and stratification of reception, the shift from national to transnational circuits of production and consumption, the increasing complicity of researchers with their subjects over representations of culture, and the historically and culturally contingent ways in which images are read and used. These concerns are addressed in a variety of locations, from the complex circulation of films, photos, and lithographs, to the ever increasing range of televisual culture \u2014 from state sponsored melodramas, religious epics and soap operas, to varieties of public television; to the activist use of video, radio, the internet, and small media.    CULTURAL THEORY AND THE DOCUMENTARY (Toby Lee)    This course considers the actual and possible forms of relation between theories of culture and society and the mode of nonfiction cinema known as (social) documentary. From one perspective, theory is a discourse of explanation that is applied, concurrently or retroactively, to the images of culture presented in documentary films: films present raw material of culture to be theorized aesthetically, sociologically, psychologically, historically, politically, and so on. But at the same time, documentary filmmaking can be conceived as an intellectual discourse, what its founders called \u201ca method of philosophic reasoning\u201d (Paul Rotha), one meant to reflect or challenge certain cultural and social ideas. Despite the order of terms in the title of this course, what theory means to documentary, and vice versa, has always been an open question. This course explores various ways to answer the question.    SIGHT AND SOUND DOCUMENTARY (SUMMER COURSE) (Marco Williams)    The intensive six week summer course teaches students to look at their world and to develop the ability to create compelling and dramatic stories in which real people are the characters and real life is the plot. Through close study and analysis of feature length and short documentaries, and hands-on directing, shooting, sound-recording, editing and re-editing, students will rigorously explore the possibilities and the power of non-fiction story telling for film and video. The course is a dynamic combination of individual and group production work, in which each student will be expected to complete five projects. While tuition is covered, please be advised that there is a lab fee of approximately $600.   VIDEO PRODUCTION SEMINAR (Stout/Furjanic/Vail )    A two-semester seminar that provides training and equipment for advanced graduate students to produce a media ethnography or short documentary. During the fall semester, in-class instruction, lab exercises, and readings introduce digital audio and video production, including shooting and editing with HD cameras, professional audio equipment, and Final Cut Pro non-linear editing systems. Focusing on ethnographic media practices, students also address key representational, methodological, and ethical issues in the production of ethnographic documentary. By the completion of the fall term, students will have chosen a topic and field site for their final projects and completed a short video (5-10 minutes). During the spring semester, students continue to work intensively on their projects by shooting, editing, and screening their footage. The course culminates in a public screening of students\u2019 completed, 20-30 min. ethnographic documentaries. Attendance in class and lab sessions is mandatory, and students who fail to complete all fall assignments will not be allowed to register for the spring semester. Students should come into the class with a well-developed project idea.    THE SEMINAR IS RESTRICTED TO STUDENTS IN THE PROGRAM IN CULTURE AND MEDIA. IT IS LIMITED TO TEN STUDENTS AND REQUIRES PERMISSION OF THE INSTRUCTOR. Culture &amp; Media I and Sight and Sound Documentary (summer session) are mandatory pre-requisites. There is no lab fee, but students are expected to provide their own videotapes. For a list of recent student documentaries click here.    SELECTED ELECTIVE COURSES/ CINEMA STUDIES and ANTHROPOLOGY/FALL 2014       Culture, Meaning and Society ANTH-GA 1222 (Rogers) This introduction to sociocultural anthropology is designed for graduate students working primarily in other disciplines, and is intended to give them a grasp of specifically anthropological ways of defining researchable questions, collecting data, and drawing inference. In the first half of the semester, we will consider the 20thcentury development of some of the basic concepts and practices that have defined the discipline (notably the culture concept, ethnographic fieldwork methods). In the second half of the semester, we will read a series of recent ethnographic case-studies to further explore current anthropological approaches to a selection of specific topics. These will be chosen largely as a function of student interests, but may include gender, religion, education, among others. *** Open only to non-Anthropology Graduate students.  Documentary Traditions CINE GT 1400 (Bagnall) Mondays 6:20 \u2013 9 PM   Fourteen sessions are devoted to a comparison of current documentaries with those made in earlier decades to illustrate how the art has responded to social, political, and economic realities and to changes in technology and systems of distribution. Undergraduates who take the course for 3 points are required to keep journals in which they respond to each session and compare observations with those made when viewing at least one documentary of their choice seen outside class, as well as in response to critical essays provided at each session and references in the text. Those wishing to earn an extra point (register for one point of H56.1097 Independent Study) may write a substantial term paper based on a topic approved by the instructor. French New Wave CINE GT 1513 (Stam) This course offers an historical and critical overview of one of the most dynamic and influential film movements within the history of the cinema -- the French New Wave \u2013 a movement that has influenced filmmakers all over the world. After examining the philosophical underpinnings of the movement in philosophical existentialism (Jean-Paul Sartre, Simone de Beauvoir) and the theoretical underpinnings in the film criticism of Cahiers du Cinema, we will examine key films and directors. We will explore the three core groups that together formed the New Wave, notably 1) the Cahiers directors (Truffaut, Godard, Chabrol, Rivette, Rohmer); 2) the Left Bank directors (Resnais, Duras, Varda, Marker); and 3) Cinema Verite (Jean Rouch, Edgar Morin). While we will focus largely on the films themselves, we will situate New Wave films within a broader spectrum of philosophy, literature, and the art. Some key themes in the course will be: first-person auteur cinema; artistic modernism and the New Wave; the relation between film and the other arts; the revolution in film language; the filmic adaptation of novels; and feminism and the New Wave; race, gender and sexuality; the evolution of style; and the political evolution leading up to the near-revolution of May 1968. The course will approach the New Wave through 1) critical writing, including by the directors themselves; 2) the screening of a chronologically arranged series of feature films; and 3) the analysis of short clips related to the larger themes. The goal of the course is for students to gain an overall sense of the historical importance of the New Wave, of the characteristic styles and themes of the key directors, and of some of the theories that circulated around such films. Topics in Documentary Film CINE GT 2002 (Lee) The term \"expanded documentary\" points both to the ways in which traditional documentary practices have diversified and transformed over the last few decades, particularly with changes in media technologies, as well as to different ways we might re-examine other film, media and art traditions through the lens of documentary practice. In this course, we consider how the documentary impulse functions in film, video, animation, sound; in the gallery, in the archive, in public space, in cyberspace; in forms linear and nonlinear, online and off. We also investigate the role of documentation in relation to performance and social practice art. In tracing these variations of documentary practice over time, we approach these expanded forms of non-fiction media not as addenda to documentary traditions, but rather as opportunities to reflect critically on those traditions, to connect present developments to historical precedents, and to pry open our sense of documentary as form, endeavor and practice. (Cross-listed with CINE-UT 417) Nonfiction Film History CINE GT 2307 (Streible, TBA) This course introduces students to the study of nonfiction film. It explores the history and theory of nonfiction cinema, including\u2014but not limited to\u2014documentary film. The established milestones of the international tradition of documentary\u2014from the romantic mythmaking of Robert Flaherty to the leftist collectives and state propaganda projects of the 1930s and 1940s, through cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9 of the 1960s and the activist and personal styles of recent decades\u2014are considered. But the course also places documentary in a broader context that includes forms of nonfiction typically segregated from the traditional conception of documentary. Some are somewhat familiar forms, such as actualities, travelogues, and newsreels. Others have been largely ignored by scholars until quite recently: sponsored, industrial, educational, scientific, and medical films; home movies and other amateur films; outtakes and other archival footage. Viewed both as discrete works of cinema and as artifacts of social and cultural significance, such orphaned films pose problems of history, culture, and aesthetics that challenge traditional conceptions of making, viewing, and studying films. Students read primary historical sources, as well as new scholarly approaches to the global history of nonfiction film, and to the possible uses and meanings of this vast archive.   Adv. Sem. Paradigms of Globalization CINE GT 2835 (Choi) This course examines multiple histories, structures, theories and key concepts of globalization, linking them with issues in the nation-state, post/modernity, post/colonialism, cultural imperialism, post/Fordism, empire, and trans/national identities. It brings together different forms of knowledge from anthropology, sociology, cultural studies, and political economy to bear on film and media studies troubled by geo-cultural uncertainty and convergence. ***Those students interested in taking this seminar should email JungBong Choi at jbc7@nyu.edu . The email should state your status in the grad program, any relevant past courses/ reading/ research, your particular interest in the seminar, and particular project, if any, that you would like to work on during the seminar. Adv. Sem. Comparative Post-colonialism CINE GT 3207 (Stam) Alongside and in the aftermath of the \"culture wars\" in the United States, many battle lines, national and transnational, have formed around such inter-related issues as \"postcoloniality,\" \"comparative imperialism,\"\"critical race\" and so forth. Challenged and debated from many directions, the terms themselves have become subject to diverse political force-fields, in some ways becoming sliding signifiers onto which diverse groups project their hopes and fears, their fantasies and anxieties. Our seminar will focus on the ways these debates are articulated differently in three zones: the Anglo-American, the French and Francophone, and the Brazilian Lusophone. What will interest us specifically will be the process of translation through which the debates are filtered. How do the debates\"travel\" and what happens to them during the voyage? What happens in the movement from one geographical space and cultural semantics into another? How do these movements translate? What are the different vocabularies? How do the terms themselves shift political and epistemological valence? What happens, then, when \"multiculturalism\" or\"postcoloniality,\" for example, are seen through other national grids, or enter other \"intellectual fields?\" How are \"out-of-place\" ideas reinvoiced, indigenized, co-opted, contained, hybridized, recontextualized, resisted? What is elided or added, or subtly changed, in the process of cross-cultural translation? How do the debates get grafted onto other, preexisting debates? What are the mirrors and grids and prisms through which the debates are seen? What is the role of national narcissism and exceptionalism? What anxieties and Utopians come into play when debates travel? Our approach throughout will be transdisciplinary, drawing on cultural studies, media studies, literary theory, and so forth.We will address the ways that popular culture can filter and reframe the debates. Popular culture, in this sense, will be invoked as illustrative of our larger themes but also as a form of intellectual/cultural agency in a globalized world. ***Those students interested in taking this seminar should email Robert Stam at rps1@nyu.edu by April 15. The email should state your status in the grad program, any relevant past courses/reading/research, your particular interest in the seminar, and particular project, if any, that you would like to work on during the seminar.

Certificate Program in Culture and Media     The Departments of Anthropology and Cinema Studies offer a specialized joint course of study leading to a New York State Certificate in Culture and Media for NYU graduate students who are also pursuing their PhD degrees in Anthropology or Cinema Studies. The program\u2019s philosophy takes a broad approach to the relationships   between culture and media in a number of domains including: ethnographic   film\u2019s significance for the fields of anthropology and cinema/media   studies; problems in representation of cultures through media; the   development of media in indigenous, Diaspora, and non-Western   communities; the emerging social and cultural formations shaped by new   media practices; the political economy shaping the production,   distribution and consumption of media worldwide; and the impact of new   media technologies on these processes.   This graduate program provides a focused course of studies   integrating production with theory and research. Training in this   program will enable students to pursue the following:   -Production work in state-of-the-art digital video based on their   own research, resulting in a twenty-thirty minute documentary. Student   works have shown in festivals worldwide, won multiple awards, and are in   distribution.  For a list of recent student documentaries click here .      -Ethnographic research into the social practice of media in a range of   communities and cultures. Students from the program have done PhD   research on the development of media in diverse settings, from the   emergence of film and TV in Papua New Guinea, to circulation of   religious media in Northern Nigeria.    -Teaching the history, theory, and production of ethnographic documentary and related issues.    -A career in media requiring an understanding of anthropology, such as   specialized programming and distribution of ethnographic film and   video, community-based documentary production, management of   ethnographic film/video libraries and archives, or work in new media.  Each year, two student works are selected for a pitch session at the prestigious SILVERDOCS documentary festival. http://silverdocs.com/ .

Ethnographic film has a peculiar and highly contested status within anthropology, cinema studies, and documentary practice. In this seminar, we will situate ethnographic film within the wider project of the representation of cultural lives, and especially \"natives\". Starting with what are regarded as the first examples of the genre, we will examine how these emerged in a particular intellectual context and political economy. We will then consider the key works that have defined the genre, and the epistemological and formal innovations associated with them, addressing questions concerning social theory, documentary, as well as the institutional structures through which they are funded, distributed, and seen by various audiences. Throughout the course we will keep in mind the properties of film as a signifying practice, its status as a form of anthropological knowledge, and the ethical and political concerns raised by cross-cultural representation.   CULTURE &amp; MEDIA II: ETHNOGRAPHY OF MEDIA (Ginsburg/Ganti)    In the last decade, a new field \u2014 the ethnography of media \u2014 has emerged as an exciting new arena of research. While claims about media in peoples lives are made on a daily basis, surprisingly little research has actually attempted to look at how media is part of the naturally occurring lived realities of people\u2019s lives. In the last decade, anthropologists and media scholars interested in film, television, and video have been turning their attention increasingly beyond the text and empiricist notions of audiences, (stereotypically associated with the ethnography of media), to consider, ethnographically, the complex social worlds in which media is produced, circulated and consumed, at home and elsewhere. This work theorizes media studies from the point of view of cross-cultural ethnographic realities and anthropology from the perspective of new spaces of communication focusing on the social, economic and political life of media and how it makes a difference in the daily lives of people as a practice, whether in production, reception, or circulation.    The class will be organized around case studies that interrogate broader issues that are particularly endemic to questions of cross-cultural media including debates over cultural imperialism vs. the autonomy of local producers/consumers, the instability and stratification of reception, the shift from national to transnational circuits of production and consumption, the increasing complicity of researchers with their subjects over representations of culture, and the historically and culturally contingent ways in which images are read and used. These concerns are addressed in a variety of locations, from the complex circulation of films, photos, and lithographs, to the ever increasing range of televisual culture \u2014 from state sponsored melodramas, religious epics and soap operas, to varieties of public television; to the activist use of video, radio, the internet, and small media.    CULTURAL THEORY AND THE DOCUMENTARY (Toby Lee)    This course considers the actual and possible forms of relation between theories of culture and society and the mode of nonfiction cinema known as (social) documentary. From one perspective, theory is a discourse of explanation that is applied, concurrently or retroactively, to the images of culture presented in documentary films: films present raw material of culture to be theorized aesthetically, sociologically, psychologically, historically, politically, and so on. But at the same time, documentary filmmaking can be conceived as an intellectual discourse, what its founders called \u201ca method of philosophic reasoning\u201d (Paul Rotha), one meant to reflect or challenge certain cultural and social ideas. Despite the order of terms in the title of this course, what theory means to documentary, and vice versa, has always been an open question. This course explores various ways to answer the question.    SIGHT AND SOUND DOCUMENTARY (SUMMER COURSE) (Marco Williams)    The intensive six week summer course teaches students to look at their world and to develop the ability to create compelling and dramatic stories in which real people are the characters and real life is the plot. Through close study and analysis of feature length and short documentaries, and hands-on directing, shooting, sound-recording, editing and re-editing, students will rigorously explore the possibilities and the power of non-fiction story telling for film and video. The course is a dynamic combination of individual and group production work, in which each student will be expected to complete five projects. While tuition is covered, please be advised that there is a lab fee of approximately $600.   VIDEO PRODUCTION SEMINAR (Stout/Furjanic/Vail )    A two-semester seminar that provides training and equipment for advanced graduate students to produce a media ethnography or short documentary. During the fall semester, in-class instruction, lab exercises, and readings introduce digital audio and video production, including shooting and editing with HD cameras, professional audio equipment, and Final Cut Pro non-linear editing systems. Focusing on ethnographic media practices, students also address key representational, methodological, and ethical issues in the production of ethnographic documentary. By the completion of the fall term, students will have chosen a topic and field site for their final projects and completed a short video (5-10 minutes). During the spring semester, students continue to work intensively on their projects by shooting, editing, and screening their footage. The course culminates in a public screening of students\u2019 completed, 20-30 min. ethnographic documentaries. Attendance in class and lab sessions is mandatory, and students who fail to complete all fall assignments will not be allowed to register for the spring semester. Students should come into the class with a well-developed project idea.    THE SEMINAR IS RESTRICTED TO STUDENTS IN THE PROGRAM IN CULTURE AND MEDIA. IT IS LIMITED TO TEN STUDENTS AND REQUIRES PERMISSION OF THE INSTRUCTOR. Culture &amp; Media I and Sight and Sound Documentary (summer session) are mandatory pre-requisites. There is no lab fee, but students are expected to provide their own videotapes. For a list of recent student documentaries click here.    SELECTED ELECTIVE COURSES/ CINEMA STUDIES and ANTHROPOLOGY/FALL 2014       Culture, Meaning and Society ANTH-GA 1222 (Rogers) This introduction to sociocultural anthropology is designed for graduate students working primarily in other disciplines, and is intended to give them a grasp of specifically anthropological ways of defining researchable questions, collecting data, and drawing inference. In the first half of the semester, we will consider the 20thcentury development of some of the basic concepts and practices that have defined the discipline (notably the culture concept, ethnographic fieldwork methods). In the second half of the semester, we will read a series of recent ethnographic case-studies to further explore current anthropological approaches to a selection of specific topics. These will be chosen largely as a function of student interests, but may include gender, religion, education, among others. *** Open only to non-Anthropology Graduate students.  Documentary Traditions CINE GT 1400 (Bagnall) Mondays 6:20 \u2013 9 PM   Fourteen sessions are devoted to a comparison of current documentaries with those made in earlier decades to illustrate how the art has responded to social, political, and economic realities and to changes in technology and systems of distribution. Undergraduates who take the course for 3 points are required to keep journals in which they respond to each session and compare observations with those made when viewing at least one documentary of their choice seen outside class, as well as in response to critical essays provided at each session and references in the text. Those wishing to earn an extra point (register for one point of H56.1097 Independent Study) may write a substantial term paper based on a topic approved by the instructor. French New Wave CINE GT 1513 (Stam) This course offers an historical and critical overview of one of the most dynamic and influential film movements within the history of the cinema -- the French New Wave \u2013 a movement that has influenced filmmakers all over the world. After examining the philosophical underpinnings of the movement in philosophical existentialism (Jean-Paul Sartre, Simone de Beauvoir) and the theoretical underpinnings in the film criticism of Cahiers du Cinema, we will examine key films and directors. We will explore the three core groups that together formed the New Wave, notably 1) the Cahiers directors (Truffaut, Godard, Chabrol, Rivette, Rohmer); 2) the Left Bank directors (Resnais, Duras, Varda, Marker); and 3) Cinema Verite (Jean Rouch, Edgar Morin). While we will focus largely on the films themselves, we will situate New Wave films within a broader spectrum of philosophy, literature, and the art. Some key themes in the course will be: first-person auteur cinema; artistic modernism and the New Wave; the relation between film and the other arts; the revolution in film language; the filmic adaptation of novels; and feminism and the New Wave; race, gender and sexuality; the evolution of style; and the political evolution leading up to the near-revolution of May 1968. The course will approach the New Wave through 1) critical writing, including by the directors themselves; 2) the screening of a chronologically arranged series of feature films; and 3) the analysis of short clips related to the larger themes. The goal of the course is for students to gain an overall sense of the historical importance of the New Wave, of the characteristic styles and themes of the key directors, and of some of the theories that circulated around such films. Topics in Documentary Film CINE GT 2002 (Lee) The term \"expanded documentary\" points both to the ways in which traditional documentary practices have diversified and transformed over the last few decades, particularly with changes in media technologies, as well as to different ways we might re-examine other film, media and art traditions through the lens of documentary practice. In this course, we consider how the documentary impulse functions in film, video, animation, sound; in the gallery, in the archive, in public space, in cyberspace; in forms linear and nonlinear, online and off. We also investigate the role of documentation in relation to performance and social practice art. In tracing these variations of documentary practice over time, we approach these expanded forms of non-fiction media not as addenda to documentary traditions, but rather as opportunities to reflect critically on those traditions, to connect present developments to historical precedents, and to pry open our sense of documentary as form, endeavor and practice. (Cross-listed with CINE-UT 417) Nonfiction Film History CINE GT 2307 (Streible, TBA) This course introduces students to the study of nonfiction film. It explores the history and theory of nonfiction cinema, including\u2014but not limited to\u2014documentary film. The established milestones of the international tradition of documentary\u2014from the romantic mythmaking of Robert Flaherty to the leftist collectives and state propaganda projects of the 1930s and 1940s, through cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9 of the 1960s and the activist and personal styles of recent decades\u2014are considered. But the course also places documentary in a broader context that includes forms of nonfiction typically segregated from the traditional conception of documentary. Some are somewhat familiar forms, such as actualities, travelogues, and newsreels. Others have been largely ignored by scholars until quite recently: sponsored, industrial, educational, scientific, and medical films; home movies and other amateur films; outtakes and other archival footage. Viewed both as discrete works of cinema and as artifacts of social and cultural significance, such orphaned films pose problems of history, culture, and aesthetics that challenge traditional conceptions of making, viewing, and studying films. Students read primary historical sources, as well as new scholarly approaches to the global history of nonfiction film, and to the possible uses and meanings of this vast archive.   Adv. Sem. Paradigms of Globalization CINE GT 2835 (Choi) This course examines multiple histories, structures, theories and key concepts of globalization, linking them with issues in the nation-state, post/modernity, post/colonialism, cultural imperialism, post/Fordism, empire, and trans/national identities. It brings together different forms of knowledge from anthropology, sociology, cultural studies, and political economy to bear on film and media studies troubled by geo-cultural uncertainty and convergence. ***Those students interested in taking this seminar should email JungBong Choi at jbc7@nyu.edu . The email should state your status in the grad program, any relevant past courses/ reading/ research, your particular interest in the seminar, and particular project, if any, that you would like to work on during the seminar. Adv. Sem. Comparative Post-colonialism CINE GT 3207 (Stam) Alongside and in the aftermath of the \"culture wars\" in the United States, many battle lines, national and transnational, have formed around such inter-related issues as \"postcoloniality,\" \"comparative imperialism,\"\"critical race\" and so forth. Challenged and debated from many directions, the terms themselves have become subject to diverse political force-fields, in some ways becoming sliding signifiers onto which diverse groups project their hopes and fears, their fantasies and anxieties. Our seminar will focus on the ways these debates are articulated differently in three zones: the Anglo-American, the French and Francophone, and the Brazilian Lusophone. What will interest us specifically will be the process of translation through which the debates are filtered. How do the debates\"travel\" and what happens to them during the voyage? What happens in the movement from one geographical space and cultural semantics into another? How do these movements translate? What are the different vocabularies? How do the terms themselves shift political and epistemological valence? What happens, then, when \"multiculturalism\" or\"postcoloniality,\" for example, are seen through other national grids, or enter other \"intellectual fields?\" How are \"out-of-place\" ideas reinvoiced, indigenized, co-opted, contained, hybridized, recontextualized, resisted? What is elided or added, or subtly changed, in the process of cross-cultural translation? How do the debates get grafted onto other, preexisting debates? What are the mirrors and grids and prisms through which the debates are seen? What is the role of national narcissism and exceptionalism? What anxieties and Utopians come into play when debates travel? Our approach throughout will be transdisciplinary, drawing on cultural studies, media studies, literary theory, and so forth.We will address the ways that popular culture can filter and reframe the debates. Popular culture, in this sense, will be invoked as illustrative of our larger themes but also as a form of intellectual/cultural agency in a globalized world. ***Those students interested in taking this seminar should email Robert Stam at rps1@nyu.edu by April 15.

Kane (PhD 2011) is the author of Chromatic Algorithms: Synthetic Color, Computer Art, and Aesthetics after Code (University of Chicago Press 2014), a book analyzing the role of electronic color in creative computing after 1960. Dr. Kane is also a postdoctoral fellow at Brown University (2014-2015) and assistant professor of visual communications at Ryerson University in Toronto. Her teaching and research fields include the history and philosophy of new media and digital aesthetics.         May Farah received her PhD from MCC in 2011 and recently accepted a position as Assistant Professor in the Department of Sociology, Anthropology and Media Studies at the American University of Beirut. Her research interests include mediated nationalism and representations, transnationalism and spatiality, and new media. Her dissertation, entitled Home versus Shelter: Place, Media, and Identity among Lebanon&rsquo;s Palestinian Refugees , focused on the relationship between diasporic populations and national identity in a globalized media age. Her work is situated at the intersections of Media Studies, Cultural Studies, and Middle Eastern Studies.         Scott Selberg (PhD 2013) joins the University of Michigan as a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Michigan Society of Fellows and as an Assistant Professor in the Department of Communication Studies . Selberg's research explores the visual culture of Alzheimer's disease. His dissertation traced the visual culture of Alzheimer&rsquo;s since its discovery at the beginning of the 20th century in order to show how certain techniques and technologies of representation help articulate popular knowledge and values of cognition, aging, and personhood. It described the history of how the disease has been represented in popular and public culture, such as Hollywood movies, scientific imagery, and pharmaceutical marketing, also investigating how the ethics and aesthetics of representation itself are essential to the imagination of the disease in America.         Hatim El-Hibri (PhD 2012) has joined the American University of Beirut as Assistant Professor in the Department of Sociology, Anthropology and Media Studies . His research examines media technologies and urban space in the Middle East. His dissertation traced the history of the visualization of Beirut, from the politics of aerial photography and mapping during the French Mandate, to the visual economy of postwar construction, to the materiality of Hizballah's live satellite television. His current book project situates Beirut in regional and global topologies of power, and considers implications for how we understand the materiality of urban infrastructures, the mediation of ethno-religious belonging, and the place of Arab media in global visual culture.         Jennifer E. Telesca (PhD 2014) is Assistant Professor of Environmental Justice in the Department of Social Science and Cultural Studies at the Pratt Institute. Her dissertation, Red Gold: On the Global Politics of Regulating Marine Life probes how diplomats from across the globe make decisions about marine life on the high seas. Based on three years of ethnographic research, her study examines how the prized bluefin tuna mediates the tension between marine conservation and the global commodities trade, and asks for whom is the Atlantic governed.         Matthew Powers (PhD 2013) has accepted a tenure-track position as an Assistant Professor in the Department of Communication at the University of Washington-Seattle. Powers' research looks at the information work of NGOs, the types of news coverage they support, and whether NGOs expand or reinforce established patterns of international news attention. His dissertation, \"Humanity's Publics: NGOs, Journalism and the International Public Sphere,\" examines reporting roles assumed by international NGOs as legacy media outlets cut their foreign news budgets. The International Communication Association presented Powers with the Gene Burd Outstanding Dissertation in Journalism Studies award at its annual conference.          Devon Powers (PhD 2008) is Associate Professor in the Department of Communication at Drexel University, where she also serves as Director of Undergraduate Studies. Powers' research interests include popular music, 20th century history, and cultural intermediation &ndash; the people and processes that operate \"in between\" the production and consumption of culture. Her book Writing the Record: The Village Voice and the Birth of Rock Criticism was published in 2013. Powers completed a fellowship at the University of Leeds in 2014.         Currently a Postdoctoral Research Associate at the Center for Information Technology Policy at Princeton University , Solon Barocas (PhD 2014) wrote his dissertation on the novel challenges that data mining poses to fairness and privacy. Examples include the use of predictive analytics for counterterrorism, voter microtargeting in political campaigns, the impact of data mining techniques on model-building in economics and finance, and the integration of evidence-based medicine with clinical decision support systems. He has also collaborated on projects that have explored policies for facial recognition technology and alternatives to the current model of online behavioral advertising.         Michael Zimmer (PhD 2007) spent a year as a postdoctoral fellow at Yale's Information Society Project before joining the faculty at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee. In addition to being an Assistant Professor in its School of Information Studies, he serves as Director of the University's Center for Information Policy Research. Zimmer credits Helen Nissenbaum's research for shaping his early interest in privacy. His dissertation explored the concept of the ideal search engine&mdash;the promise of navigating physical and intellectual space and the perils associated with this boundless flow of information. Zimmer continues his work in privacy (theory &amp; applied); one angle being the ethical implications of digital services made available by Library 2.0, such as large-scale digitization projects.         Max Liboiron (PhD 2012) is Assistant Professor in Culture and Technology in the Department of Sociology at Memorial University of Newfoundland and Labrador . Her previous appointments include a postdoctoral fellowship with ISTC-Social and at the Social Science Environmental Health Research Institute at Northeastern University. Liboiron's thesis Redefining Pollution: Plastics in the Wild uses ocean plastics and endocrine disruptors that leach from plastics to investigate how scientific and technological techniques used to describe a environmental phenomenon influence the definition of pollution and dictate forms of pollution control.         Alice Marwick (PhD 2010) joined the Department of Communication and Media Studies at Fordham in Fall 2012 as an Assistant Professor. Before this, Marwick completed a two-year postdoc at Microsoft Research, where she collaborated with danah boyd, among others, on ethnographic research involving youth populations and social media. Marwick's dissertation examined ideas of identity, status, and techniques for self-promotion that grew up around the birth of web 2.0, or social media technologies. Marwick is finishing a book on this subject for Yale Press, and says her next big project will consider conspicuous consumption in the digital realm. Part of this will include the study of visual-based online communities such as Tumblr and fashion blogs.         Jacob Gaboury (PhD 2014) joins the Department of Cultural Analysis and Theory at Stony Brook as an Assistant Professor. His research interests include new and digital media, media history, art and technology, queer theory, and media archaeology. His dissertation, \"Image Objects: An Archaeology of Computer Graphics, 1965-1979,\" investigated the early history of computer graphics and the role they play in the move toward new forms of simulation and object oriented design. Jacob is also currently a staff writer for the art and technology organization Rhizome at the New Museum for Contemporary Art in New York City, where he writes on contemporary art and technology.                         Next Feature &gt;&gt;                      Featured Video                  PROGRAM is a collaborative, interdisciplinary event series organized by graduate students within New York University\u2019s departments of Media, Culture, and Communication, English, and Comparative Literature. The series will present talks that explore the cultural, historical, aesthetic, and political impact of software and programming logic.  The goal of the series is to create an interactive space for the exploration of emerging practices across media and literature, both online and off. To this end we have organized a series of events, in which a pair of prominent scholars will explore one particular methodological approach to the study of software\u2019s impact on culture and literature, including media archaeology, software aesthetics, ubiquitous computing and urban space, and game design and narrative.  The series is open to the public, and is intended to facilitate a dialogue on the intersections of these fields.

Several guiding principles shape the intellectual projects of our Department:       A commitment to interdisciplinarity in the study of media and culture. Scholars and doctoral students engage with theoretical concepts and perspectives from a range of disciplines, including media studies, cultural studies, media history, visual culture, sound studies, anthropology, sociology, political science, and so on, in order to deploy interdisciplinary strategies of analysis.    A multi-methodological approach that draws on a diverse array of research methods in media and cultural analysis, including audience studies, semiotics, ethnography, qualitative and quantitative discourse analysis, in-depth interviewing, political/cultural economy, network analysis, and other interpretive and critical approaches.    A historical perspective that situates the study of media, technology, and culture within historical contexts, comparative historical research, media archaeology, genealogy, and media history.    A global, comparative approach in relation to cultural differences, media forms, historical frameworks, and theoretical paradigms.       The doctoral program offers five research areas, which operate as guiding frameworks for intellectual inquiry across the Department. These areas of research are overlapping and interrelated, and we encourage students to take advantage of course offerings in all five areas.    Global and Transcultural Studies While all of our doctoral research areas integrate the study of media, technology, and culture in the context of an increasingly globalized world, this research area specifically centers on inflections of the global mediascape as cross-national, transnational, or transcultural. Specific areas include: critical theories of globalization, transcultural flows, international development and postcolonial studies, comparative media systems, cross-national comparative research design, global social movements, international and intra-national media and culture treaties and policymaking, critical cultural geography, alternative modernities, and global ethnography. Faculty areas of regional expertise include: the Middle East, South Asia, East Asia, South and North America, Africa, and Eastern and Western Europe.    Technology and Society The study of technology as a political, cultural, economic, and aesthetic force is a crucial area of analysis for contemporary media scholarship. Our Department emphasizes the philosophy and politics of technology within cultural and social frameworks. Specific areas of focus include ethnographies of technological communities; philosophical, ethical, social and political dimensions of information and communications technology; information and communications policy; history of technological devices and forms of mediation; the history of science and technology; media archaeology and the study of \"dead media\"; the legal implications of technological regulation and change; copyright and intellectual property; information technologies, media, and privacy; the effects of digital and/or social media on society; visual technologies; and technologies of the built environment.    Visual Culture and Sound Studies Scholarship on visual culture and sound studies is an important emerging field across our disciplines. The study of visual culture recognizes the primary role of visual media in the enactment of power relations, the circulation of information and ideas, and the cultural practices that make meaning. Visual culture is about the study of images across a range of social arenas, from the news to art, advertising, science, fashion, television, film, digital images, architecture, and amateur media, acknowledging the experience of cross-mediation as a key factor in the contemporary visual realm. The study of visual culture is global, political, and engaged with interdisciplinary inquiries. Sound studies incorporates cultural, technological, philosophical, institutional, and interpretive approaches to practices of consuming and producing mediated sound. As an interdisciplinary field of study, it draws on media history, aesthetics, cultural analysis, formalist methods, ethnography, technological mediation, and an understanding of social and global activity determined by its auditory, sonic, and communicative materiality.    Media Institutions and Politics Mediated communication in all its forms is critically examined by exploring the relationships of power involved in its creation, distribution, and consumption. Specific areas of inquiry include: the political economy of media systems; legal and regulatory regimes of mediated communication; the professional practices and organizational routines of workers in the culture industries, including journalism, public relations, advertising, and the entertainment industry; critical discourse and content analyses of news; state-manufactured propaganda; media ecology; legislative debate and shaping of public policy; historical and contemporary social movements; processes of protest, public dissent and censorship; political campaign communication; media activism and advocacy; and other political uses of media and communication technologies.    Critical Theories of Media and Communication The study of media and communication requires engagement with a variety of theoretical traditions, including historical materialism, psychoanalysis, phenomenology, pragmatism, the Frankfurt School of critical theory, gender and queer theory, critical race theory, critical legal theory, field theory, actor-network theory, speculative realism, speech-act theory, and the various strands of structuralism and post-structuralism. The Department approaches critical theory from the perspective of critique, that is to say, from an ongoing self-examination of how knowledge and culture are created, acquired, maintained, and transmitted. In its core courses and elective seminars the graduate program seeks to train doctoral students to be subtle yet rigorous practitioners of critique in its many forms.
