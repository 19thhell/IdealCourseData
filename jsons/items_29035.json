OART-UT 1916 Acting for the Stage and Screen 8 units Prerequisite: Applicants to the acting program should have a minimum of one year acting training or equivalent.    Acting for Stage and Screen is the Open Arts Studio at NYU\u2019s Tisch School of the Arts. It is designed for a select, diverse student body, ready to challenge and stretch the physical and emotional instrument of the actor. The studio is dedicated to developing the actor's entire instrument-the body, the voice, and the imagination. Training frees the actor, so that he/she is able to go with his instincts and impulses; out of the head and into the viscera. In scene study classes the student discovers the importance of text analysis and staying in the moment, and the need for selecting strong objectives, formidable obstacles, varied actions, and meaningful personalizations. The Alexander technique and teachings of Linklater is used in voice production. The movement component includes yoga, circus, and the teachings of Laban.    Angela Pietropinto, actor and teacher, as well as a Tisch alumnae and director of the studio, has assembled a faculty composed of master teachers, dedicated to teaching the creative process an actor must go through in order to become a conduit for a playwright's ideas. The studio's faculty members are working theater professionals as well as experienced teachers. The faculty exposes students to the ideas and philosophies of contemporary and classical playwrights.    The second half of the semester aims to integrate the movement, voice production, games/improvisation, scene study, and film production techniques and apply them to the students' scenes. The director and instructors collaborate to utilize all of the training to bring the dramatic and comic text to life.    Areas of Study:       Movement    Voice Production    Games/Improv    Clowning    Commedia Dell'Arte    Scene Study    Film Production    Students will attend the studio 9:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. three days a week. The other days are spent taking academic courses. On the last day of class there is an informal presentation of the scenes students have been working on. Movement pieces created under the guidance of the movement teacher are also presented.
