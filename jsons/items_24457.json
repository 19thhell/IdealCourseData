Challenging repertoire includes music from Renaissance to Contemporary and all things in between. The group is trained to perform without a conductor. In addition to participating in the fall and spring concerts at the university, the ensemble pursues its mission to bring music to the community by performing at local public and private schools, such as the George Jackson Academy, and hospitals and senior centers including the Hallmark Senior Residence in Battery Park City. Madrigal Singers also takes its program to organizations such as the Salmagundi Arts Club and others dedicated to supporting the arts. The ensemble is involved in the revitalization of the NYU Choral Alumni and last year at the Memorial/Dedication of the plaque for Marian Konstan, they performed in the choral suite at the Kimmel Center. The New York University Madrigal Singers performed at the 29th Annual Conference of the International Society of Music Education held in Beijing, China in August of 2010. In spring of 2011, the ensemble did a combined concert with the Yale University Madrigal singers, and last January, together with the NYU Jazz Choir, traveled to the middle east to perform 9 concerts at United Arab Emirates University, The University at Sharjah and NYU Abu Dhabi. In the Spring of 2013, they performed at St. Joseph&rsquo;s Church in Greenwich Village, with Nassim Al Saba, the choir from the American University of Sharjah.
