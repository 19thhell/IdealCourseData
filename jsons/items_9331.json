Friday, February 21st, 2014 &ndash; Saturday, February 22nd, 2014   Deutsches Haus at NYU     NYU\u2019s Department of German welcomes the celebrated Turkish-German author Emine Sevgi \u00d6zdamar as the fourth DAAD Distinguished Chair in Contemporary Poetics. On the occasion of her visit, this conference reflects on contemporary German literature as a transnational phenomenon. German Studies over the past two decades have been driven to acknowledge shifts within the native literary scene, which has been shaped by Germany\u2019s transition toward an increasingly multicultural, multiethnic, and multilingual society. Engaging discourses of postcolonial studies and transnational literatures, exciting scholarship is being conducted about the changing face of contemporary German literature, a literature which increasingly looks beyond the geographic confines of the German state. \u00d6zdamar\u2019s works have been of singular importance for this shift, and her writings have opened new possibilities for interlinguistic, international, and interdisciplinary exchange. German Literature, Transnational was organized by Alys George, Assistant Professor of German, Department of German, New York University. The conference German Literature, Transnational is generously supported by the DAAD and Deutsches Haus at NYU, with additional support from NYU's Department of German and NYU's Dean for the Humanities. SCHEDULE OF EVENTS Friday, February 21, 2014 6:30-8:30 FILM PREMIERE &amp; ROUNDTABLE The documentary film \u201cGermany, As Told by Writers Christoph Hein, Wladimir Kaminer, Emine Sevgi \u00d6zdamar, and Bernhard Schlink\u201d (Dir. Olivier Morel; ARTE 2014) focuses on how renowned contemporary writers living in Germany and writing in German are interacting with the country\u2019s history in their personal, public, and creative lives.

Emphasis is on literature, language, and civilization. Civilization is interpreted here as including broader cultural works affecting the study of literature, including the theater and the cinema. Recent departmental interests include German exile literature; war and literature; German critical theory; and immigrant writing in German.   The collection also supports course work and research in the following programs: Comparative Literature; Dramatic Literature, Theatre History, and the Cinema; Literature in Translation; Women's Studies; and the Foreign Language Education Program at the School of Education.   The interdisciplinary approach of courses and research within the German department are supported by the various pertinent collections in art, history, philosophy, and the social sciences.                 Scope       Language   The collection consists principally of literary texts and criticism in German. Works of major authors are also collected in English translation. Criticism, literary history, and theory are collected in German as well as in English. Works written  in other Western European languages are collected very selectively.       Geographical Areas   Coverage includes a major emphasis on German literature of Germany, Austria, and Switzerland, and a representative body of German literature from the German immigrant (\"Ausl&auml;nder - Immigranten - Gastarbeiter\") community.       Chronological Periods   Coverage of German literature is from the medieval period to the present with current emphasis on the late 18th, and the 19th and 20th centuries.                     Types of Materials         Included    Monographs, monographic series, serials, newspapers, proceedings, facsimiles, reprints, microforms, audio-visual and electronic media (including electronic texts). Exhibition catalogs and dissertations are acquired very selectively.          Excluded    Dissertations when requested only for individual research, manuscripts, textbooks, ephemera, maps.                      Strengths &amp; Weaknesses of the Collection   The retrospective collection of 19th-century literature is a strong research collection, especially for primary and secondary resources on Goethe and Schiller. More generally, special emphasis is placed on the literature dating from 1750 to the  present, as well as on the works of modern philosophers and theorists (e.g., Habermas) and sociologists (e.g., U. Jaeggi and R. Dahrendorf).   Recently, efforts have been made to retrospectively collect important critical editions not acquired in the past. Furthermore, special attention has been paid to World War I, Weimar, pacifist and emigr&eacute; literature. This included the  acquisition of a private library of German literature imprints from the 20s and 30s and special collection items relating to pacifism, and literature and war.   The teaching of German language and linguistics and faculty research in this area have decreased; therefore, works are now selected quite stringently. However, there is an interest in research on second language acquisition.   Works in literary criticism, history, and theory, as well as subsidiary works relating to broader aspects of German culture important to literary research, are carefully selected so as to reflect the Department's needs and to maintain a  representative collection of primary and secondary sources in all centuries.   Continuing efforts will focus on the development of a collection with particular strengths in the late 18th century and the 19th and 20th centuries, the acquisition of multiple copies of works in heavy demand, and the systematic identification  and replacement of missing or worn volumes of standard works.                 Other Resources      Erich Maria Remarque's library and papers are available in Special Collections.    Instructional materials (including language tapes acquired by the language lab) are available in the Lewis Levine Language Laboratory.    For additional information regarding the library's collection in German see the following statements: Film and Broadcasting, Comparative Literature; Linguistics; Performing Arts; Philosophy and Religion; Politics; Sociology; World History.
