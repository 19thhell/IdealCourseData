The NYU Abu Dhabi Summer Academy is an 18-month program designed to enhance the academic profiles of highly-motivated Abu Dhabi-based Emirati high school students. Following a competitive admissions process, program participants are selected as recipients of the Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Scholarships for Outstanding High School Students, which enables them to attend the Summer Academy. In this mixed gender program, students are exposed to a rich cultural and rigorous academic program which enhances their ability to gain admission to and perform well at top-tier English-language universities. The program begins during the summer following the 10th year of high school and continues for the following 18 months, with two intensive summer courses of study in Abu Dhabi and at two of NYU\u2019s global locations: Florence, Italy, and New York City. In addition, students participate in online study and academic refresher weekends during the academic year.   The curriculum includes the following components:     Critical thinking and writing   Mathematical reasoning for the sciences   Test preparation (SAT and TOEFL) and college admissions counseling   Leadership development and public speaking     Instruction takes place in Abu Dhabi, followed by trips to NYU's locations in Florence, Italy and New York, in the first and second summers, respectively.                                                                               The NYUAD Summer Academy not only provides our students with the intellectual resources and skill development they require for future success, but also offers them a character-building life experience.       Her Highness Sheikha Mariam bint Mohamed bin Zayed al Nahyan                        The program prepares students to present compelling admissions dossiers to the top universities in the world, including NYUAD. Although completion of the program does not guarantee admission to NYUAD, or any of the other campuses within NYU's global network, graduates will be more qualified and better prepared to attend elite higher education institutions than they would have been without the benefit of the program.

The NYU Abu Dhabi Summer Academy is an 18-month program designed to enhance the academic profiles of highly-motivated Abu Dhabi-based Emirati high school students. Following a competitive admissions process, program participants are selected as recipients of the Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Scholarships for Outstanding High School Students, which enables them to attend the Summer Academy. In this mixed gender program, students are exposed to a rich cultural and rigorous academic program which enhances their ability to gain admission to and perform well at top-tier English-language universities. The program begins during the summer following the 10th year of high school and continues for the following 18 months, with two intensive summer courses of study in Abu Dhabi and at two of NYU\u2019s global locations: Florence, Italy, and New York City. In addition, students participate in online study and academic refresher weekends during the academic year.   The curriculum includes the following components:     Critical thinking and writing   Mathematical reasoning for the sciences   Test preparation (SAT and TOEFL) and college admissions counseling   Leadership development and public speaking     Instruction takes place in Abu Dhabi, followed by trips to NYU's locations in Florence, Italy and New York, in the first and second summers, respectively.                                                                               The NYUAD Summer Academy not only provides our students with the intellectual resources and skill development they require for future success, but also offers them a character-building life experience.       Her Highness Sheikha Mariam bint Mohamed bin Zayed al Nahyan                        The program prepares students to present compelling admissions dossiers to the top universities in the world, including NYUAD. Although completion of the program does not guarantee admission to NYUAD, or any of the other campuses within NYU's global network, graduates will be more qualified and better prepared to attend elite higher education institutions than they would have been without the benefit of the program.

The NYU Abu Dhabi Summer Academy is an 18-month program designed to enhance the academic profiles of highly-motivated Abu Dhabi-based Emirati high school students. Following a competitive admissions process, program participants are selected as recipients of the Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Scholarships for Outstanding High School Students, which enables them to attend the Summer Academy. In this mixed gender program, students are exposed to a rich cultural and rigorous academic program which enhances their ability to gain admission to and perform well at top-tier English-language universities. The program begins during the summer following the 10th year of high school and continues for the following 18 months, with two intensive summer courses of study in Abu Dhabi and at two of NYU\u2019s global locations: Florence, Italy, and New York City. In addition, students participate in online study and academic refresher weekends during the academic year.   The curriculum includes the following components:     Critical thinking and writing   Mathematical reasoning for the sciences   Test preparation (SAT and TOEFL) and college admissions counseling   Leadership development and public speaking     Instruction takes place in Abu Dhabi, followed by trips to NYU's locations in Florence, Italy and New York, in the first and second summers, respectively.                                                                               The NYUAD Summer Academy not only provides our students with the intellectual resources and skill development they require for future success, but also offers them a character-building life experience.       Her Highness Sheikha Mariam bint Mohamed bin Zayed al Nahyan                        The program prepares students to present compelling admissions dossiers to the top universities in the world, including NYUAD. Although completion of the program does not guarantee admission to NYUAD, or any of the other campuses within NYU's global network, graduates will be more qualified and better prepared to attend elite higher education institutions than they would have been without the benefit of the program.
