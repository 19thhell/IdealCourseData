The faculty members are world-renowned for their scholarship and engagement in policy debates. Several of them have significant expertise in government or private practice.     Combining state-of-the-art policy and technical expertise with sophisticated legal analysis, the LLM in Competition, Innovation and Information Law (CIIL) is unique in its approach to training students by developing an integrated understanding of the dynamic forces that shape contemporary economic activity and innovation. In the CIIL program, students choose one of two areas of focus\u2014Antitrust and Competition Policy, or Intellectual Property and Information Law\u2014while gaining an introductory foothold in the other area of focus along with exposure to other related areas of law.   The CIIL program also draws on NYU\u2019s strength in international law. The faculty includes leading experts in international and comparative aspects of competition policy and intellectual property law. Their courses and seminars offer students the opportunity to understand the importance of competition policy and intellectual property law in today\u2019s global economy.   Cutting-edge Research and Policy Initiatives   The Colloquium on Innovation Policy explores the law\u2019s role in promoting creativity and invention. Offered annually in the spring semester, students learn from top academics around the country who are invited to the Law School to speak about their recent research or publications.   The Engelberg Center on Innovation Law and Policy and the Information Law Institute sponsor a tremendous variety of lectures, symposia, research projects and policy initiatives. The Information Law Institute includes a very active Privacy Research Group.   Rich Curriculum   The extensive curriculum provides ample options for varied interests. Our professors approach their classes with a keen sense of balancing academic and theoretical discussions with practical, real-world examples of the evolving implementation of regulation and policy in the U.S. and abroad.   In addition to a course in US Antitrust law and the basic intellectual property law classes, students may choose from a wide selection of advanced seminars and courses.

The Office of Career Services assists students with their job search process, through training and sessions with alumni, to prepare them for entry into positions in the private law market. The Public Interest Law Center is the main resource for students with an interest in pursuing positions in government, NGOs, international organizations, or other public interest employment. The Academic Careers Program assists students interested in law teaching.   Each year NYU hosts two large job fairs. The International Student Interview Program brings students together with employers from around the globe. The Public Interest Legal Career Fair is the largest of its kind in the nation.   The International Finance and Development Fellowship Program provides a select number of LLM graduates with funding from the Law School to pursue a short-term fellowship at an international organization, such as the World Intellectual Property Organization.                 Competition Law Workshop           The workshop provides an opportunity for young scholars to present papers to faculty and students interested in competition law.
