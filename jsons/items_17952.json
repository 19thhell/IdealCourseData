Decisions will hopefully go out by the end of March, 2015. ITP is a creative environment at the intersection of Art and Technology in which diversity is valued and collaboration is encouraged. A background in design or computer programming is not required for acceptance into the Interactive Telecommunications Program (ITP). The program is looking for applicants from a diverse range of educational and professional backgrounds who want to explore and create new forms of communication and expression using interactive multimedia technologies. Acceptance into the program is competitive; enrollment is limited to full-time applicants who show exceptional promise and are interested in collaboration and experimentation. Admission for degree candidates is for the Fall semester only. All students entering the program must hold a bachelor&#8217;s degree which can be completed in any subject matter. No entrance examination is required (however, international students must take the Test of English as a Foreign Language, TOEFL English exam. IELTS results are accepted as well).   Admission Application   The Fall 2015 application is now available.\u00a0Applicants to ITP are required to apply online. ( http://graduate.tisch.nyu.edu/page/admissions.html ). This is the general application to the Tisch School of the Arts at NYU. Make sure to specify that you are applying to ITP. With the online application, everything can be submitted online. The creative portfolio can be emailed (preferred) or mailed to ITP&#8217;s admissions coordinator, Midori Yasuda at midori.yasuda@nyu.edu .

Please do not cover things we can find on your resume. It would be great to also state why you wish to come to ITP.       What do you love to do?       Where do you see urgent challenges and where do you see hopeful opportunities? \u00a0How might ITP help?       Whom do you think is most important to the world\u2019s future, and why?       How were you shaped by where and how you were raised and educated?       If Maleficent and Elsa from Frozen got in a fight, what moves would you make illegal?       Tell us about someone&#8211;a teacher, mentor, friend, boss&#8211;who changed your way of thinking.       Your last day on earth\u2026 what would you do?       If you could have one superpower, what would it be? Why?       Is there an object (or tool) you could not live without? Why?       If you could have dinner with anyone in the world, past or present, who would it be.       What do you see as the value and difficulties of working with people who are different than you?       What would be a dream team for you to work with? What would you work with them on? \u00a0Why?       What organizations would you least like to work with, and why?       What&#8217;s a tool, process, or organization that should exist but doesn&#8217;t?       What would the world be like if ice sank instead of floating? Why should it exist? Which work of art changed the way you see the world? What aspects of the world did it cause you to see differently, and why?       5 years from now, you get a thank you note for something you&#8217;ve done. What are you being thanked for?       If you had to build a bookshelf out of mashed potatoes, how would go about it?       Pick a hard problem. What is the simplest way you can imagine making progress on it?       What skills do you bring to an environment in which you\u2019ll get to collaborate with people from a wide range of backgrounds?       Tell us about the group or community that you care about most about serving. Who are they? \u00a0Why do you care about them? What do you see as your role with respect to that group? \u00a0In what ways do you see yourself making their lives better?       2. A resume. Please list your educational background and any work experience whether multimedia\u00a0related or not. \u00a0If you have a LinkedIn account, please provide us with your URL.   \u00a03.

Group interviews are conducted in December through February. We do expect to see everyone living in the tri-state area to come in for a group interview, even if you came for an open house. These interviews give applicants the opportunity to see the physical space, to view student work on display, and to meet current students and staff/faculty. The interviews also allow us to learn more about you. Below are the dates for the Group Interviews. Any and all ITP applicants are encouraged to attend. We will not be able to do individual Skype interviews. Again, participating in a group interview is not mandatory, but we hope to see the majority of you, especially those of you who live in or near the New York area.
