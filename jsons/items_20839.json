However, the Graduate Enrollment Management &amp; Admissions office conducts an independent evaluation of credentials that may differ from the service&rsquo;s evaluation on issues such as three-year degree equivalence.            Testing Information    Click here or read below to find out if your program requires the GRE or GMAT. Your official test scores must be on file before your application will be reviewed.

In certain cases, international graduate students may be required to take an ESL (English as a Second Language) placement exam and, if necessary, attend an intensive English program at NYU&rsquo;s American Language Institute (ALI) upon enrollment. Students may be required to attend this program while taking a reduced load of graduate academic courses. See here for more information on conditional admission for such students.

R&eacute;sum&eacute;   A copy of your most recent r&eacute;sum&eacute; or curriculum vitae must be uploaded to the online application and need not be mailed.       Official Transcripts   Official transcripts are required and must be received before a decision is released. To complete your application, official transcripts are required from all previously-attended post-secondary institutions, even if you were not a matriculated student and/or did not complete an academic program. Failure to submit all transcripts will delay the processing of your application, and failure to report all schools attended may result in admission recission.   Any transcript you upload to the online application will be considered unofficial; please contact your previously-attended institutions to arrange for official transcripts to be mailed directly to our processing center.   Note these specific transcript guidelines:      Transcripts from Indian institutions:          Official mark sheets or attested copies of mark sheets must be received by us in a sealed envelope from the institution.      If sending attested copies of your mark sheets, the attestation must be made by (and only by) the Controller of Examinations or Registrar and received by us in a sealed envelope from the institution.      Note that transcripts that are not in English are subject to the guidelines below (&ldquo;Transcripts not in English from any country&rdquo;).           Transcripts from Chinese institutions:          Transcripts sent from Project 211 institutions (institutions on this list ) must be received by us in a sealed envelope from the institution.      Transcripts from institutions that are not Project 211 institutions must be verified and sent to us directly by (and only by) the China Academic Degrees and Graduate Education Development Center (CDGDC) . Request that your institution send a transcript to CDGDC for verification and forwarding to NYU Engineering. Transcripts sent directly from non-Project 211 institutions will not be considered official.      Note that transcripts that are not in English are subject to the guidelines below (&ldquo;Transcripts not in English from any country&rdquo;) regardless of whether they have received CDGDC verification or not.           Transcripts not in English from any country:          For any transcript that is not issued in English by the institution, an English-language translation is required. (Dual-language transcripts issued by the institution are acceptable and do not require translation.)      All translations must be:             Complete and literal (word-for-word), replicating the original as precisely as possible with no attempts at interpretation or evaluation        Prepared in the same format as the original document        Typed on organization or school letterhead/stationery        Signed or stamped by an approved translator (see below)                 Official translations may be provided by one of the following:             The institution issuing the transcript        A consulate or embassy of the United States or of the institution&rsquo;s country        A professional, certified and/or accredited translation agency                 Translations will not be accepted from:             The applicant or members of his/her family        Individuals not affiliated with any of the organizations listed above.                      Transcripts in English from any other country:          Official transcripts must be received by us in a sealed envelope from the institution.           A note on credential evaluations:          We do accept official, course-by-course evaluations from NACES-member evaluation services (such as the World Education Service, also known as WES ) in lieu of transcripts. However, the Graduate Enrollment Management &amp; Admissions office conducts an independent evaluation of credentials that may differ from the service&rsquo;s evaluation on issues such as three-year degree equivalence.            Testing Information    Click here or read below to find out if your program requires the GRE or GMAT. Your official test scores must be on file before your application will be reviewed.      GRE scores are valid for 5 years. The GRE must be taken again if your GRE scores are older than 5 years.    Applicants who are applying for full-time enrollment must submit official GRE scores (the NYU Polytechnic School of Engineering ETS institution code is 2668 ). The MS in Integrated Digital Media is the only exception and does not require GRE scores for full-time applicants.    Applicants who are applying for part-time enrollment in the following programs must also submit official GRE scores for admission: Biomedical Engineering, Computer Engineering, Computer Science, Cybersecurity, Electrical Engineering, Financial Engineering, and Systems Engineering    GMAT scores may be substituted for the GRE only for applicants to the Management and Management of Technology programs. GMAT scores are valid for 5 years; the GMAT must be taken again if your GMAT scores are older than 5 years.    If the GRE is required for your application, an official GRE score report must be sent electronically to NYU Polytechnic School of Engineering via the ETS institution code 2668 ; a departmental code is not required. Visit the ETS website for more information about the exam.      English Language Proficiency Testing   All applicants to the NYU Polytechnic School of Engineering for graduate study must demonstrate excellent English language skills in reading, writing, speaking, and comprehension. Proficiency will be determined by the TOEFL (Test of English as a Foreign Language)* , IELTS (International English Language Testing System) , CAE (Cambridge English: Advanced) , or Pearson PTE Academic exams. The Office of Graduate Enrollment Management and Admissions reserves the right to request proof of English competency from any applicant. At least one of these exams is required for:      All International applicants (those who have or will request a visa)    Applicants (including US citizens and US Permanent Residents) whose first language is not English and/or who have not completed a bachelor&rsquo;s degree in the United States.     *The NYU Polytechnic School of Engineering TOEFL institution code is 2668 .   Applicants may request a waiver of English Language Proficiency Testing by submitting this form prior to the posted application deadline. The request will be reviewed only after transcripts have been received.   In certain cases, international graduate students may be required to take an ESL (English as a Second Language) placement exam and, if necessary, attend an intensive English program at NYU&rsquo;s American Language Institute (ALI) upon enrollment. Students may be required to attend this program while taking a reduced load of graduate academic courses. See here for more information on conditional admission for such students.   Letters of Recommendation   You are required to send two Letters of Recommendation. Recommendations should be provided by professors, employers, supervisors, or others who are able to comment on your academic achievements, research potential and your professional goals (no friends or relatives please). We ask that you register your recommenders or third-party recommendation service in our online application system. Once registered, your recommenders will be prompted to submit their letters electronically. This method allows you to efficiently monitor and follow up with your recommenders.   Financial Documentation   International students who will require a J-1 or F-1 visa to study at NYU will need to apply for a new I-20 or transfer by submitting financial documentation after admission . Do not submit financial documents (including bank statements and affidavits of support) with your application. Instructions for applying for a new I-20 or transfer will follow your letter of admission (if applicable).   Special Notes from the Office of Graduate Admissions      Please check the online system to confirm that you have successfully submitted your application.    Due to the volume of applications and related materials received, the Office of Graduate Admissions will only contact you if your application was successfully submitted and is deemed INCOMPLETE because of missing required materials. Otherwise you will hear from us when a decision has been rendered.    The following are acceptable document types for uploads to the online application system: PDF, JPEG, JPG, GIF, TIFF, PNG, Bitmap, DOC, DOCX, RTF and TXT.     What happens next?   Once your application has been submitted and all required documents have been received, it will be reviewed by the department to which you applied. When a decision is reached, you will be notified and will be able to access the decision online. If you are admitted, a paper notification will follow, and you will receive information about how to accept/decline your admission.

The program has a strong foundation in traffic engineering, transportation planning, transportation economics, public transportation systems, and intelligent transportation systems. To ensure that you are immediately productive upon graduation, you will tackle projects you will face on the job and work hands-on with modern tools, including, but not limited to Synchro and SIM-Traffic and other simulation programs, HCS+, AutoCAD templates for intersection design, and data collection and processing software.   The program includes a strong focus on the rapidly emerging field of intelligent transportation systems. This field applies telecommunications and information technology to solving a variety of transportation functions, from route guidance systems to automated toll collection systems to the automated highway.   Admission Requirements   You must hold at least a baccalaureate degree from an acceptable institution. You must also have a firm background in quantitative analytic skills. If admitted, students lacking such skills must take remedial courses in addition to degree requirements to strengthen their analytic competency.   In addition, you must show evidence of quantitative analytic ability, generally including a minimum of 2 years of college mathematics. A college-level course in statistics is desirable.   Finally, all foreign students admitted to the program must take an examination in English before registration.
