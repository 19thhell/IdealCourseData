The class will offer a rare opportunity for hands-on experience supporting the production of a television news series on the intersection of international politics and global religion for a major national media outlet. In 2012-2013, Professor Jason Maloney's non-profit production unit, the Bureau for International Reporting, has contracted with PBS NewsHour to produce a six-part series called Fault Lines of Faith . This course will work towards identifying, researching and developing topics that are of global importance and appropriate for television news production and inclusion in this series. The class will also develop a companion blog for the series, which will feature some of the student work done for the class. The class will also be responsible for reporting and producing video interviews with experts on International Affairs.   \u00a0   To achieve our class goals, students will divide up the world into regional dossiers, study local dynamics and socio-political trends and develop individual stories from within their areas of focus. In class, students will present and brief the group on their region, and on developments that impact our major theme. This will involve aggregating news content from a series of media, international and regional, but will also involve primary source reporting using Skype, phone and email and through coverage of public meetings and events focused on their topic and hosted by relevant organizations in New York (Human Rights Watch, Asia Society, UN groups). We will also occasionally bring these experts to us... and hear from occasional guest speakers who are expert in the topics and regions we are covering.   \u00a0   Some of the efforts undertaken by students as part of this class will support the production of the stories that are covered as part of the NewsHour video series; other work will lead to content that will be disseminated through our Fault Lines of Faith Blog. This course will offer those students interested in TV or video news production an opportunity to be a part of a major news project that will result in significant airtime on a nationally-broadcast, well-respected outlet. For those students not primarily interested in video, this course still offers the opportunity for first-hand reporting on global and topical subject matter with the potential for clips running on a promoted website. The essential skills for story identification, development, research and writing, with an emphasis on storytelling, are universal to all dissemination platforms. Though our primary outlet for this project is television, the class will emphasize story and reporting.   \u00a0   \u00a0                                               Arthur L.

Investigative Reporting   \u00a0   WILLIAM SERRIN is Collegiate Professor and Associate Professor of Journalism. Before joining NYU, he was for eight years the labor and workplace correspondent for the New York Times. He has written for numerous magazines, including Newsweek, Atlantic Monthly, American Heritage, and the Nation, as well as the Columbia Journalism Review and the Village Voice. He is the author of Homestead: The Glory and Tragedy of an American Steel Town (1993); The Company; and The Union: The \u201cCivilized Relationship\u201d of the General Motors Corporation and the United Automobile Workers (1974). He is the editor of The Business of Journalism: 10 Leading Reporters and Editors on the Perils and Pitfalls of the Press (2000) and co-editor, with Judith Bruhn Serrin, of Muckraking: The Journalism That Changed America (2002). He was a recipient of the Alicia Patterson Award, for study of American farm and food policies. He also won the Sidney Hillman Foundation Award for outstanding labor coverage, and he was a member the Detroit Free Press team of reporters who won a Pulitzer Prize for coverage of the 1967 Detroit riots. In addition, he was a recipient of the George Polk Award for reporting on the Kent State killings in 1970. He is currently working on two new books: one a memoir of growing up in his hometown, an industrial town (Saginaw, Michigan), the other an examination of how, as industries emerge and grow in America, communities grow up and expand around them, then when the industries move or collapse, the communities that have served its citizens and country so well are often left to collapse and die.

The class will offer a rare opportunity for hands-on experience supporting the production of a television news series on the intersection of international politics and global religion for a major national media outlet. In 2012-2013, Professor Jason Maloney's non-profit production unit, the Bureau for International Reporting, has contracted with PBS NewsHour to produce a six-part series called Fault Lines of Faith . This course will work towards identifying, researching and developing topics that are of global importance and appropriate for television news production and inclusion in this series. The class will also develop a companion blog for the series, which will feature some of the student work done for the class. The class will also be responsible for reporting and producing video interviews with experts on International Affairs.   \u00a0   To achieve our class goals, students will divide up the world into regional dossiers, study local dynamics and socio-political trends and develop individual stories from within their areas of focus. In class, students will present and brief the group on their region, and on developments that impact our major theme. This will involve aggregating news content from a series of media, international and regional, but will also involve primary source reporting using Skype, phone and email and through coverage of public meetings and events focused on their topic and hosted by relevant organizations in New York (Human Rights Watch, Asia Society, UN groups). We will also occasionally bring these experts to us... and hear from occasional guest speakers who are expert in the topics and regions we are covering.   \u00a0   Some of the efforts undertaken by students as part of this class will support the production of the stories that are covered as part of the NewsHour video series; other work will lead to content that will be disseminated through our Fault Lines of Faith Blog. This course will offer those students interested in TV or video news production an opportunity to be a part of a major news project that will result in significant airtime on a nationally-broadcast, well-respected outlet. For those students not primarily interested in video, this course still offers the opportunity for first-hand reporting on global and topical subject matter with the potential for clips running on a promoted website. The essential skills for story identification, development, research and writing, with an emphasis on storytelling, are universal to all dissemination platforms. Though our primary outlet for this project is television, the class will emphasize story and reporting.   \u00a0   \u00a0                                               Arthur L.

Before joining NYU, he was for eight years the labor and workplace correspondent for the New York Times. He has written for numerous magazines, including Newsweek, Atlantic Monthly, American Heritage, and the Nation, as well as the Columbia Journalism Review and the Village Voice. He is the author of Homestead: The Glory and Tragedy of an American Steel Town (1993); The Company; and The Union: The \u201cCivilized Relationship\u201d of the General Motors Corporation and the United Automobile Workers (1974). He is the editor of The Business of Journalism: 10 Leading Reporters and Editors on the Perils and Pitfalls of the Press (2000) and co-editor, with Judith Bruhn Serrin, of Muckraking: The Journalism That Changed America (2002). He was a recipient of the Alicia Patterson Award, for study of American farm and food policies.

In addition, he was a recipient of the George Polk Award for reporting on the Kent State killings in 1970. He is currently working on two new books: one a memoir of growing up in his hometown, an industrial town (Saginaw, Michigan), the other an examination of how, as industries emerge and grow in America, communities grow up and expand around them, then when the industries move or collapse, the communities that have served its citizens and country so well are often left to collapse and die.
