The program develops the core competencies of content creation and editing, while also emphasizing the business, digital media, and marketing skills that are necessary to secure leadership roles in the industry.   With a goal of exposing you to &quot;real-world, real-workplace&quot; scenarios, the curriculum reflects the most current industry trends, including best practices in e-books, apps, and mobile platforms and video. Your studies begin with core courses that provide a comprehensive framework in the essential elements of the publishing process. Media specialization courses delve into the most critical business aspects of the industry and provide the expertise needed to master them.       The core course requirements are designed to provide you with an in-depth understanding of the most important elements of publishing. While completing the core courses, you also take courses from three media specializations: media content development, media marketing and distribution, and media profitability. Advanced seminars provide a thorough exploration of key industry topics. You complete the program with a capstone project that allows you to draw on the skills you\u2019ve acquired.   While rigorous coursework is key to your success in the program, you also will be provided with numerous opportunities to expand your publishing knowledge outside of the classroom. In addition to industry events and visits, the M.S. in Publishing: Digital and Print Media has developed a strong global program. As the publishing industry becomes not only more digital, but global, an understanding of international publishing practices is imperative. Students are invited to apply for trips to international book fairs and conferences, where they can volunteer their time in return for the opportunity to participate in global events and discussions. In recent years, students have served as marketing, publicity, and educational programming volunteers at the Frankfurt, London, Abu Dhabi, and Sharjah (UAE) international book fairs and at the FIPP International Magazine conference in Rome. These opportunities are underwritten by department grants for a select number of students.
