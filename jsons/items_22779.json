Nearly every day we wake up to something new and unanticipated. This concentration is designed to give students an advanced understanding of the factors shaping IR, and to place these factors in a futures context. What alternate future scenarios can we imagine? What are the forces for change in IR? How are these forces shaping the policies and capabilities of states and nonstate actors? What are the emerging issues that the world will have to face, and how might they be addressed? Courses within this concentration help students improve their ability to anticipate change, and equip them with the analytical tools essential for professional success in a transforming environment.

This concentration introduces students to the new transnational security agenda by combining the study of traditional issues such as war and disarmament with more contemporary issues, including terrorism, organized crime, and human security scourges. These complex and interconnected challenges are as often the domain of aid workers, police officers, and development specialists as they are of soldiers, spies, and diplomats. The concentration provides students with a combination of knowledge and practical skills preparing them to address security issues and risk assessment in the context of the private and NGO sector, as well as government service.

Nearly every day we wake up to something new and unanticipated. This concentration is designed to give students an advanced understanding of the factors shaping IR, and to place these factors in a futures context. What alternate future scenarios can we imagine? What are the forces for change in IR? How are these forces shaping the policies and capabilities of states and nonstate actors? What are the emerging issues that the world will have to face, and how might they be addressed?

This concentration introduces students to the new transnational security agenda by combining the study of traditional issues such as war and disarmament with more contemporary issues, including terrorism, organized crime, and human security scourges. These complex and interconnected challenges are as often the domain of aid workers, police officers, and development specialists as they are of soldiers, spies, and diplomats. The concentration provides students with a combination of knowledge and practical skills preparing them to address security issues and risk assessment in the context of the private and NGO sector, as well as government service.

Nearly every day we wake up to something new and unanticipated. This concentration is designed to give students an advanced understanding of the factors shaping IR, and to place these factors in a futures context. What alternate future scenarios can we imagine? What are the forces for change in IR? How are these forces shaping the policies and capabilities of states and nonstate actors? What are the emerging issues that the world will have to face, and how might they be addressed? Courses within this concentration help students improve their ability to anticipate change, and equip them with the analytical tools essential for professional success in a transforming environment.

This concentration introduces students to the new transnational security agenda by combining the study of traditional issues such as war and disarmament with more contemporary issues, including terrorism, organized crime, and human security scourges. These complex and interconnected challenges are as often the domain of aid workers, police officers, and development specialists as they are of soldiers, spies, and diplomats. The concentration provides students with a combination of knowledge and practical skills preparing them to address security issues and risk assessment in the context of the private and NGO sector, as well as government service.

Our master's in Digital Media Design for Learning and Advanced Certificate in Digital Media Design for Learning (formerly Educational Communication and Technology) prepare students to create, use, and evaluate media and technology for learning, from software and websites, to games, video and mobile phone applications. The master's in Games for Learning prepares students to create, use and evaluate serious games for learning and social change. The PhD in Educational Communication and Technology prepares world-class scholars to theorize and study the relationship between design, media, technology, and learning in a variety of paradigms: from social science, to design, to humanistic and cultural studies.
