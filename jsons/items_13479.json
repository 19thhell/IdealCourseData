Together, they give us a chance to consider some of the major literary and political movements in Latin America leading up to the present. The poetry of Mistral and Neruda reveals the successive influences of surrealism, communism, socialism, up to the eve of the Pinochet coup in Chile; through novels and autobiography, Asturias and Mench\u00fa explore very different aspects of the indigenous struggle in Guatamala; the novels of Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez in Colombia and Vargas Llosa in Peru embody different sides of magical realism; and Paz, in Mexico, in his poetry and essays, represents a country that has been a literary cornerstone of Latin America.
