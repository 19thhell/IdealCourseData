Within in a comparative perspective we will consider the diverse sources & modes of representation, including American travelers\u2019 exoticizing accounts of the \u201cHoly Land,\u201d early Zionist utopianist narratives, Palestinian documentarist photography & contemporary historicizing anthologies of past images. We will study the ways images of maps, landscapes, archeological sites, villages, cities, houses, & communities have come to constitute a kind of visual archive that both document the past & serves as \u201cevidence\u201d for specific historical narratives. In recent photographic anthologies, historical texts, tourist guidebooks, memoirs, novels, as well as in documentary & fictional films, such visual material prior to the partition of Palestine has played an important role in the battle over representation. In context of partition & displacement, we will argue, dominant & counter media also play in defining national identity & communal belonging. Rather than taking for granted such notions as \u201cseeing is believing\u201d & \u201cimages do not lie,\u201d we will address the complex relationship between image & word, & between text & context. The seminar will be organized around key concepts & questions having to do with the orientalist imaginary, national allegory, & diasporic narratives.

The purpose of this doctoral course, \u201cSpecial Topics in Critical Theory: Marx,\u201d is to read key works by Marx, supplemented by some contemporary texts in western Marxist political theory, with the ultimate goal of understanding the various political & philosophical debates with which these texts engage. The course emphasizes Marxism as as a political theory, but will also address Marxism as a scholarly methodology for critique applicable to disciplines beyond political theory. Some attention is given to the so-called cultural turn in twentieth-century Marxist thought, including Marx's influence on feminism, identity, representation, & visual culture. Themes include: the commodity, alienation & reification, surplus value, ideology, consumerism, subjectivity, postfordism, community, & communism.

More particularly, the course will consider the ways that the modern category \u201cinformation\u201d has emerged in relation to different media & different genres. What are the social, material, institutional, & semantic conditions that have worked to align communication with truth or authenticity? What routes can be discerned between a history of media & a history of objectivity? Significant attention will be paid to the elaboration of key terms & concepts as well as to different disciplinary & interdisciplinary resources that shape such an inquiry.

This class offers a counterpoint by examining the legacies of these experiences in visual & cultural studies. It suggests a different history of the present than is usually told, with particular regard to visuality in film, art & performance. Each participant will undertake a research project using materials in the Tamiment Library (& elsewhere if needed) & will present the results in a mini-conference at the end of the semester.

From e-mail to texting, from online gaming to online banking, from You Tube to Hulu, from DoS attacks to Second Life sit-ins, nearly every traditional aspect of our lives has found a new expression in its digital proxy. In order to understand the cultural, social, political & economic consequences of this development, we must look to the origins of today\u2019s cyberculture, in the futuristic visions (both dystonian & utopian) that shaped the development of today\u2019s networked technologies. We will trace the genealogy of these visions, as they developed in tandem with the growing digital communications infrastructure over the past three quarters of a century, & evolved into new forms that even the most forward-thinking of visionaries could not have predicted. Ultimately, one can argue the the Internet has both exceeded & fallen short of the hype that surrounded its birth & development, & by comparing the myth to the reality, we may better understand what aspects of the human condition are likely to persist regardless of technological development.

It will center on understanding how cultural hegemony is attained, but how established norms are subverted & challenged, particularly along political & cultural fronts. Examples will be drawn from the contemporary United States, France & other countries, including global social justice movements. A variety of media formats will be reviewed, from film & print media, to social media, to protest & occupation.

We will examine a range of forms of mediated production & consumption understood broadly in relation to political, economic, & cultural power, & situate these forms in relation to contemporary theorizing about global cultural convergence, divergence, & hybridity.      Course Page               40    4            MCC-GE 2381            Topics in Globalization: Global Consumer Culture           Consumer culture by its nature is intensely local & inevitably global. Its locality is tied up with the intimacy of food, clothing, & shelter, & the elasticity of the relationship between bodies & things, between needs & desires, yet its meanings & messages are globally circulated & produced. This course explores critical approaches to the globalization of consumer culture by examining how bodies & things shape each other through long histories (colonial, postcolonial, global) of production, distribution, & fashion. Students will study the social world of global consumers as an analytic entry point into the complex networks of cultural practice which mediate the perennial tension between habituation & novelty.

Focuses on case studies of the supranational regional players in some of the most important geo-linguistic world markets, where the tensions between global/transnational media flows & local interests are most evident, engaging with theoretical positions ranging from critiques of the homogenizing effects of globalization to those that affirm the changing power relations of counter-flows based on audience preferences.      Course Page               40    4            MCC-UE 1306            Transnational Media Flows           This class examines the intersecting dynamics of media genres & geo-linguistic cultural markets in the configuration of global & regional media flows. It looks in particular at the way media genres travel & how their circulation raises issues about the cultural power of certain media narratives in specific historical, political & social conditions of consumption. We will examine the battle for national, regional, & global media markets as a struggle for the \u2018legitimate\u2019 cultural & political view of the world expressed through information (news), scientific discourse (documentaries), & popular culture (films, tele novels, reality television, music) to understand the complex global flow of television programs & films.

In recent photographic anthologies, historical texts, tourist guidebooks, memoirs, novels, as well as in documentary & fictional films, such visual material prior to the partition of Palestine has played an important role in the battle over representation. In context of partition & displacement, we will argue, dominant & counter media also play in defining national identity & communal belonging.

Emphasis will be given on how space socially organizes human meaning & on the ?inscription? of space. How do people, through, their practices & their being in the world, form relationships with the locales they occupy (both the natural world & the build environment)? How do they attach meanings to spaces to create places? & how do the experiences of inhabiting viewing & hearing those places shape their meanings, communicative practices, cultural performance memories & habits? Course themes include; mapping & the imagination; vision & space, soundscape, architecture & landscape; new media & space/time compression; space & identity; spatial violence; spatialization of memory.

The purpose of this doctoral course, \u201cSpecial Topics in Critical Theory: Marx,\u201d is to read key works by Marx, supplemented by some contemporary texts in western Marxist political theory, with the ultimate goal of understanding the various political & philosophical debates with which these texts engage. The course emphasizes Marxism as as a political theory, but will also address Marxism as a scholarly methodology for critique applicable to disciplines beyond political theory. Some attention is given to the so-called cultural turn in twentieth-century Marxist thought, including Marx's influence on feminism, identity, representation, & visual culture. Themes include: the commodity, alienation & reification, surplus value, ideology, consumerism, subjectivity, postfordism, community, & communism.

The aim of this particular course is to chart the history of how consumerism has been theorized since the nineteenth century, & to make clear the connections between the literature on consumerism/consumption & the literature on visual consumption & the relationship of modernity & visuality. The course will thus trace an arc from the literature on nineteenth century practices of visual consumption & the rise of consumer society to contemporary debates about the relationship of consumerism to philanthropy, neoliberalism & global capitalism, & theories of cultural resistance in the context of new media practices.

More particularly, the course will consider the ways that the modern category \u201cinformation\u201d has emerged in relation to different media & different genres. What are the social, material, institutional, & semantic conditions that have worked to align communication with truth or authenticity? What routes can be discerned between a history of media & a history of objectivity? Significant attention will be paid to the elaboration of key terms & concepts as well as to different disciplinary & interdisciplinary resources that shape such an inquiry.

We begin with an overview of cybernetics, information theory, systems theory, distributed communications networks, & theories of postmodernity. Next, we examine the rise of immaterial labor in the service economies & the extension of codified labor practices into the realm of daily life. The seminar will also consider the ramifications of informatic capture & the formation of coded objects & bodies. Finally, we explore networked struggle &, through it, a political theory of the present moment. The course will favor both close readings of specific technologies as well as social & cultural claims about the information age.

This class offers a counterpoint by examining the legacies of these experiences in visual & cultural studies. It suggests a different history of the present than is usually told, with particular regard to visuality in film, art & performance. Each participant will undertake a research project using materials in the Tamiment Library (& elsewhere if needed) & will present the results in a mini-conference at the end of the semester.

From e-mail to texting, from online gaming to online banking, from You Tube to Hulu, from DoS attacks to Second Life sit-ins, nearly every traditional aspect of our lives has found a new expression in its digital proxy. In order to understand the cultural, social, political & economic consequences of this development, we must look to the origins of today\u2019s cyberculture, in the futuristic visions (both dystonian & utopian) that shaped the development of today\u2019s networked technologies. We will trace the genealogy of these visions, as they developed in tandem with the growing digital communications infrastructure over the past three quarters of a century, & evolved into new forms that even the most forward-thinking of visionaries could not have predicted. Ultimately, one can argue the the Internet has both exceeded & fallen short of the hype that surrounded its birth & development, & by comparing the myth to the reality, we may better understand what aspects of the human condition are likely to persist regardless of technological development.

It incorporates historical theoretical frameworks & situates contemporary readings in relation to genealogies of the field. Specific themes may include global consumer culture; international development; gender & globalization; visuality & globalization; & global cultures of finance.      Course Page               40    4            MCC-GE 2383            Topics in Globalization: Censorship, Social Movements and Alternative Media           The course will explore concepts of media censorship, cultural & political anxieties & instability, & social movement media, primarily in the United States & France. It will center on understanding how cultural hegemony is attained, but how established norms are subverted & challenged, particularly along political & cultural fronts. Examples will be drawn from the contemporary United States, France & other countries, including global social justice movements. A variety of media formats will be reviewed, from film & print media, to social media, to protest & occupation.      Course Page               40    4            MCC-GE 2382            Topics in Globalization: Communication and International Development           This course introduces students to theoretical foundations in historical & contemporary issues in communication & international development. Topics include state-building modernization, dependency & globalization, as they concern the \u201cThird World\u201d.      Course Page               40    4            MCC-GE 2384            Topics in Globalization: Cultural Globalization in France           Course provides students with a critical understanding of how international flows of information & entertainment products \u2013 from news & information to movies, television & lifestyle brands -- play a role in shaping & reshaping global economic, political, military, & cultural realities. We will examine a range of forms of mediated production & consumption understood broadly in relation to political, economic, & cultural power, & situate these forms in relation to contemporary theorizing about global cultural convergence, divergence, & hybridity.      Course Page               40    4            MCC-GE 2381            Topics in Globalization: Global Consumer Culture           Consumer culture by its nature is intensely local & inevitably global. Its locality is tied up with the intimacy of food, clothing, & shelter, & the elasticity of the relationship between bodies & things, between needs & desires, yet its meanings & messages are globally circulated & produced. This course explores critical approaches to the globalization of consumer culture by examining how bodies & things shape each other through long histories (colonial, postcolonial, global) of production, distribution, & fashion. Students will study the social world of global consumers as an analytic entry point into the complex networks of cultural practice which mediate the perennial tension between habituation & novelty.      Course Page               40    4            MCC-GE 2165            Transnational Communities and Media Cultures           The course examines the emergence of transnational communities in global cities & the role of media & media forms in (re)defining national belonging, identity, & global culture.      Course Page               40    4            MCC-UE 1307            Transnational Communities and Media Cultures           The course examines the emergence of transnational communities in global cities & the role of media & media forms in (re)defining national belonging, identity, & global culture.      Course Page               45    4            MCC-GE 2167            Transnational Media Flows           Analyzes the global flow of media products, in particular the circulation of television & film in transnational contexts, at the intersection of political economy (economic, business, & institutional frameworks) with cultural economy (the cultural meanings of these television & film products). Focuses on case studies of the supranational regional players in some of the most important geo-linguistic world markets, where the tensions between global/transnational media flows & local interests are most evident, engaging with theoretical positions ranging from critiques of the homogenizing effects of globalization to those that affirm the changing power relations of counter-flows based on audience preferences.      Course Page               40    4            MCC-UE 1306            Transnational Media Flows           This class examines the intersecting dynamics of media genres & geo-linguistic cultural markets in the configuration of global & regional media flows. It looks in particular at the way media genres travel & how their circulation raises issues about the cultural power of certain media narratives in specific historical, political & social conditions of consumption. We will examine the battle for national, regional, & global media markets as a struggle for the \u2018legitimate\u2019 cultural & political view of the world expressed through information (news), scientific discourse (documentaries), & popular culture (films, tele novels, reality television, music) to understand the complex global flow of television programs & films.      Course Page               45    4            MCC-GE 2295            Values Embodied in Information and Communications Technology           Studies social, political & ethical values embodied in computer & information systems, & new media. Students examine work in the philosophy & social study of technology to understand the rich & sometimes troubling relationship between values & technical design. Course will ask: Is technology neutral? Who should make key decisions? What is the role of scientists & engineers? The course examines specific cases, such as, the Internet, search engines, web-cookies, & data mining from philosophical, empirical, & technical perspectives.      Course Page               40    4            MCC-GE 2450            Video Game Theory           The purpose of this class is both to provide a general introduction to the field of video game studies, & to suggest a host of divergent directions such research may take in the near future. From the phenomenology of thumbs to the ethical thickets of codes & cheats, the class will address the key questions facing game researchers today; true to the field\u2019s intent interdisciplinary nature, methodologies considered will very from ethnography to semiotic analysis. Relevant examples will be provided throughout, & no preexisting knowledge of gaming is necessary.      Course Page               40    4            MCC-UE 1008            Video Games: Culture and Industry           Examines the emergence of video games as sites of contemporary cultural production & practice. Special attention is given to the symbolic & aesthetic dimensions of video games, including their various narratives forms and sub-genres, & concentrates on their interactive dimensions. The course provides insight into the emerging trends in the interface between humans & media technologies. The course also situates video games within the business practices of the entertainment industries.

The course focuses on the research methods & approaches specific to the field of visual culture & related fields of study, its scholarly literature, its theoretical genealogy, & the stakes in interdisciplinary research.      Course Page               40    4            MCC-UE 1411            Visual Culture of Science and Technology           This course examines the imagery of science & technology, the role of visuality in the construction of scientific knowledge, artistic renditions of science, & the emergence of visual technologies in modern society. It looks at how visuality has been key to the exercise of power through such practices as cataloguing & identification; the designation of abnormality, disease, & pathologies; medical diagnosis; scientific experimentation; & the marketing of science & medicine. We will examine the development of the visual technologies in the emerging scientific practices of psychiatry & criminology; explore the sciences of eugenics, genetics, pharmacology, brain & body scans, & digital medical images of many kinds; the marketing of pharmaceuticals, & the emerging politics of scientific activism.

This seminar will examine how modern warfare has generated new visual cultures, new media networks & the sensorium of modernity.      Course Page               40    4            MCC-UE 1351            War as Media           This course examines the proposition that contemporary war should be understood as media. Was has become mediatized & media has been militarized. This course treats war & political violence as communicative acts & technologies & focuses on how they shape our understanding & experience of landscape, vision, body, time & memory.

Powers' research looks at the information work of NGOs, the types of news coverage they support, and whether NGOs expand or reinforce established patterns of international news attention. His dissertation, \"Humanity's Publics: NGOs, Journalism and the International Public Sphere,\" examines reporting roles assumed by international NGOs as legacy media outlets cut their foreign news budgets. The International Communication Association presented Powers with the Gene Burd Outstanding Dissertation in Journalism Studies award at its annual conference.          Michael Zimmer (PhD 2007) spent a year as a postdoctoral fellow at Yale's Information Society Project before joining the faculty at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee. In addition to being an Assistant Professor in its School of Information Studies, he serves as Director of the University's Center for Information Policy Research. Zimmer credits Helen Nissenbaum's research for shaping his early interest in privacy. His dissertation explored the concept of the ideal search engine&mdash;the promise of navigating physical and intellectual space and the perils associated with this boundless flow of information. Zimmer continues his work in privacy (theory &amp; applied); one angle being the ethical implications of digital services made available by Library 2.0, such as large-scale digitization projects.         Scott Selberg (PhD 2013) joins the University of Michigan as a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Michigan Society of Fellows and as an Assistant Professor in the Department of Communication Studies . Selberg's research explores the visual culture of Alzheimer's disease. His dissertation traced the visual culture of Alzheimer&rsquo;s since its discovery at the beginning of the 20th century in order to show how certain techniques and technologies of representation help articulate popular knowledge and values of cognition, aging, and personhood. It described the history of how the disease has been represented in popular and public culture, such as Hollywood movies, scientific imagery, and pharmaceutical marketing, also investigating how the ethics and aesthetics of representation itself are essential to the imagination of the disease in America.         Alice Marwick (PhD 2010) joined the Department of Communication and Media Studies at Fordham in Fall 2012 as an Assistant Professor. Before this, Marwick completed a two-year postdoc at Microsoft Research, where she collaborated with danah boyd, among others, on ethnographic research involving youth populations and social media. Marwick's dissertation examined ideas of identity, status, and techniques for self-promotion that grew up around the birth of web 2.0, or social media technologies. Marwick is finishing a book on this subject for Yale Press, and says her next big project will consider conspicuous consumption in the digital realm. Part of this will include the study of visual-based online communities such as Tumblr and fashion blogs.         Carolyn L. Kane (PhD 2011) is the author of Chromatic Algorithms: Synthetic Color, Computer Art, and Aesthetics after Code (University of Chicago Press 2014), a book analyzing the role of electronic color in creative computing after 1960. Dr. Kane is also a postdoctoral fellow at Brown University (2014-2015) and assistant professor of visual communications at Ryerson University in Toronto. Her teaching and research fields include the history and philosophy of new media and digital aesthetics.         Jennifer E. Telesca (PhD 2014) is Assistant Professor of Environmental Justice in the Department of Social Science and Cultural Studies at the Pratt Institute. Her dissertation, Red Gold: On the Global Politics of Regulating Marine Life probes how diplomats from across the globe make decisions about marine life on the high seas. Based on three years of ethnographic research, her study examines how the prized bluefin tuna mediates the tension between marine conservation and the global commodities trade, and asks for whom is the Atlantic governed.         May Farah received her PhD from MCC in 2011 and recently accepted a position as Assistant Professor in the Department of Sociology, Anthropology and Media Studies at the American University of Beirut. Her research interests include mediated nationalism and representations, transnationalism and spatiality, and new media. Her dissertation, entitled Home versus Shelter: Place, Media, and Identity among Lebanon&rsquo;s Palestinian Refugees , focused on the relationship between diasporic populations and national identity in a globalized media age. Her work is situated at the intersections of Media Studies, Cultural Studies, and Middle Eastern Studies.         Devon Powers (PhD 2008) is Associate Professor in the Department of Communication at Drexel University, where she also serves as Director of Undergraduate Studies. Powers' research interests include popular music, 20th century history, and cultural intermediation &ndash; the people and processes that operate \"in between\" the production and consumption of culture. Her book Writing the Record: The Village Voice and the Birth of Rock Criticism was published in 2013. Powers completed a fellowship at the University of Leeds in 2014.         Currently a Postdoctoral Research Associate at the Center for Information Technology Policy at Princeton University , Solon Barocas (PhD 2014) wrote his dissertation on the novel challenges that data mining poses to fairness and privacy. Examples include the use of predictive analytics for counterterrorism, voter microtargeting in political campaigns, the impact of data mining techniques on model-building in economics and finance, and the integration of evidence-based medicine with clinical decision support systems. He has also collaborated on projects that have explored policies for facial recognition technology and alternatives to the current model of online behavioral advertising.         Jacob Gaboury (PhD 2014) joins the Department of Cultural Analysis and Theory at Stony Brook as an Assistant Professor. His research interests include new and digital media, media history, art and technology, queer theory, and media archaeology. His dissertation, \"Image Objects: An Archaeology of Computer Graphics, 1965-1979,\" investigated the early history of computer graphics and the role they play in the move toward new forms of simulation and object oriented design. Jacob is also currently a staff writer for the art and technology organization Rhizome at the New Museum for Contemporary Art in New York City, where he writes on contemporary art and technology.            Max Liboiron (PhD 2012) is Assistant Professor in Culture and Technology in the Department of Sociology at Memorial University of Newfoundland and Labrador . Her previous appointments include a postdoctoral fellowship with ISTC-Social and at the Social Science Environmental Health Research Institute at Northeastern University. Liboiron's thesis Redefining Pollution: Plastics in the Wild uses ocean plastics and endocrine disruptors that leach from plastics to investigate how scientific and technological techniques used to describe a environmental phenomenon influence the definition of pollution and dictate forms of pollution control.         Hatim El-Hibri (PhD 2012) has joined the American University of Beirut as Assistant Professor in the Department of Sociology, Anthropology and Media Studies . His research examines media technologies and urban space in the Middle East. His dissertation traced the history of the visualization of Beirut, from the politics of aerial photography and mapping during the French Mandate, to the visual economy of postwar construction, to the materiality of Hizballah's live satellite television. His current book project situates Beirut in regional and global topologies of power, and considers implications for how we understand the materiality of urban infrastructures, the mediation of ethno-religious belonging, and the place of Arab media in global visual culture.                      Next Feature &gt;&gt;                      Featured Video                  PROGRAM is a collaborative, interdisciplinary event series organized by graduate students within New York University\u2019s departments of Media, Culture, and Communication, English, and Comparative Literature. The series will present talks that explore the cultural, historical, aesthetic, and political impact of software and programming logic.  The goal of the series is to create an interactive space for the exploration of emerging practices across media and literature, both online and off. To this end we have organized a series of events, in which a pair of prominent scholars will explore one particular methodological approach to the study of software\u2019s impact on culture and literature, including media archaeology, software aesthetics, ubiquitous computing and urban space, and game design and narrative.  The series is open to the public, and is intended to facilitate a dialogue on the intersections of these fields.

Several guiding principles shape the intellectual projects of our Department:       A commitment to interdisciplinarity in the study of media and culture. Scholars and doctoral students engage with theoretical concepts and perspectives from a range of disciplines, including media studies, cultural studies, media history, visual culture, sound studies, anthropology, sociology, political science, and so on, in order to deploy interdisciplinary strategies of analysis.    A multi-methodological approach that draws on a diverse array of research methods in media and cultural analysis, including audience studies, semiotics, ethnography, qualitative and quantitative discourse analysis, in-depth interviewing, political/cultural economy, network analysis, and other interpretive and critical approaches.    A historical perspective that situates the study of media, technology, and culture within historical contexts, comparative historical research, media archaeology, genealogy, and media history.    A global, comparative approach in relation to cultural differences, media forms, historical frameworks, and theoretical paradigms.       The doctoral program offers five research areas, which operate as guiding frameworks for intellectual inquiry across the Department. These areas of research are overlapping and interrelated, and we encourage students to take advantage of course offerings in all five areas.    Global and Transcultural Studies While all of our doctoral research areas integrate the study of media, technology, and culture in the context of an increasingly globalized world, this research area specifically centers on inflections of the global mediascape as cross-national, transnational, or transcultural. Specific areas include: critical theories of globalization, transcultural flows, international development and postcolonial studies, comparative media systems, cross-national comparative research design, global social movements, international and intra-national media and culture treaties and policymaking, critical cultural geography, alternative modernities, and global ethnography. Faculty areas of regional expertise include: the Middle East, South Asia, East Asia, South and North America, Africa, and Eastern and Western Europe.    Technology and Society The study of technology as a political, cultural, economic, and aesthetic force is a crucial area of analysis for contemporary media scholarship. Our Department emphasizes the philosophy and politics of technology within cultural and social frameworks. Specific areas of focus include ethnographies of technological communities; philosophical, ethical, social and political dimensions of information and communications technology; information and communications policy; history of technological devices and forms of mediation; the history of science and technology; media archaeology and the study of \"dead media\"; the legal implications of technological regulation and change; copyright and intellectual property; information technologies, media, and privacy; the effects of digital and/or social media on society; visual technologies; and technologies of the built environment.    Visual Culture and Sound Studies Scholarship on visual culture and sound studies is an important emerging field across our disciplines. The study of visual culture recognizes the primary role of visual media in the enactment of power relations, the circulation of information and ideas, and the cultural practices that make meaning. Visual culture is about the study of images across a range of social arenas, from the news to art, advertising, science, fashion, television, film, digital images, architecture, and amateur media, acknowledging the experience of cross-mediation as a key factor in the contemporary visual realm. The study of visual culture is global, political, and engaged with interdisciplinary inquiries. Sound studies incorporates cultural, technological, philosophical, institutional, and interpretive approaches to practices of consuming and producing mediated sound. As an interdisciplinary field of study, it draws on media history, aesthetics, cultural analysis, formalist methods, ethnography, technological mediation, and an understanding of social and global activity determined by its auditory, sonic, and communicative materiality.    Media Institutions and Politics Mediated communication in all its forms is critically examined by exploring the relationships of power involved in its creation, distribution, and consumption. Specific areas of inquiry include: the political economy of media systems; legal and regulatory regimes of mediated communication; the professional practices and organizational routines of workers in the culture industries, including journalism, public relations, advertising, and the entertainment industry; critical discourse and content analyses of news; state-manufactured propaganda; media ecology; legislative debate and shaping of public policy; historical and contemporary social movements; processes of protest, public dissent and censorship; political campaign communication; media activism and advocacy; and other political uses of media and communication technologies.    Critical Theories of Media and Communication The study of media and communication requires engagement with a variety of theoretical traditions, including historical materialism, psychoanalysis, phenomenology, pragmatism, the Frankfurt School of critical theory, gender and queer theory, critical race theory, critical legal theory, field theory, actor-network theory, speculative realism, speech-act theory, and the various strands of structuralism and post-structuralism. The Department approaches critical theory from the perspective of critique, that is to say, from an ongoing self-examination of how knowledge and culture are created, acquired, maintained, and transmitted. In its core courses and elective seminars the graduate program seeks to train doctoral students to be subtle yet rigorous practitioners of critique in its many forms.
