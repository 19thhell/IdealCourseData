MTHED-UE 1024    Teaching of Elementary School Mathematics II    A methods course focusing on how to teach mathematics at the elementary school level. Use of a variety of manipulatives &amp; the development of concepts &amp; skills          MTHED-UE 1032    Mathematical Concepts in Integrated Early Childhood/Special Education Curriculum I    How mathematics is learned through the social experiences of young children. Analysis of activities in early childhood settings that help children develop insight into mathematics both as a study in itself &amp; as a tool for applied use. Focus on the mathematical concepts that infuse young children's experiences, the use of mathematical tools in young children's learning, methods for adapting math curriculum for learners with diverse abilities, &amp; the relationship of mathematical learning to all areas of the curriculum.          MTHED-UE 1033    Mathematical Concepts in Integration Early Childhood/Special Education Curriculum II    How mathematics is learned through the spatial/temporal worlds of young children. Analysis of activities in early childhood settings that help children develop emerging, unprejudiced mathematical awareness. Focus on the mathematical environment that respects all learners as a means to build upon children's existing mathematical perceptions &amp; expand and further those reading.          MTHED-UE 1041    The Teaching of Rational Numbers, Grades 5-12    This course provides a link between teachers' mathematical knowledge &amp; understanding of the major skills &amp; concepts of ratios, proportions, percents, decimals &amp; fractions to the effective &amp; appropriate teaching of these topics in grades 5-12.          MTHED-UE 1043    Methods of Teaching Middle School Mathematics    Developing the skills of classroom planning, management, &amp; implementation for effective instructional practices in grades 7-12. Topics include lesson plan development &amp; implementation, different models of teaching, assessing student understanding &amp; the use of instructional technology. Students also visit schools, observe teachers in the classroom &amp; use these observations as the basis for discussions of effective teaching practice. This course requires a field component where students are involved in tutoring &amp; microteaching.          MTHED-UE 1044    Educational Technology in Secondary School Mathematics    The course provides an in-depth examination of the affordances &amp; limitations of educational technology in enhancing the teaching &amp; learning of secondary school mathematics. It focuses on the use of handheld &amp; computer technology, &amp; introduces web-based mathematical software, dynamic software, graphical tools &amp; other software that can be successfully incorporated in the middle &amp; high school mathematics classroom. The course offers opportunities to engage in, design, &amp; critique technology-enhanced mathematical activities that aim at developing understanding of school mathematics.          MTHED-UE 1045    The Teaching of Algebra and Trigonometry, Grades 7-12    This course provides a link between teachers' mathematical knowledge &amp; understanding of the major skills &amp; concepts of algebra &amp; trigonometry to the effective &amp; appropriate teaching of these topics in grades 7 through 12.          MTHED-UE 1046    The Teaching of Geometry, Grades 7-12    The course provides a link between teachers' mathematical knowledge &amp; understanding of the majors skills &amp;concepts of geometry to the effective &amp; appropriate teaching of these topics in grades 7 through 12.          MTHED-UE 1049    Mathematical Proof and Proving    The course introduces elements of mathematical proof, focusing on three main themes: 1. The meaning of mathematical statements &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; universal/existential; 2. The roles of examples in determining the validity of mathematical statements; 3. The various forms &amp; methods of mathematical proofs, including Direct (deductive) proof; proof by exhaustion; indirect proof (by contradiction, or by contrapositive); mathematical induction; disproof by counterexample. This is a problem-based course. Lessons are structured around activities that engage students in doing proofs that are meaningful to them &amp; based on mathematical topics with which they are familiar.          MTHED-UE 1050    Teaching Mathematical Proof and Proving    This course complements the content Mathematical Proof &amp; Proving course &amp; provides pedagogical aspects of teaching &amp; learning mathematical proof &amp; proving. The focus is on: 1. Students' difficulties in interpreting the meaning of mathematical; 2. Students' understandings of the roles of examples in determining the validity of mathematical statements; 3. The teaching of various forms &amp; methods of mathematical proofs &amp; bridging between informal &amp; formal proof. Special attention is given to developing students' language precision in mathematics &amp; its implications for teaching, in the course of writing &amp; presenting proofs.          MTHED-UE 1911    Student Teaching in Mathematics Education: Middle and High Schools I    One semester supervised student teaching in a mathematics education classroom in middle &amp; high school a minimum of 180 hours within 20 days. Student teaching experiences will be used to support theoretical &amp; practical applications of the planning &amp; implementation of the curriculum.
