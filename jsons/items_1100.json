Dance classes will extend through ballet, Broadway styles to more popular and contemporary dance vernaculars, such as Hip-Hop and Latin dance, as they are used in the contemporary musical theatre. Individual singing, vocal music and performance will instill essential musicianship, enable healthy vocal production, breath control and properly supported sound, the ability to act on the lyric. Students will explore the wide range of musical styles reflected in today\u2019s musical theatre. Music theory, ear training and sight singing courses will teach students to learn and perform music quickly, as required when working on new, original musical productions. Voice and Speech courses will expand strengthen and develop the actor\u2019s ability to communicate the character, narrative, rhetoric, poetry and ideas of classical, contemporary and new plays through increased vocal range, strength and expressivity, healthy vocal production and clearly articulated speech. Acting Technique courses will explore fundamentals of acting through exercises, monologues, and a variety of approaches to scene study. Advanced Acting technique courses will emphasize the ensemble and include performance opportunities in heightened language and contemporary drama, with an emphasis on global cultural perspectives and emerging contemporary aesthetics. (Music Theatre students will do fewer text based acting roles to allow for musical performance experience.) Advanced Music Theater students will work in collaborations with the acclaimed Tisch Graduate Music Theatre Writing program on original new music theatre pieces. This will be conducive to students forging bonds with the composers and librettists who will be creating the music of their cultural moment. All courses will be taught with an emphasis on the music theatre as a collaborative holistic art form requiring proficiency in acting, music, and dance.

Dance classes will extend through ballet, Broadway styles to more popular and contemporary dance vernaculars, such as Hip-Hop and Latin dance, as they are used in the contemporary musical theatre. Individual singing, vocal music and performance will instill essential musicianship, enable healthy vocal production, breath control and properly supported sound, the ability to act on the lyric. Students will explore the wide range of musical styles reflected in today\u2019s musical theatre. Music theory, ear training and sight singing courses will teach students to learn and perform music quickly, as required when working on new, original musical productions. Voice and Speech courses will expand strengthen and develop the actor\u2019s ability to communicate the character, narrative, rhetoric, poetry and ideas of classical, contemporary and new plays through increased vocal range, strength and expressivity, healthy vocal production and clearly articulated speech. Acting Technique courses will explore fundamentals of acting through exercises, monologues, and a variety of approaches to scene study. Advanced Acting technique courses will emphasize the ensemble and include performance opportunities in heightened language and contemporary drama, with an emphasis on global cultural perspectives and emerging contemporary aesthetics. (Music Theatre students will do fewer text based acting roles to allow for musical performance experience.) Advanced Music Theater students will work in collaborations with the acclaimed Tisch Graduate Music Theatre Writing program on original new music theatre pieces. This will be conducive to students forging bonds with the composers and librettists who will be creating the music of their cultural moment. All courses will be taught with an emphasis on the music theatre as a collaborative holistic art form requiring proficiency in acting, music, and dance.
