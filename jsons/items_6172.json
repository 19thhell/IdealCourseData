             In a globalized and interconnected world, how do artists navigate the increasingly fluid concepts of country, home, and identity? This convening brings together contemporary artists from the MENASA region and beyond to reflect on their methodologies and intersecting themes, including: The Artist and Society; Artist as Researcher; Navigating Private and Public Spaces; Notes from the Field: Our Interconnected World; and Memory: Using and Creating Personal and Official Archives. Performances, works-in-progress, and lively discussion comprise this three-day convening. The December 8 sessions are hosted at the Sharjah Art Foundation .

We discuss how the city radically transformed over four decades, what modern influences resonate within its landscape, and which events and people helped shape our built environment.
