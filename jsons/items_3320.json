Basic concepts of return and risk are explored in detail with a view to understanding how financial markets work and how different kinds of financial instruments are valued. These instruments, including equities, fixed income securities, options, and other derivative securities become vehicles for exploring various financial markets and the utilization of these markets by managers in different kinds of financial institutions to enhance return and manage risk. The course includes a segment on the use and application of computer-based quantitative technology for financial modeling purposes.                                                                    Introduction to Marketing - MKTG-UB 9001 - 4 points                               Evaluates, from the management point of view, marketing as a system for the satisfaction of human wants and as a catalyst of business activity. Deals with the subject at all levels from producer to consumer and emphasizes the planning required for the efficient use of marketing tools in the development and expansion of markets. Concentrates on the principles, functions, and tools of marketing, including quantitative methods. Utilizes cases and projects to develop a problem-solving ability in dealing with specific areas.                                                                    Culture of Spain: An Anthropological Perspective - SPAN-UA 9631 or ANTH-UA 9250 - 4 points                               The recent changes in both Spain and Portugal are only the latest in a series of important transformations which these two countries have undergone over the past fifty years or so. In that time, they have both gone from being predominantly rural societies where the majority of the population live and work on the land to become industrial societies not unlike those of northern Europe and North America. Yet the underlying cultural heterogeneity of the peoples of the Iberian Peninsula has meant that different regions have often had very distinct reactions to the various pressures towards political, economic and social change.   As well as introducing you to some of the basic concepts used in the study of social change, this course concentrates on examining the ethnographic diversity of the various regions of Spain and Portugal. Knowledge of this underlying diversity is essential in comprehending the importance that regionalism has played in Iberian history and its relevance to the understanding of the acceptance or rejection of such change by the different regions in contemporary Spain and Portugal. The course will specifically examine the rapidly changing role of women in both countries.

Concentrates on epistemological constructions of Spain\u2014the idea of Spain\u2014that emerge from competing external and internal perspectives. Students examine how this national culture is constructed, first analyzing Spain from North African perspectives through Sephardic nostalgic poetry and the Hispano-Arabic literary traditions. The American perspective pits notions of Spanish imperial power and grandeur against the Black Legend, a term that Protestant circles in Europe and the United States promoted to attack the legitimacy of Spain\u2019s New World empire. A final focus on European views analyzes the depiction of Spain as the embodiment of German and French Romantic ideals beginning at the end of the 17th century and the reemergence of the same notion during the Spanish Civil War (1933\u201336). Throughout, students examine principal textual and visual images that contribute to the historical and contemporary construction of a national culture that emerged at geographic and cultural crossroads.

Beginning with an analysis of the effects of anthropogenic industrial carbon dioxide gas emissions on the Earth system as derived from the scientific evidence this course attempts to understand the reaction of the global, European and Spanish political governance systems to these transformations. In order to understand something as apparently specific as the impact of climate change in the Iberian peninsula and the Spanish state\u2019s response to it we must first understand, therefore, how the United Nations and the European Union are responding to climate change since the Spanish political system\u2019s control and mitigation policies are largely determined by these two larger governance systems\u2019 responses.

International human rights legislation imposes  the same obligations on all signatory countries. Despite this, however, interpretation and  application of these rights vary considerably between countries. Students will explore a set  of controversial issues in order to understand the complex differences between the United  States and European countries\u2019 interpretation of human rights obligations, and will also look  at how these differences are portrayed in society by comparing international and national  media coverage of the issues.

From the 8th century until the 17th century, Islam played a crucial role in the history of the Iberian Peninsula. Today this period is often portrayed as one of inter-religious harmony, while al-Andalus is simultaneously mourned in contemporary Islamist discourse as a lost paradise. While we look at the history of Al-Andalus and assess the importance of the contributions of Al-Andalus to Europe and America, we evaluate the significance of its legacy in modern Spain. Furthermore, we will study the protagonist role that Spain has played in relations between Europe and the Mediterranean Islamic countries during the Modern Age. Students will gain further understanding and contextualization of current Arab-Muslim geopolitics. As a case study, we will address the Spanish Protectorate in Morocco, as well as its ensuing process of decolonization and the consequences that shape the current international relations between the two neighboring countries, Spain and Morocco.

Culture of Spain: An Anthropological Perspective - SPAN-UA 9631 or ANTH-UA 9250 - 4 points                               The recent changes in both Spain and Portugal are only the latest in a series of important transformations which these two countries have undergone over the past fifty years or so. In that time, they have both gone from being predominantly rural societies where the majority of the population live and work on the land to become industrial societies not unlike those of northern Europe and North America. Yet the underlying cultural heterogeneity of the peoples of the Iberian Peninsula has meant that different regions have often had very distinct reactions to the various pressures towards political, economic and social change.   As well as introducing you to some of the basic concepts used in the study of social change, this course concentrates on examining the ethnographic diversity of the various regions of Spain and Portugal. Knowledge of this underlying diversity is essential in comprehending the importance that regionalism has played in Iberian history and its relevance to the understanding of the acceptance or rejection of such change by the different regions in contemporary Spain and Portugal. The course will specifically examine the rapidly changing role of women in both countries.

Students examine how this national culture is constructed, first analyzing Spain from North African perspectives through Sephardic nostalgic poetry and the Hispano-Arabic literary traditions. The American perspective pits notions of Spanish imperial power and grandeur against the Black Legend, a term that Protestant circles in Europe and the United States promoted to attack the legitimacy of Spain\u2019s New World empire. A final focus on European views analyzes the depiction of Spain as the embodiment of German and French Romantic ideals beginning at the end of the 17th century and the reemergence of the same notion during the Spanish Civil War (1933\u201336). Throughout, students examine principal textual and visual images that contribute to the historical and contemporary construction of a national culture that emerged at geographic and cultural crossroads.

Beginning with an analysis of the effects of anthropogenic industrial carbon dioxide gas emissions on the Earth system as derived from the scientific evidence this course attempts to understand the reaction of the global, European and Spanish political governance systems to these transformations. In order to understand something as apparently specific as the impact of climate change in the Iberian peninsula and the Spanish state\u2019s response to it we must first understand, therefore, how the United Nations and the European Union are responding to climate change since the Spanish political system\u2019s control and mitigation policies are largely determined by these two larger governance systems\u2019 responses.

Established in 1958 as NYU's first global academic center, NYU Madrid offers students with little or no Spanish language skills a Fast-Track Spanish for Beginners program that includes a set of four courses designed to bring them to proficiency in one semester. During the spring semester, students with advanced Spanish language skills may enroll in up to two courses at the Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de Madrid (UAM). Homestays with Spanish host families encourage students to build a deeper connection with Spanish culture and provides an opportunity to practice speaking in a more casual environment. An Intercambio Program brings NYU Madrid students together with local college students to practice their Spanish and make friends.       Madrid is the political and cultural center of Spain and one of the liveliest and friendliest capital cities in Europe, replete with magnificent architecture, world-class museums, and delicious cuisine. Students at NYU Madrid enjoy a semester of rich cultural experiences that complement their studies, whether they\u2019re on a class trip to the Museo del Prado to learn firsthand about Goya's masterpieces or at an out-of-the way tapas bar on Cava Baja.

From the 8th century until the 17th century, Islam played a crucial role in the history of the Iberian Peninsula. Today this period is often portrayed as one of inter-religious harmony, while al-Andalus is simultaneously mourned in contemporary Islamist discourse as a lost paradise. While we look at the history of Al-Andalus and assess the importance of the contributions of Al-Andalus to Europe and America, we evaluate the significance of its legacy in modern Spain. Furthermore, we will study the protagonist role that Spain has played in relations between Europe and the Mediterranean Islamic countries during the Modern Age. Students will gain further understanding and contextualization of current Arab-Muslim geopolitics. As a case study, we will address the Spanish Protectorate in Morocco, as well as its ensuing process of decolonization and the consequences that shape the current international relations between the two neighboring countries, Spain and Morocco.

Culture of Spain: An Anthropological Perspective - SPAN-UA 9631 or ANTH-UA 9250 - 4 points                               The recent changes in both Spain and Portugal are only the latest in a series of important transformations which these two countries have undergone over the past fifty years or so. In that time, they have both gone from being predominantly rural societies where the majority of the population live and work on the land to become industrial societies not unlike those of northern Europe and North America. Yet the underlying cultural heterogeneity of the peoples of the Iberian Peninsula has meant that different regions have often had very distinct reactions to the various pressures towards political, economic and social change.   As well as introducing you to some of the basic concepts used in the study of social change, this course concentrates on examining the ethnographic diversity of the various regions of Spain and Portugal. Knowledge of this underlying diversity is essential in comprehending the importance that regionalism has played in Iberian history and its relevance to the understanding of the acceptance or rejection of such change by the different regions in contemporary Spain and Portugal. The course will specifically examine the rapidly changing role of women in both countries.

Students examine how this national culture is constructed, first analyzing Spain from North African perspectives through Sephardic nostalgic poetry and the Hispano-Arabic literary traditions. The American perspective pits notions of Spanish imperial power and grandeur against the Black Legend, a term that Protestant circles in Europe and the United States promoted to attack the legitimacy of Spain\u2019s New World empire. A final focus on European views analyzes the depiction of Spain as the embodiment of German and French Romantic ideals beginning at the end of the 17th century and the reemergence of the same notion during the Spanish Civil War (1933\u201336). Throughout, students examine principal textual and visual images that contribute to the historical and contemporary construction of a national culture that emerged at geographic and cultural crossroads.

Beginning with an analysis of the effects of anthropogenic industrial carbon dioxide gas emissions on the Earth system as derived from the scientific evidence this course attempts to understand the reaction of the global, European and Spanish political governance systems to these transformations. In order to understand something as apparently specific as the impact of climate change in the Iberian peninsula and the Spanish state\u2019s response to it we must first understand, therefore, how the United Nations and the European Union are responding to climate change since the Spanish political system\u2019s control and mitigation policies are largely determined by these two larger governance systems\u2019 responses.

Established in 1958 as NYU's first global academic center, NYU Madrid offers students with little or no Spanish language skills a Fast-Track Spanish for Beginners program that includes a set of four courses designed to bring them to proficiency in one semester. During the spring semester, students with advanced Spanish language skills may enroll in up to two courses at the Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de Madrid (UAM). Homestays with Spanish host families encourage students to build a deeper connection with Spanish culture and provides an opportunity to practice speaking in a more casual environment. An Intercambio Program brings NYU Madrid students together with local college students to practice their Spanish and make friends.       Madrid is the political and cultural center of Spain and one of the liveliest and friendliest capital cities in Europe, replete with magnificent architecture, world-class museums, and delicious cuisine. Students at NYU Madrid enjoy a semester of rich cultural experiences that complement their studies, whether they\u2019re on a class trip to the Museo del Prado to learn firsthand about Goya's masterpieces or at an out-of-the way tapas bar on Cava Baja.

Center for Latin American and Caribbean Studies     The Anthropology Department is actively connected with the Center for Latin American and Caribbean Studies (CLACS) of the Graduate School of Arts and Science. CLACS brings together University faculty specializing in Latin American and Caribbean research. Anthropology faculty members offer courses and guidance to students in this program, and anthropology students may construct special programs of study and research that utilize the resources offered by CLACS. The Center participates in a consortium with the Institute for Latin American Studies at Columbia University that sponsors joint courses and conferences that New York University students may attend. Additional resources are available through faculty and graduate student collaboration with the programs of the King Juan Carlos I of Spain Center for the study of Spain and the Spanish-speaking world.         Center for Media Culture and History     This interdisciplinary Center, founded in 1993 by Director Faye Ginsburg with support from The Rockefeller and Ford Foundations, sponsors a rich slate of public programming each semester with screenings, lectures and conferences, that integrate concerns of faculty and students from across the university and with cultural institutions in the city such as the Museum of Modern Art, the National Museum of the American Indian, and the American Museum of Natural History. The Center addresses issues of representation, social change, materiality and identity construction embedded in the development of film, television, video, and new media worldwide.         Center for Religion and Media     Faculty members Faye Ginsburg (Culture and Media) and Angela Zito (Religious Studies/ Anthropology) co-direct the interdisciplinary Center for Religion and Media, funded by The Pew Charitable Trusts as part of their Centers of Excellence Program for 2003-2008. The Center, a joint project of the Religious Studies Program and the Center for Media, Culture, and History, develops and broadens interdisciplinary and cross-cultural scholarship, pedagogy, and public knowledge of religion and media as a global phenomena with deep local roots.         Center for the Study of Gender and Sexuality     The Center for the Study of Gender and Sexuality (CSGS) facilitates a broad interdisciplinary investigation of gender and sexuality as keys to understanding human experience. CSGS's main activity is to organize events, including seminars, panel discussions, film screenings, and conferences. These events provide a vital meeting-place where scholars, students, artists, and activists can discuss issues involving gender and sexuality, and their intersections with other social phenomena such as race, religion, nation, class, ability/disability and ethnicity.

Its mission is to enhance and facilitate research on all fields of biological anthropology and archaeology that are broadly related to the study of human origins and evolution from a biological and cultural perspective. The aim is to foster and support multidisciplinary investigations, with an emphasis on the development of collaborative projects, international fieldwork, and state-of-the-art laboratory research. Faculty members associated with the Center currently work on aspects of primate and human paleontology, skeletal biology and comparative anatomy, molecular primatology, primate socioecology and conservation, behavioral endocrinology, Paleolithic archaeology, zooarchaeology, and the origins of symbolism, complex societies, and cities and states. In addition to research, the Center also aims to promote a greater understanding and appreciation of the study of human origins among the academic community and the public at large through conferences, workshops, educational programs, and outreach activities.         Program in Culture and Media     The Departments of Anthropology and Cinema Studies offer a specialized joint course of study leading to a New York State Certificate in Culture and Media for NYU graduate students who are pursuing their M.A. or Ph.D. degrees in Anthropology or Cinema Studies. The program\u2019s philosophy takes a broad approach to the relationships between culture and media in a number of domains including: ethnographic film\u2019s significance for the fields of anthropology and cinema/media studies; problems in representation of cultures through media; the development of media in indigenous, diaspora, and non-Western communities; the emerging social and cultural formations shaped by new media practices; and the political economy shaping the production, distribution and consumption of media worldwide.

Institute for Law and Society     As an interschool program, supported by New York University 's School of Law and the Faculty of Arts and Science, the law and society program serves as an intellectual center for faculty, graduate students, and law students interested in studying law and legal institutions from an interdisciplinary social science perspective. Law and Society encourages a wide range of social science perspectives, theoretical frameworks, and empirical methods. In addition to formal course work, the program convenes the NYU law and society colloquium and the law and society workshop, sponsors sociolegal conferences, and hosts visiting scholars         Kevorkian Center for Near Eastern Studies     The Hagop Kevorkian Center for Near Eastern Studies was created in 1966 to foster the interdisciplinary study of the modern and contemporary Middle East and to enhance public understanding of the region. The Kevorkian Center's activities focus on the histories, politics, economies, religions, cultures and languages of the area stretching from North Africa to Central Asia, and on the historical processes that have shaped the present. The Kevorkian Center organizes research workshops, luncheon seminars and other forums to encourage new perspectives on the Middle East and foster exploration of interactions and parallels with other world regions.            M.A. in Human Skeletal Biology     This two year program prepares graduates to apply the principles and techniques of skeletal biology and genetic research in Physical Anthropology to a variety of contexts, including those in the Forensic Sciences (i.e., Medical Examiner\u2019s office, Coroner\u2019s office, Armed Forces, Criminal Justice, Law Enforcement, Mass Disasters). The program can also be useful training for students who are preparing for admission to doctoral programs in skeletal biology and human evolution. Program includes 36 points of coursework, a laboratory or field internship, and a research-based M.A. thesis.         Museum Studies     Museum Studies. For more than thirty years, the Program in Museum Studies at New York University has offered an innovative course of study in the contemporary theory and practice of museum work. Emphasizing both the interdisciplinary study of museums and courses of practical training, the program has prepared more than three hundred graduates for positions of increasing responsibility in museums throughout the world. Our graduates are working in museums of fine art, history, anthropology, technology, and natural history; in arboretums, national parks, and science centers; with private and corporate collections; and in government agencies, historical societies, and art galleries. And their careers cover the full range of museum activity, working as directors, curators, educators, registrars, collection managers, and development, media and public relations specialists.         The NYCEP Program     New York University participates in the New York Consortium for Evolutionary Primatology (NYCEP), a graduate training program in evolutionary primatology that includes New York University, City University of New York, Columbia University, Wildlife Conservation Society at the Bronx Zoo, and the American Museum of Natural History. The consortium provides an integrated training program that allows student to take courses, seminars, and internships at any of these institutions offered by more than thirty biological anthropologists, primatologists, and vertebrae paleontologists participating in the program.         Psyences Project     The Psyences Project is a regional seminar, launched by Elizabeth Lunbeck (History, Vanderbilt), Emily Martin (Anthropology, NYU), and Louis Sass (Clinical Psychology, Rutgers), that provides a venue for scholars--from graduate students to professors to practitioners -- concerned with the emergence and social influence of such disciplines as psychiatry, psychology, psychoanalysis, and psychopharmacology. The Psyences Project fosters communication and scholarly exchange among researchers in this increasingly culturally potent area by holding workshops several times each year. The project receives support from the NYU Department of Anthropology and the Institute for the History of Production of Knowledge. Speakers from the last few years have included Fernando Vidal, Andreas Mayer, Alison Winter, Jonathan Metzl, Janis Jenkins, and Don Kulick. In the fall of 2012, the project is co-sponsoring a visit from Alison Bechdel, author of Are You My Mother? and Fun Home.
