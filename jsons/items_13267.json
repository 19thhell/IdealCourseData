Research is central in our graduate training. Students are exposed to a broad range of knowledge in cognition and perception and they are trained to think creatively and to develop independent research careers.                   Our program spans cognition and perception, examining mental processes such as perception, attention, memory, categorization, language, emotion, development, motor control, and cognitive neuroscience. How do we identify the letter &quot;a&quot;? How do we perceive depth and shape? What representational resources are innate? How do human cultures, and individual children, go beyond innate representational capacities? How do toddlers make decisions about their world? How are explicit and implicit memories coded in the brain? How do we inhibit inappropriate responses? How are sentences understood? How are new concepts acquired? How does attention affect perception?                   Students and faculty work closely with researchers in other departments ( Neural Science , Computer Science , Linguistics , and Philosophy ). Every week there are journal club discussions and talks by leading researchers that take place within the Psychology Department, in other NYU departments, and at other nearby schools in New York City (see Events ). Ready access to researchers at several great universities and to incredible cultural resources makes New York City a great place to study perception and cognition.                  Our graduate students begin research immediately. Students benefit from interaction with their faculty advisers and the lively exchange of research ideas among students, postdocs, and faculty at weekly Cognition and Perception colloquia and brown bag talks , research seminars, journal clubs ( cognitive neuroscience , development , ... see Events ) and our annual miniconvention. As a result of this focus on research, our students publish regularly in high-impact journals and go on to become researchers at the best research universities and industrial laboratories.                               Curriculum             What follows is a brief version of our curriculum. Full details may be found in our Graduate Student Guide . Our curriculum is designed to help students master the skills required to accomplish high quality research. Within the first two years, most students have completed the bulk of our primary course requirements. We require all students to take at least four courses in core, content-based areas of the discipline such as Memory, Perception, Attention, Cognitive Development, Psycholinguistics and Cognitive Neuroscience. In addition, we require all students to take at least two courses in quantitative methods, which can be the two-semester departmental statistics sequence, or other courses in probability theory, simulation, advanced statistical methods, etc. In addition, there are advanced seminars in areas related to the research areas of the faculty and students. The course catalog and schedule are online.                  A key aspect of our program is its strength in cognitive neuroscience, which students can select as their &quot;concentration&quot;. One aspect of this is the new, on-site, research-dedicated Center for Brain Imaging that includes a 3T MRI scanner and EEG facility, and will soon include a TMS facility as well. The center is designed to allow students the training and opportunity to become experts in cognitive neuroscience. Through a combination of course work and hands-on experience, students who select this concentration will receive training in the techniques of cognitive neuroscience and will apply these techniques to their chosen research questions.                   Students join a laboratory and begin to design and carry out a research project in their first semester. They are required to write a paper based on research they have performed as well as give a talk in our annual miniconvention at the end of their first and second years. The 2nd-year paper and completion of our basic course requirements generally result in the awarding of an MA degree. We encourage students to collaborate with more than one faculty member, including doing a full laboratory rotation or two. Students may work with primary Cognition &amp; Perception faculty or with affiliates from other programs (e.g., Social Psychology) or departments (e.g., the Center for Neural Science). (See faculty listed alphabetically with a sentence about their research interests, or by area .) In their third and fourth years, PhD students are focused primarily on research.                  We consider the best experience that students can have to become productive researchers is to carry out, write up, and present their research projects. The 1st- and 2nd-year research requirements emphasize this goal. The content and methods courses are designed to provide students with the context and tools they need to produce world-class research on their own. After graduating, most of our students have gone on to research careers. (See Recent PhDs .)                                                 Support             All students accepted into our graduate program are fully funded through the Henry M. MacCracken Program. MacCracken funding is provided through a combination of teaching assistantship, research assistantship, and fellowship, in proportions to be determined. The award package typically includes a full tuition scholarship, comprehensive health insurance and a stipend. Funding is typically guaranteed for five years, although students with substantial graduate credits or a Master's degree may only be guaranteed four years of support. For current information on the Psychology Department's aid package, please see our doctoral financial aid page .                         There is a very limited supply of subsidized housing available for graduate students which is generally used for a subset of each entering class to provide them the opportunity to get settled in New York City during their first year of residence.                               Admissions             To apply for admission to the Graduate Program in Cognition &amp; Perception, you'll need the application form , which is available from the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences. Apply for admission to the Department of Psychology. In the forms there is a place where you specify the particular program in which you are interested (e.g. Cognition &amp; Perception), as well as whether you are also interested in the Developmental Concentration.                 In the application, it is requested that you supply a personal statement. You are free to include any information in that statement that you feel will help us in our admissions decision. However, as we are a research-based program, it is especially useful if you include a review of any research experience you have had (explain what was interesting about it) as well as your current research interests.                  Together with your application, the Graduate School of Arts and Science will require you to upload official transcripts of grades from other schools you have attended, both undergraduate and graduate. In addition, it is required that you take the Graduate Record Exam ( GRE ). Some of our students also submit scores from the Advanced Psychology GRE test. We place very little weight on that score, and do not encourage you to take it.      Please do NOT mail any documents (transcripts etc) to the department. Everything needs to be uploaded and submitted through the online application.             International applicants must take the TOEFL exams if English is not their first language unless they earned a Bachelor's or Master's degree at an English speaking university. Additional information of concern to international applicants is available online from the Office of Global Services .                 We recommend that you submit your application so as to arrive by December 12th.

Research                                  The Prefrontal Cortex                                 The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is thought to be the most important brain area for higher-order cognition and sits at the apex of the sensory and motor hierarchies. The functions of the PFC give rise to higher-level cognitive abilities that make us uniquely human. They are also responsible for dysfunctions of the PFC that result in severe psychopathology, such as schizophrenia, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), substance abuse disorders, Alzheimer\u2019s and Parkinson\u2019s disease, and AIDS-related dementia. But despite its importance, we know very little about the mechanisms by which the PFC supports adaptive and maladaptive behaviors.                                  The long-term goal of the lab\u2019s research is to understand the mechanisms by which the PFC supports higher-level cognition. Most theories of PFC function posit that the PFC plays an important role in cognitive control. Cognitive control or \u201cexecutive control\u201d processes help guide thought and behavior based on internally generated goals. Cognitive control is necessary when one must use internal representations to guide behavior because the current external environment does not provide the necessary information to help one make a decision, a process known as working memory. Cognitive control is also needed when one must override responses that may otherwise be automatically elicited by stimuli in the external environment. Our lab studies both of these types of cognitive control.                                             Working Memory                                 Arguably, all forms of higher-level cognition depend on our ability to create and maintain for short periods of time internal representations of information, a process known as working memory. Working memory allows animals to use information that is not currently available in the environment but is crucial for adaptive behavior. Without the ability to temporarily store information on-line, one\u2019s behavior is stereotyped and largely depends upon learned stimulus\u2013response associations. If, however, an internal representation of critical information can be created and maintained for a short period of time, flexible behavior emerges because one\u2019s decisions can now utilize representations of temporally discontinuous events. Persistent neural activity during the delay period between a sensory cue (e.g., the position of a briefly flashed spot of light) and a later motor response (e.g., a shift of gaze to the remembered location) is the most compelling evidence that this activity reflects some form of a memory representation (Curtis and D'Esposito 2003a). In fact, essentially all models of working memory require the persistence of a representation (e.g.,(Wang 2001). Using fMRI, we have successfully identified several frontal and parietal areas that show persistent neural activity during memory delays (Curtis 2006; Curtis and D'Esposito 2006; Curtis et al. 2004; Schluppeck et al. 2006; Srimal and Curtis 2008) (Figure 1).

Nature of persistent neural activity                                  These studies have isolated persistent activity in dorsal prefrontal regions, like the frontal eye field (FEF), and the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) during the maintenance of positional information. This observation, however, does not answer what is actually being remembered or coded for by this activity (Curtis and D'Esposito 2003a). In a series of studies our aim has been to gain insight into the type of information coded by this activity. By manipulating the sensory and motor demands of the working memory task, we have been able to modulate the FEF and PPC delay-period activity. We\u2019ve found evidence that retrospective sensory coding of space may be more prominent in the PPC, while prospective motor coding of space may be more prominent in the FEF (Curtis 2006; Curtis and D'Esposito 2006; Curtis et al. 2004). During a memory delay, one can look back to a past event, a retrospective code, or can look forward to a future event, a prospective code, in order to link events that are separated in time but are contingent upon one another. Both coding schemes are likely mechanisms of working memory and provide important clues to different contributions of the frontal and parietal cortices.                                 Recently, we directly tested the hypothesis that the maintenance of a prospective oculomotor plan is an important mechanism by which we maintain space (Curtis and Connolly 2008). We used an oculomotor deferred saccade task, in which the sensory cue was continuously present throughout the delay interval, rather than merely being transiently flashed prior to the delay interval. This paradigm eliminated the memory component (i.e., the need to remember the location of the saccade target) and placed the emphasis squarely upon oculomotor planning. We found that BOLD signals persisted in the frontal and parietal cortex throughout the delay interval even when working memory was not required. Therefore, the delay period activity that is often interpreted as the signature of working memory maintenance may in fact rely on mechanisms related to prospective motor planning to bridge the temporal gap between a stimulus and its contingent response.                                             We have also shown that these neural signals during memory delay cannot solely reflect oculomotor plans. For example, we find persistent neural activity in the frontal cortex during trials in which the forthcoming memory-guided response is not known until after the delay and therefore cannot be planned (Curtis and D'Esposito 2006; Curtis et al. 2004; Srimal and Curtis 2008). In an even more dramatic demonstration, we have recently found that activity in the frontal cortex persists when subjects are maintaining an auditory-cued location that is behind the subject\u2019s head, a location that cannot be acquired with an eye-movement (Tark and Curtis 2007; 2008). These exciting new data not only call into question whether these signals are oculomotor in nature but they open up the possibility that they could reflect spatial representations that are not in eye-centered coordinates. Several members of the lab are currently conducting several follow-up studies of subjects localizing and maintaining auditorily-cued space.                      Common mechanism for spatial working memory, attention, and oculomotor intention                                  Spatial working memory maintenance may be mediated through sustained covert attention directed to the cued location (Awh et al. 2000; Postle et al. 2004). Similarly, spatial attention appears to be strongly coupled with the planning of an eye movement to the attended location (Awh et al. 2006). As discussed above, we have found evidence that persistent activity in the frontal lobe during a working memory delay period could represent 1) activation of a working memory representation of the stimulus\u2019s position, 2) covert attention directed to the cued location, or 3) a planned saccade to the cued location. We conducted a series of studies that directly tested the long-standing question of whether the neural mechanisms that support each of these processes are shared. We scanned the same subjects in separate fMRI sessions while they 1) remembered the location of a briefly presented cue, 2) covertly attended to a cued stimulus to discern a slight change in it\u2019s contrast, and 3) planned a saccade to the cue\u2019s location or mirrored location. If these three spatial processes depend on a common mechanism they should activate at least some of the same brain areas. We found two frontal regions, one that is the likely human homolog of the monkey FEF, and one parietal region, the likely homolog of monkey area LIP. In Figure 2, we plot the independent and overlapping activation of each of the three processes color keyed by the annulus (note that white denotes the conjunction of memory, attention, and intention). That is the same exact cortical area was active during spatial working memory, spatial attention, and motor intention. Detailed analyses of the time series from the superior dorsolateral frontal area, the likely FEF, demonstrated that the BOLD signal in this area persisted during the maintenance of the position in working memory, during the maintenance of covert attention, and during the maintenance of an oculomotor intention (Figure 3). Also, we were able to show that during each of these processes there is a spatial bias; there is greater activation in the hemisphere opposite the location of the memory, attentional focus, and planned movement.                                                                   Figure 2. Persistent activation during the maintenance of working memory, attention, and/or intention. Each condition is coded by the color wheel on the right. We identified two frontal areas and one parietal area that showed persistent activity in all three conditions (white = common overlap; circled with black dashed lines).                                                                   Figure 3. BOLD time courses illustrating persistent neural activity with a contralateral bias in frontal cortex during the maintenance of working memory, attention, and intention.                                  Together, these data suggest that these frontal and parietal areas house a mechanism that is common among spatial working memory, spatial attention, motor intention. It may be the co-recruitment of these areas that lead to interference when two of these processes are required simultaneously in dual task behavioral studies. We are both surprised and excited at the degree of overlap in the pattern of activation across these tasks. It could have been equally plausible that slightly different areas of frontal and parietal cortex could support each of the functions. This is the first demonstration of such a remarkable overlap in activation related to spatial memory, attention, and intention (Curtis et al. 2008). This has forced us to rethink what types of computations are performed in these areas. For instance, we have argued that the human FEF does not simply compute the metrics for eye movement planning, but it plays a larger role in spatial cognition (Curtis 2006; Curtis and Connolly 2008; Ikkai and Curtis In Press; Srimal and Curtis 2008). For instance, persistent FEF activity may represent a prioritized attentional map of space, rather than the metrics for saccades. In order to test this, we have begun to map the spatial topography of the frontal and parietal cortex using phase-based retinotopic mapping procedures adapted for higher-level cognition for which the frontal cortex may be responsible. Our preliminary data are encouraging as we are finding topographic organization that maps on to the areas where we found common activation during memory, attention, and intention (Figure 4).                        Effects of incentives on working memory                                  Although neural activity correlates with the expectation of reward in a variety of cortical and subcortical areas, such observations do not necessarily implicate these areas in the direct modulation of behavior based on reward. For instance, increased activity could simply reflect the greater effort that one is willing to exert in order to obtain the greater reward. Recently, using event-related fMRI, Mauricio Delgado and I imaged the human brain performing a spatial delayed-response task, while we independently manipulated both reward incentive and effort (Curtis et al. 2006; 2007). To manipulate incentive, we told subjects at the beginning of each trial how much money (5\u00a2 vs. $5) could be gained or lost depending on their performance on that trial. At the same time, to manipulate effort, we told subjects how difficult the current trial was going to be (easy vs. hard). We controlled difficulty by adjusting the precision necessary to discriminate the spatial memoranda from a probe stimulus presented after the delay. A psychophysical staircase procedure was used to dynamically adjust difficulty to arrive at 85% and 60% accuracy for the easy and hard conditions, respectively, for each subject. Behaviorally, reaction time, pupil size, and subjective ratings indicate that our manipulations of incentive and effort were successful. Neurally, classic oculomotor cortical areas showed strong effects of effort independent of the magnitude of incentive. Moreover, both the striatum and prefrontal cortex showed strong effects of reward incentive independent of effort level. These results suggest that effort and incentive may depend on distinct cortical and subcortical structures whose interaction promotes the attainment of desired goals.                                              Homology between human and monkey - Translational research                                  In these studies of spatial working memory, we have used memory-guided saccade tasks that are identical to those that have been used in monkey electrophysiological investigations (e.g., (Bruce and Goldberg 1985; Funahashi et al. 1989). This allowed us to use published electrophysiological data to aid in and strengthen the interpretations of our fMRI data. Specifically, we have been able to use the monkey electrophysiology data to argue that the blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signals in the human FEF arise from increases in neuronal spike rate during the memory delay. We have discovered several homologies between the patterns of BOLD and spike data. For example, just like that shown in monkey electrophysiological studies, we\u2019ve shown that BOLD signals in the human FEF 1) persists above baseline for the duration of the delay (Curtis and D'Esposito 2006; Curtis et al. 2004; Srimal and Curtis 2008), 2) scales with the length of the memory delay (Srimal and Curtis 2008), 3) is spatially selective (Curtis and D'Esposito 2006; Srimal and Curtis 2008), and 4) correlates with the accuracy of working memory performance (Curtis et al. 2004). These findings provide an important confirmation for our assumption that we can use electrophysiological data to inform and constrain our interpretations of fMRI data. Moreover, the homology not only increases the inferential power of our studies, but it also provides important and needed translational data. We have tested highly influential animal models of human cognition in humans, which, although often overlooked, is needed before the full significance of research in another species can be realized. Because of the significance of our lab\u2019s translational work, we remain in regular and close contact with several monkey electrophysiology investigators.                                 Control of Action                                   Inhibitory control                                  All animals are endowed with the capability of motor behavior. With that endowment they are faced with the continuous responsibility of selecting certain courses of action over others in order to ascertain their goals. A distinguishing feature of the higher animal species, like primates, is their exceptional ability to voluntarily control their actions. Voluntary control is necessary when an optimal motor response is uncertain or when a competing motor response must be overcome. A special case of voluntary control, or the more general term \u201cexecutive\u201d or \u201ccognitive\u201d control, is the ability to inhibit an unwanted action. Successfully withholding an over-learned, prepotent, or planned motor response is a critical demonstration of inhibitory control. Indeed, the ecological validity of such a construct is high and we can all think of a multitude of instances when we have had to inhibit our behavior. In social situations, our gaze at any given instant communicates to others information about our internal thoughts. For example, you might find it prudent to inhibit your glances towards an attractive person sitting at an adjacent table if you are dining with your partner.                        The voluntary control of behavior, of which withholding an action is a critical demonstration, can be exerted at any point along the series of processes that evolve over time from sensation to action. In the context of a stop-signal task, inhibition takes place far downstream in this evolution, after the movement has been planned. Inhibiting or canceling a planned movement following an imperative stop signal can be modeled as a race between independent GO and STOP mechanisms (Hanes and Carpenter 1999; Logan et al. 1984). Which process first reaches a critical threshold, or finish line, determines whether the planned response is generated or not. The presaccadic growth of activity in monkey FEF saccade neurons is correlated with saccade production while the growth of activity in FEF fixation neurons is correlated with saccade withholding during the performance of stop-signal tasks (Schall 2001). We were the first to demonstrate that during a stop-signal task, the successful cancellation of a planned saccade (i.e., STOP trial) causes greater human FEF activation than the generation of a saccade on no-stop signal, or GO, trials (Curtis et al. 2005). The increased activation likely reflects the co-activation of saccade and fixation neurons on STOP trials.                        Similar changes in FEF saccade and fixation neural activity can be seen when an animal prepares to inhibit an unwanted action, for instance a saccade to a visually salient target. Prior to antisaccade trials when the animal anticipates that he will need to inhibit the prepotent reflex-like saccade, the firing rate of FEF saccade neurons decreases while the firing rate of fixation neurons increases (Munoz and Everling 2004). We have demonstrated in humans that FEF activity increases prior to antisaccade trials compared to prosaccade trials (Curtis and Connolly 2008; Curtis and D'Esposito 2003b). The increase is presumably due to the co-activation of saccade and fixation neurons in the FEF prior to antisaccade trials. These changes are thought to bias the oculomotor system towards a less motile state where the onset of the target and its associated capture of attention is less likely to result in an unwanted saccade (Curtis and D'Esposito In Press). An important implication of these data is that the inhibition of an unwanted action emerges or is the consequence of the competition between different potential responses. Therefore, inhibitory control like voluntary control more generally may be best modeled as the process by which we select the best response among all competing responses, including not responding at all. At least at the level of premotor structures, a mechanism specialized for inhibiting actions, per se, does not seem necessary for the behavioral expression of inhibiting an unwanted action.                         Saccade adaptation                                  We have also begun a new line of research involving the neural mechanisms of unconscious, non-voluntary forms of motor control and learning. Within the oculomotor system, the motor programs issued given the position of the visual target on the retina remain accurate in the face of fatigue, injury and aging. Such plasticity emerges through motor learning mechanisms that continually adapt the system to new sensorimotor transformations. We recently tested the hypothesis that saccade gains adapt to minimize error between the visual target and the saccade endpoint of every saccade we make even when the errors on sequential saccades are not directionally consistent (Srimal and Curtis 2006; Srimal et al. In Press). We utilized a state-space model that estimated the degree to which saccade gains were modified by the magnitude and direction of errors made on the previous trial. We assumed that an inverse dynamics model computes the motor command necessary to generate the desired saccade. An efference copy of the motor command is sent to a forward model, which predicts the sensory error given the current state of the system and the perturbation to the system. This error is weighted by a learning parameter to form the teaching signal that trains the inverse dynamics model to produce an updated motor command. Importantly, to show that learning did not depend on the accumulation of directionally consistent errors, we fit the model to saccades made to targets that were displaced in a random direction during the saccade, thereby inducing errors whose directions were not sequentially consistent. Saccade gains clearly adapted on a trial-by-trial basis despite that the perturbations were random, and the average amount of learning per trial was of similar magnitude as that found in a constant displacement of the target. We concluded that the oculomotor system adapts to random perturbations in motor control via a mechanism that is rapid, obligatory, and does not require conscious awareness. Moreover, these features fit well within emerging theories of motor control composed of dynamic internal models used to compute and anticipate the sensory consequences of motor actions. Currently we are conducting a series of fMRI studies that use the trial-by-trial model parameters of learning to predict BOLD signal changes in the brain.

Students are exposed to a broad range of scholarship in social psychology, and receive research training that will enable them to become independent contributors to the field. What distinguishes our program from many others is the combination of quality and breadth. With twelve core faculty and a number of affiliated faculty, our program is acclaimed for its cutting-edge research on a wide range of topics in the following areas:     Social cognition and attitudes: Person perception and social  judgment ( Jim Uleman , Yaacov  Trope , Tessa West ); relational  processes, inferences about self and other ( Susan  Andersen ); spontaneous trait inference, culture and social cognition ( Jim  Uleman ), implicit/explicit attitudes, stereotypes, and prejudice ( David  Amodio ); political ideology ( John  Jost ); Psychological distance and mental   construal ( Yaacov Trope ).  Motivation, emotion, and self-regulation: Action control  and goal pursuit ( Peter Gollwitzer );  self-regulation of thought and action ( Gabriele  Oettingen) ; self-control ( Yaacov Trope ); intrinsic and extrinsic  motivation ( Tom Tyler ); system justification  ( John Jost) , emotion and motivation  effects on regulatory processes ( David  Amodio ).  Relationships, personality, and social development: Significant  others and the self, social cognition and personality,       hopelessness/depression ( Susan  Andersen ); relationships, stress, and coping ( Pat  Shrout );       attitudes and relationship formation  ( Tessa West ).  Groups, organizations, and societies: Stereotyping and prejudice in the workplace  ( Madeline Heilman );       interracial groups   ( Tessa West ); social justice  ( Tom Tyler , John Jost ).        In addition, there is a burgeoning interest and presence in Social Neuroscience.  In this growing field, research within the Program examines: the neural mechanisms  underlying activation and control of racial bias; interactions with hormones  and health ( David Amodio ); social  effects on neural processes of fear learning ( Elizabeth  Phelps , in the C&amp;P area ). Several other faculty in the Program collaborate  on various other social neuroscience projects, and the Psychology Department  hosts a Social  Neuroscience Speaker Series . The Psychology Building houses facilities  for fMRI, EEG/ERP, TMS, eye-tracking, and other psychophysiological methods. Graduate studies in the Social  Psychology Program at NYU means being part of an unusually active research culture. We share well equipped laboratories, and we promote 'open door' relationships between professors and students. Although students typically have a primary home in one professor's laboratory, we require that students work with at least one other faculty member to promote breadth of training in a variety of methodological approaches and research issues. Our goal is to prepare students to be highly competitive in the job market for the type of career they seek, and we are proud of the steady success of our students over the past 15 years in obtaining academic positions at the best research universities as well as important teaching colleges. The NYU social program has a history of a special communal, cooperative spirit, with very high morale among the students. A core component of this community is the weekly brownbag seminar, where students and faculty share their recent findings and research plans with the rest of the group. Students can bring this forum special expertise that they obtain in NYU\u2019s programs in quantitative, neuroscience, and cognitive psychology, which supplement the core curriculum in social psychology.     Academic Requirements  A total of 72 credits are required for the PhD degree. Credits are earned through coursework, research seminars and independent study over a five year period. A minimum of 24 credits must be earned through coursework with grades of B or higher. Typically, students register for 9-12 credits (either course or research credits), with the central coursework in the first 2 years of study. The minimum number of credits a student can take in a semester is 6.  All students have a faculty advisor. This is the faculty member who is the primary research mentor for the student. All students are required to work in more than one lab during their graduate career, i.e., with at least one other faculty member in a research collaboration. Students are also encouraged to seek advice from the program coordinator about courses and degree requirements.     Course Requirements Curriculum  There is no single prescribed program for the PhD in social psychology. Each student\u2019s program is designed to fit his or her interests, needs and background. The curriculum\u2019s structure comes from a specification of certain distribution requirements that promote expertise and also breadth.  Required Distribution of Courses     The social psychology Ph.D. curriculum specifies the distribution of 8 courses. Other courses that students take are electives and should be chosen in consultation with their advisors or sponsors. These may be structured courses, reading courses or research courses.  Students are required to take one course from two of the four core areas of the program: (1) social cognition; (2) motivation and self-regulation; (3) relationships, personality and social development; and (4) organizational processes (A listing of courses is provided below.) In addition, students are required to take one additional course of their choice in any of these areas, reflecting their interests.     To ensure a broad exposure to psychology and other related fields, students are required to take one course outside of the NYU social program. This course can be in another area within the psychology department (those offered in Cognition and Perception ); in another Department, such as Economics , Sociology , Philosophy , Political Science , or Neural Science in the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences , or at the Stern School of Business (e.g., in Organizational Behavior) or the Steinhardt School of Education (e.g., in Applied Psychology ); or elsewhere (e.g. through the Inter-university Doctoral Consortium).     A fifth content course is required, and this requirement may be fulfilled by registering for a core social psychology course, or a relevant course outside of the NYU social program (such as those mentioned in the preceding paragraph.)     Students are also required to take a three-course methods and statistics sequence including Research Methods I, and the Statistics courses of Intermediate Statistics and Advanced Statistics (either ANOVA or Regression). Although not required, many students take additional statistics and methods courses such as Psychometrics, Structural Equation Modeling, Analysis of Change and Research Methods II.     Further Study After completing the required courses, each student\u2019s program is individually tailored to take maximum advantage of course offerings in areas relevant to his or her selected areas of interest. While a minimum of eight courses is required, many students take additional courses in social psychology and related fields. Some also choose to minor in another subfield of psychology, such as developmental , quantitative , or cognition and perception . Arrangements can additionally be made for students to take courses in other universities that participate in the New York City Inter-University Consortium, including Columbia , Princeton , and CUNY .         Other than through coursework, the remaining points may be earned through a combination of reading courses (G89.3305/3306), pre-dissertation research courses (G89.3303/3304), or dissertation research courses (for those who have passed their proposal hearing: G89.3301/3302). No more than 12 points may be taken in each of the last three categories. Each student\u2019s program of study must receive the approval of his/her advisor each semester.     Research Requirements Research Training  Students are expected to work actively in the laboratory group of at least one NYU social psychology faculty member during all terms in residence. Although most students have a single primary placement, all are required to work with at least one additional faculty member during the five years of their training.  Brown Bag Seminar  All members of the program are expected to participate in the weekly Brown Bag seminar. The seminar meets informally, over lunch, and is a forum for presenting current and planned research. Each student is required to present on his or her research once a year. The seminar is a key component of student training over the five years of doctoral study.     Second Year Paper  Students are required to complete a Second Year Paper consisting of a formal write-up of the primary research project from their first two years of doctoral training. When approved, this paper satisfies the requirements for the Masters Degree. Although filing the paperwork for the Masters Degree is not required, completing the Second Year Paper is a program requirement. The Second Year Paper is due at the end of the Summer of the 2nd year, as the student\u2019s 3 rd year is about to begin . This project is done in collaboration with one or more faculty members and the write up of the project is done in conjunction with the student\u2019s research advisor.  Third Year Paper Students are also required to submit a Third Year Paper, which is a theoretically motivated, integrative literature review that is guided by a coherent set of theoretical purposes or questions. It covers at least two relevant research literatures and is organized along the lines of an article in Psychological Bulletin or Personality and Social Psychology Review . The paper extends well beyond the scope of the two or three lines of research in which the student is engaged and is on a topic of the student's choosing. It can be started as soon as the student formulates and writes a proposal for the paper\u2019s content and substance (developed in conjunction with one or more faculty in the program), which is then approved by a Third Year Paper Committee in the program. The proposal is due at the end of Fall of the 3 rd Year. The proposal is a one-page single-spaced abstract that states the theoretical purposes of the work and the empirical literatures the student intends to review. The proposal will be evaluated in terms of whether or not it (a) is guided by a theoretical purpose that is coherently laid out; (b) is integrative in nature, by bringing together two or more different literatures; and (c) has scholarly merit. The Third Year Paper itself is 35-45 text pages (not including references). The completed paper is due the first week of September of the fourth year. It is independent of the Second Year Paper, although the papers can be in related domains, if desired, and they can be supervised by the same research advisor, if desired. This requirement serves the function of a comprehensive examination. The Third Year Paper Committee: (a) is appointed by the program; (b) implements this program requirement; (c) evaluates and approves or disapproves paper proposals; (c) assigns readers for each completed paper based on faculty expertise (one of whom may be the student\u2019s research advisor).      Doctoral Dissertation  In consultation with a faculty advisor, students select a dissertation topic, develop it, and prepare a dissertation proposal. The proposal should provide a rationale for the importance of the research problem or issue, provide an overview of the literature in which the contribution of the research would be situated, present the theoretical rationale, purposes, and hypotheses of the research, and provide a detailed description of the methods and analyses of the proposed dissertation studies, as well as its likely implications. The proposal must be approved by a three-member dissertation committee in a formal proposal hearing. Students are advised to start thinking about prospective dissertation topics early in the doctoral training. Students should plan to complete their dissertation proposal and defend that proposal by the end of the fourth year of study, if not earlier .    Students should bear in mind that the dissertation is expected to be a major piece of independent research by the candidate. Although interaction between the candidate and his/her dissertation committee is expected and desirable, the student takes the lead on this research and the committee serves mainly in an advisory and evaluative capacity. The dissertation should be submitted by the end of the 5 th Year. After the dissertation has been completed, it must be defended in an oral examination before the three-member dissertation committee supplemented by two additional committee members designated as readers. Students typically register for two semesters (6 points) of dissertation credit during their fifth year of doctoral study while conducting their dissertation research and writing their dissertation.     For more information about the dissertation process, see the Psychology Department\u2019s document, Dissertation and Graduation Procedures for Doctoral Students.     Teaching Requirements and Assistantships     Students are appointed to teaching assistantships for a minimum of two and a maximum of five semesters during their graduate school tenure. A teaching assistantship involves assisting a faculty member with his/her instructional activities. Teaching assistantships are a source of valuable experience in presenting ideas to others, and form an integral part of doctoral education.     Training Sequence  In their first two years, students focus on mentored research projects and coursework. Over this period they complete their eight required courses. With the exception of research methods and two statistics courses, all of which must be taken in the first two semesters, students are free to fulfill their course requirements in any order they wish, typically enrolling in three courses a semester.  During the second year, students work on the Second Year Paper, and during the third year they work on the Third Year Paper (see above)     Students spend their third, fourth and fifth years taking additional coursework, as desired, and focusing primarily on their research activities, culminating in their doctoral dissertation research.     At the end of the first semester of their third year, they also propose their Third Year Paper (an integrative literature that combines differing literatures and addresses a coherent set of theoretical questions), which is then due in final form the first week of September of the fourth year .     Students should aim to prepare and defend their dissertation proposal not later than the end of their 4 th year, and to complete their dissertation toward the end of their 5 th year.     Students are guaranteed full financial support for five years of doctoral study.     General Requirements for the Doctorate at NYU      The graduate school of Arts and Science home page provides information about transfer credits and other general requirements for the doctorate at NYU. It is expected that students will fulfill the course requirements, complete the doctoral research and defend the thesis within five years.

Research is central in our graduate training. Students are exposed to a broad range of knowledge in cognition and perception and they are trained to think creatively and to develop independent research careers.                   Our program spans cognition and perception, examining mental processes such as perception, attention, memory, categorization, language, emotion, development, motor control, and cognitive neuroscience. How do we identify the letter &quot;a&quot;? How do we perceive depth and shape? What representational resources are innate? How do human cultures, and individual children, go beyond innate representational capacities? How do toddlers make decisions about their world? How are explicit and implicit memories coded in the brain? How do we inhibit inappropriate responses? How are sentences understood? How are new concepts acquired? How does attention affect perception?                   Students and faculty work closely with researchers in other departments ( Neural Science , Computer Science , Linguistics , and Philosophy ). Every week there are journal club discussions and talks by leading researchers that take place within the Psychology Department, in other NYU departments, and at other nearby schools in New York City (see Events ). Ready access to researchers at several great universities and to incredible cultural resources makes New York City a great place to study perception and cognition.                  Our graduate students begin research immediately. Students benefit from interaction with their faculty advisers and the lively exchange of research ideas among students, postdocs, and faculty at weekly Cognition and Perception colloquia and brown bag talks , research seminars, journal clubs ( cognitive neuroscience , development , ... see Events ) and our annual miniconvention. As a result of this focus on research, our students publish regularly in high-impact journals and go on to become researchers at the best research universities and industrial laboratories.                               Curriculum             What follows is a brief version of our curriculum. Full details may be found in our Graduate Student Guide . Our curriculum is designed to help students master the skills required to accomplish high quality research. Within the first two years, most students have completed the bulk of our primary course requirements. We require all students to take at least four courses in core, content-based areas of the discipline such as Memory, Perception, Attention, Cognitive Development, Psycholinguistics and Cognitive Neuroscience. In addition, we require all students to take at least two courses in quantitative methods, which can be the two-semester departmental statistics sequence, or other courses in probability theory, simulation, advanced statistical methods, etc. In addition, there are advanced seminars in areas related to the research areas of the faculty and students. The course catalog and schedule are online.                  A key aspect of our program is its strength in cognitive neuroscience, which students can select as their &quot;concentration&quot;. One aspect of this is the new, on-site, research-dedicated Center for Brain Imaging that includes a 3T MRI scanner and EEG facility, and will soon include a TMS facility as well. The center is designed to allow students the training and opportunity to become experts in cognitive neuroscience. Through a combination of course work and hands-on experience, students who select this concentration will receive training in the techniques of cognitive neuroscience and will apply these techniques to their chosen research questions.                   Students join a laboratory and begin to design and carry out a research project in their first semester. They are required to write a paper based on research they have performed as well as give a talk in our annual miniconvention at the end of their first and second years. The 2nd-year paper and completion of our basic course requirements generally result in the awarding of an MA degree. We encourage students to collaborate with more than one faculty member, including doing a full laboratory rotation or two. Students may work with primary Cognition &amp; Perception faculty or with affiliates from other programs (e.g., Social Psychology) or departments (e.g., the Center for Neural Science). (See faculty listed alphabetically with a sentence about their research interests, or by area .) In their third and fourth years, PhD students are focused primarily on research.                  We consider the best experience that students can have to become productive researchers is to carry out, write up, and present their research projects. The 1st- and 2nd-year research requirements emphasize this goal. The content and methods courses are designed to provide students with the context and tools they need to produce world-class research on their own. After graduating, most of our students have gone on to research careers. (See Recent PhDs .)                                                 Support             All students accepted into our graduate program are fully funded through the Henry M. MacCracken Program. MacCracken funding is provided through a combination of teaching assistantship, research assistantship, and fellowship, in proportions to be determined. The award package typically includes a full tuition scholarship, comprehensive health insurance and a stipend. Funding is typically guaranteed for five years, although students with substantial graduate credits or a Master's degree may only be guaranteed four years of support. For current information on the Psychology Department's aid package, please see our doctoral financial aid page .                         There is a very limited supply of subsidized housing available for graduate students which is generally used for a subset of each entering class to provide them the opportunity to get settled in New York City during their first year of residence.                               Admissions             To apply for admission to the Graduate Program in Cognition &amp; Perception, you'll need the application form , which is available from the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences. Apply for admission to the Department of Psychology. In the forms there is a place where you specify the particular program in which you are interested (e.g. Cognition &amp; Perception), as well as whether you are also interested in the Developmental Concentration.                 In the application, it is requested that you supply a personal statement. You are free to include any information in that statement that you feel will help us in our admissions decision. However, as we are a research-based program, it is especially useful if you include a review of any research experience you have had (explain what was interesting about it) as well as your current research interests.                  Together with your application, the Graduate School of Arts and Science will require you to upload official transcripts of grades from other schools you have attended, both undergraduate and graduate. In addition, it is required that you take the Graduate Record Exam ( GRE ). Some of our students also submit scores from the Advanced Psychology GRE test. We place very little weight on that score, and do not encourage you to take it.      Please do NOT mail any documents (transcripts etc) to the department. Everything needs to be uploaded and submitted through the online application.             International applicants must take the TOEFL exams if English is not their first language unless they earned a Bachelor's or Master's degree at an English speaking university. Additional information of concern to international applicants is available online from the Office of Global Services .                 We recommend that you submit your application so as to arrive by December 12th.

Research                                  The Prefrontal Cortex                                 The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is thought to be the most important brain area for higher-order cognition and sits at the apex of the sensory and motor hierarchies. The functions of the PFC give rise to higher-level cognitive abilities that make us uniquely human. They are also responsible for dysfunctions of the PFC that result in severe psychopathology, such as schizophrenia, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), substance abuse disorders, Alzheimer\u2019s and Parkinson\u2019s disease, and AIDS-related dementia. But despite its importance, we know very little about the mechanisms by which the PFC supports adaptive and maladaptive behaviors.                                  The long-term goal of the lab\u2019s research is to understand the mechanisms by which the PFC supports higher-level cognition. Most theories of PFC function posit that the PFC plays an important role in cognitive control. Cognitive control or \u201cexecutive control\u201d processes help guide thought and behavior based on internally generated goals. Cognitive control is necessary when one must use internal representations to guide behavior because the current external environment does not provide the necessary information to help one make a decision, a process known as working memory. Cognitive control is also needed when one must override responses that may otherwise be automatically elicited by stimuli in the external environment. Our lab studies both of these types of cognitive control.                                             Working Memory                                 Arguably, all forms of higher-level cognition depend on our ability to create and maintain for short periods of time internal representations of information, a process known as working memory. Working memory allows animals to use information that is not currently available in the environment but is crucial for adaptive behavior. Without the ability to temporarily store information on-line, one\u2019s behavior is stereotyped and largely depends upon learned stimulus\u2013response associations. If, however, an internal representation of critical information can be created and maintained for a short period of time, flexible behavior emerges because one\u2019s decisions can now utilize representations of temporally discontinuous events. Persistent neural activity during the delay period between a sensory cue (e.g., the position of a briefly flashed spot of light) and a later motor response (e.g., a shift of gaze to the remembered location) is the most compelling evidence that this activity reflects some form of a memory representation (Curtis and D'Esposito 2003a). In fact, essentially all models of working memory require the persistence of a representation (e.g.,(Wang 2001). Using fMRI, we have successfully identified several frontal and parietal areas that show persistent neural activity during memory delays (Curtis 2006; Curtis and D'Esposito 2006; Curtis et al. 2004; Schluppeck et al. 2006; Srimal and Curtis 2008) (Figure 1).                                                       Figure 1. Electrophysiological (A) and fMRI (B) data demonstrating persistent neural activity in frontal cortex during a working memory retention interval.                      Nature of persistent neural activity                                  These studies have isolated persistent activity in dorsal prefrontal regions, like the frontal eye field (FEF), and the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) during the maintenance of positional information. This observation, however, does not answer what is actually being remembered or coded for by this activity (Curtis and D'Esposito 2003a). In a series of studies our aim has been to gain insight into the type of information coded by this activity. By manipulating the sensory and motor demands of the working memory task, we have been able to modulate the FEF and PPC delay-period activity. We\u2019ve found evidence that retrospective sensory coding of space may be more prominent in the PPC, while prospective motor coding of space may be more prominent in the FEF (Curtis 2006; Curtis and D'Esposito 2006; Curtis et al. 2004). During a memory delay, one can look back to a past event, a retrospective code, or can look forward to a future event, a prospective code, in order to link events that are separated in time but are contingent upon one another. Both coding schemes are likely mechanisms of working memory and provide important clues to different contributions of the frontal and parietal cortices.                                 Recently, we directly tested the hypothesis that the maintenance of a prospective oculomotor plan is an important mechanism by which we maintain space (Curtis and Connolly 2008). We used an oculomotor deferred saccade task, in which the sensory cue was continuously present throughout the delay interval, rather than merely being transiently flashed prior to the delay interval. This paradigm eliminated the memory component (i.e., the need to remember the location of the saccade target) and placed the emphasis squarely upon oculomotor planning. We found that BOLD signals persisted in the frontal and parietal cortex throughout the delay interval even when working memory was not required. Therefore, the delay period activity that is often interpreted as the signature of working memory maintenance may in fact rely on mechanisms related to prospective motor planning to bridge the temporal gap between a stimulus and its contingent response.                                             We have also shown that these neural signals during memory delay cannot solely reflect oculomotor plans. For example, we find persistent neural activity in the frontal cortex during trials in which the forthcoming memory-guided response is not known until after the delay and therefore cannot be planned (Curtis and D'Esposito 2006; Curtis et al. 2004; Srimal and Curtis 2008). In an even more dramatic demonstration, we have recently found that activity in the frontal cortex persists when subjects are maintaining an auditory-cued location that is behind the subject\u2019s head, a location that cannot be acquired with an eye-movement (Tark and Curtis 2007; 2008). These exciting new data not only call into question whether these signals are oculomotor in nature but they open up the possibility that they could reflect spatial representations that are not in eye-centered coordinates. Several members of the lab are currently conducting several follow-up studies of subjects localizing and maintaining auditorily-cued space.                      Common mechanism for spatial working memory, attention, and oculomotor intention                                  Spatial working memory maintenance may be mediated through sustained covert attention directed to the cued location (Awh et al. 2000; Postle et al. 2004). Similarly, spatial attention appears to be strongly coupled with the planning of an eye movement to the attended location (Awh et al. 2006). As discussed above, we have found evidence that persistent activity in the frontal lobe during a working memory delay period could represent 1) activation of a working memory representation of the stimulus\u2019s position, 2) covert attention directed to the cued location, or 3) a planned saccade to the cued location. We conducted a series of studies that directly tested the long-standing question of whether the neural mechanisms that support each of these processes are shared. We scanned the same subjects in separate fMRI sessions while they 1) remembered the location of a briefly presented cue, 2) covertly attended to a cued stimulus to discern a slight change in it\u2019s contrast, and 3) planned a saccade to the cue\u2019s location or mirrored location. If these three spatial processes depend on a common mechanism they should activate at least some of the same brain areas. We found two frontal regions, one that is the likely human homolog of the monkey FEF, and one parietal region, the likely homolog of monkey area LIP. In Figure 2, we plot the independent and overlapping activation of each of the three processes color keyed by the annulus (note that white denotes the conjunction of memory, attention, and intention). That is the same exact cortical area was active during spatial working memory, spatial attention, and motor intention. Detailed analyses of the time series from the superior dorsolateral frontal area, the likely FEF, demonstrated that the BOLD signal in this area persisted during the maintenance of the position in working memory, during the maintenance of covert attention, and during the maintenance of an oculomotor intention (Figure 3). Also, we were able to show that during each of these processes there is a spatial bias; there is greater activation in the hemisphere opposite the location of the memory, attentional focus, and planned movement.                                                                   Figure 2. Persistent activation during the maintenance of working memory, attention, and/or intention. Each condition is coded by the color wheel on the right. We identified two frontal areas and one parietal area that showed persistent activity in all three conditions (white = common overlap; circled with black dashed lines).                                                                   Figure 3. BOLD time courses illustrating persistent neural activity with a contralateral bias in frontal cortex during the maintenance of working memory, attention, and intention.                                  Together, these data suggest that these frontal and parietal areas house a mechanism that is common among spatial working memory, spatial attention, motor intention. It may be the co-recruitment of these areas that lead to interference when two of these processes are required simultaneously in dual task behavioral studies. We are both surprised and excited at the degree of overlap in the pattern of activation across these tasks. It could have been equally plausible that slightly different areas of frontal and parietal cortex could support each of the functions. This is the first demonstration of such a remarkable overlap in activation related to spatial memory, attention, and intention (Curtis et al. 2008). This has forced us to rethink what types of computations are performed in these areas. For instance, we have argued that the human FEF does not simply compute the metrics for eye movement planning, but it plays a larger role in spatial cognition (Curtis 2006; Curtis and Connolly 2008; Ikkai and Curtis In Press; Srimal and Curtis 2008). For instance, persistent FEF activity may represent a prioritized attentional map of space, rather than the metrics for saccades. In order to test this, we have begun to map the spatial topography of the frontal and parietal cortex using phase-based retinotopic mapping procedures adapted for higher-level cognition for which the frontal cortex may be responsible. Our preliminary data are encouraging as we are finding topographic organization that maps on to the areas where we found common activation during memory, attention, and intention (Figure 4).                        Effects of incentives on working memory                                  Although neural activity correlates with the expectation of reward in a variety of cortical and subcortical areas, such observations do not necessarily implicate these areas in the direct modulation of behavior based on reward. For instance, increased activity could simply reflect the greater effort that one is willing to exert in order to obtain the greater reward. Recently, using event-related fMRI, Mauricio Delgado and I imaged the human brain performing a spatial delayed-response task, while we independently manipulated both reward incentive and effort (Curtis et al. 2006; 2007). To manipulate incentive, we told subjects at the beginning of each trial how much money (5\u00a2 vs. $5) could be gained or lost depending on their performance on that trial. At the same time, to manipulate effort, we told subjects how difficult the current trial was going to be (easy vs. hard). We controlled difficulty by adjusting the precision necessary to discriminate the spatial memoranda from a probe stimulus presented after the delay. A psychophysical staircase procedure was used to dynamically adjust difficulty to arrive at 85% and 60% accuracy for the easy and hard conditions, respectively, for each subject. Behaviorally, reaction time, pupil size, and subjective ratings indicate that our manipulations of incentive and effort were successful. Neurally, classic oculomotor cortical areas showed strong effects of effort independent of the magnitude of incentive. Moreover, both the striatum and prefrontal cortex showed strong effects of reward incentive independent of effort level. These results suggest that effort and incentive may depend on distinct cortical and subcortical structures whose interaction promotes the attainment of desired goals.                                              Homology between human and monkey - Translational research                                  In these studies of spatial working memory, we have used memory-guided saccade tasks that are identical to those that have been used in monkey electrophysiological investigations (e.g., (Bruce and Goldberg 1985; Funahashi et al. 1989). This allowed us to use published electrophysiological data to aid in and strengthen the interpretations of our fMRI data. Specifically, we have been able to use the monkey electrophysiology data to argue that the blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signals in the human FEF arise from increases in neuronal spike rate during the memory delay. We have discovered several homologies between the patterns of BOLD and spike data. For example, just like that shown in monkey electrophysiological studies, we\u2019ve shown that BOLD signals in the human FEF 1) persists above baseline for the duration of the delay (Curtis and D'Esposito 2006; Curtis et al. 2004; Srimal and Curtis 2008), 2) scales with the length of the memory delay (Srimal and Curtis 2008), 3) is spatially selective (Curtis and D'Esposito 2006; Srimal and Curtis 2008), and 4) correlates with the accuracy of working memory performance (Curtis et al. 2004). These findings provide an important confirmation for our assumption that we can use electrophysiological data to inform and constrain our interpretations of fMRI data. Moreover, the homology not only increases the inferential power of our studies, but it also provides important and needed translational data. We have tested highly influential animal models of human cognition in humans, which, although often overlooked, is needed before the full significance of research in another species can be realized. Because of the significance of our lab\u2019s translational work, we remain in regular and close contact with several monkey electrophysiology investigators.                                 Control of Action                                   Inhibitory control                                  All animals are endowed with the capability of motor behavior. With that endowment they are faced with the continuous responsibility of selecting certain courses of action over others in order to ascertain their goals. A distinguishing feature of the higher animal species, like primates, is their exceptional ability to voluntarily control their actions. Voluntary control is necessary when an optimal motor response is uncertain or when a competing motor response must be overcome. A special case of voluntary control, or the more general term \u201cexecutive\u201d or \u201ccognitive\u201d control, is the ability to inhibit an unwanted action. Successfully withholding an over-learned, prepotent, or planned motor response is a critical demonstration of inhibitory control. Indeed, the ecological validity of such a construct is high and we can all think of a multitude of instances when we have had to inhibit our behavior. In social situations, our gaze at any given instant communicates to others information about our internal thoughts. For example, you might find it prudent to inhibit your glances towards an attractive person sitting at an adjacent table if you are dining with your partner.                        The voluntary control of behavior, of which withholding an action is a critical demonstration, can be exerted at any point along the series of processes that evolve over time from sensation to action. In the context of a stop-signal task, inhibition takes place far downstream in this evolution, after the movement has been planned. Inhibiting or canceling a planned movement following an imperative stop signal can be modeled as a race between independent GO and STOP mechanisms (Hanes and Carpenter 1999; Logan et al. 1984). Which process first reaches a critical threshold, or finish line, determines whether the planned response is generated or not. The presaccadic growth of activity in monkey FEF saccade neurons is correlated with saccade production while the growth of activity in FEF fixation neurons is correlated with saccade withholding during the performance of stop-signal tasks (Schall 2001). We were the first to demonstrate that during a stop-signal task, the successful cancellation of a planned saccade (i.e., STOP trial) causes greater human FEF activation than the generation of a saccade on no-stop signal, or GO, trials (Curtis et al. 2005). The increased activation likely reflects the co-activation of saccade and fixation neurons on STOP trials.                        Similar changes in FEF saccade and fixation neural activity can be seen when an animal prepares to inhibit an unwanted action, for instance a saccade to a visually salient target. Prior to antisaccade trials when the animal anticipates that he will need to inhibit the prepotent reflex-like saccade, the firing rate of FEF saccade neurons decreases while the firing rate of fixation neurons increases (Munoz and Everling 2004). We have demonstrated in humans that FEF activity increases prior to antisaccade trials compared to prosaccade trials (Curtis and Connolly 2008; Curtis and D'Esposito 2003b). The increase is presumably due to the co-activation of saccade and fixation neurons in the FEF prior to antisaccade trials. These changes are thought to bias the oculomotor system towards a less motile state where the onset of the target and its associated capture of attention is less likely to result in an unwanted saccade (Curtis and D'Esposito In Press). An important implication of these data is that the inhibition of an unwanted action emerges or is the consequence of the competition between different potential responses. Therefore, inhibitory control like voluntary control more generally may be best modeled as the process by which we select the best response among all competing responses, including not responding at all. At least at the level of premotor structures, a mechanism specialized for inhibiting actions, per se, does not seem necessary for the behavioral expression of inhibiting an unwanted action.                         Saccade adaptation                                  We have also begun a new line of research involving the neural mechanisms of unconscious, non-voluntary forms of motor control and learning. Within the oculomotor system, the motor programs issued given the position of the visual target on the retina remain accurate in the face of fatigue, injury and aging. Such plasticity emerges through motor learning mechanisms that continually adapt the system to new sensorimotor transformations. We recently tested the hypothesis that saccade gains adapt to minimize error between the visual target and the saccade endpoint of every saccade we make even when the errors on sequential saccades are not directionally consistent (Srimal and Curtis 2006; Srimal et al. In Press). We utilized a state-space model that estimated the degree to which saccade gains were modified by the magnitude and direction of errors made on the previous trial. We assumed that an inverse dynamics model computes the motor command necessary to generate the desired saccade. An efference copy of the motor command is sent to a forward model, which predicts the sensory error given the current state of the system and the perturbation to the system. This error is weighted by a learning parameter to form the teaching signal that trains the inverse dynamics model to produce an updated motor command. Importantly, to show that learning did not depend on the accumulation of directionally consistent errors, we fit the model to saccades made to targets that were displaced in a random direction during the saccade, thereby inducing errors whose directions were not sequentially consistent. Saccade gains clearly adapted on a trial-by-trial basis despite that the perturbations were random, and the average amount of learning per trial was of similar magnitude as that found in a constant displacement of the target. We concluded that the oculomotor system adapts to random perturbations in motor control via a mechanism that is rapid, obligatory, and does not require conscious awareness. Moreover, these features fit well within emerging theories of motor control composed of dynamic internal models used to compute and anticipate the sensory consequences of motor actions. Currently we are conducting a series of fMRI studies that use the trial-by-trial model parameters of learning to predict BOLD signal changes in the brain.

Students are exposed to a broad range of scholarship in social psychology, and receive research training that will enable them to become independent contributors to the field. What distinguishes our program from many others is the combination of quality and breadth. With twelve core faculty and a number of affiliated faculty, our program is acclaimed for its cutting-edge research on a wide range of topics in the following areas:     Social cognition and attitudes: Person perception and social  judgment ( Jim Uleman , Yaacov  Trope , Tessa West ); relational  processes, inferences about self and other ( Susan  Andersen ); spontaneous trait inference, culture and social cognition ( Jim  Uleman ), implicit/explicit attitudes, stereotypes, and prejudice ( David  Amodio ); political ideology ( John  Jost ); Psychological distance and mental   construal ( Yaacov Trope ).  Motivation, emotion, and self-regulation: Action control  and goal pursuit ( Peter Gollwitzer );  self-regulation of thought and action ( Gabriele  Oettingen) ; self-control ( Yaacov Trope ); intrinsic and extrinsic  motivation ( Tom Tyler ); system justification  ( John Jost) , emotion and motivation  effects on regulatory processes ( David  Amodio ).  Relationships, personality, and social development: Significant  others and the self, social cognition and personality,       hopelessness/depression ( Susan  Andersen ); relationships, stress, and coping ( Pat  Shrout );       attitudes and relationship formation  ( Tessa West ).  Groups, organizations, and societies: Stereotyping and prejudice in the workplace  ( Madeline Heilman );       interracial groups   ( Tessa West ); social justice  ( Tom Tyler , John Jost ).        In addition, there is a burgeoning interest and presence in Social Neuroscience.  In this growing field, research within the Program examines: the neural mechanisms  underlying activation and control of racial bias; interactions with hormones  and health ( David Amodio ); social  effects on neural processes of fear learning ( Elizabeth  Phelps , in the C&amp;P area ). Several other faculty in the Program collaborate  on various other social neuroscience projects, and the Psychology Department  hosts a Social  Neuroscience Speaker Series . The Psychology Building houses facilities  for fMRI, EEG/ERP, TMS, eye-tracking, and other psychophysiological methods. Graduate studies in the Social  Psychology Program at NYU means being part of an unusually active research culture. We share well equipped laboratories, and we promote 'open door' relationships between professors and students. Although students typically have a primary home in one professor's laboratory, we require that students work with at least one other faculty member to promote breadth of training in a variety of methodological approaches and research issues. Our goal is to prepare students to be highly competitive in the job market for the type of career they seek, and we are proud of the steady success of our students over the past 15 years in obtaining academic positions at the best research universities as well as important teaching colleges. The NYU social program has a history of a special communal, cooperative spirit, with very high morale among the students. A core component of this community is the weekly brownbag seminar, where students and faculty share their recent findings and research plans with the rest of the group. Students can bring this forum special expertise that they obtain in NYU\u2019s programs in quantitative, neuroscience, and cognitive psychology, which supplement the core curriculum in social psychology.     Academic Requirements  A total of 72 credits are required for the PhD degree. Credits are earned through coursework, research seminars and independent study over a five year period. A minimum of 24 credits must be earned through coursework with grades of B or higher. Typically, students register for 9-12 credits (either course or research credits), with the central coursework in the first 2 years of study. The minimum number of credits a student can take in a semester is 6.  All students have a faculty advisor. This is the faculty member who is the primary research mentor for the student. All students are required to work in more than one lab during their graduate career, i.e., with at least one other faculty member in a research collaboration. Students are also encouraged to seek advice from the program coordinator about courses and degree requirements.     Course Requirements Curriculum  There is no single prescribed program for the PhD in social psychology. Each student\u2019s program is designed to fit his or her interests, needs and background. The curriculum\u2019s structure comes from a specification of certain distribution requirements that promote expertise and also breadth.  Required Distribution of Courses     The social psychology Ph.D. curriculum specifies the distribution of 8 courses. Other courses that students take are electives and should be chosen in consultation with their advisors or sponsors. These may be structured courses, reading courses or research courses.  Students are required to take one course from two of the four core areas of the program: (1) social cognition; (2) motivation and self-regulation; (3) relationships, personality and social development; and (4) organizational processes (A listing of courses is provided below.) In addition, students are required to take one additional course of their choice in any of these areas, reflecting their interests.     To ensure a broad exposure to psychology and other related fields, students are required to take one course outside of the NYU social program. This course can be in another area within the psychology department (those offered in Cognition and Perception ); in another Department, such as Economics , Sociology , Philosophy , Political Science , or Neural Science in the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences , or at the Stern School of Business (e.g., in Organizational Behavior) or the Steinhardt School of Education (e.g., in Applied Psychology ); or elsewhere (e.g. through the Inter-university Doctoral Consortium).     A fifth content course is required, and this requirement may be fulfilled by registering for a core social psychology course, or a relevant course outside of the NYU social program (such as those mentioned in the preceding paragraph.)     Students are also required to take a three-course methods and statistics sequence including Research Methods I, and the Statistics courses of Intermediate Statistics and Advanced Statistics (either ANOVA or Regression). Although not required, many students take additional statistics and methods courses such as Psychometrics, Structural Equation Modeling, Analysis of Change and Research Methods II.     Further Study After completing the required courses, each student\u2019s program is individually tailored to take maximum advantage of course offerings in areas relevant to his or her selected areas of interest. While a minimum of eight courses is required, many students take additional courses in social psychology and related fields. Some also choose to minor in another subfield of psychology, such as developmental , quantitative , or cognition and perception . Arrangements can additionally be made for students to take courses in other universities that participate in the New York City Inter-University Consortium, including Columbia , Princeton , and CUNY .         Other than through coursework, the remaining points may be earned through a combination of reading courses (G89.3305/3306), pre-dissertation research courses (G89.3303/3304), or dissertation research courses (for those who have passed their proposal hearing: G89.3301/3302). No more than 12 points may be taken in each of the last three categories. Each student\u2019s program of study must receive the approval of his/her advisor each semester.     Research Requirements Research Training  Students are expected to work actively in the laboratory group of at least one NYU social psychology faculty member during all terms in residence. Although most students have a single primary placement, all are required to work with at least one additional faculty member during the five years of their training.  Brown Bag Seminar  All members of the program are expected to participate in the weekly Brown Bag seminar. The seminar meets informally, over lunch, and is a forum for presenting current and planned research. Each student is required to present on his or her research once a year. The seminar is a key component of student training over the five years of doctoral study.     Second Year Paper  Students are required to complete a Second Year Paper consisting of a formal write-up of the primary research project from their first two years of doctoral training. When approved, this paper satisfies the requirements for the Masters Degree. Although filing the paperwork for the Masters Degree is not required, completing the Second Year Paper is a program requirement. The Second Year Paper is due at the end of the Summer of the 2nd year, as the student\u2019s 3 rd year is about to begin . This project is done in collaboration with one or more faculty members and the write up of the project is done in conjunction with the student\u2019s research advisor.  Third Year Paper Students are also required to submit a Third Year Paper, which is a theoretically motivated, integrative literature review that is guided by a coherent set of theoretical purposes or questions. It covers at least two relevant research literatures and is organized along the lines of an article in Psychological Bulletin or Personality and Social Psychology Review . The paper extends well beyond the scope of the two or three lines of research in which the student is engaged and is on a topic of the student's choosing. It can be started as soon as the student formulates and writes a proposal for the paper\u2019s content and substance (developed in conjunction with one or more faculty in the program), which is then approved by a Third Year Paper Committee in the program. The proposal is due at the end of Fall of the 3 rd Year. The proposal is a one-page single-spaced abstract that states the theoretical purposes of the work and the empirical literatures the student intends to review. The proposal will be evaluated in terms of whether or not it (a) is guided by a theoretical purpose that is coherently laid out; (b) is integrative in nature, by bringing together two or more different literatures; and (c) has scholarly merit. The Third Year Paper itself is 35-45 text pages (not including references). The completed paper is due the first week of September of the fourth year. It is independent of the Second Year Paper, although the papers can be in related domains, if desired, and they can be supervised by the same research advisor, if desired. This requirement serves the function of a comprehensive examination. The Third Year Paper Committee: (a) is appointed by the program; (b) implements this program requirement; (c) evaluates and approves or disapproves paper proposals; (c) assigns readers for each completed paper based on faculty expertise (one of whom may be the student\u2019s research advisor).      Doctoral Dissertation  In consultation with a faculty advisor, students select a dissertation topic, develop it, and prepare a dissertation proposal. The proposal should provide a rationale for the importance of the research problem or issue, provide an overview of the literature in which the contribution of the research would be situated, present the theoretical rationale, purposes, and hypotheses of the research, and provide a detailed description of the methods and analyses of the proposed dissertation studies, as well as its likely implications. The proposal must be approved by a three-member dissertation committee in a formal proposal hearing. Students are advised to start thinking about prospective dissertation topics early in the doctoral training. Students should plan to complete their dissertation proposal and defend that proposal by the end of the fourth year of study, if not earlier .    Students should bear in mind that the dissertation is expected to be a major piece of independent research by the candidate. Although interaction between the candidate and his/her dissertation committee is expected and desirable, the student takes the lead on this research and the committee serves mainly in an advisory and evaluative capacity. The dissertation should be submitted by the end of the 5 th Year. After the dissertation has been completed, it must be defended in an oral examination before the three-member dissertation committee supplemented by two additional committee members designated as readers. Students typically register for two semesters (6 points) of dissertation credit during their fifth year of doctoral study while conducting their dissertation research and writing their dissertation.     For more information about the dissertation process, see the Psychology Department\u2019s document, Dissertation and Graduation Procedures for Doctoral Students.     Teaching Requirements and Assistantships     Students are appointed to teaching assistantships for a minimum of two and a maximum of five semesters during their graduate school tenure. A teaching assistantship involves assisting a faculty member with his/her instructional activities. Teaching assistantships are a source of valuable experience in presenting ideas to others, and form an integral part of doctoral education.     Training Sequence  In their first two years, students focus on mentored research projects and coursework. Over this period they complete their eight required courses. With the exception of research methods and two statistics courses, all of which must be taken in the first two semesters, students are free to fulfill their course requirements in any order they wish, typically enrolling in three courses a semester.  During the second year, students work on the Second Year Paper, and during the third year they work on the Third Year Paper (see above)     Students spend their third, fourth and fifth years taking additional coursework, as desired, and focusing primarily on their research activities, culminating in their doctoral dissertation research.     At the end of the first semester of their third year, they also propose their Third Year Paper (an integrative literature that combines differing literatures and addresses a coherent set of theoretical questions), which is then due in final form the first week of September of the fourth year .     Students should aim to prepare and defend their dissertation proposal not later than the end of their 4 th year, and to complete their dissertation toward the end of their 5 th year.     Students are guaranteed full financial support for five years of doctoral study.     General Requirements for the Doctorate at NYU      The graduate school of Arts and Science home page provides information about transfer credits and other general requirements for the doctorate at NYU. It is expected that students will fulfill the course requirements, complete the doctoral research and defend the thesis within five years.
