In studying interaction and conflict in specific locations, he became increasingly interested in the shifting nature of colonial thinking and practices that went into these processes. This new direction led to a book on the relationship of social change and conflict to decolonization in French and British Africa as well as a comparative project begun in the late 1980s with anthropologist Ann Stoler. Cooper and Stoler organized an international conference on colonialism in 1989 and published an edited book, Tensions of Empire, in 1997. Cooper's interest in social theory led him to write a series of articles critical of some of the key concepts widely used in the social sciences and humanities\u2013identity, modernity, and globalization. These and other essays have been collected in his book Colonialism in Question; he also edited with Randall Packard a book on development and the social sciences. Meanwhile, another track was developing, this one coming out of teaching at the University of Michigan (1982-2001) and since then at NYU. Having for many years taught courses not only on Africa, but on social theory, colonialism, and other broad topics, he began to collaborate with Jane Burbank on a graduate course that sought to counter both the national and the modern bias of most historical studies, via a study of the most durable form of political organization in world history\u2013empires. After bringing this course to NYU, Cooper and Burbank put together a lecture course on empires for beginning undergraduates through the MAP program. Teaching this course in turn encouraged Cooper and Burbank to write a book on empires in world history, published in 2010. It won the World History Association prize for 2011 and is being translated into five languages. Cooper has continued to do extensive archival research, the fruits of which are going into the book he is currently completing on citizenship in France and French Africa, 1945-1960. He has been a fellow at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences (1990-91, 1995-96, 2002-03), the Wilson Center (1987), the Rockefeller Study Center in Bellagio (2006), the Institut d'Etudes Avanc\u00e9es de Nantes (2009), and the Wissenschaftskolleg in Berlin (2010-11). He has also been a visiting professor at the Ecole des Hautes Etudes en Sciences Sociales, the Ecole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure, and Universit\u00e9 de Paris VII. His work has been supported by National Endowment for the Humanities, Guggenheim, ACLS, and other fellowships. His book From Slaves to Squatters won the Herskovits Prize of the African Studies Association. He was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2001. In 2011 he presented the  annual Marc Bloch lecture at the Ecole des Hautes Etudes en Sciences Sociales and the Thomas Hodgkin Memorial Lecture at Oxford University. In 2012 he delivered the McMillan-Stewart lectures at Harvard University.

Approaches to Historical Research and Writing I, II HIST-GA 3603, 3213 4 points per term. 2013-14, 2014-15. These courses are designed to introduce students to some of the basic methodological and interpretive issues involved in historical research. Based around a core set of readings, the course covers important books and articles that explicitly deal with questions of method, as well as examples of certain methodologies or schools of historiography in action. The goal of these courses is to help the student produce a research paper that is of potentially publishable quality and to reveal that the student is capable of doing graduate level research and writing.    Africa    Literature of the Field: Africa HIST-GA 1562 4 points. 2013-14. This course introduces students to the major themes, scholarly approaches, and sources for African history.

Care is given to consider works addressing the Mediterranean Sea and Indian Ocean, as well as the Americas.    Race, Slavery and Freedom in the Atlantic World HIST-GA 2015 4 points. 2014-2015.    African-American History HIST-GA 1782 4 points. 2014-2015. Broad exposure to African American history. Begins with a historiographical introduction, describing the growth and development of the field, and moves to a major theme and period treatment ranging from ancient Africa to the civil rights movement. Provides an understanding of the field and a foundation for specialized course work and research.    Atlantic World    Literature of the Field: Atlantic World HIST-GA 2001 4 points. 2013-14. Introduces students to the major themes, scholarly approaches, and sources for Atlantic history.    Empires, States and Political Imagination HIST-GA 3390 4 points. 2013-14, 2014-15. Focuses on the comparative study of empires from the Romans to the present and on the variety of ways in which empire-states have established and constrained claims to rights, belonging, and power. The study of empire expands our debates over rights, citizenship, economic regulation, and accountability without letting them fall into a seeming gap between the nation-state and the global.    Political Cultures of Empire HIST-GA 2861 4 points. 2013-14, 2014-15. Provides the opportunity for closely advised research and writing on student- designed projects related to the history of empires. The course builds on readings and discussion in the reading course Empires, States, and Political Imagination (HIST-GA 3390). While the reading course is not a prerequisite for this research seminar, students should have some demonstrated knowledge of the history of at least one imperial setting and be in a position to formulate a research topic at the beginning of the semester. By the end of the semester, each student will have produced a major research paper based on primary sources in the format of an article to be published in an academic journal.    Atlantic History Workshop HIST-GA 3803 4 points. 2013-14, 2014-15. This yearlong course overlaps with the Atlantic History Workshop colloquium, which meets regularly in the Department of History throughout the academic year. At the colloquium, participants discuss pre-circulated works-in-progress presented by visiting scholars or members of the colloquium. Students enrolled in this course attend every meeting of the colloquium and undertake additional activities assigned by the instructor.    Trade and Empire: The British Atlantic in the Colonial Period HIST-GA 2001 4 points. 2014-15.    East Asia    The Japanese Colonial Empire HIST-GA 1996 4 points. 2014-15. The course examines the history of the Japanese colonial empire within the larger context of Euro-American empire-building and the development of international capitalism.    Problems in the History of Early Modern China HIST-GA 1919 4 points. 2014-15. This reading-intensive colloquium on early modern China is intended for those who are already familiar with the outlines of early modern Chinese history. Participants will both engage in greater depth some of the major paradigms in Chinese history c. 1550-1900 and will gain a broad knowledge of recent historiographical debates.    Medieval Europe    Literature of the Field: Middle Ages HIST-GA 2113 4 points. 2014-15. This course provides an introduction to the literature of medieval history for the period c. 1050-1400, as that literature has evolved over the last century, with a focus on changes in the methodology of medieval historiography, the approach to primary texts and the shifting interests that have characterized medieval scholarship in the modern context.    Byzantium and the West HIST-GA 1156 4 points. 2013-14. This seminar will explore the relations between the two heirs of Rome, Byzantium and Western Europe, from the initial division of the empire in the fourth century to the conquest of Constantinople by the Ottomans.    Historical Anthropology of the Middle Ages HIST-GA 1115 4 points. 2013-14, 2014-2015.    Rulers And The Ruled In Imperial Rome And The Byzantium HIST-GA.1125 2013-2014. With an astonishingly long life span, extending from Antiquity to the end of the Middle Ages in the Byzantine East, the Roman Empire left a legacy of political and legal organization that has shaped the modern world. This seminar explores, on the one hand, the representation and exercise of imperial power and, on the other, the way the emperor's subjects perceived their position within the system and experienced authority, official or not. We will investigate imperial legitimacy building, political discourse, consensus and opposition, negotiation and concessions to the powerful, local government and justice, corruption, oppression and patronage, as well as the social groupings and networks that afforded some leverage to the less powerful.    Europe    Literature of the Field: Early Modern Europe HIST-GA 1150 4 points. 2013-14, 2014-15. Surveys major literature and historiographical issues in the early modern field.    Literature of the Field: Modern Europe HIST-GA 1151 4 points. 2013-14, 2014-15. Survey of the major literature and historiographical issues in the modern European field.    European Intellectual History HIST-GA 1193 4 points. 2014-15. Interplays the specific cultural-historical context of interwar Europe (in particular France in the late Third Republic and Weimar Germany, but also to a lesser extent Austria, Italy, and early Soviet Russia) with trends of philosophical, literary, and political writing of the period. Certain themes or figures guide the choice of texts, e.g., authority, subjectivity, violence, sovereignty.    The Mediterranean in Historical Perspective HIST-GA 3901 4 points. 2014-15. This course will focus on war and civil war in the twentieth-century Mediterranean. We will compare and contrast the experiences of Spain, Greece and Italy, as well as of other countries of Southern Europe, and analyze how the legacy of civil war has contributed to shaping contemporary national identities. This course will address major methodological questions concerning how we understand war and civil war in the fields of history and social sciences. We will also discuss the peculiarity, if any, of civil wars in the Mediterranean, in relation to the wider historical context of twentieth-century Europe.    Italian Colonialism and Postcolonialism HIST-GA 2972 4 points. 2014-15. Explores Italian colonialism from the late 19th century through the end of empire. Through readings of travel literature, films, and historical works, we address the meaning of colonialism within Italian history and culture, colonial racial policies and gender identities, and the legacies of colonialism in Italy and in its former colonies.    Russian Cultural History HIST-GA 1330 4 points. 2014-15. This course looks at \"culture\" in an expansive way, examining recent scholarship on mapping, settlement, and territorial expansion, on laws and courts, on empire and religion, love and power, property and markets, gender, family, friendship, social science and art in Russia from the 17th through the 20th century. We will look at different groups in the empire's population--peasants in imperial and post-Soviet times, nobles, one empress and her advisor/lover, Muslims, various nationalities, Soviet officials, workers, and youth and at the linkages among them and to the state.    The Ottoman 17th Century HIST-GA 3503 4 points. 2013-14. The course emphasizes religious and intellectual over political developments, although the continuing importance of patronage as a cultural and political dynamic is stressed as a process linking all these domains. It also aims at highlighting varied communal and social experiences as well as inter-communal relations over imperial or state-oriented policies and programs.    The Ottoman Empire in Europe HIST-GA.1651 4 points. 2013-14.    The Politics of Language in Early Modern and Modern Italy HIST-GA 1981 4 points. 2014-15.    Modern European Cities HIST-GA 1203 4 points. 2014-15. This colloquium examines recent scholarship in European urban history. It includes cities from Barcelona to Moscow, and ranges widely over the 19th and 20th centuries, but its ultimate goal is not to \"cover\" particular cities or themes so much as to introduce major works and approaches from the previous decade. What issues are energizing European urban history? How do these issues relate to broader developments in historiography and the humanities? In what ways does urban history contribute something distinctive to these conversations?    19th Century France HIST-GA 1209 4 points. 2014-15. Explores the transformation of France from the Old Regime monarchy of the late eighteenth century to the early Third Republic of the 1870s. We will focus first on the French Revolution, its origins, dynamics and consequences. We will then study the political, social, and cultural conflicts that help explain why the French went through three more revolutions--in 1830, 1848, and 1871--before establishing a stable form of republican government. We will also devote time to social and cultural history, and especially to recent literature on working-class formation, gender relations, and the peasantry.    History of Modern Ireland HIST-GA.1416 2013-14.    Latin America and the Caribbean    Literature of the Field: Colonial Latin America HIST-GA 1200 4 points. 2012-13. Surveys major literature and historiographical issues in the colonial Latin American field.    Literature of the Field: Modern Latin America HIST-GA 1201 4 points. 2012-13.

In studying interaction and conflict in specific locations, he became increasingly interested in the shifting nature of colonial thinking and practices that went into these processes. This new direction led to a book on the relationship of social change and conflict to decolonization in French and British Africa as well as a comparative project begun in the late 1980s with anthropologist Ann Stoler. Cooper and Stoler organized an international conference on colonialism in 1989 and published an edited book, Tensions of Empire, in 1997. Cooper's interest in social theory led him to write a series of articles critical of some of the key concepts widely used in the social sciences and humanities\u2013identity, modernity, and globalization. These and other essays have been collected in his book Colonialism in Question; he also edited with Randall Packard a book on development and the social sciences. Meanwhile, another track was developing, this one coming out of teaching at the University of Michigan (1982-2001) and since then at NYU. Having for many years taught courses not only on Africa, but on social theory, colonialism, and other broad topics, he began to collaborate with Jane Burbank on a graduate course that sought to counter both the national and the modern bias of most historical studies, via a study of the most durable form of political organization in world history\u2013empires. After bringing this course to NYU, Cooper and Burbank put together a lecture course on empires for beginning undergraduates through the MAP program. Teaching this course in turn encouraged Cooper and Burbank to write a book on empires in world history, published in 2010. It won the World History Association prize for 2011 and is being translated into five languages. Cooper has continued to do extensive archival research, the fruits of which are going into the book he is currently completing on citizenship in France and French Africa, 1945-1960. He has been a fellow at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences (1990-91, 1995-96, 2002-03), the Wilson Center (1987), the Rockefeller Study Center in Bellagio (2006), the Institut d'Etudes Avanc\u00e9es de Nantes (2009), and the Wissenschaftskolleg in Berlin (2010-11). He has also been a visiting professor at the Ecole des Hautes Etudes en Sciences Sociales, the Ecole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure, and Universit\u00e9 de Paris VII. His work has been supported by National Endowment for the Humanities, Guggenheim, ACLS, and other fellowships. His book From Slaves to Squatters won the Herskovits Prize of the African Studies Association. He was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2001. In 2011 he presented the  annual Marc Bloch lecture at the Ecole des Hautes Etudes en Sciences Sociales and the Thomas Hodgkin Memorial Lecture at Oxford University. In 2012 he delivered the McMillan-Stewart lectures at Harvard University.

Russian Cultural History HIST-GA 1330 4 points. 2014-15. This course looks at \"culture\" in an expansive way, examining recent scholarship on mapping, settlement, and territorial expansion, on laws and courts, on empire and religion, love and power, property and markets, gender, family, friendship, social science and art in Russia from the 17th through the 20th century. We will look at different groups in the empire's population--peasants in imperial and post-Soviet times, nobles, one empress and her advisor/lover, Muslims, various nationalities, Soviet officials, workers, and youth and at the linkages among them and to the state.    The Ottoman 17th Century HIST-GA 3503 4 points. 2013-14.

It includes cities from Barcelona to Moscow, and ranges widely over the 19th and 20th centuries, but its ultimate goal is not to \"cover\" particular cities or themes so much as to introduce major works and approaches from the previous decade. What issues are energizing European urban history? How do these issues relate to broader developments in historiography and the humanities? In what ways does urban history contribute something distinctive to these conversations?    19th Century France HIST-GA 1209 4 points. 2014-15. Explores the transformation of France from the Old Regime monarchy of the late eighteenth century to the early Third Republic of the 1870s.
