New York University's \"school of music\" has historically been housed in the Steinhardt School. Music programs were created in The Steinhardt School in 1925, approximately 40 years before the creation of NYU's (Tisch) School of the Arts. Consequently, all degrees in music performance at NYU -- baccalaureate through doctoral -- are housed in The Steinhardt School. Steinhardt's music performance programs in voice (classical and music theatre), piano, strings, woodwinds, brass, percussion, and jazz instruments are internationally recognized. Steinhardt provides intense music performance training along with top-tier music academic courses within the context of a world-renowned university.    Additional undergraduate and/or graduate music degrees are offered in Steinhardt in Music Composition, Music Business, Music Technology, Music Education, and Music Therapy. With 1,600 music majors and some 400 music faculty, the aggregate of Steinhardt's music programs represent one of the largest \"music schools\" in the United States.    Q. What is the difference between (1) Steinhardt's Music Business and Music Technology programs and (2) Tisch's Clive Davis Department of Recorded Music?    First, for information regarding Tisch's Clive Davis Department of Recorded Music, please visit their website . Tisch's Clive Davis Department of Recorded music grants a BFA degree. By way of difference, students majoring in Steinhardt's Music Business Program or Steinhardt's Music Technology Program receive the B.M., the bachelor of music degree. Furthermore, Steinhardt Music Business and Music Technology students are required to complete an audition and to read music prior to admission to Steinhardt.    In accordance with national standards for undergraduate degrees in music, Steinhardt Music Business and Music Technology majors are required to complete 16 \"core\" courses, four each in (1) Music Theory, (2) Music History, (3) Aural Comprehension, and (4) Keyboard Harmony and Improvisation. That \"core\" curriculum of sixteen courses is not offered in Tisch.    In addition to the \"core\" curriculum, Steinhardt Music Business majors complete a substantial number of \"specialization\" courses in Music Business including internships, along with courses in The Stern School of Business and liberal arts courses in The College of Arts and Sciences. Steinhardt Music Technology majors complete the sixteen \"core\" courses along with a very substantial number of courses in music technology in our multiple music recording studios and labs, internships, and liberal arts courses in The College of Arts and Sciences.    Steinhardt Music Business and Music Technology majors are often serious performers, composers and producers, who develop those talents through private music instruction with our acclaimed faculty.    While there are longstanding master's programs in Music Business and Music Technology in The Steinhardt School, at present, only the BFA is offered in Tisch's Clive Davis Department of Recorded Music.    Q. What is the difference between a music performance major and a music education major?    Music performance majors in Steinhardt receive \"music conservatory\" training as performers in preparation for careers in music performance. They are not required to take courses in music education, do not participate in student teaching, and are not certified to teach K-12.    Music Education majors in Steinhardt are expected to be outstanding musicians. Undergraduate music education majors have a \"primary instrument\" (instrument or voice), take private lessons throughout their four years, participate in ensembles, and present senior recitals on their primary instrument, very much like music performance majors. However, in addition to intense study in music, music education majors take a substantial number of \"specialization\" courses related to music education, including mentored student teaching assignments. Upon completion of the B.M. degree, Steinhardt music education majors are able to teach K-12 in most states in the U.S. Each state has its own teacher licensing exams and guidelines, which may require completion of a masters&rsquo; degree within five years of completion of the bachelors degree.       Q. Can an undergraduate student who is not majoring in music in Steinhardt complete a music &ldquo;minor&rdquo; in Steinhardt?    Yes, non-Steinhardt music majors can complete a music minor in Steinhardt&rsquo;s Department of Music and Performing Arts. The music minor consists of eight &ldquo;core&rdquo; courses &ndash; two courses each in (1) Music Theory, (2) Music History, (3) Aural Comprehension, and (4) Keyboard Harmony and Improvisation &ndash; as well as other music academic courses and private lessons and participation in ensembles.    However, Steinhardt does not offer program-specific minors. Consequently, we do not offer a &ldquo;minor&rdquo; in music performance, music composition, music business, music technology, or music education.    For more information, please click on &ldquo;Academics&rdquo; in this web site and scroll down to the bottom to &ldquo;Music Minor.&rdquo; In addition, please feel free to contact our department&rsquo;s coordinator of the music minor, Dr. Paul Horan at pgh1@nyu.edu or 212-998-5771.       Q. Can an undergraduate student majoring in Steinhardt&rsquo;s Department of Music and Performing Arts complete a minor in another department?    Yes, we encourage our undergraduate students to explore and complete one or more minors in areas in which they develop interest. Minors are available in several departments in The Steinhardt School as well as in the College of Arts and Sciences.       Q: Can non-music majors (i.e., students not majoring in music in Steinhardt) register for private music lessons in Steinhardt?    For generations, Steinhardt Music and Performing Arts has provided non-department music majors with private music lessons. Lessons are offered in voice, guitar and most orchestral instruments in classical, jazz and music theatre styles. Students interested in registering for private music lessons may fill out the form available here .    Private music lessons lasting one full hour per week are four (4) credits and half hour lessons per week are two (2) credits. Please note that one full hour per week lessons for three (3) credits are restricted to Steinhardt Music Majors.    Private lesson teachers are assigned based on each student's skill level and assigned by the Steinhardt faculty and administration. Non-music major students with little or no music reading ability who are interested in piano, voice or guitar lessons are often required to take one semester of group piano, voice or guitar. Thereafter, private piano, voice or guitar lessons are assigned. Private lessons are available on most orchestral and jazz instruments.    However, there are some restrictions for students who are not majoring in music in Steinhardt. Due to space limitations, private lessons for non-Steinhardt music majors are not available on harp or drum set (rock and jazz). In addition, private instruction in classical percussion requires an audition with Professor Jonathan Haas, Director of Classical Percussion Studies, and if accepted, participation in percussion, orchestral and/or wind ensembles is required of students taking private classical percussion lessons.    Q: Can non-music majors (i.e., students not majoring in music in Steinhardt) register for music ensembles in Steinhardt?    Steinhardt Music and Performing Arts allows non-department music majors to register for department-based ensembles. Department ensembles include several choirs, close to thirty jazz ensembles (trio to nonet), two 18 piece jazz big bands, dozens of classical strings, woodwind, and brass ensembles, as well as The NYU Symphony Orchestra, Repertory Orchestra, and Community Orchestra. An audition is required for registration and participation in Steinhardt ensembles. Auditions are given at the beginning of the semester, particularly in early September.

Home > Undergraduate Program     Undergraduate Program Undergraduate students in the department study, create, and perform music in an environment that combines the benefits of a well-rounded liberal arts education with the resources of a major research university.      Resources    Our students have a wealth of resources available for their research, performance, and creative work. The Shorin Music Performance Center offers a large number of rehearsal and practice rooms and the Department has its own intimate, loft-likeperformance space that serves as a recording studio and as a venue for recitals and concerts. Two cutting-edge technology labs - The Washington Square Computer Music Studio and the Media Lab - provide digital resources for composition and research. Professional sound recording and video equipment is available for check-out. The Department hosts the Washington Square Contemporary Music Society , the Collegium Musicum, and the Washington Square Harp and Shamrock Orchestra , the only Irish music ensemble in any university in the U.S. Our students can also join ensembles sponsored by the Steinhardt School of Education , such as the NYU Symphony Orchestra. The Department's greatest asset, however, is its location in the heart of New York City, one of the world's great cultural centers. Many of our courses are structured around live performances at venues ranging from the city's  top concert halls to its most obscure performance spaces. We also encourage students to take advantage of our location by pursuing internships with NYC-based recording companies, music magazines, or major performing arts organizations.      The Undergraduate Program    Students pursuing a major or minor in music gain proficiency in theory, history, criticism, and interpretation of music traditions throughout the world. At the same time, our students develop skills in analysis, critical thinking, composition, and writing that are valuable across disciplines. As a result, the major and minor in music constitute excellent preparation for graduate study in music and related fields in the Arts, Humanities, and Social Sciences; for careers in music, media, and culture industries; or for any occupation demanding clear and original thinking, command of the written word, analytical skills, and creativity.    In addition to a curriculum designed for majors and minors, we offer a wide range of innovative courses - in historical musicology, ethnomusicology, popular music, music theory, composition, historical performance, jazz, and the emerging field of sound studies - that are addressed to the general student. Recent and upcoming undergraduate courses include:               Harmony and Counterpoint (4 semesters) History of European Music (4 semesters)    Popular Music in Latin/o American and the Caribbean Music, War and Memory Twelve Masterworks of 20th century Music    Principles of Composition: Electroacoustic Music    Advanced Seminar in Jazz Studies    Introduction to Celtic Music    The Art of Listening: From Bach to Bjork on the Streets of New York    Global Hip Hop and the Politics of Culture    Musical 'Complexities'/Theoretical Perplexity    Anthropology of Improvisation    Alternate Canons: The Black Rock Coalition    Native American Music and Poetics    Spectral Music: A Chord or and Attitude?

Q. Can an undergraduate student who is not majoring in music in Steinhardt complete a music &ldquo;minor&rdquo; in Steinhardt?    Yes, non-Steinhardt music majors can complete a music minor in Steinhardt&rsquo;s Department of Music and Performing Arts. The music minor consists of eight &ldquo;core&rdquo; courses &ndash; two courses each in (1) Music Theory, (2) Music History, (3) Aural Comprehension, and (4) Keyboard Harmony and Improvisation &ndash; as well as other music academic courses and private lessons and participation in ensembles.    However, Steinhardt does not offer program-specific minors. Consequently, we do not offer a &ldquo;minor&rdquo; in music performance, music composition, music business, music technology, or music education.    For more information, please click on &ldquo;Academics&rdquo; in this web site and scroll down to the bottom to &ldquo;Music Minor.&rdquo; In addition, please feel free to contact our department&rsquo;s coordinator of the music minor, Dr. Paul Horan at pgh1@nyu.edu or 212-998-5771.       Q. Can an undergraduate student majoring in Steinhardt&rsquo;s Department of Music and Performing Arts complete a minor in another department?    Yes, we encourage our undergraduate students to explore and complete one or more minors in areas in which they develop interest. Minors are available in several departments in The Steinhardt School as well as in the College of Arts and Sciences.       Q: Can non-music majors (i.e., students not majoring in music in Steinhardt) register for private music lessons in Steinhardt?    For generations, Steinhardt Music and Performing Arts has provided non-department music majors with private music lessons. Lessons are offered in voice, guitar and most orchestral instruments in classical, jazz and music theatre styles. Students interested in registering for private music lessons may fill out the form available here .    Private music lessons lasting one full hour per week are four (4) credits and half hour lessons per week are two (2) credits. Please note that one full hour per week lessons for three (3) credits are restricted to Steinhardt Music Majors.    Private lesson teachers are assigned based on each student's skill level and assigned by the Steinhardt faculty and administration. Non-music major students with little or no music reading ability who are interested in piano, voice or guitar lessons are often required to take one semester of group piano, voice or guitar. Thereafter, private piano, voice or guitar lessons are assigned. Private lessons are available on most orchestral and jazz instruments.    However, there are some restrictions for students who are not majoring in music in Steinhardt. Due to space limitations, private lessons for non-Steinhardt music majors are not available on harp or drum set (rock and jazz). In addition, private instruction in classical percussion requires an audition with Professor Jonathan Haas, Director of Classical Percussion Studies, and if accepted, participation in percussion, orchestral and/or wind ensembles is required of students taking private classical percussion lessons.    Q: Can non-music majors (i.e., students not majoring in music in Steinhardt) register for music ensembles in Steinhardt?    Steinhardt Music and Performing Arts allows non-department music majors to register for department-based ensembles. Department ensembles include several choirs, close to thirty jazz ensembles (trio to nonet), two 18 piece jazz big bands, dozens of classical strings, woodwind, and brass ensembles, as well as The NYU Symphony Orchestra, Repertory Orchestra, and Community Orchestra. An audition is required for registration and participation in Steinhardt ensembles. Auditions are given at the beginning of the semester, particularly in early September. Please click on &ldquo;Auditions&rdquo; in this web site and then click on &ldquo;Current Students&rdquo; and follow instructions.

Home > Undergraduate Program     Undergraduate Program Undergraduate students in the department study, create, and perform music in an environment that combines the benefits of a well-rounded liberal arts education with the resources of a major research university.      Resources    Our students have a wealth of resources available for their research, performance, and creative work. The Shorin Music Performance Center offers a large number of rehearsal and practice rooms and the Department has its own intimate, loft-likeperformance space that serves as a recording studio and as a venue for recitals and concerts. Two cutting-edge technology labs - The Washington Square Computer Music Studio and the Media Lab - provide digital resources for composition and research. Professional sound recording and video equipment is available for check-out. The Department hosts the Washington Square Contemporary Music Society , the Collegium Musicum, and the Washington Square Harp and Shamrock Orchestra , the only Irish music ensemble in any university in the U.S. Our students can also join ensembles sponsored by the Steinhardt School of Education , such as the NYU Symphony Orchestra. The Department's greatest asset, however, is its location in the heart of New York City, one of the world's great cultural centers. Many of our courses are structured around live performances at venues ranging from the city's  top concert halls to its most obscure performance spaces. We also encourage students to take advantage of our location by pursuing internships with NYC-based recording companies, music magazines, or major performing arts organizations.      The Undergraduate Program    Students pursuing a major or minor in music gain proficiency in theory, history, criticism, and interpretation of music traditions throughout the world. At the same time, our students develop skills in analysis, critical thinking, composition, and writing that are valuable across disciplines. As a result, the major and minor in music constitute excellent preparation for graduate study in music and related fields in the Arts, Humanities, and Social Sciences; for careers in music, media, and culture industries; or for any occupation demanding clear and original thinking, command of the written word, analytical skills, and creativity.    In addition to a curriculum designed for majors and minors, we offer a wide range of innovative courses - in historical musicology, ethnomusicology, popular music, music theory, composition, historical performance, jazz, and the emerging field of sound studies - that are addressed to the general student. Recent and upcoming undergraduate courses include:               Harmony and Counterpoint (4 semesters) History of European Music (4 semesters)    Popular Music in Latin/o American and the Caribbean Music, War and Memory Twelve Masterworks of 20th century Music    Principles of Composition: Electroacoustic Music    Advanced Seminar in Jazz Studies    Introduction to Celtic Music    The Art of Listening: From Bach to Bjork on the Streets of New York    Global Hip Hop and the Politics of Culture    Musical 'Complexities'/Theoretical Perplexity    Anthropology of Improvisation    Alternate Canons: The Black Rock Coalition    Native American Music and Poetics    Spectral Music: A Chord or and Attitude?
