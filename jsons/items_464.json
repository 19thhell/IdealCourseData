The Center for Multicultural Education and Programs offers various programs and initiatives related to diversity and social justice. These efforts are designed so students have creative and interesting opportunities to explore race, religion, socio-economic class, gender, sexual orientation, ethnicity, national origin and other aspects of social identity. Programs are open to all NYU students.            Members of the NYU community connect with each other and to the happenings and programs put on by the Center and other organizations around campus and in the city with the Center's weekly E-newsletter. From The Center Orientation to the annual Nia Awards Ceremony, students are provided a plethora of year-round opportunities to connect with the campus community. In addition to open houses and receptions, the Center offers activities throughout the year that allow students to engage one another in informal settings. Navigate the Center for Multicultural Education and Program's website or contact its office for more information.
