As we write our own texts, we will engage with theorists/writers and discover how they have interrogated themselves and their works. The modality of our project will be writerly self-reflection: discoursing with ourselves while writing, reading ourselves in our own texts, and engaging with a work-in-progress by means of a conversation with it. Readings may include works by Barthes, Blanchot, Derrida, Heidegger, and Deleuze and Guattari.

As we write our own texts, we will engage with theorists/writers and discover how they have interrogated themselves and their works. The modality of our project will be writerly self-reflection: discoursing with ourselves while writing, reading ourselves in our own texts, and engaging with a work-in-progress by means of a conversation with it. Readings may include works by Barthes, Blanchot, Derrida, Heidegger, and Deleuze and Guattari.

As we write our own texts, we will engage with theorists/writers and discover how they have interrogated themselves and their works. The modality of our project will be writerly self-reflection: discoursing with ourselves while writing, reading ourselves in our own texts, and engaging with a work-in-progress by means of a conversation with it. Readings may include works by Barthes, Blanchot, Derrida, Heidegger, and Deleuze and Guattari.
