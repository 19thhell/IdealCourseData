It also prepares financial analysts and investors with a general understanding of the valuation content and limitations of financial statement information. Starting with a review of financial data in a company's annual report and accounting statements, participants will gain a well-rounded understanding of how basic accounting information may be used in communicating with financial managers, as well as to assess a firm's future prospects and value. The remaining time will be spent covering finance principles relevant to leaders whose primary job responsibilities are outside of the finance function with implications for project decisions, corporate structure and performance measurement. This will involve examining how project choice maps to various financial metrics and highlighting common pitfalls in this process, such as recent psychological biases described in the field of Behavioral Finance.    The format of this three-day program includes a combination of: lecture on basic but important finance and accounting principles; interactive discussion of actual financial statements and policy decisions in a range of situations including the current financial environment; and group analysis of cases involving relevant, real world financial issues.    Program Benefits:  During this program participants will:      Analyze a firm's annual reports and statements to interpret the data for use in the organization and to assess a firm's future prospects and value    Learn how to communicate more effectively with finance colleagues    Develop an understanding of the foundational elements of finance, including valuation metrics for project choice, and the driving forces behind corporate finance decisions and results - namely incentives, information, and psychology    Evaluate concerns related to the acquisition/investment decisions of the organization and their funding    Practice valuation techniques of Discounted Cash Flow and NPV in the form of discussion, exercise and real case analysis    Apply the principles of accounting and finance to shed light on various business events - ranging from the general aspects and implications of financial crises and trends to participant-specific issues such as performance measurement, compensation and project choice.

It also prepares financial analysts and investors with a general understanding of the valuation content and limitations of financial statement information. Starting with a review of financial data in a company's annual report and accounting statements, participants will gain a well-rounded understanding of how basic accounting information may be used in communicating with financial managers, as well as to assess a firm's future prospects and value. The remaining time will be spent covering finance principles relevant to leaders whose primary job responsibilities are outside of the finance function with implications for project decisions, corporate structure and performance measurement. This will involve examining how project choice maps to various financial metrics and highlighting common pitfalls in this process, such as recent psychological biases described in the field of Behavioral Finance.    The format of this three-day program includes a combination of: lecture on basic but important finance and accounting principles; interactive discussion of actual financial statements and policy decisions in a range of situations including the current financial environment; and group analysis of cases involving relevant, real world financial issues.    Program Benefits:  During this program participants will:      Analyze a firm's annual reports and statements to interpret the data for use in the organization and to assess a firm's future prospects and value    Learn how to communicate more effectively with finance colleagues    Develop an understanding of the foundational elements of finance, including valuation metrics for project choice, and the driving forces behind corporate finance decisions and results - namely incentives, information, and psychology    Evaluate concerns related to the acquisition/investment decisions of the organization and their funding    Practice valuation techniques of Discounted Cash Flow and NPV in the form of discussion, exercise and real case analysis    Apply the principles of accounting and finance to shed light on various business events - ranging from the general aspects and implications of financial crises and trends to participant-specific issues such as performance measurement, compensation and project choice.
