These core values and beliefs are as follows: We value both disciplinary-based and interdisciplinary training and research. We value interdisciplinary curiosity about organizations and willingness to learn about and contribute to areas of management outside one&rsquo;s core area of expertise. We value, and seek to create, a culture of respect for different perspectives and opinions. We believe that managers can and do affect the strategic direction of firms and we are interested in a better understanding of issues related to strategic management. We believe it is important to consider the role of the organizational context in affecting behavior in, of, and among organizations. We share an interest in understanding the dynamics of organizational processes.
