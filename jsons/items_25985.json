The journal offers a platform for scholars, artists, educators, therapists, administrators and community workers in the arts to engage in evaluative, analytical, and reflective dialogues concerning diverse topics in the field. According to Dr. Taylor, &ldquo; ArtsPraxis [was] a deliberate title choice highlighting the critical orientation of the publication to stimulate good and collegial debate across the artforms.&rdquo; I hope the articles in this issue will inspire further conversations among readers, across disciplines, with the authors, and out in the field, as the terms ethnotheatre, ethnodrama, and theatre for social justice continue to evolve. In line with the Call for Papers, the umbrella definitions we are working from in this issue are intentionally broad to encourage a dialogue regarding the many diverse practices that fall under these categories. Ethnotheatre references applied theatre presentations powered by authentic human stories. Theatre for Social Justice aims to elevate discourse on diversity and inclusion. The 2006 NYU Forum on Ethnotheatre and Theatre for Social Justice was a lively exploration of how theatre contributes to culture and politics.  Key questions the Forum asked participants to consider  What is theatre for social justice and what contribution does ethnotheatre  make to social discourse?  How can ethnotheatre operate as a qualitative research method?  Is there an ethnotheatre aesthetic?  Who are the beneficiaries of theatre for social justice and ethnotheatre?  How is Theatre for Social Justice, in its diverse manifestations, reflected  in our arts education research practices?  What are some of the ethical issues involved when we use theatre as a  tool in qualitative research?  The four authors contributing to this issue of ArtsPraxis consider these topics and offer their own perspectives. In the true spirit of this journal, each of the authors invites further dialogue regarding their article and the issue as a whole through email communication. You will find the authors&rsquo; emails in the biographical profiles provided at the beginning of each article.  Johnny Salda&ntilde;a - Reflections on an Ethnotheatre Aesthetic  To begin the conversation, Salda&ntilde;a invites us to consider his five assertions regarding an emerging ethnotheatre aesthetic that weave together the authentic, artistic, and academic elements of the art form. Careful to own all of his definitions and assertions, Salda&ntilde;a has emerged as one of the leading scholarly and artistic pundits on the topic. I use this term in its most reverent form, taken from the Sanskrit origins to mean wise man or learned teacher. This status becomes even more apparent as we read all of the subsequent authors in this journal issue referencing his writing on the subject in their articles. Salda&ntilde;a recognizes the evolutionary nature of the genre and reminds us that the field will continue to change in the future. With deep humility he reminds us that these are his musings on the topic and his personal goal as an artist is to develop an ethnotheatre aesthetic that captures on stage a complex rendering of ethnotainment. Read Johnny Salda&ntilde;a&#39;s Reflections on an Ethnotheatre Aesthetic  Nancy Putnam Smithner - The Women&rsquo;s Project: A Director&rsquo;s Perspective on Creating a Performance Collage  If some moments in life are truly worth living, then Smithner reveals in her article that certain events are certainly worth reliving, and indeed even worth sharing with an audience. She describes the journey of fifteen women, including herself as director and curator of the project, in creating a unique, insightful and compelling performance collage about the human condition. Smithner reminds us of the intersection fed by ethnotheatrical practices; &ldquo;[m]erging text (autoethnographic narrative) and the body (the performative aspect), the act of performance allows researchers to &lsquo;re-inhabit&rsquo; their bodies as they build knowledge.&rdquo;  As an audience member who witnessed this performance at The NYU Forum  on Ethnotheatre and Theatre for Social Justice, I was struck by the grace  with which the women on stage performed their autoethnographies, spoken word  poetry, rants, and monologues, and I marveled at the adept use of physical  movement and characterization that wove the fabric of their lives and cultures  together. Smithner and the other women illustrated how ethnodrama expands  our field of possibilities both as an art form and as research. Through this  project, each of these women took on the role of autoethnographic researcher  and wrote her narrative; the director had the opportunity, I might even say  the responsibility, to hold a mirror up at various angles and reflect the  lives of these performer/researchers onstage. Finally, as performers, these  women embodied some of the most tender, frustrating, painful, and vivid memories  of their lives. Through her article, Smithner invites us to sit in the front  row and peer into the context and process through which this performance  collage was developed and complements this approach with a theoretical discussion  of the feminist and post-colonial lenses she employed as a director/co-researcher  in this project. Read Nancy Putnam Smithner&#39;s The Women&rsquo;s Project: A Director&rsquo;s Perspective on Creating a Performance Collage  George Belliveau &amp; Vincent White - Performer and Audience Responses to Ethnotheatre: Exploring Conflict and Social Justice  Belliveau &amp; White manifest the true potential and mission of ArtsPraxis through engaging in a dialogue with one another regarding the methodological and ethical issues involved when employing ethnotheatre as a performance and research genre. They further extend the discussion by highlighting the responses and feedback of participants and audience members of certain ethnotheatrical events to critically examine the efficacy and potential of ethnotheatre. These authors raise fascinating points for us to consider as practitioners and audience members of ethnotheatre, and they too highlight the evolutionary nature of these practices. I am reminded of the talking books the late Paulo Freire engaged in with critical educators such as Ira Shor, Donaldo Macedo, and the late Myles Horton, among others. These two authors speak to one another, question each other, and reflect back to the other their impressions of the art form as both a performative act and applied research. Belliveau White&rsquo;s contribution to the examination of ethnotheatre frames it as a theatre of the people, one through which they, as researchers, give careful consideration to the purpose, nature and ethical implications of the dramatic engagement. They are always conscious throughout the research and artistic processes of who the intended audience is for the work. As authors, they recognize that although they engage in an academic form of playwriting through this article, their piece is not meant for performance. However, they do set the stage for us to further the dialogue about ethnotheatre and theatre for social justice.  Read George Belliveau &amp; Vincent White&#39;s Performer and Audience Responses to Ethnotheatre: Exploring Conflict and Social Justice  My final reflections as Guest Editor One of the greatest pleasures I have taken in editing this second issue of ArtsPraxis is the ability to celebrate such diverse voices from the field. The authors published here represent multiple identities in terms of gender, race, ethnicity, country of origin (out of respect for our Canadian colleagues, I have honoured the original spelling forms throughout this issue), and scholarly and artistic disciplines. This issue brings together voices who have decades of theatre experience and are new to the field of arts-based research, and educational researchers who are just getting their feet wet in terms of theatrical practices. We welcome any and all discussions and inquiries about the articles and projects published in this issue of ArtsPraxis and look forward to furthering the conversation with all of you.  &lt;&lt; Back to ArtsPraxis, Issue 2                   Department of Music and Performing Arts Professions - 35 W. 4th Street, Suite 1077 -  New York, NY 10012 -  212 998 5424    This site, and all its contents, are Copyright &copy;    by New York University.

ArtsPraxis, Issue 2  ArtsPraxis, Issue 1 (PDF Only)  ARTSPRAXIS responds to the call for a rich dialogue between all those committed to the arts in educational and community contexts. The journal will include contributions from arts educators, therapists, arts agencies, arts administrators, funding bodies, arts scholars, and community artists from diverse settings. The journal emphasizes critical analysis of the arts in society. ARTSPRAXIS provides a platform for contributors to interrogate why the arts matter and how the arts can be persuasively argued for in a range of domains. The pressing issues which face the arts in society will be deconstructed. Contributors are encouraged to write in a friendly and accessible manner appropriate to a wide readership. Nonetheless, contributions should be informed and scholarly, and must demonstrate the author&rsquo;s knowledge of the material being discussed. Clear compelling arguments are preferred, arguments which are logically and comprehensively supported by the appropriate literature. Authors are encouraged to articulate how their research design best fits the question (s) being examined. Research design includes the full range of quantitative-qualitative methods, including arts-based inquiry; case study, narrative and ethnography; historical and autobiographical; experimental and quasi-experimental analysis; survey and correlation research. Articles which push the boundaries of research design and those which encourage innovative methods of presenting findings are encouraged. Contributions which seek dialogue across the artforms are welcomed. The genesis of has been informed by the results of a literature search which identified over 60 journals in the arts disciplines but few which facilitated dialogue across and between the arts disciplines. The publication of ARTSPRAXIS follows the successful NYU Forum on Assessment in Arts Education in August 2003, which brought together over 130 participants committed to discourse among arts educators. Evaluations of the Forum indicated that this event was a significant one for strengthening the arts in challenging and uncertain times. ARTSPRAXIS enables that discourse to continue. The first issues of the journal publish the leading articles from the NYU Forum.

Contemporary art provides an opportunity to reflect on contemporary society and the issues relevant to ourselves, and the world around us. Contemporary artists work in a globally influenced, culturally diverse, and technologically advancing world. Their art is a dynamic combination of materials, methods, concepts, and subjects that challenge traditional boundaries and defy easy definition. Diverse and eclectic, contemporary art as a whole is distinguished by the very lack of a uniform, organizing principle, ideology, or &lsquo;ism.&rsquo; Contemporary art is part of a cultural dialogue that concerns larger contextual frameworks such as personal and cultural identity, family, community, and nationality.    Critical Pedagogy    Critical pedagogy is a term that applies to a number of educational perspectives that address the issue of power in teaching and learning. Important contributors to these perspectives include Paulo Freire, bell hooks, and Henry Giroux. Critical pedagogy is best understood not as a single theory, but as a range of possible educational responses to social structures and relations that are unequal or oppressive. The &ldquo;critical&rdquo; in critical pedagogy refers to the ability to analyze, expose and challenge the hidden social, cultural and political processes that are a part of knowledge production, including how one&rsquo;s own views and assumptions come from a particular cultural and historical formation. Critical pedagogy encourages educators to not only be aware of injustices but to take action to transform the practices and structures that perpetuate them. Ultimately, critical pedagogy seeks to provide education that is democratic, emancipatory, and empowering to students.    Critical Theory    Critical theory for us describes an interdisciplinary field of study. It provides a way of understanding institutions, such as the art world and education, in terms of the ideas and knowledge they produce and reproduce in our society, which is characterized by the unequal distribution of power. It involves looking at the ideas that shape cultural practices such as visual art, media, advertising and entertainment. Additionally, critical theory enables the examination of particular facets of these practices, such as the nature of representation, artistic authority and voice.    Pedagogy    Pedagogy is the whole art of teaching. Our program looks at the ways in which pedagogy can include making decisions about curriculum, how and in whose interest knowledge is produced and passed on, and what instructional methods best serve both the educator&rsquo;s teaching philosophy and the needs of diverse student populations.    Praxis    Praxis is practice, or action, with the thoughtfulness of reflection. Praxis as an idea emerged from the work of Brazilian educator Paulo Freire, who described it as &ldquo;reflection and action upon the world in order to transform it.&rdquo; (1990, Pedagogy of the Oppressed, p.36). It embodies our belief that theory and practice are not binary opposites, but rather complements that work together to further one&rsquo;s lifelong growth as an artist-educator.    Social Activism    Social activism addresses social, political, cultural, and economic inequities by organizing and connecting individuals with a community-based movement in order to enact social change. While social services address the needs of individuals, social action looks more at the root causes of injustice and tries to find ways to organize communities in an effort to eliminate or overcome those injustices.

The journal offers a platform for scholars, artists, educators, therapists, administrators and community workers in the arts to engage in evaluative, analytical, and reflective dialogues concerning diverse topics in the field. According to Dr. Taylor, &ldquo; ArtsPraxis [was] a deliberate title choice highlighting the critical orientation of the publication to stimulate good and collegial debate across the artforms.&rdquo; I hope the articles in this issue will inspire further conversations among readers, across disciplines, with the authors, and out in the field, as the terms ethnotheatre, ethnodrama, and theatre for social justice continue to evolve. In line with the Call for Papers, the umbrella definitions we are working from in this issue are intentionally broad to encourage a dialogue regarding the many diverse practices that fall under these categories. Ethnotheatre references applied theatre presentations powered by authentic human stories. Theatre for Social Justice aims to elevate discourse on diversity and inclusion. The 2006 NYU Forum on Ethnotheatre and Theatre for Social Justice was a lively exploration of how theatre contributes to culture and politics.  Key questions the Forum asked participants to consider  What is theatre for social justice and what contribution does ethnotheatre  make to social discourse?  How can ethnotheatre operate as a qualitative research method?  Is there an ethnotheatre aesthetic?  Who are the beneficiaries of theatre for social justice and ethnotheatre?  How is Theatre for Social Justice, in its diverse manifestations, reflected  in our arts education research practices?  What are some of the ethical issues involved when we use theatre as a  tool in qualitative research?  The four authors contributing to this issue of ArtsPraxis consider these topics and offer their own perspectives. In the true spirit of this journal, each of the authors invites further dialogue regarding their article and the issue as a whole through email communication. You will find the authors&rsquo; emails in the biographical profiles provided at the beginning of each article.  Johnny Salda&ntilde;a - Reflections on an Ethnotheatre Aesthetic  To begin the conversation, Salda&ntilde;a invites us to consider his five assertions regarding an emerging ethnotheatre aesthetic that weave together the authentic, artistic, and academic elements of the art form. Careful to own all of his definitions and assertions, Salda&ntilde;a has emerged as one of the leading scholarly and artistic pundits on the topic. I use this term in its most reverent form, taken from the Sanskrit origins to mean wise man or learned teacher. This status becomes even more apparent as we read all of the subsequent authors in this journal issue referencing his writing on the subject in their articles. Salda&ntilde;a recognizes the evolutionary nature of the genre and reminds us that the field will continue to change in the future. With deep humility he reminds us that these are his musings on the topic and his personal goal as an artist is to develop an ethnotheatre aesthetic that captures on stage a complex rendering of ethnotainment. Read Johnny Salda&ntilde;a&#39;s Reflections on an Ethnotheatre Aesthetic  Nancy Putnam Smithner - The Women&rsquo;s Project: A Director&rsquo;s Perspective on Creating a Performance Collage  If some moments in life are truly worth living, then Smithner reveals in her article that certain events are certainly worth reliving, and indeed even worth sharing with an audience. She describes the journey of fifteen women, including herself as director and curator of the project, in creating a unique, insightful and compelling performance collage about the human condition. Smithner reminds us of the intersection fed by ethnotheatrical practices; &ldquo;[m]erging text (autoethnographic narrative) and the body (the performative aspect), the act of performance allows researchers to &lsquo;re-inhabit&rsquo; their bodies as they build knowledge.&rdquo;  As an audience member who witnessed this performance at The NYU Forum  on Ethnotheatre and Theatre for Social Justice, I was struck by the grace  with which the women on stage performed their autoethnographies, spoken word  poetry, rants, and monologues, and I marveled at the adept use of physical  movement and characterization that wove the fabric of their lives and cultures  together. Smithner and the other women illustrated how ethnodrama expands  our field of possibilities both as an art form and as research. Through this  project, each of these women took on the role of autoethnographic researcher  and wrote her narrative; the director had the opportunity, I might even say  the responsibility, to hold a mirror up at various angles and reflect the  lives of these performer/researchers onstage. Finally, as performers, these  women embodied some of the most tender, frustrating, painful, and vivid memories  of their lives. Through her article, Smithner invites us to sit in the front  row and peer into the context and process through which this performance  collage was developed and complements this approach with a theoretical discussion  of the feminist and post-colonial lenses she employed as a director/co-researcher  in this project. Read Nancy Putnam Smithner&#39;s The Women&rsquo;s Project: A Director&rsquo;s Perspective on Creating a Performance Collage  George Belliveau &amp; Vincent White - Performer and Audience Responses to Ethnotheatre: Exploring Conflict and Social Justice  Belliveau &amp; White manifest the true potential and mission of ArtsPraxis through engaging in a dialogue with one another regarding the methodological and ethical issues involved when employing ethnotheatre as a performance and research genre. They further extend the discussion by highlighting the responses and feedback of participants and audience members of certain ethnotheatrical events to critically examine the efficacy and potential of ethnotheatre. These authors raise fascinating points for us to consider as practitioners and audience members of ethnotheatre, and they too highlight the evolutionary nature of these practices. I am reminded of the talking books the late Paulo Freire engaged in with critical educators such as Ira Shor, Donaldo Macedo, and the late Myles Horton, among others. These two authors speak to one another, question each other, and reflect back to the other their impressions of the art form as both a performative act and applied research. Belliveau White&rsquo;s contribution to the examination of ethnotheatre frames it as a theatre of the people, one through which they, as researchers, give careful consideration to the purpose, nature and ethical implications of the dramatic engagement. They are always conscious throughout the research and artistic processes of who the intended audience is for the work. As authors, they recognize that although they engage in an academic form of playwriting through this article, their piece is not meant for performance. However, they do set the stage for us to further the dialogue about ethnotheatre and theatre for social justice.  Read George Belliveau &amp; Vincent White&#39;s Performer and Audience Responses to Ethnotheatre: Exploring Conflict and Social Justice  My final reflections as Guest Editor One of the greatest pleasures I have taken in editing this second issue of ArtsPraxis is the ability to celebrate such diverse voices from the field. The authors published here represent multiple identities in terms of gender, race, ethnicity, country of origin (out of respect for our Canadian colleagues, I have honoured the original spelling forms throughout this issue), and scholarly and artistic disciplines. This issue brings together voices who have decades of theatre experience and are new to the field of arts-based research, and educational researchers who are just getting their feet wet in terms of theatrical practices. We welcome any and all discussions and inquiries about the articles and projects published in this issue of ArtsPraxis and look forward to furthering the conversation with all of you.  &lt;&lt; Back to ArtsPraxis, Issue 2                   Department of Music and Performing Arts Professions - 35 W. 4th Street, Suite 1077 -  New York, NY 10012 -  212 998 5424    This site, and all its contents, are Copyright &copy;    by New York University.

ArtsPraxis, Issue 2  ArtsPraxis, Issue 1 (PDF Only)  ARTSPRAXIS responds to the call for a rich dialogue between all those committed to the arts in educational and community contexts. The journal will include contributions from arts educators, therapists, arts agencies, arts administrators, funding bodies, arts scholars, and community artists from diverse settings. The journal emphasizes critical analysis of the arts in society. ARTSPRAXIS provides a platform for contributors to interrogate why the arts matter and how the arts can be persuasively argued for in a range of domains. The pressing issues which face the arts in society will be deconstructed. Contributors are encouraged to write in a friendly and accessible manner appropriate to a wide readership. Nonetheless, contributions should be informed and scholarly, and must demonstrate the author&rsquo;s knowledge of the material being discussed. Clear compelling arguments are preferred, arguments which are logically and comprehensively supported by the appropriate literature. Authors are encouraged to articulate how their research design best fits the question (s) being examined. Research design includes the full range of quantitative-qualitative methods, including arts-based inquiry; case study, narrative and ethnography; historical and autobiographical; experimental and quasi-experimental analysis; survey and correlation research. Articles which push the boundaries of research design and those which encourage innovative methods of presenting findings are encouraged. Contributions which seek dialogue across the artforms are welcomed. The genesis of has been informed by the results of a literature search which identified over 60 journals in the arts disciplines but few which facilitated dialogue across and between the arts disciplines. The publication of ARTSPRAXIS follows the successful NYU Forum on Assessment in Arts Education in August 2003, which brought together over 130 participants committed to discourse among arts educators. Evaluations of the Forum indicated that this event was a significant one for strengthening the arts in challenging and uncertain times. ARTSPRAXIS enables that discourse to continue. The first issues of the journal publish the leading articles from the NYU Forum.

Contemporary art provides an opportunity to reflect on contemporary society and the issues relevant to ourselves, and the world around us. Contemporary artists work in a globally influenced, culturally diverse, and technologically advancing world. Their art is a dynamic combination of materials, methods, concepts, and subjects that challenge traditional boundaries and defy easy definition. Diverse and eclectic, contemporary art as a whole is distinguished by the very lack of a uniform, organizing principle, ideology, or &lsquo;ism.&rsquo; Contemporary art is part of a cultural dialogue that concerns larger contextual frameworks such as personal and cultural identity, family, community, and nationality.    Critical Pedagogy    Critical pedagogy is a term that applies to a number of educational perspectives that address the issue of power in teaching and learning. Important contributors to these perspectives include Paulo Freire, bell hooks, and Henry Giroux. Critical pedagogy is best understood not as a single theory, but as a range of possible educational responses to social structures and relations that are unequal or oppressive. The &ldquo;critical&rdquo; in critical pedagogy refers to the ability to analyze, expose and challenge the hidden social, cultural and political processes that are a part of knowledge production, including how one&rsquo;s own views and assumptions come from a particular cultural and historical formation. Critical pedagogy encourages educators to not only be aware of injustices but to take action to transform the practices and structures that perpetuate them. Ultimately, critical pedagogy seeks to provide education that is democratic, emancipatory, and empowering to students.    Critical Theory    Critical theory for us describes an interdisciplinary field of study. It provides a way of understanding institutions, such as the art world and education, in terms of the ideas and knowledge they produce and reproduce in our society, which is characterized by the unequal distribution of power. It involves looking at the ideas that shape cultural practices such as visual art, media, advertising and entertainment. Additionally, critical theory enables the examination of particular facets of these practices, such as the nature of representation, artistic authority and voice.    Pedagogy    Pedagogy is the whole art of teaching. Our program looks at the ways in which pedagogy can include making decisions about curriculum, how and in whose interest knowledge is produced and passed on, and what instructional methods best serve both the educator&rsquo;s teaching philosophy and the needs of diverse student populations.    Praxis    Praxis is practice, or action, with the thoughtfulness of reflection. Praxis as an idea emerged from the work of Brazilian educator Paulo Freire, who described it as &ldquo;reflection and action upon the world in order to transform it.&rdquo; (1990, Pedagogy of the Oppressed, p.36). It embodies our belief that theory and practice are not binary opposites, but rather complements that work together to further one&rsquo;s lifelong growth as an artist-educator.    Social Activism    Social activism addresses social, political, cultural, and economic inequities by organizing and connecting individuals with a community-based movement in order to enact social change. While social services address the needs of individuals, social action looks more at the root causes of injustice and tries to find ways to organize communities in an effort to eliminate or overcome those injustices.
