Srivatsan; vsrivats@stern.nyu.edu ; Office: KMC 7-49    The course has three goals:    (1) Introduce the student to the academic discipline of human and economic development    (2) Focus on the role of the private sector in promoting development through social enterprise    (3) Utilize the context of India - one of the oldest, and the longest living, of human civilizations      One of the lessons that we will learn is that we cannot fully understand development without a deep understanding of a particular society's culture, values, traditions, institutions and practices. However the academic understanding of these issues is far less rigorous than those on market and government-related ones and thereby leads to many puzzles, enigmas and mysteries. In order to gain a greater insight into how these societal particularities inter-relate and interact with economic development, we shall familiarize ourselves with the culture, history and institutions of India, as well as go on excursions in and around Mumbai and Chennai. The hope is that through lectures, documentaries, discussions and excursions, students will gain a deeper understanding of human development in general, as well as economic development in the specific Indian context. Building on this conceptual understanding we will use cases to discuss how various private sector actors - for-profit and not-for-profit, small and large, start-ups and ongoing initiatives - are helping to solve some of these deep problems and are overcoming some daunting challenges. The focus of this course and especially the students' final group project is to look at how developmental issues, which were previously believed to be in the domain of the public sector alone, can be fruitfully addressed by the private sector and/or by public-private partnerships.

Program Overview                                              Course Overview                                     ECON-UB 223 Social Enterprise and Economic Development: The Indian Context, 3 credits  Professor V. Srivatsan; vsrivats@stern.nyu.edu ; Office: KMC 7-49    The course has three goals:    (1) Introduce the student to the academic discipline of human and economic development    (2) Focus on the role of the private sector in promoting development through social enterprise    (3) Utilize the context of India - one of the oldest, and the longest living, of human civilizations      One of the lessons that we will learn is that we cannot fully understand development without a deep understanding of a particular society's culture, values, traditions, institutions and practices. However the academic understanding of these issues is far less rigorous than those on market and government-related ones and thereby leads to many puzzles, enigmas and mysteries. In order to gain a greater insight into how these societal particularities inter-relate and interact with economic development, we shall familiarize ourselves with the culture, history and institutions of India, as well as go on excursions in and around Mumbai and Chennai. The hope is that through lectures, documentaries, discussions and excursions, students will gain a deeper understanding of human development in general, as well as economic development in the specific Indian context. Building on this conceptual understanding we will use cases to discuss how various private sector actors - for-profit and not-for-profit, small and large, start-ups and ongoing initiatives - are helping to solve some of these deep problems and are overcoming some daunting challenges. The focus of this course and especially the students' final group project is to look at how developmental issues, which were previously believed to be in the domain of the public sector alone, can be fruitfully addressed by the private sector and/or by public-private partnerships.
