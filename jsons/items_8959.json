Grandin shares the honor with Harvard University\u2019s Sven Beckert, who was recognized for Empire of Cotton: A Global History (Alfred A. Knopf, 2014).   \u201cWe are excited to award the Bancroft Prize to two extraordinary works, both deeply researched and offering important new interpretations of their historical subjects,\u201d said Damon E. Jaggars, Columbia\u2019s interim vice provost and University Librarian. \u201cWe congratulate Sven Beckert and Greg Grandin for their exceptional achievements.\u201d   Grandin\u2019s book centers on the Herman Melville novella, Benito Cereno . In constructing it, Melville draws from the memoirs of Captain Amasa Delano, an early-19th century New England seal hunter, who climbs aboard a distressed Spanish ship carrying West Africans he thought were slaves. He is mistaken. Having earlier seized control of the vessel and slaughtered most of the crew, they were staging an elaborate ruse, acting as if they were servants. When Delano, who opposed slavery, finally realizes the deception, he responds with explosive violence.   \u201cWith prodigious research, Grandin reconstructs the complex processes and tortuous journeys that brought New Englander Amasa Delano and his crew of seal hunters into fateful contact with a Spanish ship under the invisible control of the enslaved men and women it was supposed to be transporting,\u201d Columbia said in announcing the award. \u201cGrandin\u2019s eloquent retelling of the story, like Herman Melville\u2019s novella Benito Cereno before it, animates a thoughtful meditation on the meanings of slavery; it is also a gripping and deeply erudite demonstration of the global reaches and ramifications of the slave trade during the age of revolution.

Even casual observers of film history are aware of the Third Reich\u2019s relationship with the German film industry\u2014but what about its Axis ally Italy? How did it develop under fascism? How did it serve the interests of the regime? Few people know that many of Italian cinema's leading lights, from Federico Fellini to Roberto Rossellini to Michelangelo Antonioni, got their start in the Fascist film industry.   In the award-winning Italian Fascism\u2019s Empire Cinema , Ruth Ben-Ghiat, a professor of Italian Studies and history at NYU, offers the first in-depth examination of the feature and documentary films made by Rossellini and others about Italy\u2019s African and Balkan occupations during Mussolini\u2019s dictatorship.   At the event, Ben-Ghiat, along with Richard Pe\u00f1a, former director of the New York Film Festival and a professor at Columbia University, Joseph Luzzi of Bard College, and Stanislao Pugliese of Hofstra University will discuss the link between Mussolini\u2019s regime and the Italian film industry.   The event is free and open to the public; admission is on a first-come, first-served basis . For more information, please call 212.998.8739.

Grandin shares the honor with Harvard University\u2019s Sven Beckert, who was recognized for Empire of Cotton: A Global History (Alfred A. Knopf, 2014).   \u201cWe are excited to award the Bancroft Prize to two extraordinary works, both deeply researched and offering important new interpretations of their historical subjects,\u201d said Damon E. Jaggars, Columbia\u2019s interim vice provost and University Librarian. \u201cWe congratulate Sven Beckert and Greg Grandin for their exceptional achievements.\u201d   Grandin\u2019s book centers on the Herman Melville novella, Benito Cereno . In constructing it, Melville draws from the memoirs of Captain Amasa Delano, an early-19th century New England seal hunter, who climbs aboard a distressed Spanish ship carrying West Africans he thought were slaves. He is mistaken. Having earlier seized control of the vessel and slaughtered most of the crew, they were staging an elaborate ruse, acting as if they were servants. When Delano, who opposed slavery, finally realizes the deception, he responds with explosive violence.   \u201cWith prodigious research, Grandin reconstructs the complex processes and tortuous journeys that brought New Englander Amasa Delano and his crew of seal hunters into fateful contact with a Spanish ship under the invisible control of the enslaved men and women it was supposed to be transporting,\u201d Columbia said in announcing the award. \u201cGrandin\u2019s eloquent retelling of the story, like Herman Melville\u2019s novella Benito Cereno before it, animates a thoughtful meditation on the meanings of slavery; it is also a gripping and deeply erudite demonstration of the global reaches and ramifications of the slave trade during the age of revolution.
