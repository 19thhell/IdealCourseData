Americas Scholars participate in academic seminars and cultural activities with Gallatin faculty members.        Group Meetings and Activities   Throughout the academic year, Americas Scholars explore a particular theme through bi-weekly evening meetings. The majority of Americas Scholars activities will take place during this time, although some activities such as dinners and performances may occur at other times.   Examples of Americas Scholars activities:     Attending lectures and readings on topics related to the Americas   Visits to museums, dance performances, musical performances, and other cultural events   Independent research and collaborative group projects          International and Domestic Travel   The Americas Scholars investigate their yearly theme by traveling as a group during January to an international or domestic location. Group members prepare a project based on their explorations and share it with the Gallatin community.   Examples of past travel locations and themes:     Puerto Rico: &quot;Puerto Rico and New York: Culture and Community&quot;   Cuba: &quot;The Effects of Economic Embargo&quot;   Hawaii: &quot;Colonialism and Indigeneity&quot;   New Orleans: &quot;The Social Production of Natural Disaster&quot;   Brazil: &quot;Consumerism&quot;     Americas Scholars 2014-15   Details coming soon.
