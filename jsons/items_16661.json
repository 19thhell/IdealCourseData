The statement should be concisely written.         Length of Statement of Purpose: The GSAS online application states that the statement of purpose should be limited to two double-spaced pages, however the Psychology Department will accept a statement of purpose that does not exceed 1,000 words, regardless of page length.     Note: I/O MA program applicants must submit a supplemental case essay in addition to the statement of purpose. For instructions about the I/O supplemental essay, please see this link: http://psych.nyu.edu/programs/ma/ioadmissions.html .             Letters of Recommendation : Applicants must submit three letters of recommendation. Preferably, the letters should come from former professors at college.

Letters should not be from family friends or counselors, or from religious or political figures, unless the recommender has been in a position to personally supervise the applicant's academic or work performance.     Prerequisites:\u00a0 All applicants are required to have graduated with at least a 3.0 (B) average from a four-year, fully accredited undergraduate program. An undergraduate psychology major is not required, but all applicants must complete both an Introductory Psychology class and a basic Statistics class (behavioral statistics preferred), with grades of B or better, prior to starting the M.A. program.\u00a0 If you are in the process of taking a prerequisite, please indicate this in your statement of purpose.

The MA Program has recently instituted an MA Scholars designation for students with superior academic credentials who may enroll in certain doctoral-level courses with permission of the relevant instructor.               Application Deadlines     ONLINE APPLICATION         GSAS APPLICATION RESOURCE CENTER              General Psychology Master&rsquo;s Program:     Application Deadline for Fall and Summer: Currently Open         Application Deadline for Spring: October 1 (Applications will be accepted until October 15)              Industrial and Organizational Psychology Master\u2019s Program:     Application Deadline for Fall and Summer: January 15         Application Deadline for Spring: October 1     When an application deadline falls on a weekend, the application will close the following Monday     Financial Aid     The Department of Psychology does not offer fellowship or assistantship support to students in the Master&rsquo;s programs. Many students are granted educational loans to help fund their tuition. \u00a0For information on other ways to finance your education, please visit the Financial Aid Office&rsquo;s webpage for alternative funding sources .     Non-degree Status     To take classes in the General Psychology MA program without the intention of obtaining a Master&rsquo;s degree, students may apply to the program using the non-degree application.\u00a0 Please note that entry into the non-degree program does not guarantee entry into the degree-seeking program regardless of successful completion of MA classes.\u00a0 Students who are non-degree may take up to 12 credits.     The I/O MA program does not offer non-degree status.\u00a0 To take any I/O classes, students must be degree-seeking I/O students.     Application Instructions for non-degree students are located here: http://gsas.nyu.edu/object/grad.app.nodeg     Please note that non-degree students must only submit one letter of recommendation and the GRE/GMAT is not required. With non-degree status, a student may take a maximum of 12 points of MA-level courses before applying to the degree-seeking MA program. Non-degree students who wish to apply for admission to the MA program must satisfy any condition set by the department, including taking the GRE or GMAT. Once the student has attained degree-seeking status, s/he will receive credit for all psychology graduate courses completed as a non-degree student.     The most common reasons for applying as a non-degree student are:     1) the student is visiting from another graduate program;     2) the student wants to take a course or two before investing time in studying for the GRE.     After the MA     General Psychology : The majority of the students in the General Psychology MA Program share a motivation to improve their work status within the mental health field or wish to prepare for doctoral-level degrees, either the PhD or PsyD. The mental health field is growing and includes job opportunities in health delivery in hospitals, clinics, and community social services, as well as research possibilities within a variety of applied agencies.     Industrial and Organizational Psychology : The MA in Industrial/Organizational Psychology opens up careers in a vast array of companies that hire psychologists with an academic background in employee relations, personnel administration, and the technical skills involved in testing, job analysis, research, etc. Most of our Industrial/Organizational graduates find employment as human resources generalists (with organizations such as law firms, hotels, and publishers) or human resources specialists for large corporations (such as banks, investment houses, and accounting firms). About a third of our I/O graduates find positions with management consulting firms (e.g., the Hay Group, Andersen Consulting, Personnel Decisions).           Frequently Asked Questions          Where can I access the application?      Can you send me pamphlets or brochures about the program?      I&rsquo;m experiencing a technical difficulty in the application itself, can you help?      I didn't take Statistics for the Behavioral Sciences, but I took another statistics course. Will this satisfy the stats prerequisite?      I didn&rsquo;t take an Introductory Psychology course, but I took other psychology classes. Will this satisfy the psych prerequisite?      Can I take my prerequisites at NYU? Where else can I take them?      Can I audit a class?      I have already applied. When can I expect a decision?      Can I schedule a meeting or interview with an admissions advisor in person?      How long does it take to complete this degree?      My test scores are less than 5 years old, but they're based on the old scoring system out of 800. What scores does the I/O and/or general program consider competitive?      Can an undocumented immigrant apply to this program?       I would like to review basic statistics and/or psychology material--is there a free resource for me to do this?               Where can I access the application?      http://gsas.nyu.edu/object/grad.admissions.onlineapp      Can you send me pamphlets or brochures about the program?     We no longer create paper informational materials, but please browse our website or email David Park if you have any specific questions not answered on our website.      I&rsquo;m experiencing a technical difficulty in the application itself, can you help?     Our application is housed by Graduate Enrollment Services; please take a look at their website (they have a number of helpful FAQ pages): http://gsas.nyu.edu/page/grad.admissionsapplication.html     If you don&rsquo;t see an answer, feel free to contact them:     Graduate Enrollment Services     Phone: (212) 998-8050     Email: gsas.admissions@nyu.edu      I didn't take Statistics for the Behavioral Sciences, but I took another statistics course. Will this satisfy the stats prerequisite?     Yes, we accept alternative undergraduate-level statistics classes.      I didn&rsquo;t take an Introductory Psychology course, but I took other psychology classes. Will this satisfy the psych prerequisite?     We prefer that you took a class that covered the basics of psychology, but if you completed several more advanced psychology courses, covering a variety of areas, that would be acceptable. Reading extensively on your own is not considered an acceptable alternative to taking a formal course in General Psychology. If it has been a long time since you have taken any psychology courses, it would be a good idea to brush up with an online introductory course.          Can I take my prerequisites at NYU? Where else can I take them?   To take prerequisites at NYU, you will need to apply as a non-degree student. However, we find online courses to be an acceptable and more accessible alternative. To satisfy a prerequisite, an online course must be affiliated with a non-profit University that has a physical campus. We recommend the following courses:       University of Texas Extension:       PSY 301: Introduction to Psychology       PSY 317: Statistical Methods in Psychology         University of Colorado at Boulder Online:       PSYC 1001: General Psychology       PSYC 3101: Statistics and Research Methods in Psychology                     Can I audit a class?     Unfortunately, we can allow only officially registered students to attend our classes.\u00a0 Our M.A. classes are fairly small, and we find it too disruptive to allow visitors to attend class.\u00a0 NYU permits auditing of an entire course but only if the student pays the full price of the course (you must still apply as a non-degree student).      I have already applied. When can I expect a decision?     Please expect an admissions decision 6-8 weeks from the application deadline.\u00a0 If you are under specific time pressure to receive a decision by a particular deadline, please email David Park .      Can I schedule a meeting or interview with an admissions advisor in person?     Unfortunately due to the large volume of applicants, we are not able to meet with prospective students in person. However, we do have regular information sessions for prospective applicants to meet with our director and program coordinator. For more information on the next information session please click here: http://psych.nyu.edu/programs/ma/openhouse.html . If you do have specific questions that are not answered on the website and you&rsquo;re unable to attend an Information Session, please email David Park for answers.      How long does it take to complete this degree?     Students vary on the amount of time they take to complete the degree.\u00a0 All students have a maximum of five years to complete the degree.\u00a0 Students who are attending the program full time (9 credits per semester) can complete it in two years.     How important are my GRE scores, recommendations, undergraduate transcripts, etc.?     We take all parts of your application into consideration.\u00a0 There is no one score that would disqualify you from admission.\u00a0 However, competitive applicants will be strong in multiple areas of their application.\u00a0 It is useful to have strong GRE scores, a 3.0 or above on your undergraduate transcript, research experience, work experience, good letters of recommendation, etc.\u00a0 However, we have more qualified candidates than spots in the program and ultimately, cannot guarantee admission for any individual.       How do I check if you have received all of my application materials?     Applicants can enter their N number here to find out if we&rsquo;ve received your materials: http://www.nyu.edu/gsas/request/smts.html     Is the GRE Psychology Subject Test required?     No, we do not require the Psychology subject test.     How many international students are in the program?     Currently, 23% of our active student body is international.     I wish to apply to the Forensic or Social and Consumer Psychology program--what application do I fill out?     The Forensic specialization and Social and Consumer specialization are housed under our General Psychology Masters program. Please fill out the General Psychology Application here: http://gsas.nyu.edu/object/grad.admissions.onlineapp     Can I speak to a current student?     Please email David Park for contact information from our current student body leaders.     At what time do the applications close on the deadline?     Applications close at 5 PM EST/EDT the day of the deadline.     I am an international prospective student for whom English is not my first language. \u00a0I went to a bilingual school where I spoke English in some or all of my classes. Must I still take the TOEFL?     Please contact The Office of Global Services for questions regarding the international applicant requirements.      OGS:     Tel: (212) 998-4720     Fax: (212) 995-4115      intl.students.scholars@nyu.edu     I am an international student and my transcript does not have a GPA on a 4.0 scale and/or my Bachelor&rsquo;s program was completed in fewer than 4 years, how will I be evaluated?     Once your application is submitted, trained staff members will translate your grades into a system similar to the U.S. grading system so that our admissions committee can understand your transcript and GPA. Similarly, they will evaluate your degree and assess whether or not it is the equivalent of a U.S. Bachelor's degree. Unfortunately, the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences cannot assign a staff member to your application until it has been submitted.      My test scores are less than 5 years old, but they're based on the old scoring system out of 800. What scores does the I/O and/or general program consider competitive?     General Psychology:     Verbal: 530 or above     Quantitative: 600 or above     Writing: 4.5 or above     I/O Psychology:     Verbal: 580 or above     Quantitative: 630 or above     Writing: 4.5 or above           Can an undocumented immigrant apply to this program?     Please contact OGS, our resource for international students.     OGS:     Tel: (212) 998-4720     Fax: (212) 995-4115    intl.students.scholars@nyu.edu          I would like to review basic statistics and/or psychology material--is there a free resource for me to do this?     Although this does NOT satisfy the pre-requisites for applicants (see question 6), students can visit:\u00a0\u00a0 http://www.onlinecourses.com/ \u00a0for a free online course to review basic statistics and/or psychology. \u00a0This is especially useful if you've been out of school for some time, have already formally completed Statistics and/or Intro to Psychology with a B or better in both, but want to familiarize yourself with these areas before resuming your studies. \u00a0Students who complete the online courses at\u00a0\u00a0 http://www.onlinecourses.com/ \u00a0are not given grades. \u00a0To satisfy the pre-requisites for applying to the program, you must take the courses with a University or College \u00a0that has a physical campus (or an online course associated with a physical campus). \u00a0Please see question 6 for information on how to satisfy the pre-requisites.

Many students are granted educational loans to help fund their tuition. \u00a0For information on other ways to finance your education, please visit the Financial Aid Office&rsquo;s webpage for alternative funding sources .     Non-degree Status     To take classes in the General Psychology MA program without the intention of obtaining a Master&rsquo;s degree, students may apply to the program using the non-degree application.\u00a0 Please note that entry into the non-degree program does not guarantee entry into the degree-seeking program regardless of successful completion of MA classes.\u00a0 Students who are non-degree may take up to 12 credits.     The I/O MA program does not offer non-degree status.\u00a0 To take any I/O classes, students must be degree-seeking I/O students.     Application Instructions for non-degree students are located here: http://gsas.nyu.edu/object/grad.app.nodeg     Please note that non-degree students must only submit one letter of recommendation and the GRE/GMAT is not required. With non-degree status, a student may take a maximum of 12 points of MA-level courses before applying to the degree-seeking MA program. Non-degree students who wish to apply for admission to the MA program must satisfy any condition set by the department, including taking the GRE or GMAT. Once the student has attained degree-seeking status, s/he will receive credit for all psychology graduate courses completed as a non-degree student.     The most common reasons for applying as a non-degree student are:     1) the student is visiting from another graduate program;     2) the student wants to take a course or two before investing time in studying for the GRE.     After the MA     General Psychology : The majority of the students in the General Psychology MA Program share a motivation to improve their work status within the mental health field or wish to prepare for doctoral-level degrees, either the PhD or PsyD. The mental health field is growing and includes job opportunities in health delivery in hospitals, clinics, and community social services, as well as research possibilities within a variety of applied agencies.     Industrial and Organizational Psychology : The MA in Industrial/Organizational Psychology opens up careers in a vast array of companies that hire psychologists with an academic background in employee relations, personnel administration, and the technical skills involved in testing, job analysis, research, etc. Most of our Industrial/Organizational graduates find employment as human resources generalists (with organizations such as law firms, hotels, and publishers) or human resources specialists for large corporations (such as banks, investment houses, and accounting firms). About a third of our I/O graduates find positions with management consulting firms (e.g., the Hay Group, Andersen Consulting, Personnel Decisions).           Frequently Asked Questions          Where can I access the application?      Can you send me pamphlets or brochures about the program?      I&rsquo;m experiencing a technical difficulty in the application itself, can you help?      I didn't take Statistics for the Behavioral Sciences, but I took another statistics course. Will this satisfy the stats prerequisite?      I didn&rsquo;t take an Introductory Psychology course, but I took other psychology classes. Will this satisfy the psych prerequisite?      Can I take my prerequisites at NYU? Where else can I take them?      Can I audit a class?      I have already applied. When can I expect a decision?      Can I schedule a meeting or interview with an admissions advisor in person?      How long does it take to complete this degree?      My test scores are less than 5 years old, but they're based on the old scoring system out of 800. What scores does the I/O and/or general program consider competitive?      Can an undocumented immigrant apply to this program?       I would like to review basic statistics and/or psychology material--is there a free resource for me to do this?               Where can I access the application?      http://gsas.nyu.edu/object/grad.admissions.onlineapp      Can you send me pamphlets or brochures about the program?     We no longer create paper informational materials, but please browse our website or email David Park if you have any specific questions not answered on our website.      I&rsquo;m experiencing a technical difficulty in the application itself, can you help?     Our application is housed by Graduate Enrollment Services; please take a look at their website (they have a number of helpful FAQ pages): http://gsas.nyu.edu/page/grad.admissionsapplication.html     If you don&rsquo;t see an answer, feel free to contact them:     Graduate Enrollment Services     Phone: (212) 998-8050     Email: gsas.admissions@nyu.edu      I didn't take Statistics for the Behavioral Sciences, but I took another statistics course. Will this satisfy the stats prerequisite?     Yes, we accept alternative undergraduate-level statistics classes.      I didn&rsquo;t take an Introductory Psychology course, but I took other psychology classes. Will this satisfy the psych prerequisite?     We prefer that you took a class that covered the basics of psychology, but if you completed several more advanced psychology courses, covering a variety of areas, that would be acceptable. Reading extensively on your own is not considered an acceptable alternative to taking a formal course in General Psychology. If it has been a long time since you have taken any psychology courses, it would be a good idea to brush up with an online introductory course.          Can I take my prerequisites at NYU? Where else can I take them?   To take prerequisites at NYU, you will need to apply as a non-degree student. However, we find online courses to be an acceptable and more accessible alternative. To satisfy a prerequisite, an online course must be affiliated with a non-profit University that has a physical campus. We recommend the following courses:       University of Texas Extension:       PSY 301: Introduction to Psychology       PSY 317: Statistical Methods in Psychology         University of Colorado at Boulder Online:       PSYC 1001: General Psychology       PSYC 3101: Statistics and Research Methods in Psychology                     Can I audit a class?     Unfortunately, we can allow only officially registered students to attend our classes.\u00a0 Our M.A. classes are fairly small, and we find it too disruptive to allow visitors to attend class.\u00a0 NYU permits auditing of an entire course but only if the student pays the full price of the course (you must still apply as a non-degree student).      I have already applied. When can I expect a decision?     Please expect an admissions decision 6-8 weeks from the application deadline.\u00a0 If you are under specific time pressure to receive a decision by a particular deadline, please email David Park .      Can I schedule a meeting or interview with an admissions advisor in person?     Unfortunately due to the large volume of applicants, we are not able to meet with prospective students in person. However, we do have regular information sessions for prospective applicants to meet with our director and program coordinator. For more information on the next information session please click here: http://psych.nyu.edu/programs/ma/openhouse.html . If you do have specific questions that are not answered on the website and you&rsquo;re unable to attend an Information Session, please email David Park for answers.      How long does it take to complete this degree?     Students vary on the amount of time they take to complete the degree.\u00a0 All students have a maximum of five years to complete the degree.\u00a0 Students who are attending the program full time (9 credits per semester) can complete it in two years.     How important are my GRE scores, recommendations, undergraduate transcripts, etc.?     We take all parts of your application into consideration.\u00a0 There is no one score that would disqualify you from admission.\u00a0 However, competitive applicants will be strong in multiple areas of their application.\u00a0 It is useful to have strong GRE scores, a 3.0 or above on your undergraduate transcript, research experience, work experience, good letters of recommendation, etc.\u00a0 However, we have more qualified candidates than spots in the program and ultimately, cannot guarantee admission for any individual.       How do I check if you have received all of my application materials?     Applicants can enter their N number here to find out if we&rsquo;ve received your materials: http://www.nyu.edu/gsas/request/smts.html     Is the GRE Psychology Subject Test required?     No, we do not require the Psychology subject test.     How many international students are in the program?     Currently, 23% of our active student body is international.     I wish to apply to the Forensic or Social and Consumer Psychology program--what application do I fill out?     The Forensic specialization and Social and Consumer specialization are housed under our General Psychology Masters program. Please fill out the General Psychology Application here: http://gsas.nyu.edu/object/grad.admissions.onlineapp     Can I speak to a current student?     Please email David Park for contact information from our current student body leaders.     At what time do the applications close on the deadline?     Applications close at 5 PM EST/EDT the day of the deadline.     I am an international prospective student for whom English is not my first language. \u00a0I went to a bilingual school where I spoke English in some or all of my classes. Must I still take the TOEFL?     Please contact The Office of Global Services for questions regarding the international applicant requirements.      OGS:     Tel: (212) 998-4720     Fax: (212) 995-4115      intl.students.scholars@nyu.edu     I am an international student and my transcript does not have a GPA on a 4.0 scale and/or my Bachelor&rsquo;s program was completed in fewer than 4 years, how will I be evaluated?     Once your application is submitted, trained staff members will translate your grades into a system similar to the U.S. grading system so that our admissions committee can understand your transcript and GPA. Similarly, they will evaluate your degree and assess whether or not it is the equivalent of a U.S. Bachelor's degree. Unfortunately, the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences cannot assign a staff member to your application until it has been submitted.      My test scores are less than 5 years old, but they're based on the old scoring system out of 800. What scores does the I/O and/or general program consider competitive?     General Psychology:     Verbal: 530 or above     Quantitative: 600 or above     Writing: 4.5 or above     I/O Psychology:     Verbal: 580 or above     Quantitative: 630 or above     Writing: 4.5 or above           Can an undocumented immigrant apply to this program?

Although this does NOT satisfy the pre-requisites for applicants (see question 6), students can visit:\u00a0\u00a0 http://www.onlinecourses.com/ \u00a0for a free online course to review basic statistics and/or psychology. \u00a0This is especially useful if you've been out of school for some time, have already formally completed Statistics and/or Intro to Psychology with a B or better in both, but want to familiarize yourself with these areas before resuming your studies. \u00a0Students who complete the online courses at\u00a0\u00a0 http://www.onlinecourses.com/ \u00a0are not given grades. \u00a0To satisfy the pre-requisites for applying to the program, you must take the courses with a University or College \u00a0that has a physical campus (or an online course associated with a physical campus). \u00a0Please see question 6 for information on how to satisfy the pre-requisites.

In addition, (1) all core courses must be taken at NYU in the Psychology   Department, and (2) students must earn a grade of at least B in all   core courses.     All of the courses in the M.A. program are 3 points each, so 12 courses   must be taken. Students may take anywhere between one and three courses   each semester. The program is expected to take two years to complete   in most cases, but can be completed a little sooner for full-time students   (especially if some courses are taken during the summer session), or   somewhat later for those working full-time. A student who has completed   all course work, but must stay enrolled to take the comprehensive examination   or complete a thesis, must pay a matriculation fee each semester until   graduation. A maximum of five years from the date of first registration   is allowed for completing the degree.      Basic course requirements (all of the following are required   for all students, and must be completed within the first two semesters   of the M.A. program) :      Introductory Course: G89.2032 Intro to I/O Psychology . Only   if a student has taken a very similar, graduate-level course at another   institution can this requirement be waived.      Statistics: G89.2016 Master's Statistics. In   special cases, G89.1016 (Introductory) or a doctoral course may be   substituted.      Research  : G89.2067 Applied Research Methods. In special cases,   another research course may be substituted.      Core Course requirements (two courses must be taken from each   core):               CORE &quot;I&quot;      CORE &quot;O&quot;                G89.2070 Personnel Selection      G89.2072 Work Motivation and Attitudes                G89.2071 Performance Measurement &amp; Rewards      G89.2074 Organizational Development                G89.2073 Training in Organizations      G89.2076 Leadership and Strategic Change              The above requirements allow for five elective courses, which can   be taken from the general program (e.g., Psychology of Social Behavior;   Introduction to Psychological Testing), other divisions of NYU (e.g.,   graduate-level Economics; Stern School of Business-MBA program), or   other universities (a limit of 9 credits can be transferred from graduate   programs at other institutions). Courses taken outside of the psychology   department must have some psychological content, and be approved by   an adviser. Elective credits can also be taken in the form of non-classroom   courses, such as Fieldwork, Independent Research, and MA Thesis Seminar.   Although Fieldwork (generally, an unpaid internship in an HR department   or consulting firm) is not required, it is strongly recommended for   students who enter the program without relevant work experience.      COMPREHENSIVE EXAM / M.A. THESIS REQUIREMENT     All students must either pass the comprehensive exam, or write an acceptable M.A. thesis.      The Comprehensive Exam: This is a three-hour written test that is given three times each year: October, February, and June. The questions are integrative in nature and are randomly selected from a large study list that is available to all students at any time. Except for rare exceptions, a student must have completed all of the basic and core requirements, as outlined above, before sitting for the exam.     MA Thesis: As an alternative to the comprehensive exam, a student may seek permission to write an M.A. thesis. To be eligible to write a thesis, a student must have passed all of the basic and core requirements with at least a B+ average, and have secured the sponsorship of a full-time faculty member (in consultation with the MA director). In general, an MA thesis does not require that the student perform original or independent research, but that the student make an original contribution to the research of his/her sponsor.

Two separate degrees are available from our MA Program:          MA in General Psychology : This program has the flexibility to suit students who wish to explore several areas of psychology, as well as students who wish to shape their coursework to fit special interests and needs, including preparation for admission to a doctoral program. Several specializations are available within the General Program, but students are not required to specialize. The most common\u00a0 Specializations \u00a0are\u00a0 Forensic Psychology ,\u00a0 Social and Consumer Psychology , Clinical Psychology, Cognition/Perception, Neuroscience, Developmental Psychology, and Social Psychology.      MA in Industrial/Organizational Psychology : This program is designed to prepare graduates to apply research and principles of human behavior to a variety of organizational settings, such as human resources departments, and management consulting firms. The program can also be modified for students who are preparing for admission to doctoral programs in Industrial/Organizational and related fields.         Requirements for Admission     All applicants must submit official scores from the General Aptitude Test of the Graduate Record Examination (GRE) or the Graduate Management Admission Test (GMAT) . Please note that we do not use absolute minimum scores on the GRE or GMAT to make admissions decisions. Our decisions are based on a composite of criteria applied to all of the credentials presented in your application. However, to help applicants assess their standing on the GRE/GMAT with respect to our usual applicant pool, we offer the following guidelines.         General Psychology : Historically, competitive applicants have obtained the following scores:     GRE:     Verbal Reasoning: 158 or above     Quantitative Reasoning: 156 or above     Writing: 4.5 or above     If you took the old GRE test and your score is out of 800, please click here     GMAT:     Verbal: 32 or above     Quantitative: 40 or above     Writing section: 4.5 or above     The total GMAT score should be a 590 or above.      I/O Psychology :     Historically, competitive applicants have obtained the following scores:     GRE:     Verbal Reasoning: 158 or above     Quantitative Reasoning: 156 or above     Writing: 4.5 or above     If you took the old GRE test and your score is out of 800, please click here     GMAT:     Verbal: 36 or above     Quantitative: 43 or above     Writing section: 4.5 or above     The total GMAT score should be a 600 or above.

Please visit the Writing Sample Requirement For Application section for more information.      ONLY for   I/O  applicants applying to Summer or Fall 2014: \u00a0Applicants are now asked to submit a short (no more than 5 minutes in length) video that addresses two topics:          Present an executive summary of your approach to the\u00a0 writing sample case study . The key topics and resolution suggested should be presented as if to an organization in a business format and context.      Explain your career goals and interests as they relate to the approach presented in the writing sample case study.         Please note that the preliminary screening of applications will mainly make use of written personal statements, not videos. Therefore, your written personal statement should include a full account of your background and career goals. Videos mainly will be used to distinguish between finalists. Do not be concerned if there is substantial redundancy between your written personal statement, writing sample case study, and your video.\u00a0     See\u00a0 Adding a URL to Your Application \u00a0for more information.     For applicants who are unfamiliar with shooting video footage, we recommend that you use a point and shoot device such as a smartphone, camcorder, or webcam.\u00a0 Some tips on how to shoot and upload a video can be found here:\u00a0 http://www.wikihow.com/Do-a-YouTube-Video    Both programs :     The current application fee is $95 dollars.     TOEFL : The standards for the verbal GRE are relaxed somewhat for international students whose first language is not English.\u00a0 These applicants must also submit official scores on the TOEFL -- Test of English as a Foreign Language. Historically, competitive applicants have obtained a total score of at least 100, with none of the sub-scores below 22.\u00a0 For more information on the application process for international students please refer to our FAQs .\u00a0 Other questions should be directed to the Office of Global Services: http://www.nyu.edu/life/student-life/international-students-and-scholars.html     Statement of Purpose: Both the General MA and I/O MA program application require a statement of purpose essay. Your statement of purpose should describe past and present work as it relates to your intended field of study, educational objectives, career plans, and reasons for choosing your field. The statement should be concisely written.         Length of Statement of Purpose: The GSAS online application states that the statement of purpose should be limited to two double-spaced pages, however the Psychology Department will accept a statement of purpose that does not exceed 1,000 words, regardless of page length.     Note: I/O MA program applicants must submit a supplemental case essay in addition to the statement of purpose. For instructions about the I/O supplemental essay, please see this link: http://psych.nyu.edu/programs/ma/ioadmissions.html .             Letters of Recommendation : Applicants must submit three letters of recommendation. Preferably, the letters should come from former professors at college. For applicants who have been out of school for some time, letters from supervisors are acceptable. Letters should not be from family friends or counselors, or from religious or political figures, unless the recommender has been in a position to personally supervise the applicant's academic or work performance.     Prerequisites:\u00a0 All applicants are required to have graduated with at least a 3.0 (B) average from a four-year, fully accredited undergraduate program. An undergraduate psychology major is not required, but all applicants must complete both an Introductory Psychology class and a basic Statistics class (behavioral statistics preferred), with grades of B or better, prior to starting the M.A. program.\u00a0 If you are in the process of taking a prerequisite, please indicate this in your statement of purpose. Applicants who are in the process of completing a prerequisite can be admitted pending successful completion of the course/s.     Time to Degree: The MA Program may be completed on a full or part-time basis, providing that all work is completed within a five-year period. Students may begin the MA program in either the Fall or Spring semesters, or during one of the Summer sessions. Most MA courses begin at 6:20 PM, and some begin at 4:20 PM. The MA Program has recently instituted an MA Scholars designation for students with superior academic credentials who may enroll in certain doctoral-level courses with permission of the relevant instructor.

Many students are granted educational loans to help fund their tuition. \u00a0For information on other ways to finance your education, please visit the Financial Aid Office&rsquo;s webpage for alternative funding sources .     Non-degree Status     To take classes in the General Psychology MA program without the intention of obtaining a Master&rsquo;s degree, students may apply to the program using the non-degree application.\u00a0 Please note that entry into the non-degree program does not guarantee entry into the degree-seeking program regardless of successful completion of MA classes.\u00a0 Students who are non-degree may take up to 12 credits.     The I/O MA program does not offer non-degree status.\u00a0 To take any I/O classes, students must be degree-seeking I/O students.     Application Instructions for non-degree students are located here: http://gsas.nyu.edu/object/grad.app.nodeg     Please note that non-degree students must only submit one letter of recommendation and the GRE/GMAT is not required. With non-degree status, a student may take a maximum of 12 points of MA-level courses before applying to the degree-seeking MA program. Non-degree students who wish to apply for admission to the MA program must satisfy any condition set by the department, including taking the GRE or GMAT. Once the student has attained degree-seeking status, s/he will receive credit for all psychology graduate courses completed as a non-degree student.     The most common reasons for applying as a non-degree student are:     1) the student is visiting from another graduate program;     2) the student wants to take a course or two before investing time in studying for the GRE.     After the MA     General Psychology : The majority of the students in the General Psychology MA Program share a motivation to improve their work status within the mental health field or wish to prepare for doctoral-level degrees, either the PhD or PsyD. The mental health field is growing and includes job opportunities in health delivery in hospitals, clinics, and community social services, as well as research possibilities within a variety of applied agencies.     Industrial and Organizational Psychology : The MA in Industrial/Organizational Psychology opens up careers in a vast array of companies that hire psychologists with an academic background in employee relations, personnel administration, and the technical skills involved in testing, job analysis, research, etc. Most of our Industrial/Organizational graduates find employment as human resources generalists (with organizations such as law firms, hotels, and publishers) or human resources specialists for large corporations (such as banks, investment houses, and accounting firms). About a third of our I/O graduates find positions with management consulting firms (e.g., the Hay Group, Andersen Consulting, Personnel Decisions).

I&rsquo;m experiencing a technical difficulty in the application itself, can you help?      I didn't take Statistics for the Behavioral Sciences, but I took another statistics course. Will this satisfy the stats prerequisite?      I didn&rsquo;t take an Introductory Psychology course, but I took other psychology classes. Will this satisfy the psych prerequisite?      Can I take my prerequisites at NYU? Where else can I take them?      Can I audit a class?      I have already applied. When can I expect a decision?      Can I schedule a meeting or interview with an admissions advisor in person?      How long does it take to complete this degree?      My test scores are less than 5 years old, but they're based on the old scoring system out of 800. What scores does the I/O and/or general program consider competitive?      Can an undocumented immigrant apply to this program?       I would like to review basic statistics and/or psychology material--is there a free resource for me to do this?               Where can I access the application?      http://gsas.nyu.edu/object/grad.admissions.onlineapp      Can you send me pamphlets or brochures about the program?     We no longer create paper informational materials, but please browse our website or email David Park if you have any specific questions not answered on our website.      I&rsquo;m experiencing a technical difficulty in the application itself, can you help?     Our application is housed by Graduate Enrollment Services; please take a look at their website (they have a number of helpful FAQ pages): http://gsas.nyu.edu/page/grad.admissionsapplication.html     If you don&rsquo;t see an answer, feel free to contact them:     Graduate Enrollment Services     Phone: (212) 998-8050     Email: gsas.admissions@nyu.edu      I didn't take Statistics for the Behavioral Sciences, but I took another statistics course. Will this satisfy the stats prerequisite?     Yes, we accept alternative undergraduate-level statistics classes.      I didn&rsquo;t take an Introductory Psychology course, but I took other psychology classes. Will this satisfy the psych prerequisite?     We prefer that you took a class that covered the basics of psychology, but if you completed several more advanced psychology courses, covering a variety of areas, that would be acceptable. Reading extensively on your own is not considered an acceptable alternative to taking a formal course in General Psychology. If it has been a long time since you have taken any psychology courses, it would be a good idea to brush up with an online introductory course.          Can I take my prerequisites at NYU? Where else can I take them?   To take prerequisites at NYU, you will need to apply as a non-degree student. However, we find online courses to be an acceptable and more accessible alternative. To satisfy a prerequisite, an online course must be affiliated with a non-profit University that has a physical campus. We recommend the following courses:       University of Texas Extension:       PSY 301: Introduction to Psychology       PSY 317: Statistical Methods in Psychology         University of Colorado at Boulder Online:       PSYC 1001: General Psychology       PSYC 3101: Statistics and Research Methods in Psychology                     Can I audit a class?     Unfortunately, we can allow only officially registered students to attend our classes.\u00a0 Our M.A. classes are fairly small, and we find it too disruptive to allow visitors to attend class.\u00a0 NYU permits auditing of an entire course but only if the student pays the full price of the course (you must still apply as a non-degree student).      I have already applied. When can I expect a decision?     Please expect an admissions decision 6-8 weeks from the application deadline.\u00a0 If you are under specific time pressure to receive a decision by a particular deadline, please email David Park .      Can I schedule a meeting or interview with an admissions advisor in person?     Unfortunately due to the large volume of applicants, we are not able to meet with prospective students in person. However, we do have regular information sessions for prospective applicants to meet with our director and program coordinator. For more information on the next information session please click here: http://psych.nyu.edu/programs/ma/openhouse.html . If you do have specific questions that are not answered on the website and you&rsquo;re unable to attend an Information Session, please email David Park for answers.      How long does it take to complete this degree?     Students vary on the amount of time they take to complete the degree.\u00a0 All students have a maximum of five years to complete the degree.\u00a0 Students who are attending the program full time (9 credits per semester) can complete it in two years.     How important are my GRE scores, recommendations, undergraduate transcripts, etc.?     We take all parts of your application into consideration.\u00a0 There is no one score that would disqualify you from admission.\u00a0 However, competitive applicants will be strong in multiple areas of their application.\u00a0 It is useful to have strong GRE scores, a 3.0 or above on your undergraduate transcript, research experience, work experience, good letters of recommendation, etc.\u00a0 However, we have more qualified candidates than spots in the program and ultimately, cannot guarantee admission for any individual.       How do I check if you have received all of my application materials?     Applicants can enter their N number here to find out if we&rsquo;ve received your materials: http://www.nyu.edu/gsas/request/smts.html     Is the GRE Psychology Subject Test required?     No, we do not require the Psychology subject test.     How many international students are in the program?     Currently, 23% of our active student body is international.     I wish to apply to the Forensic or Social and Consumer Psychology program--what application do I fill out?     The Forensic specialization and Social and Consumer specialization are housed under our General Psychology Masters program. Please fill out the General Psychology Application here: http://gsas.nyu.edu/object/grad.admissions.onlineapp     Can I speak to a current student?     Please email David Park for contact information from our current student body leaders.     At what time do the applications close on the deadline?     Applications close at 5 PM EST/EDT the day of the deadline.     I am an international prospective student for whom English is not my first language. \u00a0I went to a bilingual school where I spoke English in some or all of my classes. Must I still take the TOEFL?     Please contact The Office of Global Services for questions regarding the international applicant requirements.

Once your application is submitted, trained staff members will translate your grades into a system similar to the U.S. grading system so that our admissions committee can understand your transcript and GPA. Similarly, they will evaluate your degree and assess whether or not it is the equivalent of a U.S. Bachelor's degree. Unfortunately, the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences cannot assign a staff member to your application until it has been submitted.      My test scores are less than 5 years old, but they're based on the old scoring system out of 800. What scores does the I/O and/or general program consider competitive?

In addition, (1) all core courses must be taken at NYU in the Psychology   Department, and (2) students must earn a grade of at least B in all   core courses.     All of the courses in the M.A. program are 3 points each, so 12 courses   must be taken. Students may take anywhere between one and three courses   each semester. The program is expected to take two years to complete   in most cases, but can be completed a little sooner for full-time students   (especially if some courses are taken during the summer session), or   somewhat later for those working full-time. A student who has completed   all course work, but must stay enrolled to take the comprehensive examination   or complete a thesis, must pay a matriculation fee each semester until   graduation. A maximum of five years from the date of first registration   is allowed for completing the degree.      Basic course requirements (all of the following are required   for all students, and must be completed within the first two semesters   of the M.A. program) :      Introductory Course: G89.2032 Intro to I/O Psychology . Only   if a student has taken a very similar, graduate-level course at another   institution can this requirement be waived.      Statistics: G89.2016 Master's Statistics. In   special cases, G89.1016 (Introductory) or a doctoral course may be   substituted.      Research  : G89.2067 Applied Research Methods. In special cases,   another research course may be substituted.      Core Course requirements (two courses must be taken from each   core):               CORE &quot;I&quot;      CORE &quot;O&quot;                G89.2070 Personnel Selection      G89.2072 Work Motivation and Attitudes                G89.2071 Performance Measurement &amp; Rewards      G89.2074 Organizational Development                G89.2073 Training in Organizations      G89.2076 Leadership and Strategic Change              The above requirements allow for five elective courses, which can   be taken from the general program (e.g., Psychology of Social Behavior;   Introduction to Psychological Testing), other divisions of NYU (e.g.,   graduate-level Economics; Stern School of Business-MBA program), or   other universities (a limit of 9 credits can be transferred from graduate   programs at other institutions). Courses taken outside of the psychology   department must have some psychological content, and be approved by   an adviser. Elective credits can also be taken in the form of non-classroom   courses, such as Fieldwork, Independent Research, and MA Thesis Seminar.   Although Fieldwork (generally, an unpaid internship in an HR department   or consulting firm) is not required, it is strongly recommended for   students who enter the program without relevant work experience.      COMPREHENSIVE EXAM / M.A. THESIS REQUIREMENT     All students must either pass the comprehensive exam, or write an acceptable M.A. thesis.      The Comprehensive Exam: This is a three-hour written test that is given three times each year: October, February, and June. The questions are integrative in nature and are randomly selected from a large study list that is available to all students at any time. Except for rare exceptions, a student must have completed all of the basic and core requirements, as outlined above, before sitting for the exam.     MA Thesis: As an alternative to the comprehensive exam, a student may seek permission to write an M.A. thesis. To be eligible to write a thesis, a student must have passed all of the basic and core requirements with at least a B+ average, and have secured the sponsorship of a full-time faculty member (in consultation with the MA director). In general, an MA thesis does not require that the student perform original or independent research, but that the student make an original contribution to the research of his/her sponsor.
