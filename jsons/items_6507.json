First-year students take three courses that constitute the First-Year Program: the First-Year Interdisciplinary Seminar and First-Year Writing Seminar (which you will take in the fall), and the First-Year Research Seminar (which you will take in the spring). Each seminar is organized around a particular theme with related readings that serve as springboards for discussion and models for students\u2019 essays.   Below is a complete list of the First-Year Interdisciplinary Seminar and First-Year Writing Seminar offerings. Prepare for your pre-registration advising conversations by selecting your top five choices among the First-Year Interdisciplinary Seminars and First-Year Writing Seminars offered for Fall 2015.          The First-Year Interdisciplinary Seminar introduces students to the philosophy, goals, and methods of university education and to the interdisciplinary, individualized approach of the Gallatin School. These small classes of about 18 students encourage discussion rather than lecturing and focus on a theme that incorporates significant world texts representing several disciplines.

Description       In this class we will look at how weddings and marriages have been represented in art and culture throughout modernity. We will investigate marriage as a celebration of love and union and as a system of religious, patriarchal, hetero-normative, and capitalistic exploitation and oppression. Through the analysis of key texts we will seek to understand why our longstanding cultural obsession with marriage\u2014an institution often deemed outmoded\u2014has continued to persist. Segments of the course will be devoted to representations of weddings and marriage in plays by Shakespeare and Edward Albee; in Jane Austen\u2019s\u00a0 Pride and Prejudice \u00a0; in artworks by Jan van Eyck, Kiki Smith, Frieda Kahlo, and David Magnusson; in Ingmar Bergman\u2019s\u00a0 Scenes from a Marriage \u00a0and David Fincher\u2019s\u00a0 Gone Girl \u00a0; and in contemporary popular songs such as Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s \u201cSingle Ladies (Put a Ring on It).\u201d We will also look at recent studies on marriage and divorce rates, discuss Bruce Benderson\u2019s polemic,\u00a0 Against Marriage \u00a0, and examine fissures in the LGBTQ community around the question of marriage equality. Students will collaborate through workshops and online, give in-class presentations, and complete a series of writing assignments around topics drawn from our objects of study.

First-year students take three courses that constitute the First-Year Program: the First-Year Interdisciplinary Seminar and First-Year Writing Seminar (which you will take in the fall), and the First-Year Research Seminar (which you will take in the spring). Each seminar is organized around a particular theme with related readings that serve as springboards for discussion and models for students\u2019 essays.   Below is a complete list of the First-Year Interdisciplinary Seminar and First-Year Writing Seminar offerings. Prepare for your pre-registration advising conversations by selecting your top five choices among the First-Year Interdisciplinary Seminars and First-Year Writing Seminars offered for Fall 2015.          The First-Year Interdisciplinary Seminar introduces students to the philosophy, goals, and methods of university education and to the interdisciplinary, individualized approach of the Gallatin School. These small classes of about 18 students encourage discussion rather than lecturing and focus on a theme that incorporates significant world texts representing several disciplines.

Description       In this class we will look at how weddings and marriages have been represented in art and culture throughout modernity. We will investigate marriage as a celebration of love and union and as a system of religious, patriarchal, hetero-normative, and capitalistic exploitation and oppression. Through the analysis of key texts we will seek to understand why our longstanding cultural obsession with marriage\u2014an institution often deemed outmoded\u2014has continued to persist. Segments of the course will be devoted to representations of weddings and marriage in plays by Shakespeare and Edward Albee; in Jane Austen\u2019s\u00a0 Pride and Prejudice \u00a0; in artworks by Jan van Eyck, Kiki Smith, Frieda Kahlo, and David Magnusson; in Ingmar Bergman\u2019s\u00a0 Scenes from a Marriage \u00a0and David Fincher\u2019s\u00a0 Gone Girl \u00a0; and in contemporary popular songs such as Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s \u201cSingle Ladies (Put a Ring on It).\u201d We will also look at recent studies on marriage and divorce rates, discuss Bruce Benderson\u2019s polemic,\u00a0 Against Marriage \u00a0, and examine fissures in the LGBTQ community around the question of marriage equality. Students will collaborate through workshops and online, give in-class presentations, and complete a series of writing assignments around topics drawn from our objects of study.

First-year students take three courses that constitute the First-Year Program: the First-Year Interdisciplinary Seminar and First-Year Writing Seminar (which you will take in the fall), and the First-Year Research Seminar (which you will take in the spring). Each seminar is organized around a particular theme with related readings that serve as springboards for discussion and models for students\u2019 essays.   Below is a complete list of the First-Year Interdisciplinary Seminar and First-Year Writing Seminar offerings. Prepare for your pre-registration advising conversations by selecting your top five choices among the First-Year Interdisciplinary Seminars and First-Year Writing Seminars offered for Fall 2015.          The First-Year Interdisciplinary Seminar introduces students to the philosophy, goals, and methods of university education and to the interdisciplinary, individualized approach of the Gallatin School. These small classes of about 18 students encourage discussion rather than lecturing and focus on a theme that incorporates significant world texts representing several disciplines.

Description       In this class we will look at how weddings and marriages have been represented in art and culture throughout modernity. We will investigate marriage as a celebration of love and union and as a system of religious, patriarchal, hetero-normative, and capitalistic exploitation and oppression. Through the analysis of key texts we will seek to understand why our longstanding cultural obsession with marriage\u2014an institution often deemed outmoded\u2014has continued to persist. Segments of the course will be devoted to representations of weddings and marriage in plays by Shakespeare and Edward Albee; in Jane Austen\u2019s\u00a0 Pride and Prejudice \u00a0; in artworks by Jan van Eyck, Kiki Smith, Frieda Kahlo, and David Magnusson; in Ingmar Bergman\u2019s\u00a0 Scenes from a Marriage \u00a0and David Fincher\u2019s\u00a0 Gone Girl \u00a0; and in contemporary popular songs such as Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s \u201cSingle Ladies (Put a Ring on It).\u201d We will also look at recent studies on marriage and divorce rates, discuss Bruce Benderson\u2019s polemic,\u00a0 Against Marriage \u00a0, and examine fissures in the LGBTQ community around the question of marriage equality. Students will collaborate through workshops and online, give in-class presentations, and complete a series of writing assignments around topics drawn from our objects of study.
