Introduction          In the fall 2007 semester, the College of Arts and Science  launched its new Collegiate Seminar Program for entering freshmen. These  Collegiate Seminars have several distinctive features. Offered only to freshmen  in the College of Arts and Science, they are taught exclusively by  distinguished senior Arts and Science faculty whose excellence as scholars and  teachers has been recognized by their appointment as Collegiate Professors.  These faculty not only teach these courses but also serve as the students\u2019  mentors throughout their entire undergraduate careers at NYU. During the  semester in which the seminar is offered and in subsequent semesters, the  faculty work with their students to create special enrichment and reunion  activities, which might include a visit with a renowned scholar; a museum,  theater, concert, or film outing; a dinner discussion on a book or poem; or  just a purely social evening.          Like other seminars, these small classes are meant to  introduce students to important subjects and to challenge them intellectually  through rigorous standards of analysis and oral and written argumentation. To  that end, they stress demanding reading and writing assignments that introduce  students to an essential research skill\u2014such as a literature review,  quantitative reasoning, critical use of primary sources, the identification of  a research problem, critical analysis of texts, or confrontations with works of  art. In addition to participating actively in class discussions, students are  expected to give oral presentations in class. A final paper will typically,  though not always, have gone through one or more revisions, perhaps revised  with the benefit of in-class comments. In other seminars the focus may be on  individual or group projects. In applying and registering for one of these seminars,  students are expected to commit themselves to doing honors-level academic work  and to participating actively in co-curricular and mentoring activities beyond  the semester-long course.   Course Descriptions                               The Cultural Nature of Language (V70.0101; call # 74564) Instructor: Bambi Schieffelin Monday and Wednesday, 9:30\u201310:45 a.m.          From accents, pronouns, swearing, and spelling, how one uses  language is never value-free. In this seminar we examine language-using as a  social practice, and analyze how speakers and their language(s) are evaluated  and regulated across a range of contexts and cultures. Starting with how  children learn to talk, or don\u2019t (e.g., feral children), we examine speech and  silence across a range of societies. We look at popular attitudes toward  language and the practices by which people regulate its use in the media (e.g.,  political correctness), in legal and educational institutions (e.g., \u201cEnglish  Only\u201d), and in multilingual cities (e.g., Barcelona, Montreal) in order to understand  how ideas about language are often recruited to non-linguistic concerns, such  as who should be included and who excluded. In thinking about the cultural  nature of language in this way, we critically explore issues of identity and  authority.          Bambi B. Schieffelin, Collegiate Professor  and Professor of Anthropology, is a linguistic anthropologist who has studied  speech practices among Haitians in Queens, N.Y., lawyers and litigants in lower  Manhattan\u2019s Small Claims Court, college students and their use of IM, and  Bosavi people in Papua New Guinea. She is the author of The Give and Take of  Everyday Life: Language Socialization of Kaluli Children . She is co-editor of, among other books, The  Acquisition of Literacy: Ethnographic Perspectives, Language Ideologies:  Practice and Theory and Consequences  of Contact . She has also published articles  in preeminent journals of her field, including Current Anthropology and Annual Review of Anthropology . She is completing a book on the impact of  Christianity on the language and social life of Bosavi people over the past 25  years, and continues research on linguistic creativity and change as evidenced  in computer mediated communication.                      Terrorism, Nihilism, and Modernity (V70.0102; call # 74565) Instructor: James Gilligan Tuesday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m.          The past century has witnessed violence the character and  scale of which are so unique and unprecedented that we have had to create a new  vocabulary to describe it (genocide, terrorism) and the ideologies that  underlie it (totalitarianism, fundamentalism). To understand modern violence,  we will examine the origin of the modern mind in the 17th century, when  science, based on universal doubt, ended the Age of Faith, and the traditional  sources of moral, legal, and political authority lost credibility. Nietzsche  called this the \u201cdeath of God\u201d (and the Devil); it could also be called the  death of Good and Evil, leading to another set of new words (nihilism,  agnosticism, anomie, anarchy). We will study the origins and implications of  these developments by reading Shakespeare and John Donne, Nietzsche and  Dostoevsky, Beckett and Wittgenstein, Simone Weil and Hannah Arendt, as well as  modern mass murderers from Hitler to bin Laden. Finally, we will ask whether  the modern human sciences can help us understand how to reverse or at least  limit this escalation of violence.          James Gilligan, Collegiate Professor, headed  the Institute of Law and Psychiatry and directed mental health programs for the  Massachusetts prison system while on the faculty of the Harvard Medical School  Department of Psychiatry. He has also served as President of the International  Association for Forensic Psychotherapy, and as Chair of the Committee on  Prevention, which was part of President Clinton\u2019s National Campaign Against  Youth Violence. His books include Violence: Reflections on a National  Epidemic and Preventing Violence:  An Agenda for the Coming Century . He has  been a consultant on violence prevention to the World Health Organization\u2019s  Department of Injuries and Violence Prevention, the International Criminal  Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, the Secretary-General of the United  Nations, the Law Lords of the House of Lords, and other groups and individuals  throughout the world.                       Saying and Meaning: Intersections of Poetry and  Philosophy (V70.0103; call # 74566) Instructor: Tom Gerety Tuesday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m.          This seminar will explore the sometimes uncertain boundary  between poetry and philosophy. Every poet is saying something to himself or  herself\u2014as well as to readers. Rarely do poets content themselves with  sounds alone, or even images alone; often they make arguments. Philosophers, on  the other hand, have long been thought to engage their readers, their students,  solely with arguments. Yet from the earliest days, philosophers have used  imagery and myth to make sense of the world and to make \u201carguments\u201d about it.  We will seek to move back and forth, then, between poetry and philosophy, in  order to understand both better. We will read, criticize and, frankly, imitate  several of the most poetic philosophers and philosophic poets. These will  include poets and philosophers both ancient and modern, writing in English as  well as in other languages in translation. Among other themes\u2014such as  language itself, imagination and love\u2014we will pay special attention to  poems with ties to Greenwich Village and to New York City.          Tom Gerety, Collegiate Professor, joined the NYU faculty in 2005, having first come  to NYU two years earlier to head the Brennan Center for Justice at the Law  School. Before then he served as President of Amherst College from 1994 to 2003  and of Trinity College in Hartford, Connecticut, from 1989 to 1994. From 1986  to 1989 he was the Dean and Nippert Professor at the College of Law of the  University of Cincinnati. As a law professor he taught and wrote on  constitutional law and political philosophy, with a special emphasis on First  Amendment freedoms, including speech, privacy, and religious freedom. With Judy  Woodruff, he wrote and narrated a PBS series, Visions of the Constitution , funded by the National Endowment for the  Humanities. He is the author, most recently, of The Freshman Who Hated  Socrates .                      In Search of Lost Time (V70.0104; call # 74567) Instructor: Marcelle Clements Thursday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m.          We will read Proust (in translation) as he should be read:  hedonistically\u2014with respect and admiration but also with delectation. A  prodigious novel, 4,500 pages long, In Search of Lost Time addresses literature\u2019s richest theme:  desire\u2014its remembrance, transformation, perversion, defeat, and final  resurgence in the form of art. More than 100 years old, often said to be the  first modern novel, it remains a dazzling portait of the French beau monde and,  even more, of the power and elegance of its author\u2019s sensibility. It is still  unparalleled in how it combines self-examination with social history,  extraordinary psychological acuity with the study of glamour and decadence, how  it merges an audacious explosion of form with explorations of memory,  attachment, deception, lust, jealousy, ambition, disappointment, and ennui. It  is also one of the most pleasurable and elating reads. Although Marcel Proust  (1871\u20131922) is usually assumed to be France\u2019s greatest novelist, his  prose is so layered and brilliant that, unfortunately, many readers begin at  the beginning and never move past the first fifty pages, reading the same  gorgeous sentences again and again. While In Search of Lost Time\u2019 s prose style (playing on association, evocation,  magnification, punning, rhythm) may have been its most radical contribution to  the art of the novel, it cannot be understood until it has been read once in  its entirety. In this seminar, we will keep moving at a brisk pace through the  work, merely glancing at its riches on our way, until we arrive at the uniquely  euphoric experience of reading the final volume, Time Regained . Required reading: an average of 350 pages per week.          Marcelle Clements is Collegiate Professor  and a Fellow of the New York Institute for the Humanities at NYU. She is the  author of a collection of essays, The Dog Is Us and Other Observations, a book of nonfiction, The Improvised Woman , and of two novels, Rock Me and, most recently, Midsummer . Her numerous articles and essays on the arts,  culture, and politics have appeared in leading national publications.                      Pharmaceutical Drugs, Ethics, and Culture (V70.0105; call # 74568) Instructor: David A. Scicchitano Wednesday, 3:30\u20136:15 p.m.          Why are drug prices often higher in the United States than  in Canada, Europe, and other parts of the world, and what impact does this have  on healthcare? What is \u201cinformed consent\u201d for individuals who elect to  participate in clinical drug tests, and what ethical concerns are raised while  obtaining such consent? This seminar is designed to introduce students to these  and other contemporary issues in the realm of pharmaceuticals, focusing on drug  design, safety, and distribution. Early in the seminar, students are introduced  to the basic concepts of drug research and testing, with an emphasis on the  Food and Drug Administration rules for bringing a drug to the clinic and  eventually to the marketplace. This leads to the complex issues related to drug  distribution inside and outside the United States, the societal implications  associated with developing new therapeutic regimens, and the economic factors  and laws that come into play. The seminar also develops students\u2019 writing,  critical thinking, and presentation skills, with emphasis placed on  researching, evaluating, and presenting evidence.          David A. Scicchitano, Collegiate Professor  and Professor of Biology, also serves as the Director of Undergraduate Research  in the College. His research interests include the way environmental agents,  particularly chemicals, interact with and damage DNA, interfering with  fundamental cellular process, and triggering pathology. He has published  numerous articles in scholarly journals of his field, including Biochemistry , the Journal of Molecular Biology , the Journal of Biological Chemistry , and Environmental Health Perspectives . His research has been funded by grants from the  National Institutes of Health. He has twice won the College\u2019s Golden Dozen  Award for Teaching Excellence, as well as the University\u2019s Distinguished  Teaching Award.                      American Wars, Past and Present: Vietnam and Iraq (V70.0106; call # 74569) Instructor: Marilyn B. Young Wednesday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m.          The course will consider the last major war of the 20th  century and the first major war of the 21st century. The history, memory, and  political uses of the Vietnam War will be the subject of the first part of the  course. The ongoing influence of that war on contemporary politics will occupy  the second part of the course. The way Gulf War I (Operation Desert Storm) was  fought and reported upon was shaped by the specific understanding the  administration of George H. W. Bush had of the Vietnam War. The current war in  the Gulf (Operation Iraqi Freedom) was, of course, shaped by the outcome of the  first Gulf War. But it has also been fought in the shadow of Vietnam analogies  that are used by those who support the war as well as by those who oppose it.  The course will examine these analogies with some care. The overarching concern  of the seminar is the ongoing haunting of American politics\u2014military and  civilian\u2014by a war fought over three decades ago. There are two connected  questions: Can history teach? What does it teach?          Marilyn B. Young, Collegiate Professor and Professor of History, is a former  Chair of the History Department. Her teaching and her writing focus on U.S.  foreign policy. Her books include The Vietnam Wars, 1945\u20131990 , The Rhetoric of Empire: American China  Policy, 1895\u20131901 , Transforming  Russia and China: Revolutionary Struggle in the 20th Century , with William Rosenberg, and Human Rights  and Revolutions , with Lynn Hunt and Jeffrey  Wasserstrom. She has also edited several collections of essays on the recent  wars in Iraq. She was Director of the Project on the Cold War as a Global  Conflict at NYU\u2019s International Center for Advanced Study in 2001\u20132004.  She has been the recipient of a Guggenheim Fellowship and of an American  Council of Learned Societies Fellowship. Twice she has won the College\u2019s Golden  Dozen Award for Teaching Excellence.                      How We See (V70.0109; call # 74572) Instructor: Marisa Carrasco Thursday, 11:00 a.m.\u20131:30 p.m.          Do we see the world the  way we do because we are the way we are or because the world is the way it is?  The ease with which we comprehend the visual world, and recognize objects and  events, makes it tempting to think that the world is just the way we see it and  to take our perceptual capabilities for granted. But when we comprehend that we  cannot process all the information available in the environment, when we try to  build machines that can see, or when we encounter people who have lost some  specific visual capability\u2014for example, persons who can no longer  recognize faces\u2014we realize how extraordinary and intricate are the  machinery and mechanisms of sight. This course looks at what we know about  vision from multiple scientific perspectives: perceptual psychology tells us  about the process of seeing, and provides important insights into the workings  of visual mechanisms; neuropsychology shows us what happens to perception when  these mechanisms malfunction; neuroscience tells us about processes at the  level of cells and neural systems. At the same time, we will discuss modes and  techniques of scientific inquiry from these different perspectives. How do  vision scientists learn? What kinds of experiments do they conduct? How has the  development of new neuroimaging techniques (fMRI, for example) shaped the  field?          Marisa Carrasco is Collegiate Professor and  Professor of Psychology and Neural Science, as well as a former Chair of the  Psychology Department. Born and raised in Mexico City, she received her  licentiate in psychology from the National University of Mexico and her Ph.D.  in psychology (cognition and perception) from Princeton University. She  conducts research in cognitive neuroscience, exploring the relation between the  psychological and neural mechanisms involved in visual perception and  attention. She has published many papers in the most prominent scientific  journals in perception, in particular, and in science, in general. Her  accomplishments have been recognized by prestigious awards and fellowships  throughout her career, such as an American Association of University Women  Fellowship, a National Young Investigator Award from the National Science  Foundation, a Cattell Fellowship, and a Guggenheim Fellowship.                      Life\u2019s Ends, in Aristotle, Nietzsche, and Darwinism (V70.0110; call # 74573) Instructor: John Richardson Tuesday, 9:30 a.m.\u201312:00 noon          We share a very strong impression that  nature\u2014especially organisms or life\u2014has some kind of purposiveness  or design, is somehow aimed at ends. But we generally take science, and  Darwinian biology in particular, to oppose this first impression and to push  ends or purposes quite out of nature. This course will examine that strong  sense of the teleology (end-directedness) of life or nature, and consider how  it really stands up to a scientific or naturalistic view. Part of our attention  will be historical: we will focus on two very different philosophers, Aristotle  and Nietzsche, who are alike in their very strong allegiance to science, yet also  in their insistence on explaining life by its ends or goals. Why do they so  insist\u2014and Nietzsche even after Darwin? Another part of our attention  will be more contemporary: we will consider what evolutionary theory really  does entail as to whether organisms have ends. We will see how even the most  current science may still leave room for teleology. Readings will be from  Aristotle, Nietzsche, and contemporary philosophy of biology.          John Richardson is Collegiate Professor and  Professor of Philosophy. He specializes in 19th- and 20th-century continental  philosophy. In addition to numerous articles on these topics, he has written  books about Nietzsche ( Nietzsche\u2019s System   and Nietzsche\u2019s New Darwinism )  and Heidegger ( Existential Epistemology: A Heideggerian Critique of  the Cartesian Project ). He is also  co-editor of Nietzsche , a volume  in the Oxford Readings in Philosophy series. He has been a winner of the  College\u2019s Golden Dozen Award for Teaching Excellence.                          Great Science, Fabulous Science, and Voodoo Science (V70.0111; call # 75492) Instructor: Allen Mincer Monday and Wednesday, 11:00 a.m.\u201312:15 p.m. Prerequisites: high school chemistry, physics, and calculus.          Science is often portrayed as following a very clearly  defined set of procedures: start with a hypothesis, do an experiment, and based  on the results reject the hypothesis or adopt it as a working assumption. The  actual process, however, is rarely so straightforward. In addition, the stories  as usually told or recorded may differ from what really happened. We will study  some famous and infamous experiments, mainly in the physical sciences, selected  to illustrate intellectual tours de force, cases of error, cases of fraud, and  the murky boundaries between them. Along the way, issues such as the discarding  of \u201cfaulty data,\u201d theoretical bias, and probabilistic tools for hypothesis  acceptance and rejection will be discussed.          Allen Mincer, Collegiate Professor and  Professor of Physics at NYU, is a former Chair of the Department of Physics. He  specializes in experimental particle physics and particle astrophysics. He is  currently also a member of the ATLAS collaboration, which is studying the  nature of the elementary building blocks of matter at the CERN Large Hadron  Collider in Geneva, Switzerland. His research at NYU has a long, continuous  history of generous support by grants from the National Science Foundation. He  is co-author of approximately 200 scientific publications, including the  discovery of the top quark with the D-Zero collaboration. His interests include  education, and in addition to teaching in the Physics Department he has taught  in the Steinhardt School\u2019s Department of Teaching and Learning, been involved  in research in physics education, and has twice been awarded the CAS Golden  Dozen Award for Teaching Excellence.                      Daily Life in China, 1750\u20131950 (V70.0112; call # 75491) Instructor: Joanna Waley-Cohen Wednesday, 4:55\u20137:30 p.m.          Historians of the West often draw a link between the  development of a consumer society and the onset of modernity, examining  patterns of daily life in such centers as London and Paris from no later than  the 18th century or even earlier. This seminar examines such patterns in the  context of China from the high imperial era through the first half of the 20th  century; the goal is to give students a range of knowledge sufficient to use as  a basis for comparison, and an understanding of the analytical issues involved.  Using a combination of primary documents, fiction, and secondary sources, we  will explore such questions as: What was distinctive about the experience of  urban Chinese in late imperial and early modern times? What was the shape of an  ordinary day? How did architecture reflect gender norms? Who belonged to a  typical household (family members, concubines, servants, etc.), and how did  children learn? What forms did social life take? How was the revering of  ancestors incorporated into family life? What were people\u2019s different work  experiences? How did people acquire necessities such as food and clothing, or  luxuries such as antiques? Other questions that may emerge in the course of the  semester will be taken up as well.          Joanna Waley-Cohen, Collegiate Professor and  Professor of History, has taught the history of China at NYU since 1992. She  received her B.A. and M.A. degrees in Chinese studies from Cambridge University  and her Ph.D. degree in History from Yale University. Her books include The  Sextants of Beijing: Global Currents in Chinese History and The Culture of War: Empire and the  Military under the Qing Dynasty . Currently  she is working on two related projects. The first is a social and cultural  history of cooks and cooking in early modern China. The second uses an account  of an upper-class Chinese household of the 18th century, including family  members, domestic servants, religious advisers, and in-house entertainers, to  illuminate the functioning of social class and gender distinctions in Chinese  daily life in an era of prosperity. Last year she was awarded a Culinary Trust  Harry Bell Grant for research in China.                      Making Sense of Monsters and Masks (V70.0113; call # 75490) Instructor: Judith G. Miller Monday and Wednesday, 11:00 a.m.\u201312:15 p.m.          Among the more significant activities of human beings is  that of giving shape to fears and desires through art. All cultures participate  in this form of emotional exteriorization, including creating through myth and  literature \u201cmonsters\u201d and sculpting in textures and words various types of  \u201cmasks.\u201d In this seminar, we will concentrate on monsters and masks in several  cultures for whom the French language is a major expressive form. We will thus  chart the meaning and impact of the archetypal masked figures of the commedia  dell\u2019arte in French theatre, the obsessive  concern with grotesque person (the monstrous mask) in French romanticism,  zombification and carnival figures in Caribbean cultural forms, and raptor  masks and transformative gu\u00e9risseur s  or healers in Francophone West African works. We will build a repertory of  approaches to interpreting and uncovering the many layers of masking and  monstrousness by reading in anthropology, psychoanalysis, aesthetics, and  literary theory: For as interesting as the masks and monsters \u201cpeopling\u201d the  world are the ways in which humans at various points in time have attempted to  understand what making masks and monsters means. (All readings will be in  English.)          Judith G. Miller, Collegiate Professor and  Professor of French, is Chair of NYU\u2019s French Department.

Finding New York City (V70.0114; call # 75904) Instructor: William Serrin Thursday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m.          In this seminar students explore, read and write about, and  develop a deep understanding of New York City, from diverse perspectives and by  means of various media. They will venture into different neighborhoods, ethnic  areas, all five boroughs, out on the Hudson and East River, restaurants, parks,  and the like. They will examine New York history, and how the city has changed  over the decades, writing about what they see and find. In the end all should  have an understanding of how New York City began, how it has changed over time,  what remains from the old days, what new things are happening, and what the  future might be. It is, in short, a course in urban America that takes New York  City as its laboratory. The seminar will turn to some of the splendid books  that deal with important aspects of the city. It will also consider how the  image of New York City in the movies has changed over the decades, drawing, in  part, on the book Celluloid Skyline . In  addition, it will use parts of the Ken Burns PBS documentary series New  York City .          William Serrin is Collegiate Professor and Associate Professor of Journalism. Before  joining NYU, he was for eight years the labor and workplace correspondent for  the New York Times . He has  written for numerous magazines, including Newsweek , Atlantic Monthly, American Heritage , andthe Nation , as well as  the Columbia Journalism Review   and the Village Voice . He is  the author of Homestead: The Glory and Tragedy of an American Steel Town , and The Company and the Union: The \u201cCivilized  Relationship\u201d of the General Motors Corporation and the United Automobile  Workers . He is the editor of   The Business of Journalism: 10 Leading Reporters and Editors on the Perils and  Pitfalls of the Press and  co-editor, with Judith Bruhn Serrin, of Muckraking!: The Journalism That  Changed America . He was a  recipient of the Alicia Patterson Award, for study of American farm and food  policies. He also won the Sidney Hillman Foundation Award for outstanding labor  coverage, and he was a member the Detroit Free Press team of reporters who won a Pulitzer Prize for  coverage of the 1967 Detroit riots. In addition, he was a recipient of the  George Polk Award for reporting on the Kent State killings in 1970.                      James Joyce and Comparative Literature (V70.0115, call # 76483) Instructor: John Hamilton Thursday, 9:30 a.m.\u201312:15 p.m.          The seminar focuses on Joyce\u2019s first novel, A Portrait of  the Artist as a Young Man (1916), and  situates it within the broad discipline of comparative literature. As a student  of modern languages, Joyce stunningly composed a work of art that recognizes  and is conversant with complex strands of a European tradition that demand  critical attention. In addition to reading and discussing closely what has been  judged as one of the greatest 20th-century novels in English, participants are  invited to delve into this rich inheritance that informs every page. Select  writings from Aristotle, Vergil, Aquinas, Dante, Shakespeare, Milton, Goethe,  Byron, and Flaubert, as well as passages from other works by Joyce, serve to  interrupt and thereby challenge approaches to the novel, in order to  interrogate a host of thematic and theoretical issues: for example,  autobiography and fiction; notions of genius and creativity; characterizations  of childhood and adolescence; and the bold claims of literary modernism. Over  the course of the seminar, students will also be introduced to the basic  premises and methods of literary criticism, including philology, hermeneutics,  intertextuality, narratology, and some general problems in aesthetics and  philosophy.          John Hamilton is Collegiate Professor and  Professor of Comparative Literature and German at New York University. He has  held teaching positions in Classics at the University of California-Santa Cruz  and in Comparative Literature and German at Harvard University. In  2005\u201306, he worked as a resident fellow at the Institute for Advanced  Study (Wissenschaftskolleg) in Berlin. In addition to numerous articles, he has  published Soliciting Darkness: Pindar, Obscurity, and the Classical  Tradition , and Music, Madness,  and the Unworking of Language , and he has  co-edited a volume entitled Radical Philology (forthcoming).                      Russia\u2019s Multicultural Empire (V70.0116; call # 76612) Instructor: Jane Burbank Tuesday, 9:30 a.m.\u201312:00 noon          From the 16th century to the present, \u201cRussia\u201d has been an  empire\u2014a state that spread its power over different peoples, with  different religious commitments, different laws and customs, different  histories. This seminar will explore the qualities of Russia\u2019s kind of empire.  What held the vast territories and populations ruled by tsars and later by  communists together? Why has Russia not disintegrated or been torn apart by  multiple wars among its many ethnic groups since 1991? (Chechnya is an  exception to the quite peaceful breakup of the USSR into fifteen states, all of  them multiethnic.) We will take a historical look at these questions, examining  both how Russian leaders ruled their many populations and how people living on  the terrain of a succession of Russian empires\u2014the Grand Princedom of  Muscovy, Imperial Russia, the Soviet Union, and the Russian  Federation\u2014have imagined their relations with each other and with these  states. Our sources will include historians\u2019 studies, literature, and documents  of many types\u2014games, maps, and laws. Each student will have the chance to  investigate a particular imperial situation, and we will work together to  understand the origins, habits, and effects of Russia\u2019s empires of difference.          Jane Burbank, Collegiate Professor and  Professor of History and of Russian and Slavic Studies, is a historian of  Russia, of empire, and of law. Her early work focused on Russian intellectuals\u2019  interpretations of the revolution of 1917, in her book Intelligentsia and  Revolution: Russian Views of Bolshevism, 1917\u20131922 . Later she turned to Russian law and to how ordinary  people used it. Her book Russian Peasants Go to Court: Legal Culture  in the Countryside, 1905\u20131917 reveals  that rural people, contrary to received opinion, were avid litigators. For a  glimpse at this study, see her NYU website: She recently edited Russian  Empire: Space, People, Power, 1730\u20131930 ,  a collective and international study of Russian empire. At present she is  completing, with Frederick Cooper, a study of empires in world history.                                Welcome!

Introduction          In the fall 2007 semester, the College of Arts and Science  launched its new Collegiate Seminar Program for entering freshmen. These  Collegiate Seminars have several distinctive features. Offered only to freshmen  in the College of Arts and Science, they are taught exclusively by  distinguished senior Arts and Science faculty whose excellence as scholars and  teachers has been recognized by their appointment as Collegiate Professors.  These faculty not only teach these courses but also serve as the students\u2019  mentors throughout their entire undergraduate careers at NYU. During the  semester in which the seminar is offered and in subsequent semesters, the  faculty work with their students to create special enrichment and reunion  activities, which might include a visit with a renowned scholar; a museum,  theater, concert, or film outing; a dinner discussion on a book or poem; or  just a purely social evening.          Like other seminars, these small classes are meant to  introduce students to important subjects and to challenge them intellectually  through rigorous standards of analysis and oral and written argumentation. To  that end, they stress demanding reading and writing assignments that introduce  students to an essential research skill\u2014such as a literature review,  quantitative reasoning, critical use of primary sources, the identification of  a research problem, critical analysis of texts, or confrontations with works of  art. In addition to participating actively in class discussions, students are  expected to give oral presentations in class. A final paper will typically,  though not always, have gone through one or more revisions, perhaps revised  with the benefit of in-class comments. In other seminars the focus may be on  individual or group projects. In applying and registering for one of these seminars,  students are expected to commit themselves to doing honors-level academic work  and to participating actively in co-curricular and mentoring activities beyond  the semester-long course.   Course Descriptions                               The Cultural Nature of Language (V70.0101; call # 74564) Instructor: Bambi Schieffelin Monday and Wednesday, 9:30\u201310:45 a.m.          From accents, pronouns, swearing, and spelling, how one uses  language is never value-free. In this seminar we examine language-using as a  social practice, and analyze how speakers and their language(s) are evaluated  and regulated across a range of contexts and cultures. Starting with how  children learn to talk, or don\u2019t (e.g., feral children), we examine speech and  silence across a range of societies. We look at popular attitudes toward  language and the practices by which people regulate its use in the media (e.g.,  political correctness), in legal and educational institutions (e.g., \u201cEnglish  Only\u201d), and in multilingual cities (e.g., Barcelona, Montreal) in order to understand  how ideas about language are often recruited to non-linguistic concerns, such  as who should be included and who excluded. In thinking about the cultural  nature of language in this way, we critically explore issues of identity and  authority.          Bambi B. Schieffelin, Collegiate Professor  and Professor of Anthropology, is a linguistic anthropologist who has studied  speech practices among Haitians in Queens, N.Y., lawyers and litigants in lower  Manhattan\u2019s Small Claims Court, college students and their use of IM, and  Bosavi people in Papua New Guinea. She is the author of The Give and Take of  Everyday Life: Language Socialization of Kaluli Children . She is co-editor of, among other books, The  Acquisition of Literacy: Ethnographic Perspectives, Language Ideologies:  Practice and Theory and Consequences  of Contact . She has also published articles  in preeminent journals of her field, including Current Anthropology and Annual Review of Anthropology . She is completing a book on the impact of  Christianity on the language and social life of Bosavi people over the past 25  years, and continues research on linguistic creativity and change as evidenced  in computer mediated communication.                      Terrorism, Nihilism, and Modernity (V70.0102; call # 74565) Instructor: James Gilligan Tuesday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m.          The past century has witnessed violence the character and  scale of which are so unique and unprecedented that we have had to create a new  vocabulary to describe it (genocide, terrorism) and the ideologies that  underlie it (totalitarianism, fundamentalism). To understand modern violence,  we will examine the origin of the modern mind in the 17th century, when  science, based on universal doubt, ended the Age of Faith, and the traditional  sources of moral, legal, and political authority lost credibility. Nietzsche  called this the \u201cdeath of God\u201d (and the Devil); it could also be called the  death of Good and Evil, leading to another set of new words (nihilism,  agnosticism, anomie, anarchy). We will study the origins and implications of  these developments by reading Shakespeare and John Donne, Nietzsche and  Dostoevsky, Beckett and Wittgenstein, Simone Weil and Hannah Arendt, as well as  modern mass murderers from Hitler to bin Laden. Finally, we will ask whether  the modern human sciences can help us understand how to reverse or at least  limit this escalation of violence.          James Gilligan, Collegiate Professor, headed  the Institute of Law and Psychiatry and directed mental health programs for the  Massachusetts prison system while on the faculty of the Harvard Medical School  Department of Psychiatry. He has also served as President of the International  Association for Forensic Psychotherapy, and as Chair of the Committee on  Prevention, which was part of President Clinton\u2019s National Campaign Against  Youth Violence. His books include Violence: Reflections on a National  Epidemic and Preventing Violence:  An Agenda for the Coming Century . He has  been a consultant on violence prevention to the World Health Organization\u2019s  Department of Injuries and Violence Prevention, the International Criminal  Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, the Secretary-General of the United  Nations, the Law Lords of the House of Lords, and other groups and individuals  throughout the world.                       Saying and Meaning: Intersections of Poetry and  Philosophy (V70.0103; call # 74566) Instructor: Tom Gerety Tuesday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m.          This seminar will explore the sometimes uncertain boundary  between poetry and philosophy. Every poet is saying something to himself or  herself\u2014as well as to readers. Rarely do poets content themselves with  sounds alone, or even images alone; often they make arguments. Philosophers, on  the other hand, have long been thought to engage their readers, their students,  solely with arguments. Yet from the earliest days, philosophers have used  imagery and myth to make sense of the world and to make \u201carguments\u201d about it.  We will seek to move back and forth, then, between poetry and philosophy, in  order to understand both better. We will read, criticize and, frankly, imitate  several of the most poetic philosophers and philosophic poets. These will  include poets and philosophers both ancient and modern, writing in English as  well as in other languages in translation. Among other themes\u2014such as  language itself, imagination and love\u2014we will pay special attention to  poems with ties to Greenwich Village and to New York City.          Tom Gerety, Collegiate Professor, joined the NYU faculty in 2005, having first come  to NYU two years earlier to head the Brennan Center for Justice at the Law  School. Before then he served as President of Amherst College from 1994 to 2003  and of Trinity College in Hartford, Connecticut, from 1989 to 1994. From 1986  to 1989 he was the Dean and Nippert Professor at the College of Law of the  University of Cincinnati. As a law professor he taught and wrote on  constitutional law and political philosophy, with a special emphasis on First  Amendment freedoms, including speech, privacy, and religious freedom. With Judy  Woodruff, he wrote and narrated a PBS series, Visions of the Constitution , funded by the National Endowment for the  Humanities. He is the author, most recently, of The Freshman Who Hated  Socrates .                      In Search of Lost Time (V70.0104; call # 74567) Instructor: Marcelle Clements Thursday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m.          We will read Proust (in translation) as he should be read:  hedonistically\u2014with respect and admiration but also with delectation. A  prodigious novel, 4,500 pages long, In Search of Lost Time addresses literature\u2019s richest theme:  desire\u2014its remembrance, transformation, perversion, defeat, and final  resurgence in the form of art. More than 100 years old, often said to be the  first modern novel, it remains a dazzling portait of the French beau monde and,  even more, of the power and elegance of its author\u2019s sensibility. It is still  unparalleled in how it combines self-examination with social history,  extraordinary psychological acuity with the study of glamour and decadence, how  it merges an audacious explosion of form with explorations of memory,  attachment, deception, lust, jealousy, ambition, disappointment, and ennui. It  is also one of the most pleasurable and elating reads. Although Marcel Proust  (1871\u20131922) is usually assumed to be France\u2019s greatest novelist, his  prose is so layered and brilliant that, unfortunately, many readers begin at  the beginning and never move past the first fifty pages, reading the same  gorgeous sentences again and again. While In Search of Lost Time\u2019 s prose style (playing on association, evocation,  magnification, punning, rhythm) may have been its most radical contribution to  the art of the novel, it cannot be understood until it has been read once in  its entirety. In this seminar, we will keep moving at a brisk pace through the  work, merely glancing at its riches on our way, until we arrive at the uniquely  euphoric experience of reading the final volume, Time Regained . Required reading: an average of 350 pages per week.          Marcelle Clements is Collegiate Professor  and a Fellow of the New York Institute for the Humanities at NYU. She is the  author of a collection of essays, The Dog Is Us and Other Observations, a book of nonfiction, The Improvised Woman , and of two novels, Rock Me and, most recently, Midsummer . Her numerous articles and essays on the arts,  culture, and politics have appeared in leading national publications.                      Pharmaceutical Drugs, Ethics, and Culture (V70.0105; call # 74568) Instructor: David A. Scicchitano Wednesday, 3:30\u20136:15 p.m.          Why are drug prices often higher in the United States than  in Canada, Europe, and other parts of the world, and what impact does this have  on healthcare? What is \u201cinformed consent\u201d for individuals who elect to  participate in clinical drug tests, and what ethical concerns are raised while  obtaining such consent? This seminar is designed to introduce students to these  and other contemporary issues in the realm of pharmaceuticals, focusing on drug  design, safety, and distribution. Early in the seminar, students are introduced  to the basic concepts of drug research and testing, with an emphasis on the  Food and Drug Administration rules for bringing a drug to the clinic and  eventually to the marketplace. This leads to the complex issues related to drug  distribution inside and outside the United States, the societal implications  associated with developing new therapeutic regimens, and the economic factors  and laws that come into play. The seminar also develops students\u2019 writing,  critical thinking, and presentation skills, with emphasis placed on  researching, evaluating, and presenting evidence.          David A. Scicchitano, Collegiate Professor  and Professor of Biology, also serves as the Director of Undergraduate Research  in the College. His research interests include the way environmental agents,  particularly chemicals, interact with and damage DNA, interfering with  fundamental cellular process, and triggering pathology. He has published  numerous articles in scholarly journals of his field, including Biochemistry , the Journal of Molecular Biology , the Journal of Biological Chemistry , and Environmental Health Perspectives . His research has been funded by grants from the  National Institutes of Health. He has twice won the College\u2019s Golden Dozen  Award for Teaching Excellence, as well as the University\u2019s Distinguished  Teaching Award.                      American Wars, Past and Present: Vietnam and Iraq (V70.0106; call # 74569) Instructor: Marilyn B. Young Wednesday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m.          The course will consider the last major war of the 20th  century and the first major war of the 21st century. The history, memory, and  political uses of the Vietnam War will be the subject of the first part of the  course. The ongoing influence of that war on contemporary politics will occupy  the second part of the course. The way Gulf War I (Operation Desert Storm) was  fought and reported upon was shaped by the specific understanding the  administration of George H. W. Bush had of the Vietnam War. The current war in  the Gulf (Operation Iraqi Freedom) was, of course, shaped by the outcome of the  first Gulf War. But it has also been fought in the shadow of Vietnam analogies  that are used by those who support the war as well as by those who oppose it.  The course will examine these analogies with some care. The overarching concern  of the seminar is the ongoing haunting of American politics\u2014military and  civilian\u2014by a war fought over three decades ago. There are two connected  questions: Can history teach? What does it teach?          Marilyn B. Young, Collegiate Professor and Professor of History, is a former  Chair of the History Department. Her teaching and her writing focus on U.S.  foreign policy. Her books include The Vietnam Wars, 1945\u20131990 , The Rhetoric of Empire: American China  Policy, 1895\u20131901 , Transforming  Russia and China: Revolutionary Struggle in the 20th Century , with William Rosenberg, and Human Rights  and Revolutions , with Lynn Hunt and Jeffrey  Wasserstrom. She has also edited several collections of essays on the recent  wars in Iraq. She was Director of the Project on the Cold War as a Global  Conflict at NYU\u2019s International Center for Advanced Study in 2001\u20132004.  She has been the recipient of a Guggenheim Fellowship and of an American  Council of Learned Societies Fellowship. Twice she has won the College\u2019s Golden  Dozen Award for Teaching Excellence.                      How We See (V70.0109; call # 74572) Instructor: Marisa Carrasco Thursday, 11:00 a.m.\u20131:30 p.m.          Do we see the world the  way we do because we are the way we are or because the world is the way it is?  The ease with which we comprehend the visual world, and recognize objects and  events, makes it tempting to think that the world is just the way we see it and  to take our perceptual capabilities for granted. But when we comprehend that we  cannot process all the information available in the environment, when we try to  build machines that can see, or when we encounter people who have lost some  specific visual capability\u2014for example, persons who can no longer  recognize faces\u2014we realize how extraordinary and intricate are the  machinery and mechanisms of sight. This course looks at what we know about  vision from multiple scientific perspectives: perceptual psychology tells us  about the process of seeing, and provides important insights into the workings  of visual mechanisms; neuropsychology shows us what happens to perception when  these mechanisms malfunction; neuroscience tells us about processes at the  level of cells and neural systems. At the same time, we will discuss modes and  techniques of scientific inquiry from these different perspectives. How do  vision scientists learn? What kinds of experiments do they conduct? How has the  development of new neuroimaging techniques (fMRI, for example) shaped the  field?          Marisa Carrasco is Collegiate Professor and  Professor of Psychology and Neural Science, as well as a former Chair of the  Psychology Department. Born and raised in Mexico City, she received her  licentiate in psychology from the National University of Mexico and her Ph.D.  in psychology (cognition and perception) from Princeton University. She  conducts research in cognitive neuroscience, exploring the relation between the  psychological and neural mechanisms involved in visual perception and  attention.

Her  accomplishments have been recognized by prestigious awards and fellowships  throughout her career, such as an American Association of University Women  Fellowship, a National Young Investigator Award from the National Science  Foundation, a Cattell Fellowship, and a Guggenheim Fellowship.                      Life\u2019s Ends, in Aristotle, Nietzsche, and Darwinism (V70.0110; call # 74573) Instructor: John Richardson Tuesday, 9:30 a.m.\u201312:00 noon          We share a very strong impression that  nature\u2014especially organisms or life\u2014has some kind of purposiveness  or design, is somehow aimed at ends. But we generally take science, and  Darwinian biology in particular, to oppose this first impression and to push  ends or purposes quite out of nature. This course will examine that strong  sense of the teleology (end-directedness) of life or nature, and consider how  it really stands up to a scientific or naturalistic view. Part of our attention  will be historical: we will focus on two very different philosophers, Aristotle  and Nietzsche, who are alike in their very strong allegiance to science, yet also  in their insistence on explaining life by its ends or goals. Why do they so  insist\u2014and Nietzsche even after Darwin? Another part of our attention  will be more contemporary: we will consider what evolutionary theory really  does entail as to whether organisms have ends. We will see how even the most  current science may still leave room for teleology. Readings will be from  Aristotle, Nietzsche, and contemporary philosophy of biology.          John Richardson is Collegiate Professor and  Professor of Philosophy. He specializes in 19th- and 20th-century continental  philosophy. In addition to numerous articles on these topics, he has written  books about Nietzsche ( Nietzsche\u2019s System   and Nietzsche\u2019s New Darwinism )  and Heidegger ( Existential Epistemology: A Heideggerian Critique of  the Cartesian Project ). He is also  co-editor of Nietzsche , a volume  in the Oxford Readings in Philosophy series. He has been a winner of the  College\u2019s Golden Dozen Award for Teaching Excellence.                          Great Science, Fabulous Science, and Voodoo Science (V70.0111; call # 75492) Instructor: Allen Mincer Monday and Wednesday, 11:00 a.m.\u201312:15 p.m. Prerequisites: high school chemistry, physics, and calculus.          Science is often portrayed as following a very clearly  defined set of procedures: start with a hypothesis, do an experiment, and based  on the results reject the hypothesis or adopt it as a working assumption. The  actual process, however, is rarely so straightforward. In addition, the stories  as usually told or recorded may differ from what really happened. We will study  some famous and infamous experiments, mainly in the physical sciences, selected  to illustrate intellectual tours de force, cases of error, cases of fraud, and  the murky boundaries between them. Along the way, issues such as the discarding  of \u201cfaulty data,\u201d theoretical bias, and probabilistic tools for hypothesis  acceptance and rejection will be discussed.          Allen Mincer, Collegiate Professor and  Professor of Physics at NYU, is a former Chair of the Department of Physics. He  specializes in experimental particle physics and particle astrophysics. He is  currently also a member of the ATLAS collaboration, which is studying the  nature of the elementary building blocks of matter at the CERN Large Hadron  Collider in Geneva, Switzerland. His research at NYU has a long, continuous  history of generous support by grants from the National Science Foundation. He  is co-author of approximately 200 scientific publications, including the  discovery of the top quark with the D-Zero collaboration. His interests include  education, and in addition to teaching in the Physics Department he has taught  in the Steinhardt School\u2019s Department of Teaching and Learning, been involved  in research in physics education, and has twice been awarded the CAS Golden  Dozen Award for Teaching Excellence.                      Daily Life in China, 1750\u20131950 (V70.0112; call # 75491) Instructor: Joanna Waley-Cohen Wednesday, 4:55\u20137:30 p.m.          Historians of the West often draw a link between the  development of a consumer society and the onset of modernity, examining  patterns of daily life in such centers as London and Paris from no later than  the 18th century or even earlier. This seminar examines such patterns in the  context of China from the high imperial era through the first half of the 20th  century; the goal is to give students a range of knowledge sufficient to use as  a basis for comparison, and an understanding of the analytical issues involved.  Using a combination of primary documents, fiction, and secondary sources, we  will explore such questions as: What was distinctive about the experience of  urban Chinese in late imperial and early modern times? What was the shape of an  ordinary day? How did architecture reflect gender norms? Who belonged to a  typical household (family members, concubines, servants, etc.), and how did  children learn? What forms did social life take? How was the revering of  ancestors incorporated into family life? What were people\u2019s different work  experiences? How did people acquire necessities such as food and clothing, or  luxuries such as antiques? Other questions that may emerge in the course of the  semester will be taken up as well.          Joanna Waley-Cohen, Collegiate Professor and  Professor of History, has taught the history of China at NYU since 1992. She  received her B.A. and M.A. degrees in Chinese studies from Cambridge University  and her Ph.D. degree in History from Yale University. Her books include The  Sextants of Beijing: Global Currents in Chinese History and The Culture of War: Empire and the  Military under the Qing Dynasty . Currently  she is working on two related projects. The first is a social and cultural  history of cooks and cooking in early modern China. The second uses an account  of an upper-class Chinese household of the 18th century, including family  members, domestic servants, religious advisers, and in-house entertainers, to  illuminate the functioning of social class and gender distinctions in Chinese  daily life in an era of prosperity. Last year she was awarded a Culinary Trust  Harry Bell Grant for research in China.                      Making Sense of Monsters and Masks (V70.0113; call # 75490) Instructor: Judith G. Miller Monday and Wednesday, 11:00 a.m.\u201312:15 p.m.          Among the more significant activities of human beings is  that of giving shape to fears and desires through art. All cultures participate  in this form of emotional exteriorization, including creating through myth and  literature \u201cmonsters\u201d and sculpting in textures and words various types of  \u201cmasks.\u201d In this seminar, we will concentrate on monsters and masks in several  cultures for whom the French language is a major expressive form. We will thus  chart the meaning and impact of the archetypal masked figures of the commedia  dell\u2019arte in French theatre, the obsessive  concern with grotesque person (the monstrous mask) in French romanticism,  zombification and carnival figures in Caribbean cultural forms, and raptor  masks and transformative gu\u00e9risseur s  or healers in Francophone West African works. We will build a repertory of  approaches to interpreting and uncovering the many layers of masking and  monstrousness by reading in anthropology, psychoanalysis, aesthetics, and  literary theory: For as interesting as the masks and monsters \u201cpeopling\u201d the  world are the ways in which humans at various points in time have attempted to  understand what making masks and monsters means. (All readings will be in  English.)          Judith G. Miller, Collegiate Professor and  Professor of French, is Chair of NYU\u2019s French Department.

Finding New York City (V70.0114; call # 75904) Instructor: William Serrin Thursday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m.          In this seminar students explore, read and write about, and  develop a deep understanding of New York City, from diverse perspectives and by  means of various media. They will venture into different neighborhoods, ethnic  areas, all five boroughs, out on the Hudson and East River, restaurants, parks,  and the like. They will examine New York history, and how the city has changed  over the decades, writing about what they see and find. In the end all should  have an understanding of how New York City began, how it has changed over time,  what remains from the old days, what new things are happening, and what the  future might be. It is, in short, a course in urban America that takes New York  City as its laboratory. The seminar will turn to some of the splendid books  that deal with important aspects of the city. It will also consider how the  image of New York City in the movies has changed over the decades, drawing, in  part, on the book Celluloid Skyline . In  addition, it will use parts of the Ken Burns PBS documentary series New  York City .          William Serrin is Collegiate Professor and Associate Professor of Journalism. Before  joining NYU, he was for eight years the labor and workplace correspondent for  the New York Times . He has  written for numerous magazines, including Newsweek , Atlantic Monthly, American Heritage , andthe Nation , as well as  the Columbia Journalism Review   and the Village Voice .

In addition, he was a recipient of the  George Polk Award for reporting on the Kent State killings in 1970.                      James Joyce and Comparative Literature (V70.0115, call # 76483) Instructor: John Hamilton Thursday, 9:30 a.m.\u201312:15 p.m.          The seminar focuses on Joyce\u2019s first novel, A Portrait of  the Artist as a Young Man (1916), and  situates it within the broad discipline of comparative literature. As a student  of modern languages, Joyce stunningly composed a work of art that recognizes  and is conversant with complex strands of a European tradition that demand  critical attention. In addition to reading and discussing closely what has been  judged as one of the greatest 20th-century novels in English, participants are  invited to delve into this rich inheritance that informs every page. Select  writings from Aristotle, Vergil, Aquinas, Dante, Shakespeare, Milton, Goethe,  Byron, and Flaubert, as well as passages from other works by Joyce, serve to  interrupt and thereby challenge approaches to the novel, in order to  interrogate a host of thematic and theoretical issues: for example,  autobiography and fiction; notions of genius and creativity; characterizations  of childhood and adolescence; and the bold claims of literary modernism. Over  the course of the seminar, students will also be introduced to the basic  premises and methods of literary criticism, including philology, hermeneutics,  intertextuality, narratology, and some general problems in aesthetics and  philosophy.          John Hamilton is Collegiate Professor and  Professor of Comparative Literature and German at New York University. He has  held teaching positions in Classics at the University of California-Santa Cruz  and in Comparative Literature and German at Harvard University. In  2005\u201306, he worked as a resident fellow at the Institute for Advanced  Study (Wissenschaftskolleg) in Berlin. In addition to numerous articles, he has  published Soliciting Darkness: Pindar, Obscurity, and the Classical  Tradition , and Music, Madness,  and the Unworking of Language , and he has  co-edited a volume entitled Radical Philology (forthcoming).                      Russia\u2019s Multicultural Empire (V70.0116; call # 76612) Instructor: Jane Burbank Tuesday, 9:30 a.m.\u201312:00 noon          From the 16th century to the present, \u201cRussia\u201d has been an  empire\u2014a state that spread its power over different peoples, with  different religious commitments, different laws and customs, different  histories. This seminar will explore the qualities of Russia\u2019s kind of empire.  What held the vast territories and populations ruled by tsars and later by  communists together? Why has Russia not disintegrated or been torn apart by  multiple wars among its many ethnic groups since 1991? (Chechnya is an  exception to the quite peaceful breakup of the USSR into fifteen states, all of  them multiethnic.) We will take a historical look at these questions, examining  both how Russian leaders ruled their many populations and how people living on  the terrain of a succession of Russian empires\u2014the Grand Princedom of  Muscovy, Imperial Russia, the Soviet Union, and the Russian  Federation\u2014have imagined their relations with each other and with these  states. Our sources will include historians\u2019 studies, literature, and documents  of many types\u2014games, maps, and laws. Each student will have the chance to  investigate a particular imperial situation, and we will work together to  understand the origins, habits, and effects of Russia\u2019s empires of difference.          Jane Burbank, Collegiate Professor and  Professor of History and of Russian and Slavic Studies, is a historian of  Russia, of empire, and of law. Her early work focused on Russian intellectuals\u2019  interpretations of the revolution of 1917, in her book Intelligentsia and  Revolution: Russian Views of Bolshevism, 1917\u20131922 . Later she turned to Russian law and to how ordinary  people used it. Her book Russian Peasants Go to Court: Legal Culture  in the Countryside, 1905\u20131917 reveals  that rural people, contrary to received opinion, were avid litigators. For a  glimpse at this study, see her NYU website: She recently edited Russian  Empire: Space, People, Power, 1730\u20131930 ,  a collective and international study of Russian empire. At present she is  completing, with Frederick Cooper, a study of empires in world history.                                Welcome!

Introduction    In the fall 2007 semester, the College of Arts and Science is launching a new Collegiate Seminar Program for entering freshmen. These Collegiate Seminars have several distinctive features. Offered only to freshmen in the College of Arts and Science, they are taught exclusively by distinguished senior Arts and Science faculty whose excellence as scholars and teachers has been recognized by their appointment as Collegiate Professors. In addition, these faculty will not only teach these courses but also serve as the students\u2019 mentors throughout their entire undergraduate careers at NYU. During the semester in which the seminar is offered and in subsequent semesters, the faculty will work with their students to create special enrichment and reunion activities, which might include a visit with a renowned scholar; a museum, theater, concert, or film outing; a dinner discussion on a book or poem; or just a purely social evening.    Like other seminars, these small classes are meant to introduce students to important subjects and to challenge them intellectually through rigorous standards of analysis and oral and written argumentation. To that end, they stress demanding readings and writing assignments that introduce students to an essential research skill\u2014such as a literature review, quantitative reasoning, critical use of primary sources, the identification of a research problem, critical analysis of texts, or confrontations with works of art. In addition to participating actively in class discussions, students are expected to give oral presentations in class. A final paper will typically, though not always, have gone through one or more revisions, perhaps revised with the benefit of in-class comments. In other seminars the focus may be on individual or group projects.    In applying and registering for one of these seminars, students are expected to commit themselves to doing honors-level academic work and to participating actively in co-curricular and mentoring activities beyond the semester-long course.        Course Descriptions       The Cultural Nature of Language (V70.0101; call # 75854) Instructor: Bambi Schieffelin Monday and Wednesday, 9:30\u201310:45 a.m.    From accents, pronouns, swearing, and spelling, how one uses language is never value-free. In this seminar we examine language-using as a social practice, and analyze how speakers and their language(s) are evaluated and regulated across a range of contexts and cultures. Starting with how children learn to talk, or don\u2019t (e.g., feral children), we examine speech and silence across a range of societies. We look at popular attitudes toward language and the practices by which people regulate its use in the media (e.g., political correctness), in legal and educational institutions (e.g., \u201cEnglish Only\u201d), and in multilingual cities (e.g., Barcelona, Montreal) in order to understand how ideas about language are often recruited to non-linguistic concerns, such as who should be included and who excluded. In thinking about the cultural nature of language in this way, we critically explore issues of identity and authority.    Bambi Schieffelin, Collegiate Professor and Professor of Anthropology, is a linguistic anthropologist who has studied speech practices among Haitians (Queens, N.Y.), lawyers and litigants in lower Manhattan\u2019s Small Claims Court, and Bosavi people (Papua New Guinea). She is the author of The Give and Take of Everyday Life: Language Socialization of Kaluli Children . She is coeditor of, among other books, The Acquisition of Literacy: Ethnographic Perspectives , Language Socialization across Cultures , and Language Ideologies: Practice and Theory . She has also published articles in preeminent journals of her field, including Current Anthropology and Annual Review of Anthropology . Her current book project focuses on the impact of evangelical Christianity on the language and social life of Bosavi people over the past 25 years.    Terrorism, Nihilism, and Modernity (V70.0102; call # 76145) Instructor: James Gilligan Tuesday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m.    The past century has witnessed violence the character and scale of which are so unique and unprecedented that we have had to create a new vocabulary to describe it (genocide, terrorism) and the ideologies that underlie it (totalitarianism, fundamentalism). To understand modern violence, we will examine the origin of the modern mind in the 17th century, when science, based on universal doubt, ended the Age of Faith, and the traditional sources of moral, legal, and political authority lost credibility. Nietzsche called this the \u201cdeath of God\u201d (and the Devil); it could also be called the death of Good and Evil, leading to another set of new words (nihilism, agnosticism, anomie, anarchy). We will study the origins and implications of these developments by reading Shakespeare and John Donne, Nietzsche and Dostoevsky, Beckett and Wittgenstein, Simone Weil and Hannah Arendt, as well as modern mass murderers from Hitler to bin Laden. Finally, we will ask whether the modern human sciences can help us understand how to reverse or at least limit this escalation of violence.    James Gilligan, Collegiate Professor, headed the Institute of Law and Psychiatry and directed mental health programs for the Massachusetts prison system while on the faculty of the Harvard Medical School Department of Psychiatry. He has also served as Director of the Center for the Study of Violence and as a member of President Clinton\u2019s National Commission on Youth Violence. His books include Violence: Our Deadly Epidemic and Its Causes , Violence: Reflections on a National Epidemic , and Preventing Violence: An Agenda for the Coming Century . He has been a consultant to the Department of Injuries and Violence Prevention at the World Health Organization, the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, and numerous other organizations.    Saying and Meaning: Intersections of Poetry and Philosophy (V70.0103; call # 75903) Instructor: Tom Gerety Tuesday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m.    This seminar will explore the sometimes uncertain boundary between poetry and philosophy. Every poet is saying something to himself or herself\u2014as well as to readers. Rarely do poets content themselves with sounds alone, or even images alone; often they make arguments. Philosophers, on the other hand, have long been thought to engage their readers, their students, solely with arguments. Yet from the earliest days, philosophers have used imagery and myth to make sense of the world and to make \u201carguments\u201d about it. We will seek to move back and forth, then, between poetry and philosophy, in order to understand both better. We will read, criticize, and, frankly, imitate several of the most poetic philosophers and philosophic poets. These will include poets and philosophers both ancient and modern, writing in English as well as in other languages in translation. Among the authors we are likely to consider will be Sappho and Heraclitus, Plato, the Metaphysical and Romantic poets, Baudelaire, Rilke, Nietzsche, Wittgenstein, Yeats, Stevens, Eliot, and Pessoa, as well as several contemporary poets.    Tom Gerety, Collegiate Professor, joined the NYU faculty in 2005, having first come to NYU two years earlier to head the Brennan Center for Justice at the Law School. Before then he served as President of Amherst College from 1994 to 2003 and of Trinity College in Hartford, Connecticut, from 1989 to 1994. From 1986 to 1989 he was the Dean and Nippert Professor at the College of Law of the University of Cincinnati. As a law professor he taught and wrote on constitutional law and political philosophy, with a special emphasis on First Amendment freedoms, including speech, privacy, and religious freedom. With Judy Woodruff, he wrote and narrated a PBS series, Visions of the Constitution , funded by the National Endowment for the Humanities.    In Search of Lost Time (V70.0104; call # 75902) Instructor: Marcelle Clements Wednesday, 11:00 a.m.\u20131:30 p.m.    We will read Proust (in translation) as he should be read: hedonistically\u2014with respect and admiration but also with delectation. A prodigious novel, 4,500 pages long, In Search of Lost Time addresses literature\u2019s richest theme: desire\u2014its remembrance, transformation, perversion, defeat, and final resurgence in the form of art. More than 100 years old, often said to be the first modern novel, it remains a dazzling social history of the French beau monde and, even more, of the power and elegance of its author\u2019s sensibility. It is still unparalleled in how it combines self-examination with social history, extraordinary psychological acuity with the study of glamour and decadence, how it merges an audacious explosion of form with explorations of memory, attachment, deception, lust, jealousy, ambition, disappointment, and ennui. It is also one of the most pleasurable and elating reads. But although Marcel Proust (1871\u20131922) is usually assumed to be France\u2019s greatest novelist, his prose is so layered and brilliant that, unfortunately, many readers begin at the beginning and never move past the first 50 pages, reading the same gorgeous sentences again and again. But while In Search of Lost Time \u2019s prose style (playing on association, evocation, magnification, punning, rhythm) may have been its most radical contribution to the art of the novel, it cannot be understood until it has been read once in its entirety. In this seminar, we will keep moving at a brisk pace through the work, merely glancing at its riches on our way, until we arrive at the uniquely euphoric experience of reading the final volume, Time Regained . Required reading: an average of 350 pages per week.    Marcelle Clements is Collegiate Professor and a Fellow of the New York Institute for the Humanities at NYU. Her articles and essays on the arts, culture, and politics have appeared in many national publications, including the New York Times , the Washington Post , Newsday , the Village Voice , Elle , Mademoiselle , Ms. , Rolling Stone , Mirabella , Harper\u2019s Bazaar , Esquire , and Premiere . She is the author of a collection of essays, The Dog Is Us and Other Observations ; a book of nonfiction, The Improvised Woman: Single Women Reinventing Single Life ; and two novels, Rock Me and, most recently, Midsummer .    Pharmaceutical Drugs, Ethics, and Culture (V70.0105; call # 76056) Instructor: David A. Scicchitano Friday, 9:30 a.m.\u201312:00 noon    This seminar is designed to introduce students to contemporary issues in the realm of pharmaceuticals, focusing on drug design, safety, and distribution. Early in the seminar, students are introduced to the basic concepts of drug research and testing, with an emphasis on the Food and Drug Administration rules for bringing a drug to the clinic and eventually to the marketplace. This leads to the complex issues related to drug distribution inside and outside the United States, the societal implications associated with new therapeutic regimens, and the economic factors and laws that come into play. The seminar also develops students\u2019 writing, critical thinking, and presentation skills, with emphasis placed on researching, evaluating, and presenting evidence.    David A. Scicchitano, Collegiate Professor and Professor of Biology, also serves as the Director of Undergraduate Research in the College. His research interests include the way environmental agents, particularly chemicals, interact with and damage DNA, interfering with fundamental cellular process, and triggering pathology. He has published numerous articles in scholarly journals of his field, including Biochemistry , the Journal of Molecular Biology , the Journal of Biological Chemistry , and Environmental Health Perspectives . His research is funded by grants from the National Institutes of Health. He has twice won the College\u2019s Golden Dozen Award for Excellence in Teaching, as well as the University\u2019s Distinguished Teaching Award.    American Wars, Past and Present: Vietnam and Iraq (V70.0106; call # 76057) Instructor: Marilyn B. Young Wednesday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m.    The course will consider the last major war of the 20th century and the first major war of the 21st century. The history, memory, and political uses of the Vietnam War will be the subject of the first part of the course. The ongoing influence of that war on contemporary politics will occupy the second part of the course. The way Gulf War I (Operation Desert Storm) was fought and reported upon was shaped by the specific understanding the administration of George H. W. Bush had of the Vietnam War. The current war in the Gulf (Operation Iraqi Freedom) was, of course, shaped by the outcome of the first Gulf War. But it has also been fought in the shadow of Vietnam analogies that are used by those who support the war as well as by those who oppose it. The course will examine these analogies with some care. The overarching concern of the seminar is the ongoing haunting of American politics\u2014military and civilian\u2014by a war fought over three decades ago. There are two connected questions: Can history teach? What does it teach?    Marilyn B. Young, Collegiate Professor and Professor of History, is a former Chair of the History Department. Her teaching and her writing focus on U.S. foreign policy. Her books include The Vietnam Wars, 1945\u20131990 , The Rhetoric of Empire: American China Policy, 1895\u20131901 , Transforming Russia and China: Revolutionary Struggle in the 20th Century , with William Rosenberg, and Human Rights and Revolutions , with Lynn Hunt and Jeffrey Wasserstrom. She has also edited several collections of essays on the recent wars in Iraq. She was Director of the Project on the Cold War as a Global Conflict at NYU\u2019s International Center for Advanced Study in 2001\u20132004. She has been the recipient of a Guggenheim Fellowship and of an American Council of Learned Societies Fellowship.

Zoo\u00ebsis: Animal Acts for Changing Times (V70.0107; call # 76169) Instructor: Una Chaudhuri Thursday, 9:30 a.m.\u201312:00 noon    The emerging field of animal studies has already generated neologisms in various disciplines: \u201canthrozoology\u201d (culture studies), \u201czoopolis\u201d (urban social theory), and \u201czoontology\u201d (philosophy). To these the fields of literature and performance studies propose an addition\u2014\u201czoo\u00ebsis,\u201d to refer to the history of animal representation that stretches, in the Western literary tradition, from Aesop\u2019s Fables to Will Self\u2019s Great Apes ; in the Western dramatic tradition, from Aristophanes\u2019 The Frogs to Albee\u2019s The Goat; in film, from Muybridge\u2019s \u201czoogyroscope\u201d to Herzog\u2019s Grizzly Man ; in popular culture, from Mickey Mouse to Animal Planet ;and in popular performance from gladiatorial contests to Siegfried and Roy. To speak of zoo\u00ebsis is also to acknowledge the manifold performances engendered by cultural animal practices such as pet-keeping, dog shows, equitation, rodeo, bull-fighting, animal sacrifice, scientific experimentation, taxidermy, hunting, fur-wearing, meat-eating\u2014each with its own archive and repertory, its own performers and spectators. In this course we will study recent films, novels, plays, and cultural events that reveal how our interaction with animals shapes our understanding of the human, our approach to the \u201cOther\u201d (including the racial and ethnic Other), and our attitude toward the world.    Una Chaudhuri, Collegiate Professor and Professor of English and of Drama, has served as chair of both the Department of English in the Faculty of Arts and Science and of the Department of Drama at the Tisch School of the Arts. She is the author of No Man\u2019s Stage: A Semiotic Study of Jean Genet\u2019s Plays and Staging Place: The Geography of Modern Drama , editor of Rachel\u2019s Brain and Other Storms: The Performance Scripts of Rachel Rosenthal , and coeditor, with Elinor Fuchs, of the critical anthology Land/Scape/Theater . Her current work explores the intersections of performance studies and the emerging field of animal studies, on which she just guest-edited a special issue of TDR: The Journal of Performance Studies. She has won both the College\u2019s Golden Dozen Award for Excellence in Teaching and the University\u2019s Distinguished Teaching Award.    Matter, Dark Matter, and Dark Energy (V70.0108; call # 76204) Instructor: Glennys Farrar Monday and Wednesday, 3:30\u20134:45 p.m.    The past several decades have seen tremendous advances in observational cosmology. As a result we understand in remarkable detail many aspects of the evolution and the contents of the universe. This course will focus on three of the most puzzling facts about the universe: Why was there a slight excess of matter over antimatter after the Big Bang? (Otherwise, after matter\u2013antimatter annihilation was complete, no matter would have been left.) What is dark matter? (Although on average in the universe it is five times more abundant than normal matter, we know that it is something not found on Earth or, so far, observed in our laboratories.) What is the so-called dark energy? (The expansion rate of the universe is actually accelerating, rather than slowing down as was expected, a finding that is attributed to some new component of the universe known as dark energy.) Students enrolling in the seminar should either have had AP Physics, be enrolled in Physics I (V83.0091), or have permission of the instructor.    Glennys Farrar, Collegiate Professor and Professor of Physics, is Director of NYU\u2019s Center for Cosmology and Particle Physics. Before coming to NYU in 1998 as Chair of the Physics Department, she was on the faculties of the California Institute of Technology and Rutgers University and a member of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton. Her current work focuses mainly on problems at the intersection of astrophysics, cosmology, and particle physics, including ultra\u2013high energy cosmic rays, the nature of dark matter and dark energy, and the origin of the asymmetry between matter and antimatter. Her research has been supported by grants from the National Science Foundation.    How We See (V70.0109; call # 76230) Instructor: Marisa Carrasco Thursday, 9:30 a.m.\u201312:00 noon    Do we see the world the way we do because we are the way we are or because the world is the way it is? The ease with which we comprehend the visual world, and recognize objects and events, makes it tempting to think that the world is just the way we see it and to take our perceptual capabilities for granted. But when we comprehend that we cannot process all the information available in the environment, when we try to build machines that can see, or when we encounter people who have lost some specific visual capability\u2014for example, persons who can no longer recognize faces\u2014we realize how extraordinary and intricate are the machinery and mechanisms of sight. This course looks at what we know about vision from multiple scientific perspectives: perceptual psychology tells us about the process of seeing, and provides important insights into the workings of visual mechanisms; neuropsychology shows us what happens to perception when these mechanisms malfunction; neuroscience tells us about processes at the level of cells and neural systems. At the same time, we will discuss modes and techniques of scientific inquiry from these different perspectives. How do vision scientists learn? What kinds of experiments do they conduct? How has the development of new neuroimaging techniques (fMRI, for example) shaped the field?    Marisa Carrasco is Collegiate Professor and Professor of Psychology and Neural Science, as well as Chair of the Psychology Department. Born and raised in Mexico City, she received her licentiate in psychology from the National University of Mexico and her Ph.D. in psychology (cognition and perception) from Princeton University. She conducts research in cognitive neuroscience, exploring the relation between the psychological and neural mechanisms involved in visual perception and attention. She has published many papers in the most prominent scientific journals in perception, in particular, and in science, in general. Her accomplishments have been recognized by prestigious awards and fellowships throughout her career, such as an American Association of University Women Fellowship, a National Young Investigator Award from the National Science Foundation, a Cattell Fellowship, and a Guggenheim Fellowship.    Life\u2019s Ends, in Aristotle, Nietzsche, and Darwinism (V70.0110; call # 76245) Instructor: John Richardson Wednesday, 9:30 a.m.\u201312:00 noon    We share a very strong impression that nature\u2014especially organisms or life\u2014has some kind of purposiveness or design, is somehow aimed at ends. But we generally take science, and Darwinian biology in particular, to oppose this first impression and to push ends or purposes quite out of nature. This course will examine that strong sense of the teleology (end-directedness) of life or nature, and consider how it really stands up to a scientific or naturalistic view. Part of our attention will be historical: we will focus on two very different philosophers, Aristotle and Nietzsche, who are alike in their very strong allegiance to science, yet also in their insistence on explaining life by its ends or goals. Why do they so insist\u2014and Nietzsche even after Darwin? Another part of our attention will be more contemporary: we will consider what evolutionary theory really does entail as to whether organisms have ends. We will see how even the most current science may still leave room for teleology. Readings will be from Aristotle, Nietzsche, and contemporary philosophy of biology.    John Richardson is Collegiate Professor and Professor of Philosophy. He specializes in 19th- and 20th-century continental philosophy. In addition to numerous articles on these topics, he has written books about Nietzsche ( Nietzsche\u2019s System and Nietzsche\u2019s New Darwinism ) and Heidegger ( Existential Epistemology: A Heideggerian Critique of the Cartesian Project ). He is also coeditor of Nietzsche , a volume in the Oxford Readings in Philosophy series. He has been a winner of the College\u2019s Golden Dozen Award for Excellence in Teaching.                       Welcome!
