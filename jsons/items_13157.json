Future research could include understanding the forces that drive lottery-ticket purchases, what prompts risk-taking behaviors by cab drivers, or identifying the intersections at which pedestrians are most likely to jaywalk\u2014and why.    IISDM will draw upon resources at existing NYU schools and centers\u2014the Center for Urban Science and Progress (CUSP), the Stern School of Business, and Langone Medical Center\u2014as well as NYU\u2019s Faculty of Arts and Science and its global academic centers and campuses in Abu Dhabi and Shanghai.    \u201cWith access to the massive data streams flowing through the City of New York, IISDM has the opportunity to test models and policies developed by scholars at a previously unimaginable scale,\u201d adds Glimcher. \u201cMoreover, NYU\u2019s unique assets offer an unparalleled opportunity to unite scholars studying decision-making in a synergy that would be possible nowhere else.\u201d      In 2013, NYU launched an Initiative in Data Science and Statistics, which aims to harness today\u2019s torrent of data in order to make advances in medicine, science, technology, business, and a range of other fields. The university-wide effort has included the creation of the Center for Data Science and a masters-degree program in this emerging academic discipline.

We focus on helping writer/directors develop a narrative voice and the technical virtuosity to express that voice in cinema. Our students learn by doing -- writing scripts, directing and producing films and exercises, shooting and crewing on each other's projects. Every student has an opportunity to make a minimum of five movies while at NYU. The program confers a Masters of Fine Arts degree. The Graduate Film Program encompasses both fiction and documentary filmmaking. Each semester, courses in screenwriting, directing, aesthetics, acting, cinematography, editing, producing, and sound design compliment specific filmmaking projects that provide hands-on training. Our students are well-prepared to transition into the professional world with a range of technical skills which often lead to employment in the industry, a reel of short films which can serve as calling cards, and a feature film script. The Graduate Film Program offers a stimulating and challenging creative community. Our faculty are working professionals in the industry who are committed to developing the next generation of filmmakers. Recent guest lecturers have included David Mamet, Ang Lee, Anthony Minghella, Melvin Van Peebles, Jodie Foster and John Sayles. The student body is a diverse group from all over the world with a range of creative experience including filmmaking, theater, and photography. Admission to NYU's Graduate Film Program is highly selective, enrolling only 36 new students per year.

Future research could include understanding the forces that drive lottery-ticket purchases, what prompts risk-taking behaviors by cab drivers, or identifying the intersections at which pedestrians are most likely to jaywalk\u2014and why.    IISDM will draw upon resources at existing NYU schools and centers\u2014the Center for Urban Science and Progress (CUSP), the Stern School of Business, and Langone Medical Center\u2014as well as NYU\u2019s Faculty of Arts and Science and its global academic centers and campuses in Abu Dhabi and Shanghai.    \u201cWith access to the massive data streams flowing through the City of New York, IISDM has the opportunity to test models and policies developed by scholars at a previously unimaginable scale,\u201d adds Glimcher. \u201cMoreover, NYU\u2019s unique assets offer an unparalleled opportunity to unite scholars studying decision-making in a synergy that would be possible nowhere else.\u201d      In 2013, NYU launched an Initiative in Data Science and Statistics, which aims to harness today\u2019s torrent of data in order to make advances in medicine, science, technology, business, and a range of other fields. The university-wide effort has included the creation of the Center for Data Science and a masters-degree program in this emerging academic discipline.

We focus on helping writer/directors develop a narrative voice and the technical virtuosity to express that voice in cinema. Our students learn by doing -- writing scripts, directing and producing films and exercises, shooting and crewing on each other's projects. Every student has an opportunity to make a minimum of five movies while at NYU. The program confers a Masters of Fine Arts degree. The Graduate Film Program encompasses both fiction and documentary filmmaking. Each semester, courses in screenwriting, directing, aesthetics, acting, cinematography, editing, producing, and sound design compliment specific filmmaking projects that provide hands-on training. Our students are well-prepared to transition into the professional world with a range of technical skills which often lead to employment in the industry, a reel of short films which can serve as calling cards, and a feature film script. The Graduate Film Program offers a stimulating and challenging creative community. Our faculty are working professionals in the industry who are committed to developing the next generation of filmmakers. Recent guest lecturers have included David Mamet, Ang Lee, Anthony Minghella, Melvin Van Peebles, Jodie Foster and John Sayles. The student body is a diverse group from all over the world with a range of creative experience including filmmaking, theater, and photography. Admission to NYU's Graduate Film Program is highly selective, enrolling only 36 new students per year.

As of March 1 we became a University-wide Institute drawing together interdisciplinary scholars of decision making from across NYU&#8217;s 3 international portals, 11 study abroad sites and academic schools in New York ranging from the School of Medicine to the School of Engineering. The IISDM will continue the many ground-breaking programs of the Center for Neuroeconomics while developing a host of inter-school initiatives that will extend the depth and reach of scholarship in the decision-sciences here at NYU.
