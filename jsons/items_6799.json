Aussies famously describe their nation as the lucky country, yet from the Indigenous perspective, it might more aptly be called the stolen country. Australia is the land of the fair go, which cruelly detains refugees; a multicultural nation with a history of a white Australia policy; a place with distinctive local traditions, which takes many of its cues from global culture; an easy-going country with a surprisingly large degree of governmental control over individual liberties; a highly urbanised population that romances the Bush and the Outback as embodying \u2018real\u2019 Australia; a nation proud of its traditions of egalitarianism and mateship, with numerous rules about who is allowed in \u2018the club\u2019; a society with a history of anti-British and anti-American sentiment that simultaneously hold strong political allegiances and military pacts with Britain and the USA; and a place with a history of progressive social policy and a democratic tradition, which has never undergone a revolution. This course strives to make sense of Australian society and culture by exploring the complexities and contradictions in Australia\u2019s self-image.   The course will be introduced with an overview, and followed by four sessions covering four distinct themes during Orientation and the first three weeks of semester. Each session will include a 1-hour lecture, either given by the instructor or a guest lecturer, and a recitation-style discussion. There are seven mandatory field trips: Sydney Harbour Cruise, Rocks Walking Tour, The Blue Mountains, Featherdale Wildlife Park, Balmain Bowling Club Lawn Bowls, Overnight trip to Inglevale Farm, and the NYU World Tour.

The role of anthropology in the representation and governance of Indigenous life is itself an important subject for anthropological inquiry, considering that Indigenous people of Australia have long been the objects of interest and imagination by outsiders for their cultural formulations of kinship, ritual, art, gender, and politics. These representations\u2014in feature films about them (such as Rabbit-Proof Fence and Australia), New Age Literature (such as Mutant Message Down Under), or museum exhibitions (such as in the Museum of Sydney or the Australian Museum)\u2014are now also in dialogue with Indigenous forms of cultural production, in genres as diverse as film, television, drama, dance, art and writing. The course will explore how Aboriginal people have struggled to reproduce themselves and their traditions on their own terms, asserting their right to forms of cultural autonomy and self-determination. Through the examination of ethnographic and historical texts, films, archives and Indigenous life-writing accounts, we will consider the ways in which Aboriginalities are being challenged and constructed in contemporary Australia.   The course will consist of lectures interspersed with discussions, student presentations, and films/other media; we may also have guest presenters.

It focuses on some of the regional and historical variations of Aboriginal art in the context of the history of a settler nation, while considering the issues of its circulation and evaluation within contemporary discourses of value. Topics include the cosmological dimensions of the art, its political implications, its relationship to cultural identity, and its aesthetic frameworks. Students will visit some of the major national collections of Indigenous Australian art as well as exhibitions of contemporary works. There will also be guest presentations from Indigenous artists and Indigenous art curators.

The main topics of the course are time value of money, portfolio selection, equilibrium asset pricing (CAPM), equity valuation, arbitrage pricing, fixed income securities and derivatives. You are expected to understand valuation formulas and be able to apply them to new problems. The appropriate tools necessary for solving these problems will be developed at each stage and practiced in the homework assignments. The models we will cover have immediate applications and implications for real-world financial decisions. Every effort will be made to relate the course material to current financial news.   Throughout the course the emphasis will be on two main areas: learning conceptual knowledge through theory and problem solving; and critical thinking through the application of real-life scenarios and local cases. The course will incorporate aspects of Australian securities market and financial institutions and a comparative approach will be adopted in demonstrating similarities and differences between the U.S. capital market and the Australian capital market.   Sample Syllabus                                                                    Introduction to Marketing - MKTG-UB 9001 - 4 points                               This course introduces students to the concepts and skills needed to create and critique effective marketing. Marketers in all organisations require an understanding of the many facets of marketing, beyond simply advertising or communications. The American Marketing Association defines marketing as:   \u201cMarketing is the activity, set of institutions, and processes for creating, communicating, delivering, and exchanging offerings that have value for customers, clients, partners, and society at large.\u201d   The course focuses on the role of marketing and its importance in contemporary organisations and society. During the session, students will critically explore marketing principles, concepts and models from a practical perspective. Beyond studying the theory of marketing, students will analyse a variety of real-world examples and case studies. Organisations need to create a balanced, coordinated marketing mix, where all elements of its marketing activities work together. Marketing also requires combining qualitative and quantitative analysis to gain an understanding and reveal insights into the internal and external environment. To achieve this, the course uses a combination of lectures, class discussion, case studies, assignments and exams. The remainder of this syllabus describes the course and students responsibilities.   Sample Syllabus                                Child and Adolescent Mental Health Studies                                                    Child and Adolescent Psychopathology - CAMS-UA 9101 - 4 points                               Prerequisite: PSYCH-UA 1/Intro to Psychology   While psychopathology courses are commonplace among undergraduate psychology curricula, courses focusing on child and adolescent psychopathology are relatively rare. More novel still is the opportunity to receive instruction in child and adolescent psycho pathology from practicing psychiatrists and psychologists at an internationally renowned clinical and research center. Through lecture presentations and discussions, this course will focus on disease etiology, epidemiology, phenomenology, nosology, and diagnosis. We will engage students in a critical review of common child and adolescent psychopathology and challenge social and cultural assumptions of what constitutes \u201cnormal\u201d vs. \u201cpathological\u201d behavior, cognition, and emotion.   Sample Syllabus                        College Core Curriculum          Registration priority for CORE courses will be given to NYU College of Arts and Sciences (CAS) students. Other students will be able to register as space remains available. Please pay close attention to course notes displayed in Albert.                                                          Expressive Culture: Film - CORE-UA 9750 - 4 points                               How has Australian cinema engaged with significant and often contested historical, political and cultural events in the nation\u2019s past? The films in this course offer critical perspectives on the history of colonisation in Australia; the legacies of the Stolen Generations; the controversies surrounding Australia\u2019s role in World War One; as well as Australia\u2019s relationships with its Pacific Asian neighbours. We will focus on films that have marked significant shifts in public consciousness about the past such as Gallipoli (1981), Rabbit-Proof Fence (2002) and Balibo (2009). We will also draw on films that have employed innovative narrative and aesthetic strategies for exploring the relationship between the past and the present such as Ten Canoes (2006) and The Tracker (2002). Throughout the course, students will develop their understanding of the basic methods and concepts of cinema studies. In particular, students will develop a critical vocabulary for analysing how filmmakers have approached the use of memory, testimony, re-enactment, researched detail, allegory and archives across a diverse range of examples.

We will engage with a diverse range of readings \u2013 featuring many Australian authors \u2013 and discuss technical elements and affective poetics to learn how to \u2018read as a writer\u2019. Weeks are devoted to crafting the short story and poetry. Students will complete weekly \u2018microfiction\u2019 homework exercises based upon images they take or find, and participate in in-class writing exercises, all of which will contribute to the writing journal submitted with the final work. The class emphasises the importance of embodied interaction with the city through a field trip using \u2018The Disappearing\u2019 \u2013 a downloadable app featuring over 100 site-specific poems spanning a \u2018poetic map\u2019 of Sydney, created by The Red Room Company. Students will think about the possibilities of marrying new technologies with writing as they navigate using poems as landmarks. Students workshop their drafts during the course, learning how to effectively communicate critical feedback and how to be receptive to constructive critique. This takes the form of a discussion in-class and students are required to submit written critical feedback on their classmates\u2019 drafts in an online forum. At the end of the course students will have the opportunity to showcase their work at a reading night to the rest of the NYU Sydney student body and invited faculty.

In addition to major texts from Australia and New Zealand, we will also encounter a range of works from Malaysia, Singapore, the Philippines, and the Pacific islands. Some questions we will tackle include: How have the cultural, historical, and economic processes of colonialism, diaspora and migration connected and shaped this diverse region? How have issues of race and indigeneity been central to various discourses of nationalism? What particular roles have Australia and New Zealand, as sub-imperial powers, played in the region? Finally, what can the latest generation of migrant writing in Australia show us about new forms of interconnections across the globalizing Asia-Pacific? Students in this course will examine novels, poetry, films and theoretical texts to develop critical thinking, reading and writing skills. Along the way, they will gain a solid grounding in the problematics of postcolonialism, race, diaspora, indigeneity, nationalism and multiculturalism.

In this course we consider the cultural reverberations of ecological awareness\u2014focusing on literature, cinema and visual art. Eco-criticism is a relatively young field of study in the humanities, developed in response to twin crises: actual environmental degradation, and a breakdown in intellectual categories of \u2018the natural\u2019 brought on by technology and politics. This course provides an opportunity to reflect on a number of key tropes in ecological thinking including wilderness, pollution, animals, food and apocalypse. Learn about a philosopher who survived a crocodile attack, the beach at the end of the world, how to prepare and eat Australian moths, and why the Large Hadron Collider is a metaphysical machine. Principle texts in this course include American and Australian novels, films and documentaries, read alongside supplementary sources in literary, audio and artistic mediums. We ask how literature\u2014one of the richest arenas for the practice of human imagination\u2014does, has, or could shape environmental thought and action. How does the non-human world enter into human artforms? What are the historical and structural obstacles to admitting different forms of consciousness into text? What literary genres and styles are called forth by the huge ecological challenges of our times?

We will meet for a weekly in-class seminar, except for three to four weeks during the session set aside for field trips. Our field trips will give us the opportunity to experience environmental issues first-hand, meet people, gather story ideas and find local Australian context for our own writing. Guest speakers will join us occasionally to further explore key issues. Our in-class seminars will briefly introduce key journalism concepts and techniques to those new to journalism and reinforce and further develop these skills for experienced journalism students. During each in-class seminar we will also discuss set readings, and explore the environment beat, reading stories that have been reported in Australia and around the world. We will consider work that explores this journalistic tradition, its forms and its themes and the place it takes in the new media world. Drawing our inspiration from great writers, we will find our own stories, our own voices and learn to tell our own tales. We will work on a class blog and each student will produce a news story which may be published on the blog, and a feature story for publication either on our blog or in an Australian or international print or digital outlet.

The seminar provides the structure for you to explore many different aspects of your internship site, and to gain more from your experience by comparing and contrasting the internship experiences of all class participants. The goal is to finish the semester with an in-depth understanding of the company or organization hosting your internship, including its mission, approach, policies, and the context in which it operates. More generally, we will consider the state of the contemporary workplace and ourselves as workers. Throughout the semester we will take note of similarities and differences of Australian and American workplaces and work culture. Ultimately, you will use the seminar to reflect critically and analytically on the internship experience, and on your personal and future professional goals.

Historical and theoretical frameworks will be provided to enable students to approach the scope, disparity and complexity of current developments. These frameworks will be supplemented with the latest media news and developments. In short, we ask: what the heck is going on in the hyper-turbulent realm of blogs, Buzzfeed and The Sydney Morning Herald?   Students will be encouraged to assess shifts in national, regional and international media patterns of production, distribution and consumption. The aim is to come to an understanding of the tumultuous contemporary global communication environment. Key concepts examined include: the advent of social media; the radical implications of globalisation; the disruption of established information flows and emergence of new information channels; the ethics, law and regulation of modern media; and trends in communication and information technologies. Issues addressed include: the rise of celebrity culture; the challenges facing the entertainment industry; and the rise, rise and potential demise of Rupert Murdoch. The focus will be international, with an emphasis on Australia.   Ultimately, the course will examine the ways in which global communication is undergoing a paradigm shift, as demonstrated by the Arab spring and the creeping dominance of Google, Facebook and Twitter. In other words: students, I\u2019ve a feeling we\u2019re not in Kansas anymore.

During the course of the semester we will discuss many different aspects of cognition: perception, attention, memory, language, concepts, reasoning, problem solving, expertise, creativity, and decision making. The emphasis in the course will be on how psychologists have used experiments to help construct theories of how the human mind works and how human thinking occurs. The class will involve lectures, student presentations, discussion, video material to accompany lectures, and occasional example class experiments. The course also has a practical component, for which students work in small groups and conduct an empirical study, which they write up in a research report.

The Australian Experience - SCA-UA 9809 - 4 points                               This course offers a wide-ranging critique of Australian culture and society. It aims to interrogate Australian society with a methodology that draws on critical race theory, feminism, social geography and cultural studies. It will look at issues such as the relationship between Australian settler culture and Aboriginal Australians; Australia\u2019s experience of migration and multiculturalism; Australians\u2019 relationship with their environment; and Australians\u2019 sense of national identity. In particular, it will consider how these issues have played out in popular culture.   This course offers a special experience for students wishing to broaden and deepen their methodologies of cultural analysis. Australian society is fascinating in itself, but it also offers a unique perspective on transnational issues such as identity formation, social justice movements and the experience of multiculturalism. For instance, given Australia\u2019s history of Indigenous and non-Indigenous relations, the issue of race in a post-colonial context is particularly acute here. Through comparison with the Australian experience, students will develop a more critical view of American and global society. Students wishing to pursue a career that involves cultural analysis will benefit greatly from studying Australian society, in Australia, and thus developing this comparative approach.   This course has three interweaving themes of study: race, class and gender. This course will look at how these issues have played out in various facets of Australian culture, ie: attitudes to the landscape; representations of crime; humour; and art. The course is bookended by sessions that consider place-making in Australia: an introductory session that looks at exploration and mapping, and a concluding session that looks at popular music and geographies of place.

Global Orientations: Australian Society and Culture                               Australian society is replete with contradictions. Aussies famously describe their nation as the lucky country, yet from the Indigenous perspective, it might more aptly be called the stolen country. Australia is the land of the fair go, which cruelly detains refugees; a multicultural nation with a history of a white Australia policy; a place with distinctive local traditions, which takes many of its cues from global culture; an easy-going country with a surprisingly large degree of governmental control over individual liberties; a highly urbanised population that romances the Bush and the Outback as embodying \u2018real\u2019 Australia; a nation proud of its traditions of egalitarianism and mateship, with numerous rules about who is allowed in \u2018the club\u2019; a society with a history of anti-British and anti-American sentiment that simultaneously hold strong political allegiances and military pacts with Britain and the USA; and a place with a history of progressive social policy and a democratic tradition, which has never undergone a revolution. This course strives to make sense of Australian society and culture by exploring the complexities and contradictions in Australia\u2019s self-image.   The course will be introduced with an overview, and followed by four sessions covering four distinct themes during Orientation and the first three weeks of semester. Each session will include a 1-hour lecture, either given by the instructor or a guest lecturer, and a recitation-style discussion. There are seven mandatory field trips: Sydney Harbour Cruise, Rocks Walking Tour, The Blue Mountains, Featherdale Wildlife Park, Balmain Bowling Club Lawn Bowls, Overnight trip to Inglevale Farm, and the NYU World Tour.

The structure of the class will mirror the real world experience of working writers. Students will be asked to come up with an idea for their script, pitch the story, do any needed research, and then proceed to a step-outline and treatment. It is required that this class be taken before taking Developing The Screenplay and/or Adaptation: A Screenwriting Workshop, Writing for Advanced TV Production Workshop, Advanced Television Writing: The One Hour Drama, or Advanced Feature Writing I. Script Analysis is also recommended for students who want to take these courses.                                                                      Strategies for Independent Producing - FMTV-UT 9092 - 3 points                                 Course Level: Intermediate/Advanced   The purpose of this course is to give students important tools for developing and producing an independent film. The course focuses on independent narrative features and documentaries, and recognizes the fundamental nature of film as art and commerce. It examines the marketplace for independent feature film, its history, and its workings, including the mechanics and economics of distribution, festival strategies, and funding strategies, including grant funding. Students construct a plan for a feature project of their choice, incorporating a creative package, production strategy, and a financing strategy. There will be guest speakers and occasional screenings.                                                                     NYU Centers Abroad...

In this course we'll read and discuss the various classic accounts of Creation.

Texts will include Genesis; the Theogony; the fragments of the Presocratics; selections from Plato's Timaeus and other dialogues; Midrash on Genesis; Commentaries by Church Fathers such as Augustine and Gregory on the Creation story; and selections from ancient Middle Eastern, Hindu.

Aussies famously describe their nation as the lucky country, yet from the Indigenous perspective, it might more aptly be called the stolen country. Australia is the land of the fair go, which cruelly detains refugees; a multicultural nation with a history of a white Australia policy; a place with distinctive local traditions, which takes many of its cues from global culture; an easy-going country with a surprisingly large degree of governmental control over individual liberties; a highly urbanised population that romances the Bush and the Outback as embodying \u2018real\u2019 Australia; a nation proud of its traditions of egalitarianism and mateship, with numerous rules about who is allowed in \u2018the club\u2019; a society with a history of anti-British and anti-American sentiment that simultaneously hold strong political allegiances and military pacts with Britain and the USA; and a place with a history of progressive social policy and a democratic tradition, which has never undergone a revolution. This course strives to make sense of Australian society and culture by exploring the complexities and contradictions in Australia\u2019s self-image.   The course will be introduced with an overview, and followed by four sessions covering four distinct themes during Orientation and the first three weeks of semester. Each session will include a 1-hour lecture, either given by the instructor or a guest lecturer, and a recitation-style discussion. There are seven mandatory field trips: Sydney Harbour Cruise, Rocks Walking Tour, The Blue Mountains, Featherdale Wildlife Park, Balmain Bowling Club Lawn Bowls, Overnight trip to Inglevale Farm, and the NYU World Tour.   Sample Syllabus                              Anthropology                                                  Anthropology of Indigenous Australia - ANTH-UA 9037 - 4 points                               This course offers an introduction to some of the classical and current issues in the anthropology of Indigenous Australia. The role of anthropology in the representation and governance of Indigenous life is itself an important subject for anthropological inquiry, considering that Indigenous people of Australia have long been the objects of interest and imagination by outsiders for their cultural formulations of kinship, ritual, art, gender, and politics. These representations\u2014in feature films about them (such as Rabbit-Proof Fence and Australia), New Age Literature (such as Mutant Message Down Under), or museum exhibitions (such as in the Museum of Sydney or the Australian Museum)\u2014are now also in dialogue with Indigenous forms of cultural production, in genres as diverse as film, television, drama, dance, art and writing. The course will explore how Aboriginal people have struggled to reproduce themselves and their traditions on their own terms, asserting their right to forms of cultural autonomy and self-determination. Through the examination of ethnographic and historical texts, films, archives and Indigenous life-writing accounts, we will consider the ways in which Aboriginalities are being challenged and constructed in contemporary Australia.   The course will consist of lectures interspersed with discussions, student presentations, and films/other media; we may also have guest presenters.

It focuses on some of the regional and historical variations of Aboriginal art in the context of the history of a settler nation, while considering the issues of its circulation and evaluation within contemporary discourses of value. Topics include the cosmological dimensions of the art, its political implications, its relationship to cultural identity, and its aesthetic frameworks. Students will visit some of the major national collections of Indigenous Australian art as well as exhibitions of contemporary works. There will also be guest presentations from Indigenous artists and Indigenous art curators.

Foundations of Finance - FINC-UB 9002 - 4 points                               Prerequisites: (1) STAT-UB 103 Statistics for Business Control and Regression/Forecasting Models OR STAT-UB 1 Statistics for Business Control (4 credit) plus STAT-UB 3 Regression/Forecasting (2 credit) OR equivalent AND (2) one of the following: ECON-UB 1 Microeconomics OR ECON-UA 2 Economic Principles II, OR ECON-UA 5 Introduction to Economic Analysis, AND (3) ACCT-UB 1 Principles of Financial Accounting AND (4) At least Sophomore Standing.   This course is a rigorous, quantitative introduction to financial market structure and financial asset valuation. This course seeks to equip students with a fundamental understanding of the concepts and principles of finance. The main topics of the course are time value of money, portfolio selection, equilibrium asset pricing (CAPM), equity valuation, arbitrage pricing, fixed income securities and derivatives. You are expected to understand valuation formulas and be able to apply them to new problems. The appropriate tools necessary for solving these problems will be developed at each stage and practiced in the homework assignments. The models we will cover have immediate applications and implications for real-world financial decisions. Every effort will be made to relate the course material to current financial news.   Throughout the course the emphasis will be on two main areas: learning conceptual knowledge through theory and problem solving; and critical thinking through the application of real-life scenarios and local cases. The course will incorporate aspects of Australian securities market and financial institutions and a comparative approach will be adopted in demonstrating similarities and differences between the U.S. capital market and the Australian capital market.   Sample Syllabus                                                                    Introduction to Marketing - MKTG-UB 9001 - 4 points                               This course introduces students to the concepts and skills needed to create and critique effective marketing. Marketers in all organisations require an understanding of the many facets of marketing, beyond simply advertising or communications. The American Marketing Association defines marketing as:   \u201cMarketing is the activity, set of institutions, and processes for creating, communicating, delivering, and exchanging offerings that have value for customers, clients, partners, and society at large.\u201d   The course focuses on the role of marketing and its importance in contemporary organisations and society. During the session, students will critically explore marketing principles, concepts and models from a practical perspective. Beyond studying the theory of marketing, students will analyse a variety of real-world examples and case studies. Organisations need to create a balanced, coordinated marketing mix, where all elements of its marketing activities work together. Marketing also requires combining qualitative and quantitative analysis to gain an understanding and reveal insights into the internal and external environment. To achieve this, the course uses a combination of lectures, class discussion, case studies, assignments and exams. The remainder of this syllabus describes the course and students responsibilities.

More novel still is the opportunity to receive instruction in child and adolescent psycho pathology from practicing psychiatrists and psychologists at an internationally renowned clinical and research center. Through lecture presentations and discussions, this course will focus on disease etiology, epidemiology, phenomenology, nosology, and diagnosis. We will engage students in a critical review of common child and adolescent psychopathology and challenge social and cultural assumptions of what constitutes \u201cnormal\u201d vs. \u201cpathological\u201d behavior, cognition, and emotion.

Expressive Culture: Film - CORE-UA 9750 - 4 points                               How has Australian cinema engaged with significant and often contested historical, political and cultural events in the nation\u2019s past? The films in this course offer critical perspectives on the history of colonisation in Australia; the legacies of the Stolen Generations; the controversies surrounding Australia\u2019s role in World War One; as well as Australia\u2019s relationships with its Pacific Asian neighbours. We will focus on films that have marked significant shifts in public consciousness about the past such as Gallipoli (1981), Rabbit-Proof Fence (2002) and Balibo (2009). We will also draw on films that have employed innovative narrative and aesthetic strategies for exploring the relationship between the past and the present such as Ten Canoes (2006) and The Tracker (2002). Throughout the course, students will develop their understanding of the basic methods and concepts of cinema studies. In particular, students will develop a critical vocabulary for analysing how filmmakers have approached the use of memory, testimony, re-enactment, researched detail, allegory and archives across a diverse range of examples.

We will engage with a diverse range of readings \u2013 featuring many Australian authors \u2013 and discuss technical elements and affective poetics to learn how to \u2018read as a writer\u2019. Weeks are devoted to crafting the short story and poetry. Students will complete weekly \u2018microfiction\u2019 homework exercises based upon images they take or find, and participate in in-class writing exercises, all of which will contribute to the writing journal submitted with the final work. The class emphasises the importance of embodied interaction with the city through a field trip using \u2018The Disappearing\u2019 \u2013 a downloadable app featuring over 100 site-specific poems spanning a \u2018poetic map\u2019 of Sydney, created by The Red Room Company. Students will think about the possibilities of marrying new technologies with writing as they navigate using poems as landmarks. Students workshop their drafts during the course, learning how to effectively communicate critical feedback and how to be receptive to constructive critique. This takes the form of a discussion in-class and students are required to submit written critical feedback on their classmates\u2019 drafts in an online forum. At the end of the course students will have the opportunity to showcase their work at a reading night to the rest of the NYU Sydney student body and invited faculty.

In addition to major texts from Australia and New Zealand, we will also encounter a range of works from Malaysia, Singapore, the Philippines, and the Pacific islands. Some questions we will tackle include: How have the cultural, historical, and economic processes of colonialism, diaspora and migration connected and shaped this diverse region? How have issues of race and indigeneity been central to various discourses of nationalism? What particular roles have Australia and New Zealand, as sub-imperial powers, played in the region? Finally, what can the latest generation of migrant writing in Australia show us about new forms of interconnections across the globalizing Asia-Pacific? Students in this course will examine novels, poetry, films and theoretical texts to develop critical thinking, reading and writing skills. Along the way, they will gain a solid grounding in the problematics of postcolonialism, race, diaspora, indigeneity, nationalism and multiculturalism.

In this course we consider the cultural reverberations of ecological awareness\u2014focusing on literature, cinema and visual art. Eco-criticism is a relatively young field of study in the humanities, developed in response to twin crises: actual environmental degradation, and a breakdown in intellectual categories of \u2018the natural\u2019 brought on by technology and politics. This course provides an opportunity to reflect on a number of key tropes in ecological thinking including wilderness, pollution, animals, food and apocalypse. Learn about a philosopher who survived a crocodile attack, the beach at the end of the world, how to prepare and eat Australian moths, and why the Large Hadron Collider is a metaphysical machine. Principle texts in this course include American and Australian novels, films and documentaries, read alongside supplementary sources in literary, audio and artistic mediums. We ask how literature\u2014one of the richest arenas for the practice of human imagination\u2014does, has, or could shape environmental thought and action. How does the non-human world enter into human artforms? What are the historical and structural obstacles to admitting different forms of consciousness into text?

We will meet for a weekly in-class seminar, except for three to four weeks during the session set aside for field trips. Our field trips will give us the opportunity to experience environmental issues first-hand, meet people, gather story ideas and find local Australian context for our own writing. Guest speakers will join us occasionally to further explore key issues. Our in-class seminars will briefly introduce key journalism concepts and techniques to those new to journalism and reinforce and further develop these skills for experienced journalism students. During each in-class seminar we will also discuss set readings, and explore the environment beat, reading stories that have been reported in Australia and around the world. We will consider work that explores this journalistic tradition, its forms and its themes and the place it takes in the new media world. Drawing our inspiration from great writers, we will find our own stories, our own voices and learn to tell our own tales. We will work on a class blog and each student will produce a news story which may be published on the blog, and a feature story for publication either on our blog or in an Australian or international print or digital outlet.

Historical and theoretical frameworks will be provided to enable students to approach the scope, disparity and complexity of current developments. These frameworks will be supplemented with the latest media news and developments. In short, we ask: what the heck is going on in the hyper-turbulent realm of blogs, Buzzfeed and The Sydney Morning Herald?   Students will be encouraged to assess shifts in national, regional and international media patterns of production, distribution and consumption. The aim is to come to an understanding of the tumultuous contemporary global communication environment. Key concepts examined include: the advent of social media; the radical implications of globalisation; the disruption of established information flows and emergence of new information channels; the ethics, law and regulation of modern media; and trends in communication and information technologies. Issues addressed include: the rise of celebrity culture; the challenges facing the entertainment industry; and the rise, rise and potential demise of Rupert Murdoch. The focus will be international, with an emphasis on Australia.   Ultimately, the course will examine the ways in which global communication is undergoing a paradigm shift, as demonstrated by the Arab spring and the creeping dominance of Google, Facebook and Twitter. In other words: students, I\u2019ve a feeling we\u2019re not in Kansas anymore.

During the course of the semester we will discuss many different aspects of cognition: perception, attention, memory, language, concepts, reasoning, problem solving, expertise, creativity, and decision making. The emphasis in the course will be on how psychologists have used experiments to help construct theories of how the human mind works and how human thinking occurs. The class will involve lectures, student presentations, discussion, video material to accompany lectures, and occasional example class experiments. The course also has a practical component, for which students work in small groups and conduct an empirical study, which they write up in a research report.

The Australian Experience - SCA-UA 9809 - 4 points                               This course offers a wide-ranging critique of Australian culture and society. It aims to interrogate Australian society with a methodology that draws on critical race theory, feminism, social geography and cultural studies. It will look at issues such as the relationship between Australian settler culture and Aboriginal Australians; Australia\u2019s experience of migration and multiculturalism; Australians\u2019 relationship with their environment; and Australians\u2019 sense of national identity. In particular, it will consider how these issues have played out in popular culture.   This course offers a special experience for students wishing to broaden and deepen their methodologies of cultural analysis. Australian society is fascinating in itself, but it also offers a unique perspective on transnational issues such as identity formation, social justice movements and the experience of multiculturalism. For instance, given Australia\u2019s history of Indigenous and non-Indigenous relations, the issue of race in a post-colonial context is particularly acute here. Through comparison with the Australian experience, students will develop a more critical view of American and global society. Students wishing to pursue a career that involves cultural analysis will benefit greatly from studying Australian society, in Australia, and thus developing this comparative approach.   This course has three interweaving themes of study: race, class and gender. This course will look at how these issues have played out in various facets of Australian culture, ie: attitudes to the landscape; representations of crime; humour; and art. The course is bookended by sessions that consider place-making in Australia: an introductory session that looks at exploration and mapping, and a concluding session that looks at popular music and geographies of place.

Global Orientations: Australian Society and Culture                               Australian society is replete with contradictions. Aussies famously describe their nation as the lucky country, yet from the Indigenous perspective, it might more aptly be called the stolen country. Australia is the land of the fair go, which cruelly detains refugees; a multicultural nation with a history of a white Australia policy; a place with distinctive local traditions, which takes many of its cues from global culture; an easy-going country with a surprisingly large degree of governmental control over individual liberties; a highly urbanised population that romances the Bush and the Outback as embodying \u2018real\u2019 Australia; a nation proud of its traditions of egalitarianism and mateship, with numerous rules about who is allowed in \u2018the club\u2019; a society with a history of anti-British and anti-American sentiment that simultaneously hold strong political allegiances and military pacts with Britain and the USA; and a place with a history of progressive social policy and a democratic tradition, which has never undergone a revolution. This course strives to make sense of Australian society and culture by exploring the complexities and contradictions in Australia\u2019s self-image.   The course will be introduced with an overview, and followed by four sessions covering four distinct themes during Orientation and the first three weeks of semester. Each session will include a 1-hour lecture, either given by the instructor or a guest lecturer, and a recitation-style discussion. There are seven mandatory field trips: Sydney Harbour Cruise, Rocks Walking Tour, The Blue Mountains, Featherdale Wildlife Park, Balmain Bowling Club Lawn Bowls, Overnight trip to Inglevale Farm, and the NYU World Tour.

The structure of the class will mirror the real world experience of working writers. Students will be asked to come up with an idea for their script, pitch the story, do any needed research, and then proceed to a step-outline and treatment. It is required that this class be taken before taking Developing The Screenplay and/or Adaptation: A Screenwriting Workshop, Writing for Advanced TV Production Workshop, Advanced Television Writing: The One Hour Drama, or Advanced Feature Writing I. Script Analysis is also recommended for students who want to take these courses.                                                                      Strategies for Independent Producing - FMTV-UT 9092 - 3 points                                 Course Level: Intermediate/Advanced   The purpose of this course is to give students important tools for developing and producing an independent film. The course focuses on independent narrative features and documentaries, and recognizes the fundamental nature of film as art and commerce. It examines the marketplace for independent feature film, its history, and its workings, including the mechanics and economics of distribution, festival strategies, and funding strategies, including grant funding. Students construct a plan for a feature project of their choice, incorporating a creative package, production strategy, and a financing strategy. There will be guest speakers and occasional screenings.                                                                     NYU Centers Abroad...
