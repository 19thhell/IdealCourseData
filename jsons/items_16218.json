Founded in 1979 as the first graduate education program in alternative media, ITP has grown into a living community of technologists, theorists, engineers, designers, and artists uniquely dedicated to pushing the boundaries of interactivity in the real and digital worlds. A hands-on approach to experimentation, production and risk-taking make this hi-tech fun house a creative home not only to its 220 students, but also to an extended network of the technology industry's most daring and prolific practitioners.    ITP is internationally recognized as a unique and vital contributor of new ideas and talented individuals to the professional world of multimedia and interactivity. The department takes a creative and professional approach to the challenges of the information age.    Experimentation is an essential element in understanding both the opportunities and responsibilities inherent in this evolving field. ITP's philosophy of a hands-on approach to learning relies on collaboration rather than competition, fostering a creative environment where exploration, analysis, risk-taking and experimentation can occur. The department provides an open and nurturing environment in which people are empowered to develop their own ideas, no matter how experimental. ITP emphasizes the user's creativity rather than the capability of the computer. The department challenges students to apply their creativity and imagination to the latest digital tools and techniques. The curriculum is devoted to teaching the practice and theory that emerge from the convergence of new media technologies.    The department, which began in 1979, grew out of the work of the Alternate Media Center which was founded in 1971. ITP and AMC have developed an international reputation for pioneering work in demonstration and research in the field of interactive media. 2009 marks the 30th anniversary of the Interactive Telecommunications Program.

students to the possibilities and capabilities of interactive tools, whether hardware or software, and to teach them how to understand and create new experiences with those tools.   It is also designed to serve as a crossroads for a variety of disciplines, from engineering and computer science to the social sciences and the arts. This mixing is built into the courses themselves and embodied in the interactive lab, an environment where scientists and artists come together with curious students and faculty to imagine new forms of media and technology.

Thinking about how we interface with these tools beyond the mouse and keyboard, we can approach software and electronics as artists and designers and explore new paradigms of interaction with machines and each other. This introductory course will provide students hands-on experience with screen-based and physical interaction design through programming and electronics using microcontrollers, electronics, and writing our own software. Fundamentals of programming and circuit design will supplement readings on human-computer interaction and design theory. Weekly lab exercises encourage students to experiment freely, creating their own novel interfaces and controls for working with machines.

What is media&rsquo;s role in creating culture, influencing political events, forming communities, and archiving? What is ubiquitous computing, embedded computing, physical computing? How is cyberspace merging with physical space and how does participatory media change the face of cultural institutions, historical narratives, and mapping? Students are asked to consider the role of media in their own lives and consider where it both fails and succeeds.

This course explores the technology that enables the consumption and production of new forms of media on these devices with an eye toward how that media can be used in conjunction with the devices&rsquo; original social and communicative purposes. Students create projects that utilize the available technology to explore new forms of media creation and consumption.

MDMED-AD 114J Values in Information Technology and Digital Media                                             Computing, information technology, and digital media are integrated into all aspects of contemporary life including commerce, finance, education, politics, entertainment, communication, and social life. This course studies these technologies through the lens of social, political, and ethical values investigating whether and how technical systems promote or impede values to which we are committed. While we explore concepts and literatures, students form collaborative groups, select projects and apply philosophical and social theories of technology to analyze and, possibly, design, prototype, and build systems. The course welcomes students with a variety of backgrounds and skills, though some prior understanding of and experience with digital technology and media, and computing or social, political, and ethical analysis is recommended.

MDMED-AD 116 Mashups - Creating with Web APIs                                             As the World Wide Web continues to grow and pervade our everyday lives, an ever-increasing amount of data and digital services are becoming accessible to us through public web APIs - Application Programming Interfaces. Common to many web sites, including YouTube, Twitter, Google Maps, Wikipedia and more, these web APIs offer a way to programmatically request and re-purpose endless troves of information. How might we use these available resources to create unique, creative, and compelling web experiences of our own? Subscribing to a process-oriented approach, much of class time will be spent reviewing and writing code, primarily Javascript, for client-side (front-end) web development.

This course provides an overview of video art since its inception in the late 1960s and is designed to trace the path of the medium to contemporary practices. Emerging methods of video interaction in the context of performance and installation will be applied. Students will develop their own work while examining technical and aesthetic concepts embedded in existing pieces.

Students develop artistic collaborative projects involving sound, movement, digital video, lighting, interaction technologies, and telematics, which are presented publicly at the end of the semester. This course requires no skills and is open to anyone willing to establish a collaborative project involving different art forms and other domains.    * Note: The former title of this course was &#39;Collaborating in the Digital Domain&#39;.
