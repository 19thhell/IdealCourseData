New York University is one of the few universities in the country to offer a graduate degree in the music business field . The skills you develop will serve you well in a fast-paced industry that needs thoroughly trained personnel who can apply business and administration theory to problems that have a strong aesthetic and artistic dimension.    In addition to providing structured courses, the curriculum promotes student autonomy through an interactive classroom atmosphere, internships, and research requirements . Students are encouraged to participate in extracurricular activities such as the Concert Program Board, radio station WNYU and to follow our blog, Velocity , for the latest news and happenings.    Underlying our curriculum is a four-step process of teaching and learning that answers the question: what can you learn at a university that will prepare you to succeed in an industry that is notoriously fluid and capricious?       First, we teach the structure of the industry &ndash; its systems, practices, rules and regulations.          Second, we explore the changes in and reasons behind that structure .          Third, we encourage critical analysis and interpretation of the structure .          The fourth step is up to you &ndash; final Colloquy projects propose changes and innovations to take the industry forward.          Special Concentration in Music Technology    The Music Technology Concentration within the M.A. program in Music Business is intended for students with an academic or professional background in technology who wish to exploit that experience in the commercial arena.    The focus of the concentration is on understanding interrelations between music businesses and consumer technologies, audio for games and other interactive applications, sound design in the digital music space, and emerging platforms for the generation and exploitation of music.

New York University is one of the few universities in the country to offer a graduate degree in the music business field . The skills you develop will serve you well in a fast-paced industry that needs thoroughly trained personnel who can apply business and administration theory to problems that have a strong aesthetic and artistic dimension.    In addition to providing structured courses, the curriculum promotes student autonomy through an interactive classroom atmosphere, internships, and research requirements . Students are encouraged to participate in extracurricular activities such as the Concert Program Board, radio station WNYU and to follow our blog, Velocity , for the latest news and happenings.    Underlying our curriculum is a four-step process of teaching and learning that answers the question: what can you learn at a university that will prepare you to succeed in an industry that is notoriously fluid and capricious?       First, we teach the structure of the industry &ndash; its systems, practices, rules and regulations.          Second, we explore the changes in and reasons behind that structure .          Third, we encourage critical analysis and interpretation of the structure .          The fourth step is up to you &ndash; final Colloquy projects propose changes and innovations to take the industry forward.
