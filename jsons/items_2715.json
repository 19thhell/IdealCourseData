It is well known that language is a social phenomenon;  this course will focus on some aspects of language that make its study  more like a natural science.

Reflecting the strongly inter-disciplinary character  of this frontier, NYU\u2019s Language &amp; Mind study program is strongly  integrative, drawing courses from three departments: Linguistics,  Psychology and Philosophy. Human language is at the center of the  Language &amp; Mind study program, but the major is broader than  Linguistics; the program also incorporates Psychological  experimentation techniques and Philosophical inquiry. The aim is to  give students the necessary background for exploration of new  perspectives for both language and the human mind. There are ten required courses selected from an interdisciplinary  cross-section of Linguistics, Psychology, and Philosophy. Beyond the  defining course of this major, called \u201cLanguage and Mind\u201d, students  take three courses in Linguistics (selected from a set of ten  Linguistics courses), one in Philosophy (selected from a set of three  Philosophy courses), four in Psychology (selected from a set of nine  Psychology courses), and an additional course from one of the three  departments. The Honors track encourages ambitious research  that aims to reflect the frontier nature of the major and supports work  at the interface between established disciplines.
