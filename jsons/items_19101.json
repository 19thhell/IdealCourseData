The consolidated operating budget for New York University is $7.356 billion. The budget presentation in the pages that follow focuses only on the parts of New York University other than the NYU Langone Medical Center (i.e., the School of Medicine and the Hospitals Center). The budget for the \u201cUniversity\u201d totals $2.799 billion and includes all academic, auxiliary, and administrative units at Washington Square, Brooklyn, NYU Abu Dhabi, the New York-based budget of NYU Shanghai, and all global sites.    The budget provides the financial framework for the University\u2019s mission of teaching and research by balancing resources with need and aspiration. Fiscal 2015 is the first full fiscal year following the merger with NYU Polytechnic, and the budget reflects the savings in administrative and auxiliary operations that resulted from the merger, as well as increased capital and academic investments in the new Polytechnic School of Engineering. The fiscal 2015 budget also incorporates funding for planning and design for the redevelopment of the Coles Sports and Recreation Center site on Mercer Street. When completed, the new building on the site will provide modern, high-quality space designed specifically to meet the University\u2019s long-term academic, residential, sports, and recreational needs.    The University continues to increase our institutional aid for students and to invest in career services. Two important new categories of undergraduate financial aid included in the fiscal 2015 budget are the Finish Line Grant and the Global Pathways Scholarship: the Finish Line Grant provides scholarship assistance to undergraduates receiving financial aid as they approach their final semester, lowering their debt upon graduation; and the Global Pathways Scholarship program provides need-based assistance to cover the additional costs of studying abroad. Both programs are made possible by the Momentum Campaign, which was announced last year to raise $1 billion of new funding for financial aid. The Wasserman Center for Career Development will expand its career placement services for master\u2019s and PhD students, especially for those enrolled in schools other than the professional schools.    NYU will continue to be vigilant about its budget to ensure that support of academic excellence remains our highest priority. I hope you will find this outline of NYU's fiscal 2015 budget to be informative.    Sincerely,    Anthony P. Jiga    Vice President for Budget and Planning              New York University Fiscal 2015 Consolidated Operating Revenues        (dollars in billions)           University* $2.799 38%  NYU Langone Medical Center**  4.557   62%  TOTAL  $7.356  100%      Notes   *All parts of New York University other than the NYU Langone Medical Center, i.e., the  School of Medicine and the Hospitals Center.

The consolidated operating budget for New York University is $7.356 billion. The budget presentation in the pages that follow focuses only on the parts of New York University other than the NYU Langone Medical Center (i.e., the School of Medicine and the Hospitals Center). The budget for the \u201cUniversity\u201d totals $2.799 billion and includes all academic, auxiliary, and administrative units at Washington Square, Brooklyn, NYU Abu Dhabi, the New York-based budget of NYU Shanghai, and all global sites.    The budget provides the financial framework for the University\u2019s mission of teaching and research by balancing resources with need and aspiration. Fiscal 2015 is the first full fiscal year following the merger with NYU Polytechnic, and the budget reflects the savings in administrative and auxiliary operations that resulted from the merger, as well as increased capital and academic investments in the new Polytechnic School of Engineering. The fiscal 2015 budget also incorporates funding for planning and design for the redevelopment of the Coles Sports and Recreation Center site on Mercer Street. When completed, the new building on the site will provide modern, high-quality space designed specifically to meet the University\u2019s long-term academic, residential, sports, and recreational needs.    The University continues to increase our institutional aid for students and to invest in career services. Two important new categories of undergraduate financial aid included in the fiscal 2015 budget are the Finish Line Grant and the Global Pathways Scholarship: the Finish Line Grant provides scholarship assistance to undergraduates receiving financial aid as they approach their final semester, lowering their debt upon graduation; and the Global Pathways Scholarship program provides need-based assistance to cover the additional costs of studying abroad. Both programs are made possible by the Momentum Campaign, which was announced last year to raise $1 billion of new funding for financial aid. The Wasserman Center for Career Development will expand its career placement services for master\u2019s and PhD students, especially for those enrolled in schools other than the professional schools.    NYU will continue to be vigilant about its budget to ensure that support of academic excellence remains our highest priority. I hope you will find this outline of NYU's fiscal 2015 budget to be informative.    Sincerely,    Anthony P. Jiga    Vice President for Budget and Planning              New York University Fiscal 2015 Consolidated Operating Revenues        (dollars in billions)           University* $2.799 38%  NYU Langone Medical Center**  4.557   62%  TOTAL  $7.356  100%      Notes   *All parts of New York University other than the NYU Langone Medical Center, i.e., the  School of Medicine and the Hospitals Center.
