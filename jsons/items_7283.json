Inside the box, the energy is entirely kinetic because , so the classical energy is              where and are the two components of the particle's momentum. We see that the energy naturally is expressible as  a sum of kinetic energies associated with motion in the and   directions:              Because the energy is a simple sum, the solutions of the Schr&#246;dinger equation can be expressed as simple products of the solutions of the one-dimensional Schr&#246;dinger equation for this problem.

Thus, the wave function  is of the form              which satisfies the boundary conditions at and , namely and .

The formulas for the energies and wave functions become only slightly more complicated:                           The definition of the dimensionless variables is also altered slightly                     The fact that the wave function is a  product of one-dimensional wave functions:              makes the calculation of probabilities rather easy. The probability that a measurement the particle's position will yield a value of and is                                                                       Example : For a particle in a two-dimensional box, if the particle is in the state , what is the probability that a measurement of the particle's position will yield and ?        Substituting into the above formula, we have                                                                                                       Next: Particle in a three-dimensional   Up: lecture_7   Previous: lecture_7    Mark E.
