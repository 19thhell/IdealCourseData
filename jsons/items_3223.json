With the support of the Center, I   was able to juggle full-time coursework, internship experiences with   Human Rights Watch and the Institute for International Humanitarian   Affairs, in addition to employment alongside the Center\u2019s dedicated and   experienced staff. I always felt as though the Center was exceptionally   helpful in attaining these internships and understanding the need for a   prudent professional-academic balance.\u201d \u2014Stephen Whittaker, M.A. CEMS '14  Degree Program Requirements Follow this link for information on course credit and other requirements to fulfill the Master's in European and Mediterranean Studies.
