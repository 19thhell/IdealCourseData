Location: Gulf+Western Gallery 721 Broadway (at Waverly Place) New York, NY 10003 An exhibition entitled This is not me: Enduring Syria's War , by Bridgette Auger, the 2012 Tierney Fellowship award recipient from the Department of Photography &amp; Imaging in the Kanbar Institute of Film and Television at New York University, will go on view June 13th at the Tisch School of the Arts.       This is not me: Enduring Syria's War is a photography-based project incorporating text and video that follows two friends as they experience war from inside and outside their homeland. The project looks beyond the enormous physical destruction caused by the war to the profound emotional and mental toll on those forcibly displaced by the violence.      The Tierney Family Foundation established the annual Tierney Fellowship grant in 2005. It is awarded to a Photography &amp; Imaging alumnus who has shown excellence in the field of photography and graduated within the past seven years. The primary goal of the Fellowship is to find aspiring artists who will be tomorrow's leaders and assist them in overcoming challenges that photographers face at the start of their careers.      Bridgette Auger is an independent media artist living in the Middle East for over four years and is currently based in Beirut, Lebanon. Bridgette works as a still photographer and videographer covering breaking news through video-reporting as well as camera work on documentary films. Her work has been published by outlets such as The Daily Beast, The Guardian, GlobalPost, The Christian Science Monitor, Rolling Stone ME, CNN, the International Organization for Migration , and The UN Refugee Agency . She has worked in Egypt, Oman, Syria, Lebanon, Libya, Iraqi Kurdistan, Kashmir, Mongolia, China as well as the US. She has a degree in Photography and Imaging from New York University's Tisch School of the Arts and a Master in Social Documentation from the University of California, Santa Cruz.   Gallery hours are 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. weekdays and noon to 5 p.m.   Saturdays. It is open to the public, and admission is free. Photo   identification is required to enter the building.
