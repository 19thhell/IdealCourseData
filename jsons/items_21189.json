Institutions, Governance, and International Development         This course introduces the theory and practice of institutional reform in developing and transitional countries. It reviews the evolution of international development paradigms, examining how the role, structure, and management of institutions, the public sector, and non-governmental organizations have changed in response to shifting economic and political trends, with a particular emphasis on accountability. The focus is on major institutional and managerial reforms intended to promote good governance as less developed economies liberalize and their societies democratize. Key topics include issues of property rights, knowledge and innovation, learning, the rule of law, decentralization/intergovernmental relations, civil service reforms, anticorruption, citizen engagement, and public-private partnerships. In addition, the roles of international development aid and the external institutions that support institutional and managerial reform in developing and transitional countries are introduced. The course concludes with a synthetic review and a comparative case study exercise.

Human rights. Global poverty. Climate Change. What role should military force play in foreign policy? Arguments over how to respond to these issues reflect debates about the appropriate role that the United States should play in the world -- debates that date back to the country's founding. Should the United States aspire to global dominance? Should or can the United States foster the creation of an international society founded upon international law and cooperation? These and other questions will be explored by examining competing views on the most critical foreign policy issues of the 21st century, issues that will redefine the relationship between the United States and the world.

The theme explored is how public officials balance concerns for substantive policy objectives, institutional politics and elective politics in order to achieve change. The nature of key legislative and executive institutional objectives and roles is examined. In addition, attention is given to the role of policy analysis and analysts in shaping policy decisions, seeking to identify their potential for positive impact and their limitations in the political process.      A second goal of the course is to sharpen students\u2019 ability to think and write like professional policy analysts. Students will be asked to apply both a policy analysis framework and a political perspective to the issues under discussion       Download Syllabus                               Date      Publication/Paper           2014      Gershman, John and Jonathan Morduch 2014.  Credit is Not a Right [REVISED] Forthcoming in volume edited by Tom Sorell and Luis Cabrera: Microfinance, Rights, and Global Justice. Cambridge University Press. View/Download Article    Abstract    Muhammad Yunus, the microcredit pioneer, has proposed that access to credit should be a human right. We approach the question by drawing on fieldwork and empirical scholarship in political science and economics. Evidence shows that access to credit may be powerful for some people some of the time, but it is not powerful for everyone all of the time, and in some cases it can do damage. Yunus\u2019s claim for the power of credit access has yet to be widely verified, and most rigorous studies find microcredit impacts that fall far short of the kinds of empirical assertions on which his proposal rests. We discuss ways that expanding the domain of rights can diminish the power of existing rights, and we argue for a right to non-discrimination in credit access, rather than a right to credit access itself.                        2011      Gershman, John and Jonathan Morduch. 2011.  Credit is Not a Right  View/Download Article | View Publication    Abstract    Is credit a human right? Muhammad Yunus, the most visible leader of a global movement to provide microcredit to world\u2019s poor, says it should be. NYU\u2019s John Gershman and FAI\u2019s Jonathan Morduch disagree. In their new paper, Credit is Not a Right, they ask whether a rights-based approach to microcredit will in fact be effective in making quality, affordable credit more available to poor families \u2013 and, more importantly, whether it is a constructive step in terms of the broader goal of global poverty reduction. Jonathan Morduch argues his case in this video.       2004      Gershman, J. 2004.  A Secure America in a Secure World Interhemispheric Resource Center, September,    Abstract    The Bush administration\u2019s \u201cwar on terrorism\u201d reflects a major failure of leadership and makes Americans more vulnerable rather than more secure. The administration has chosen a path to combat terrorism that has weakened multilateral institutions and squandered international goodwill. Not only has Bush failed to support effective reconstruction in Afghanistan, but his war and occupation in Iraq have made the United States more vulnerable and have opened a new front and a recruiting tool for terrorists while diverting resources from essential homeland security efforts. In short, Washington\u2019s approach to homeland security fails to address key vulnerabilities, undermines civil liberties, and misallocates resources. The administration has taken some successful steps to counter terrorism, such as improved airline and border security, a partial crackdown on terrorist financing, improved international cooperation in sharing intelligence, the arrest of several high-level al-Qaida figures, and the disruption of a number of planned attacks. But these successes are overwhelmed by policy choices that have made U.S. citizens more rather than less vulnerable. The Bush White House has undermined the very values it claims to be defending at home and abroad\u2014democracy and human rights; both Washington\u2019s credibility and its efforts to combat terrorism are hampered when it aids repressive regimes. Furthermore, the administration has weakened the international legal framework essential to creating a global effort to counter terrorism, and it has failed to address the political contexts\u2014failed states and repressive regimes\u2014that enable and facilitate terrorism.    2002      Gershman, J. 2002.  Is Southeast Asia the Second Front? Foreign Affairs, July/August 2002 View report    Abstract    With U.S. troops on the ground in the Philippines and closer military ties developing to other countries in the region, Washington is taking the war on terror to Southeast Asia. But a military approach to the region's problems would be a deadly mistake: it could weaken local democracies and turn neutral forces into new enemies.       2000      Fox, J. & Gershman, J. 2000.

Institutions, Governance, and International Development         This course introduces the theory and practice of institutional reform in developing and transitional countries. It reviews the evolution of international development paradigms, examining how the role, structure, and management of institutions, the public sector, and non-governmental organizations have changed in response to shifting economic and political trends, with a particular emphasis on accountability. The focus is on major institutional and managerial reforms intended to promote good governance as less developed economies liberalize and their societies democratize. Key topics include issues of property rights, knowledge and innovation, learning, the rule of law, decentralization/intergovernmental relations, civil service reforms, anticorruption, citizen engagement, and public-private partnerships. In addition, the roles of international development aid and the external institutions that support institutional and managerial reform in developing and transitional countries are introduced. The course concludes with a synthetic review and a comparative case study exercise.

Human rights. Global poverty. Climate Change. What role should military force play in foreign policy? Arguments over how to respond to these issues reflect debates about the appropriate role that the United States should play in the world -- debates that date back to the country's founding. Should the United States aspire to global dominance? Should or can the United States foster the creation of an international society founded upon international law and cooperation? These and other questions will be explored by examining competing views on the most critical foreign policy issues of the 21st century, issues that will redefine the relationship between the United States and the world.

The theme explored is how public officials balance concerns for substantive policy objectives, institutional politics and elective politics in order to achieve change. The nature of key legislative and executive institutional objectives and roles is examined. In addition, attention is given to the role of policy analysis and analysts in shaping policy decisions, seeking to identify their potential for positive impact and their limitations in the political process.      A second goal of the course is to sharpen students\u2019 ability to think and write like professional policy analysts.

Credit is Not a Right [REVISED] Forthcoming in volume edited by Tom Sorell and Luis Cabrera: Microfinance, Rights, and Global Justice. Cambridge University Press. View/Download Article    Abstract    Muhammad Yunus, the microcredit pioneer, has proposed that access to credit should be a human right. We approach the question by drawing on fieldwork and empirical scholarship in political science and economics. Evidence shows that access to credit may be powerful for some people some of the time, but it is not powerful for everyone all of the time, and in some cases it can do damage. Yunus\u2019s claim for the power of credit access has yet to be widely verified, and most rigorous studies find microcredit impacts that fall far short of the kinds of empirical assertions on which his proposal rests. We discuss ways that expanding the domain of rights can diminish the power of existing rights, and we argue for a right to non-discrimination in credit access, rather than a right to credit access itself.                        2011      Gershman, John and Jonathan Morduch. 2011.  Credit is Not a Right  View/Download Article | View Publication    Abstract    Is credit a human right? Muhammad Yunus, the most visible leader of a global movement to provide microcredit to world\u2019s poor, says it should be. NYU\u2019s John Gershman and FAI\u2019s Jonathan Morduch disagree. In their new paper, Credit is Not a Right, they ask whether a rights-based approach to microcredit will in fact be effective in making quality, affordable credit more available to poor families \u2013 and, more importantly, whether it is a constructive step in terms of the broader goal of global poverty reduction. Jonathan Morduch argues his case in this video.       2004      Gershman, J. 2004.  A Secure America in a Secure World Interhemispheric Resource Center, September,    Abstract    The Bush administration\u2019s \u201cwar on terrorism\u201d reflects a major failure of leadership and makes Americans more vulnerable rather than more secure. The administration has chosen a path to combat terrorism that has weakened multilateral institutions and squandered international goodwill. Not only has Bush failed to support effective reconstruction in Afghanistan, but his war and occupation in Iraq have made the United States more vulnerable and have opened a new front and a recruiting tool for terrorists while diverting resources from essential homeland security efforts. In short, Washington\u2019s approach to homeland security fails to address key vulnerabilities, undermines civil liberties, and misallocates resources. The administration has taken some successful steps to counter terrorism, such as improved airline and border security, a partial crackdown on terrorist financing, improved international cooperation in sharing intelligence, the arrest of several high-level al-Qaida figures, and the disruption of a number of planned attacks. But these successes are overwhelmed by policy choices that have made U.S. citizens more rather than less vulnerable. The Bush White House has undermined the very values it claims to be defending at home and abroad\u2014democracy and human rights; both Washington\u2019s credibility and its efforts to combat terrorism are hampered when it aids repressive regimes. Furthermore, the administration has weakened the international legal framework essential to creating a global effort to counter terrorism, and it has failed to address the political contexts\u2014failed states and repressive regimes\u2014that enable and facilitate terrorism.    2002      Gershman, J. 2002.  Is Southeast Asia the Second Front? Foreign Affairs, July/August 2002 View report    Abstract    With U.S. troops on the ground in the Philippines and closer military ties developing to other countries in the region, Washington is taking the war on terror to Southeast Asia. But a military approach to the region's problems would be a deadly mistake: it could weaken local democracies and turn neutral forces into new enemies.       2000      Fox, J. & Gershman, J. 2000.

As part of the core curriculum of the NYU Wagner Masters program, Capstone teams spend an academic year addressing challenges and identifying opportunities for a client organization or conducting research on a pressing social question. Wagner's Capstone program provides students with a centerpiece of their graduate experience whereby they are able to experience first-hand turning the theory of their studies into practice under the guidance of an experienced faculty member. Projects require students to get up-to-speed quickly on a specific content or issue area; enhance key process skills including project management and teamwork; and develop competency in gathering, analyzing, and reporting out on data. Capstone requires students to interweave their learning in all these areas, and to do so in real time, in an unpredictable, complex, real-world environment.

Institutions, Governance, and International Development         This course introduces the theory and practice of institutional reform in developing and transitional countries. It reviews the evolution of international development paradigms, examining how the role, structure, and management of institutions, the public sector, and non-governmental organizations have changed in response to shifting economic and political trends, with a particular emphasis on accountability. The focus is on major institutional and managerial reforms intended to promote good governance as less developed economies liberalize and their societies democratize. Key topics include issues of property rights, knowledge and innovation, learning, the rule of law, decentralization/intergovernmental relations, civil service reforms, anticorruption, citizen engagement, and public-private partnerships. In addition, the roles of international development aid and the external institutions that support institutional and managerial reform in developing and transitional countries are introduced. The course concludes with a synthetic review and a comparative case study exercise.

Human rights. Global poverty. Climate Change. What role should military force play in foreign policy? Arguments over how to respond to these issues reflect debates about the appropriate role that the United States should play in the world -- debates that date back to the country's founding. Should the United States aspire to global dominance? Should or can the United States foster the creation of an international society founded upon international law and cooperation? These and other questions will be explored by examining competing views on the most critical foreign policy issues of the 21st century, issues that will redefine the relationship between the United States and the world.

The theme explored is how public officials balance concerns for substantive policy objectives, institutional politics and elective politics in order to achieve change. The nature of key legislative and executive institutional objectives and roles is examined. In addition, attention is given to the role of policy analysis and analysts in shaping policy decisions, seeking to identify their potential for positive impact and their limitations in the political process.      A second goal of the course is to sharpen students\u2019 ability to think and write like professional policy analysts.

Credit is Not a Right [REVISED] Forthcoming in volume edited by Tom Sorell and Luis Cabrera: Microfinance, Rights, and Global Justice. Cambridge University Press. View/Download Article    Abstract    Muhammad Yunus, the microcredit pioneer, has proposed that access to credit should be a human right. We approach the question by drawing on fieldwork and empirical scholarship in political science and economics. Evidence shows that access to credit may be powerful for some people some of the time, but it is not powerful for everyone all of the time, and in some cases it can do damage. Yunus\u2019s claim for the power of credit access has yet to be widely verified, and most rigorous studies find microcredit impacts that fall far short of the kinds of empirical assertions on which his proposal rests. We discuss ways that expanding the domain of rights can diminish the power of existing rights, and we argue for a right to non-discrimination in credit access, rather than a right to credit access itself.                        2011      Gershman, John and Jonathan Morduch. 2011.  Credit is Not a Right  View/Download Article | View Publication    Abstract    Is credit a human right? Muhammad Yunus, the most visible leader of a global movement to provide microcredit to world\u2019s poor, says it should be. NYU\u2019s John Gershman and FAI\u2019s Jonathan Morduch disagree. In their new paper, Credit is Not a Right, they ask whether a rights-based approach to microcredit will in fact be effective in making quality, affordable credit more available to poor families \u2013 and, more importantly, whether it is a constructive step in terms of the broader goal of global poverty reduction. Jonathan Morduch argues his case in this video.       2004      Gershman, J. 2004.  A Secure America in a Secure World Interhemispheric Resource Center, September,    Abstract    The Bush administration\u2019s \u201cwar on terrorism\u201d reflects a major failure of leadership and makes Americans more vulnerable rather than more secure. The administration has chosen a path to combat terrorism that has weakened multilateral institutions and squandered international goodwill. Not only has Bush failed to support effective reconstruction in Afghanistan, but his war and occupation in Iraq have made the United States more vulnerable and have opened a new front and a recruiting tool for terrorists while diverting resources from essential homeland security efforts. In short, Washington\u2019s approach to homeland security fails to address key vulnerabilities, undermines civil liberties, and misallocates resources. The administration has taken some successful steps to counter terrorism, such as improved airline and border security, a partial crackdown on terrorist financing, improved international cooperation in sharing intelligence, the arrest of several high-level al-Qaida figures, and the disruption of a number of planned attacks. But these successes are overwhelmed by policy choices that have made U.S. citizens more rather than less vulnerable. The Bush White House has undermined the very values it claims to be defending at home and abroad\u2014democracy and human rights; both Washington\u2019s credibility and its efforts to combat terrorism are hampered when it aids repressive regimes. Furthermore, the administration has weakened the international legal framework essential to creating a global effort to counter terrorism, and it has failed to address the political contexts\u2014failed states and repressive regimes\u2014that enable and facilitate terrorism.    2002      Gershman, J. 2002.

But a military approach to the region's problems would be a deadly mistake: it could weaken local democracies and turn neutral forces into new enemies.       2000      Fox, J. & Gershman, J. 2000.
