Today's urban planners must balance development, community needs and social justice, provision of critical public services, sustainability and security.   Housed within a school of public service, rather than a school of architecture, the Master of Urban Planning program uses the broader contexts of policy, management and finance to prepare students with the critical thinking they need to succeed in urban design, land use, economic and community development, housing, and environmental and infrastructure planning.   NYU Wagner is at the forefront of the vital issues and debates about the future of cities, and the program presents myriad opportunities to obtain and practice the skills needed to confront these challenges, in New York and beyond.

As a graduate of the MS program, you will have the following knowledge and competencies:     The ability to identify, define, collect, analyze, and communicate relevant data from diverse sources (tabular, web, sensors, etc.)   A depth of knowledge in a particular urban domain, such as energy, buildings, transportation, etc., and in a discipline, including visualization, decision models and optimization, simulation and computational methods   An understanding of urban science and urban informatics and their relationship to the operation and development of cities   An ability to identify and assess problems, evaluate data needs and analytical approaches to problem-solving, and develop solutions in real-world, multiple-constraint contexts   The ability to utilize large-scale data to better understand city functions   Direct, hands-on experience working in high-intensity, real-world environments with industry and agency partners   The ability to manage and lead complex processes of technology innovation and deployment   Leadership skills for your chosen career path in an entrepreneurial venture or existing organization     If your background is in mathematics, science, or engineering, the MS in Applied Urban Science and Informatics will provide you with the opportunity to engage in the interdisciplinary study of urban science and informatics and to apply your technical skills to urban problems.   The one-year, three-semester, 30-credit MS program provides core courses in urban science, urban informatics, and information and communication technology in cities. You will have the opportunity to select from multiple urban domains and informatics disciplines to gain breadth and depth in the application of big data analytics to urban problems.   The program also contains a focus on entrepreneurship and innovation leadership, and you are given the option to study technology entrepreneurship or change leadership in an existing organization.   Additionally, you will complete the Urban Science Intensive. The Intensive will place you in a multidisciplinary environment with a specific city agency and industry partner to work on a project that addresses an actual, current urban challenge in a particular domain. The project may be within larger, ongoing research efforts involving city agencies and CUSP industry partners, a self-contained effort involving agencies and corporations, or entrepreneurial in focus and content.         What Makes the Program Special?   Seven elements are at the heart of why this program is unlike any other.       Discipline Specialization   Select an informatics discipline that will guide your applied work in the program. Discipline specializations are targeted at building skills for data acquisition and management, integration, and analysis in a number of subfields.   Domain Specialization   Choose to specialize in one urban domain (transportation and mobility; buildings and the built environment; public health, security, and emergency response; or environmental sustainability) that will serve as the basis for your Urban Science Intensive project.   Entrepreneurship and Innovation Leadership Specialization   You&#8217;ll have the option to specialize in either change leadership and organizational behavior or entrepreneurship and new venture creation. These skills are critical for successfully applying your degree to real world situations.
