The Jewish Community in Palestine Under Ottoman and British Rule    HBRJD-UA  188 4 points.    The growth of Jewish national aspirations in Europe from the 1880s led to an influx of Jews who wished to settle the land as farmers and to pursue Jewish economic autonomy within the Ottoman world. The occupation of Palestine by British forces and the British support for a Jewish National Home (Balfour Declaration) transformed Jewish expectations. Increasing waves of immigration began to change the demographic character of Palestine, and the Zionist movement now dominated Jewish life there. We examine the growth of the Jewish community, as well as cooperation and conflict with the Palestinian Arab population; the growth of Arab and Palestinian nationalism and the Arab response to both British rule and the growth of Jewish society; and the parallel development of Jewish demands for separatism and statehood.

For both, it is the formative event of their history. In recent decades, Israel's \"New Historians,\" alongside other researchers, have contributed to changes in the way historians, and even the Israeli public, see their past. We attempt to provide students with basic knowledge and analytical tools to understand what \"really happened,\" beyond narratives and memories.

Israeli  Politics in Comparative Perspective    HBRJD-UA  711 Offered  every two years. 4 points.

Objective (and a central methodological concern of political science) is to  critically examine the assumption of Israel as a \"case apart\" and to degree to  which Israel's \"unique\" characteristics may be understood as \"normal\" politics  in the world at large. In doing so, we seek both to better understand the Israeli  case and to explore diverse paths to conflict resolution.

The Jewish Community in Palestine Under Ottoman and British Rule    HBRJD-UA  188 4 points.    The growth of Jewish national aspirations in Europe from the 1880s led to an influx of Jews who wished to settle the land as farmers and to pursue Jewish economic autonomy within the Ottoman world. The occupation of Palestine by British forces and the British support for a Jewish National Home (Balfour Declaration) transformed Jewish expectations. Increasing waves of immigration began to change the demographic character of Palestine, and the Zionist movement now dominated Jewish life there. We examine the growth of the Jewish community, as well as cooperation and conflict with the Palestinian Arab population; the growth of Arab and Palestinian nationalism and the Arab response to both British rule and the growth of Jewish society; and the parallel development of Jewish demands for separatism and statehood. The  War of 1948    HBRJD-UA  189 Offered  every three years. 4 points.    The first Arab-Israeli war of 1948 still provokes multidimensional debates, in both academic and public circles.

For both, it is the formative event of their history.

Israeli  Politics in Comparative Perspective    HBRJD-UA  711 Offered  every two years. 4 points.    One  of the most characteristic themes in Israeli politics is that of Israel's  uniqueness, in its security needs, in its cultural and political identity, and  in its relationship to the international community. This widespread perception  of separateness readily contributes to and is at least partially constituted by  the state's history of strategic insecurity and political isolation in the  Middle East as well as its characteristic form of democratic governance.  Objective (and a central methodological concern of political science) is to  critically examine the assumption of Israel as a \"case apart\" and to degree to  which Israel's \"unique\" characteristics may be understood as \"normal\" politics  in the world at large. In doing so, we seek both to better understand the Israeli  case and to explore diverse paths to conflict resolution.

Topics covered include whether a machine could think, the reduction of the mind to the brain, connectionism and neural nets, mental representation, and whether consciousness can be explained materialistically. Group I: History of Philosophy       History of Ancient Philosophy V83.0020-001 TR 2-3:15 Masahiro Yamada       Examination of the major figures and movements in Greek philosophy, especially Plato and Aristotle.        V83.0021-001 History of Modern Philosophy MW 11:00-12:15 AM Wayne Waxman       In this course, we will read excerpts from the key metaphysical and epistemological texts of the greatest thinkers of what is often called philosophy\u2019s Golden Age: Descartes, Spinoza, Leibniz, Locke, Berkeley, Hume, and Kant.              V83.0039-001 Recent Continental Philosophy TR 9:30-10:45 John Richardson    The course will survey and assess the works of some of the major German and French philosophers in the second half of the 20 th Century. These will include: Heidegger (after Being and Time ), Gadamer, Habermas, Foucault, Derrida, and Deleuze. (We may give lesser attention to one or two others.) Group II: Ethics, Value, and Society           V83.0040-001 Ethics MW 3:30-4:45 Sharon Street       In this course, we will examine some central topics in moral philosophy. Among the questions we will consider are: What reason is there to be moral? Is pleasure the only ultimate good? What makes an action right or wrong, and to what extent is this a matter of the action's consequences? What role should the concept of virtue play in moral theorizing? Are there such things as moral facts, and if so, how should we understand them? Is there a single true morality, or is moral truth relative to culture or the individual?Readings will be drawn from both contemporary and historical sources.        V83.0050-001 Medical Ethics TR 11-12:15 William Ruddick    Examines moral issues in medical practice and research. Topics include euthanasia and quality of life; deception, hope, and paternalism; malpractice and unpredictability; patient rights, virtues, and vices; animal, fetal, and clinical research; criteria for rationing medical care; ethical principles, professional codes, and case analysis.    No prerequisites, but preference is given to juniors and seniors.        V83.0102-001 Topics in Ethics and Political Philosophy TR 11-12:15 Peter Unger Prerequisite: Two course in Philosophy, including either V83.0040, V83.0041, V83.0045, or V83.0052.    The course will revolve around two central questions in basic ethics, with related discussion of several topics in applied ethics. The first central question is, what is it that determines the moral status of a particular being? If we can save one human baby or else two elephants, in a world with plenty of each, what is it about the human baby that determines it's she alone that we should save, rather than both elephants, each (suppose) mentally more advanced than she? And, here's the second central question: Is there a morally significant distinction, even anywhere in the neighborhood of the (probably insignificant) distinction between causing and letting happen - between killing and letting die, for instance, and, for another instance, between inflicting pain and letting pain happen?      On the second question, I'll unconfidently argue that there really isn't any important distinction. And, so, it's terribly wrong to for us to allow distant little children, in the poorest regions, to suffer and die young. But, now turning back to the first question, there's this: If we can't find good reason to accord the human babies enormously higher moral status than almost all other mammals, will we then be required, on pain of behaving very badly, to provide them also, all over the world, with whatever aid they need to flourish? For many centuries, that may be enormously costly. So, there'll be important interplay between our two central questions. Our discussion of these questions will have implications for issues of discrimination, abortion, infanticide, euthanasia, and other \"hot topics\" in applied ethics.    Far from being a series of lectures, the course should consist mainly of lively discussion with, and among, its students, where the students think hard about ethical issues. Since there won't be an attempt to impart a \"body of ethical knowledge,\" there won't be any exams. But, students must write two lucid short papers, or possibly three, each on a different issue discussed in class.       Group III: Metaphysics, Epistemology, Mind, Language, and Logic       V83.0070-001 Logic MW 2-3:15 PM Peter Graham       Introduces the techniques, results, and philosophical import of 20th century formal logic. Principal concepts include those of sentence, set, interpretation, validity, consistency, consequence, tautology, derivation, and completeness.             V83.0074-001 Modal Logic TR 2-3:15 Kit Fine       Modal logic is the logic of necessity and possibility and other such notions. In recent times, the framework of possible worlds has provided a valuable tool for investigating the formal properties of these notions. This course provides an introduction to the basic concepts, methods, and results of modal logic, with an emphasis on its application to such other fields as philosophy, linguistics, and computer science.        V83.0076-001 Belief, Truth &amp; Knowledge MW 9:30-10:45 Roger White       This course is an inquiry into the nature of inquiry. We often seek answers to questions\u2014e.g., Who was responsible for the Sept 11 attacks? Will the Knicks win tonight? 837+655=?\u2014and take ourselves to know the answers, or have rational opinions, or to have good evidence for our views. Rather than answer these questions, we will step back and ask, What is the nature of evidence? and, What it is to know something or to be rational? In answering these questions, we will examine versions of, and responses to Skepticism: that there is very little we can know or have reason to believe.              V83.0085-001 Philosophy of Language MW 12:30-1:45 Ray Buchanan       Examines various philosophical and psychological approaches to language and meaning and their consequences for traditional philosophical problems in metaphysics, epistemology, and ethics. Discusses primarily 20th Century authors including Russell, Wittgenstein, and Quine.        V83.0098-001 Philosophy of Mathematics MW 2-3:15 Joshua Schechter       This seminar will provide an introduction to central topics in the philosophy of mathematics. We will discuss the nature of mathematical objects: Are they mental constructions, do they inhabit some Platonic realm, or are there no mathematical objects at all? We will also discuss the status of our knowledge of mathematics. The course will have two parts. In the first part, we will consider several historically influential views of mathematics, such as Formalism, Intuitionism, and Logicism. In the second part of the course, we will consider contemporary views of mathematics. This part of the course will be structured around the question of how our knowledge of mathematics ought to be explained. Views to be explored include Fictionalism, Neo-logicism, Plenitudinous Platonism, and Structuralism.Readings for the course will be taken from an introductory book as well as from a collection of primary sources. Students will be evaluated based on class participation, two short papers, and a longer final paper.             V83.0103-001 Topics in Metaphysics and Epistemology MW 4:55-6:10 Nico Silins Prerequisite: Two course in Philosophy, including either V83.0076 or V83.0078.       This course will focus on the metaphysics of human persons. The human organism where you are could continue to live as a human vegetable, without any psychology. But could you outlive any changes in your psychology, however extreme? If not, what is the relation between you and the human organism where you are? We will address these and other questions about human persons in connection with much more general questions about the metaphysics of objects which exist in space and time.

V88.0722    Cross listed as: V83.0123    READINGS IN CHINESE PHILOSOPHY AND CULTURE MW 12:30-1:45    This course introduces undergraduate students to the thought of seven major philosophers, beginning with an intensive study of the Confucian Analects. Following this, we read the works of Confucius' followers (Mo Tzu, Mencius, and Hsun Tzu) and their Daoist and Legalist adversaries (Lao Tzu, Chuang Tzu, and Han Fei Tzu. These thinkers from the pre-imperial period (ca. 500BC to the unification ofChina in 221BC) form the foundation upon which much of the subsequent culture rests. The course concludes with one dynastic history and one historical novel, both concerning the first imperial era, the Han.

The  Bible as Literature    HBRJD-UA  23 Identical  to RELST-UA 23. Offered periodically. 4 points.    Over  the past few decades, many readers have come to a fuller appreciation of the  emotional and imaginative power of the Bible's narratives, which still speak  with remarkable clarity to our own sensibilities, leading one critic to  characterize the Bible as a \"full-fledged kindred spirit\" of modernism. We  examine this \"kindred spirit,\" using a broadly literary approach as our guide.  While the focus is on narrative\u2014the Pentateuch (Genesis to Deuteronomy) and the  Former Prophets (Joshua to Kings), as well as shorter narrative books (Ruth, Jonah,  and Esther)\u2014also studies Ecclesiastes and Job as ancient precursors to modern  skepticism.

The object of intense religious devotion given its  role in the histories of three major religions, Jerusalem has become the focus  of a bitter nationalist struggle between Arabs and Jews, Israelis and  Palestinians. It is both a political symbol and the focus of fervid  imaginings for millions of people around the world. But in everyday life,  Jerusalem is home to 750,000 Jews and Arabs in an ethnically segregated but  prosperous binational city. Begins with a survey of the history of Jerusalem,  focusing on the late-Ottoman, British, partitioned Israeli and Jordanian eras,  before considering the growth of a united city under exclusive Israeli control  since 1967.

What was the profile of the Jewish immigrants to the destination countries? Was the composition of the immigration to Palestine unique? What obstacles did the migrants encounter in acting on their decision and how did they overcome them? Women in Israeli Society    HBRJD-UA  187 4 points.    Studies the role of women in the pre-state and Israeli society from the end of the 19th century until today from historical, sociological and legal perspectives. Topics include the myth of gender equality in Ottoman and Mandatory Palestine and later in the state of Israel; images of the \"new Hebrew woman,\" the reality and life of these women, and their contributions to the new Israeli society and culture; and the concepts of gender and national identities. The Jewish Community in Palestine Under Ottoman and British Rule    HBRJD-UA  188 4 points.    The growth of Jewish national aspirations in Europe from the 1880s led to an influx of Jews who wished to settle the land as farmers and to pursue Jewish economic autonomy within the Ottoman world. The occupation of Palestine by British forces and the British support for a Jewish National Home (Balfour Declaration) transformed Jewish expectations. Increasing waves of immigration began to change the demographic character of Palestine, and the Zionist movement now dominated Jewish life there. We examine the growth of the Jewish community, as well as cooperation and conflict with the Palestinian Arab population; the growth of Arab and Palestinian nationalism and the Arab response to both British rule and the growth of Jewish society; and the parallel development of Jewish demands for separatism and statehood. The  War of 1948    HBRJD-UA  189 Offered  every three years. 4 points.    The first Arab-Israeli war of 1948 still provokes multidimensional debates, in both academic and public circles. In the Palestinian and Arab collective memory, the war is engraved as the Nakba\u2014the catastrophe\u2014while Israel celebrates it as its day of independence. For both, it is the formative event of their history. In recent decades, Israel's \"New Historians,\" alongside other researchers, have contributed to changes in the way historians, and even the Israeli public, see their past. We attempt to provide students with basic knowledge and analytical tools to understand what \"really happened,\" beyond narratives and memories.

Israeli  Politics in Comparative Perspective    HBRJD-UA  711 Offered  every two years. 4 points.    One  of the most characteristic themes in Israeli politics is that of Israel's  uniqueness, in its security needs, in its cultural and political identity, and  in its relationship to the international community. This widespread perception  of separateness readily contributes to and is at least partially constituted by  the state's history of strategic insecurity and political isolation in the  Middle East as well as its characteristic form of democratic governance.  Objective (and a central methodological concern of political science) is to  critically examine the assumption of Israel as a \"case apart\" and to degree to  which Israel's \"unique\" characteristics may be understood as \"normal\" politics  in the world at large. In doing so, we seek both to better understand the Israeli  case and to explore diverse paths to conflict resolution. Attempts to address  the growing interest in comparative analysis of Middle Eastern politics, with a  focus on the State of Israel.

Among the questions we will consider are: What reason is there to be moral? Is pleasure the only ultimate good? What makes an action right or wrong, and to what extent is this a matter of the action's consequences? What role should the concept of virtue play in moral theorizing? Are there such things as moral facts, and if so, how should we understand them? Is there a single true morality, or is moral truth relative to culture or the individual?Readings will be drawn from both contemporary and historical sources.

The course will revolve around two central questions in basic ethics, with related discussion of several topics in applied ethics. The first central question is, what is it that determines the moral status of a particular being? If we can save one human baby or else two elephants, in a world with plenty of each, what is it about the human baby that determines it's she alone that we should save, rather than both elephants, each (suppose) mentally more advanced than she? And, here's the second central question: Is there a morally significant distinction, even anywhere in the neighborhood of the (probably insignificant) distinction between causing and letting happen - between killing and letting die, for instance, and, for another instance, between inflicting pain and letting pain happen?      On the second question, I'll unconfidently argue that there really isn't any important distinction. And, so, it's terribly wrong to for us to allow distant little children, in the poorest regions, to suffer and die young. But, now turning back to the first question, there's this: If we can't find good reason to accord the human babies enormously higher moral status than almost all other mammals, will we then be required, on pain of behaving very badly, to provide them also, all over the world, with whatever aid they need to flourish? For many centuries, that may be enormously costly. So, there'll be important interplay between our two central questions. Our discussion of these questions will have implications for issues of discrimination, abortion, infanticide, euthanasia, and other \"hot topics\" in applied ethics.    Far from being a series of lectures, the course should consist mainly of lively discussion with, and among, its students, where the students think hard about ethical issues. Since there won't be an attempt to impart a \"body of ethical knowledge,\" there won't be any exams. But, students must write two lucid short papers, or possibly three, each on a different issue discussed in class.       Group III: Metaphysics, Epistemology, Mind, Language, and Logic       V83.0070-001 Logic MW 2-3:15 PM Peter Graham       Introduces the techniques, results, and philosophical import of 20th century formal logic. Principal concepts include those of sentence, set, interpretation, validity, consistency, consequence, tautology, derivation, and completeness.             V83.0074-001 Modal Logic TR 2-3:15 Kit Fine       Modal logic is the logic of necessity and possibility and other such notions. In recent times, the framework of possible worlds has provided a valuable tool for investigating the formal properties of these notions. This course provides an introduction to the basic concepts, methods, and results of modal logic, with an emphasis on its application to such other fields as philosophy, linguistics, and computer science.        V83.0076-001 Belief, Truth &amp; Knowledge MW 9:30-10:45 Roger White       This course is an inquiry into the nature of inquiry. We often seek answers to questions\u2014e.g., Who was responsible for the Sept 11 attacks? Will the Knicks win tonight? 837+655=?\u2014and take ourselves to know the answers, or have rational opinions, or to have good evidence for our views. Rather than answer these questions, we will step back and ask, What is the nature of evidence? and, What it is to know something or to be rational? In answering these questions, we will examine versions of, and responses to Skepticism: that there is very little we can know or have reason to believe.              V83.0085-001 Philosophy of Language MW 12:30-1:45 Ray Buchanan       Examines various philosophical and psychological approaches to language and meaning and their consequences for traditional philosophical problems in metaphysics, epistemology, and ethics. Discusses primarily 20th Century authors including Russell, Wittgenstein, and Quine.        V83.0098-001 Philosophy of Mathematics MW 2-3:15 Joshua Schechter       This seminar will provide an introduction to central topics in the philosophy of mathematics. We will discuss the nature of mathematical objects: Are they mental constructions, do they inhabit some Platonic realm, or are there no mathematical objects at all? We will also discuss the status of our knowledge of mathematics. The course will have two parts. In the first part, we will consider several historically influential views of mathematics, such as Formalism, Intuitionism, and Logicism. In the second part of the course, we will consider contemporary views of mathematics. This part of the course will be structured around the question of how our knowledge of mathematics ought to be explained. Views to be explored include Fictionalism, Neo-logicism, Plenitudinous Platonism, and Structuralism.Readings for the course will be taken from an introductory book as well as from a collection of primary sources. Students will be evaluated based on class participation, two short papers, and a longer final paper.             V83.0103-001 Topics in Metaphysics and Epistemology MW 4:55-6:10 Nico Silins Prerequisite: Two course in Philosophy, including either V83.0076 or V83.0078.       This course will focus on the metaphysics of human persons. The human organism where you are could continue to live as a human vegetable, without any psychology. But could you outlive any changes in your psychology, however extreme? If not, what is the relation between you and the human organism where you are? We will address these and other questions about human persons in connection with much more general questions about the metaphysics of objects which exist in space and time. CROSS LISTED COURSES:    V78.0424    Cross listed as: V83.0127    Spinoza\u2019s Theological-Political Treatise and Its Aftermath    MW 11-12:15    Dr. Yitzhak Melamed    The course is an in-depth study of Spinoza's main political work, the Theological-Political Treatise.

V88.0722    Cross listed as: V83.0123    READINGS IN CHINESE PHILOSOPHY AND CULTURE MW 12:30-1:45    This course introduces undergraduate students to the thought of seven major philosophers, beginning with an intensive study of the Confucian Analects. Following this, we read the works of Confucius' followers (Mo Tzu, Mencius, and Hsun Tzu) and their Daoist and Legalist adversaries (Lao Tzu, Chuang Tzu, and Han Fei Tzu. These thinkers from the pre-imperial period (ca. 500BC to the unification ofChina in 221BC) form the foundation upon which much of the subsequent culture rests. The course concludes with one dynastic history and one historical novel, both concerning the first imperial era, the Han.

The Bible as Literature   HBRJD-UA 23 Identical  to RELST-UA 23. Offered periodically. 4 points.   Over the past few  decades, many readers have come to a fuller appreciation of the  emotional and imaginative power of the Bible's narratives, which  still speak with remarkable clarity to our own sensibilities, leading  one critic to characterize the Bible as a \"full-fledged kindred  spirit\" of modernism. The course pursues this \"kindred spirit,\"  using a broadly literary approach as its guide.

The myths of the  ancient Near East represent the earliest literary expressions of  human thought. Students in this class read myths from ancient Egypt,  Mesopotamia, Ugarit, Anatolia, and Israel, studying the myths  themselves as literary works, as well as exploring the ideas and  broader issues that shaped them. These myths, including both  extensive literary masterpieces such as the Epic of Gilgamesh and  shorter works such as the Flight of Etana to Heaven, offer a window  into the religious mentality of the ancient Near East, which in turn  laid the foundation for many elements of modern Western culture.

Ancient Egyptian  Mortuary Traditions   HBRJD-UA 134 Offered  every third year. Roth. 4 points.   Ironically, the  mummies, tombs, and pyramids that furnish most of our evidence for  life in ancient Egypt can be understood only in the context of the  Egyptians' beliefs about death. The course surveys these beliefs  and their evolution, examining translations of their mortuary texts  and the art, artifacts, and architecture they created to deal with  death. This interdisciplinary approach is then applied to the study  of ancient Egyptian life and society.

They have relocated to North and South America, South  Africa, and Australia, as well as to Israel. This course explores  many of the issues raised by the prominence of migration as a feature  of modern Jewish migrations, including the similarities and  differences between Jewish and non-Jewish migrations of the same  time, the causes and structures of the migrations, and the impact of  migration on the various aspects of integration in the receiving  societies.

The War of 1948   HBRJD-UA 189 Offered  every three years. 4 points.   The 1948 first  Arab-Israeli war still provokes multidimensional debates, in both  academic and public circles. In the Palestinian and Arab collective  memory, the war is engraved as the Nakba\u2014the catastrophe\u2014while  Israel celebrates it as its day of independence. For both, it is the  formative event of their history. In recent decades, Israel's \"New  Historians,\" alongside other researchers, contributed to changes in  the way historians, and even the Israeli public, see their past. In  this course, we attempt to provide students with basic knowledge and  analytical tools to understand what \"really happened,\" beyond  narratives and memories.      Russian Jewish History   HBRJD-UA 191 Offered  every other year. Estraikh. 4 points.   Focuses on Jewish  history in imperial Russia, from the end of the 18th century to the  beginning of the 20th.

Israeli Politics in Comparative Perspective HBRJD-UA 711 Offered every two years. 4 points. One of the most characteristic themes in Israeli politics is that of Israel's uniqueness, in its security needs, in its cultural and political identity, and in its relationship to the international community. This widespread perception of separateness readily contributes to and is at least partially constituted by the state's history of strategic insecurity and political isolation in the Middle East as well as its characteristic form of democratic governance. The objective of this class (and a central methodological concern of political science) is to critically examine the assumption of Israel as a \"case apart\" and to degree to which Israel's \"unique\" characteristics may be understood as \"normal\" politics in the world at large. In doing so, we seek both to better understand the Israeli case and to explore diverse paths to conflict resolution. This course will attempt to address the growing interest in comparative analysis of middle-eastern politics, with a focus on the State of Israel. Israeli Territorial Politics: Between Security &amp; Identity HBRJD-UA 712 Prerequisite: general knowledge of contemporary Israeli/Middle Eastern politics. Offered every two years. 4 points.

To accomplish this goal, this course will incorporate a range of scholarly historical and political readings on Israel as well as films and regular student-led discussions on relevant current events.
