Gomez is currently professor of History and Middle Eastern and Islamic Studies at New York University, having served as the director of the Association for the Study of the Worldwide African Diaspora (ASWAD) from its inception in 2000 to 2007. He has also served as chair of the History departments at both NYU and Spelman College, and served as President of UNESCO's International Scientific Committee for the Slave Route Project from 2009 to 2011. His first book, Pragmatism in the Age of Jihad: The Precolonial State of Bundu (Cambridge University Press, 1992), examines a Muslim polity in what is now eastern Senegal. The next publication, Exchanging Our Country Marks: The Transformation of African Identities in the Colonial and Antebellum South (University of North Carolina Press, 1998), is concerned with questions of culture and race as they were informed by the African presence and experience. Reversing Sail: A History of the African Diaspora (Cambridge University Press, 2005) is primarily aimed at an undergraduate audience, and is more fully involved with the idea of an African diaspora, as is Diasporic Africa: A Reader (New York University Press, 2006), an edited volume that spans time and space in investigating a variety of themes and issues. Black Crescent: African Muslims in the Americas (Cambridge University Press, 2005, Black Caucus of the American Library Association 2006 Literary Awards Winner for Nonfiction Category), continues with the study of the African diaspora by looking at the ways in which African Muslims negotiated their bondage and freedom throughout the Americas, but in a way that allows for significant integration of Islamic Africa. Primarily a cultural and social historian of both Africa and its diaspora, Gomez is currently in the writing stages of a book on the history of early and medieval West Africa, with a focus on imperial Songhay. Upon its completion, he plans to write a comprehensive study of the African diaspora, within which he will address all attendant arguments and debates. Throughout, he will remain connected to the Arabic manuscript project underway in Mali, arguably one of the most important endeavors to develop in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. He continues to work with these as well as other organizations invested in the struggles of people of African descent worldwide, and especially looks forward to exciting opportunities developing in Latin America.

We will investigate imperial legitimacy building, political discourse, consensus and opposition, negotiation and concessions to the powerful, local government and justice, corruption, oppression and patronage, as well as the social groupings and networks that afforded some leverage to the less powerful.

We will look at different groups in the empire's population--peasants in imperial and post-Soviet times, nobles, one empress and her advisor/lover, Muslims, various nationalities, Soviet officials, workers, and youth and at the linkages among them and to the state.    The Ottoman 17th Century HIST-GA 3503 4 points. 2013-14.

It includes cities from Barcelona to Moscow, and ranges widely over the 19th and 20th centuries, but its ultimate goal is not to \"cover\" particular cities or themes so much as to introduce major works and approaches from the previous decade. What issues are energizing European urban history? How do these issues relate to broader developments in historiography and the humanities? In what ways does urban history contribute something distinctive to these conversations?    19th Century France HIST-GA 1209 4 points. 2014-15. Explores the transformation of France from the Old Regime monarchy of the late eighteenth century to the early Third Republic of the 1870s. We will focus first on the French Revolution, its origins, dynamics and consequences. We will then study the political, social, and cultural conflicts that help explain why the French went through three more revolutions--in 1830, 1848, and 1871--before establishing a stable form of republican government. We will also devote time to social and cultural history, and especially to recent literature on working-class formation, gender relations, and the peasantry.

Gomez is currently professor of History and Middle Eastern and Islamic Studies at New York University, having served as the director of the Association for the Study of the Worldwide African Diaspora (ASWAD) from its inception in 2000 to 2007. He has also served as chair of the History departments at both NYU and Spelman College, and served as President of UNESCO's International Scientific Committee for the Slave Route Project from 2009 to 2011. His first book, Pragmatism in the Age of Jihad: The Precolonial State of Bundu (Cambridge University Press, 1992), examines a Muslim polity in what is now eastern Senegal. The next publication, Exchanging Our Country Marks: The Transformation of African Identities in the Colonial and Antebellum South (University of North Carolina Press, 1998), is concerned with questions of culture and race as they were informed by the African presence and experience. Reversing Sail: A History of the African Diaspora (Cambridge University Press, 2005) is primarily aimed at an undergraduate audience, and is more fully involved with the idea of an African diaspora, as is Diasporic Africa: A Reader (New York University Press, 2006), an edited volume that spans time and space in investigating a variety of themes and issues. Black Crescent: African Muslims in the Americas (Cambridge University Press, 2005, Black Caucus of the American Library Association 2006 Literary Awards Winner for Nonfiction Category), continues with the study of the African diaspora by looking at the ways in which African Muslims negotiated their bondage and freedom throughout the Americas, but in a way that allows for significant integration of Islamic Africa. Primarily a cultural and social historian of both Africa and its diaspora, Gomez is currently in the writing stages of a book on the history of early and medieval West Africa, with a focus on imperial Songhay. Upon its completion, he plans to write a comprehensive study of the African diaspora, within which he will address all attendant arguments and debates. Throughout, he will remain connected to the Arabic manuscript project underway in Mali, arguably one of the most important endeavors to develop in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. He continues to work with these as well as other organizations invested in the struggles of people of African descent worldwide, and especially looks forward to exciting opportunities developing in Latin America.
