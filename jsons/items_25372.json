The remaining 9 credits are psychology electives, chosen from a wide variety of courses offered in other NYU graduate programs as well as local consortium universities.  Full-time students carry 12 to 13 credits per semester, and complete the program in 2 years. Part-time students carry 6 to 9 credits per semester and complete the program in 3 to 6 years. Individual curriculum advisement is available, and much information can be found online. Curriculum advisement for registration, regardless, is always offered in a group setting, because the majority of the full-time students follow the cohort curriculum (all students admitted in a given year take the same sequence of courses).

Generally, courses build upon each other, as for example, our three-term sequence of Children, Adolescent, and Adult Art Therapy. Our research class is offered in the third term in preparation for the thesis, in the fourth and final term. All core courses are lecture format with class discussion and varying amounts of art experientials. Classes are held weekly, in 2&frac12; hour sessions, with 14 -15 classes per semester. (See also courses offered.) Internships Our program offers unusual opportunities to graduate students in art therapy and takes full advantage of the wide variety of training opportunities available in New York, art capital of the world and center of one of the most diverse and richly complex health systems in the country. In particular, the concentration of experts in the field of mental health not only provides students with excellent opportunities for internships in a great variety of renowned settings, but also allows them to attend the numerous lectures, seminars, workshops and conferences that abound in New York. Global Internships The NYU Graduate Art Therapy Program offers an intensive 3-week internship abroad during the summer. Students work at a wide range of placements such as orphanages, academic settings, AIDS hospices, mental health facilities, senior residences, juvenile and adult prisons, and among HIV+ and other chronic populations. Internships have been held in Tanzania, Peru, South Africa and Brazil and will continue in other locations. Successful students earn 3 academic credits. The Final Project In addition to course work and internship requirements, students in the Program must complete a substantial project (thesis). The thesis must demonstrate both theoretical knowledge and accumulated clinical experience. It can be an in-depth case study, a research paper, or a creative and practical proposal (applied art therapy). The first draft of the thesis is due by March 1. Thereafter each student works closely with a reader (sponsor) up to the April 30 due date. The reader is usually a program faculty member, though for highly specialized topics, an outside expert will serve that function. The reader grades the thesis, but if the reader or the student requests a second opinion, a second reader will be recruited. In addition to the extensive narrative evaluation and commentary, the theses are graded on a scale of A through F (a B- is required to pass; successive revisions are permitted).  Upon completion of the thesis, students present their work in a program mini-conference. This is a full-day event, and student presenters are encouraged to invite family, friends and colleagues to attend. Professional Development New York University is also concerned with the continued growth and development of art therapists. We have instituted post-master&rsquo;s courses of interest to working professionals, such as Techniques of Supervision. Many graduates maintain a connection with the New York University&rsquo;s program serving as field supervisors, creating additional art therapy positions and contributing to the growth of art therapy. Some are successfully establishing private practices in communities and present their work in conferences and symposia. In addition we have been offering a lecture series and symposia featuring speakers from the fields of art, art history, psychoanalysis, psychiatry, and psychology. These special programs allow art therapists and related professionals to expand their knowledge and experience.

Genomics, the study of all the genes in an organism, is providing new insights into this amazing diversity of life on Earth. We begin with the fundamentals of DNA, genes and genomes. We then explore microbial diversity, with an emphasis on how genomics can reveal many aspects of organisms. We follow with examinations of animal and plant diversity. We examine the use of DNA to trace human ancestry, as well as the use of genomics as a diagnostic tool in medicine. We conclude by considering the societal implications of this ability to alter the genomes of crop plants, livestock and potentially humans.                  Study Questions   (1) What are the steps in cloning by nuclear transfer? Why is cloning of adult cells more difficult than cloning of embryonic cells?     (2) How is therapeutic cloning different from reproductive cloning?     ( 3) How is somatic gene therapy different from germline gene therapy?

Mission Statement The NYU Art Therapy Program integrates psychotherapy and visual arts practice, engaging the creative power of art for clinical assessment and treatment. In particular, we promote (1) scholarly research abilities and evidence-based clinical praxis, (2) cross-cultural competency with appreciation of social justice issues, and (3) fluency with the evolving technologies of new media art. Theoretical Orientation Our guiding theoretical orientation is psychoanalytic, which subsumes post-Freudian ego psychology, object relations, self psychology, and intersubjective psychology. We also focus on empirically based developments, especially attachment theory and trauma research. Background New York University has been identified with the training of art therapists since the 1950s when Margaret Naumburg, an eminent pioneer in the field, offered courses and training seminars on the graduate level in New York University&rsquo;s Department of Art and Art Professions. This tradition was continued when Edith Kramer came to the University in 1973 to develop a master&rsquo;s program in Art Therapy. By 1976, the master of arts in Art Therapy program had obtained approval from the New York State Education Department, and in 1979, New York University&rsquo;s Graduate Art Therapy program was one of the first of five programs to receive approval from the American Art Therapy Association.    Learning Outcomes    1. Demonstrate scholarly research abilities and integrate them effectively with evidence-based clinical praxis    2. Employ cross-cultural competency with an appreciation of social justice issues    3. Demonstrate fluency with the evolving technologies of new art media    Curriculum The program requires a total of 49 credits to graduate; 28 credits are core art therapy courses and 12 credits are internship . The remaining 9 credits are psychology electives, chosen from a wide variety of courses offered in other NYU graduate programs as well as local consortium universities.  Full-time students carry 12 to 13 credits per semester, and complete the program in 2 years. Part-time students carry 6 to 9 credits per semester and complete the program in 3 to 6 years. Individual curriculum advisement is available, and much information can be found online. Curriculum advisement for registration, regardless, is always offered in a group setting, because the majority of the full-time students follow the cohort curriculum (all students admitted in a given year take the same sequence of courses). The cohort sequence is designed to optimize preparation for clinical practice. For the first term, students take two foundation courses. The first is Art for Art Therapists, a studio-based class. Here, students have the opportunity to understand and interpret their own creative processes and products, which is essential for understanding their own clinical transference / countertransference issues. The second foundation course is Theory and Practice of Art Therapy. This course combines didactic classroom learning with a fieldwork component that allows them to ease into clinical work gradually. Specifically, students observe art therapists working in real clinical settings, for 85-100 hours. Generally, courses build upon each other, as for example, our three-term sequence of Children, Adolescent, and Adult Art Therapy. Our research class is offered in the third term in preparation for the thesis, in the fourth and final term. All core courses are lecture format with class discussion and varying amounts of art experientials. Classes are held weekly, in 2&frac12; hour sessions, with 14 -15 classes per semester. (See also courses offered.) Internships Our program offers unusual opportunities to graduate students in art therapy and takes full advantage of the wide variety of training opportunities available in New York, art capital of the world and center of one of the most diverse and richly complex health systems in the country. In particular, the concentration of experts in the field of mental health not only provides students with excellent opportunities for internships in a great variety of renowned settings, but also allows them to attend the numerous lectures, seminars, workshops and conferences that abound in New York. Global Internships The NYU Graduate Art Therapy Program offers an intensive 3-week internship abroad during the summer. Students work at a wide range of placements such as orphanages, academic settings, AIDS hospices, mental health facilities, senior residences, juvenile and adult prisons, and among HIV+ and other chronic populations. Internships have been held in Tanzania, Peru, South Africa and Brazil and will continue in other locations. Successful students earn 3 academic credits. The Final Project In addition to course work and internship requirements, students in the Program must complete a substantial project (thesis). The thesis must demonstrate both theoretical knowledge and accumulated clinical experience. It can be an in-depth case study, a research paper, or a creative and practical proposal (applied art therapy). The first draft of the thesis is due by March 1. Thereafter each student works closely with a reader (sponsor) up to the April 30 due date. The reader is usually a program faculty member, though for highly specialized topics, an outside expert will serve that function. The reader grades the thesis, but if the reader or the student requests a second opinion, a second reader will be recruited. In addition to the extensive narrative evaluation and commentary, the theses are graded on a scale of A through F (a B- is required to pass; successive revisions are permitted).  Upon completion of the thesis, students present their work in a program mini-conference. This is a full-day event, and student presenters are encouraged to invite family, friends and colleagues to attend. Professional Development New York University is also concerned with the continued growth and development of art therapists. We have instituted post-master&rsquo;s courses of interest to working professionals, such as Techniques of Supervision. Many graduates maintain a connection with the New York University&rsquo;s program serving as field supervisors, creating additional art therapy positions and contributing to the growth of art therapy. Some are successfully establishing private practices in communities and present their work in conferences and symposia. In addition we have been offering a lecture series and symposia featuring speakers from the fields of art, art history, psychoanalysis, psychiatry, and psychology. These special programs allow art therapists and related professionals to expand their knowledge and experience. Projects: Update on 911Arts Our 9/11 Arts Project, for World Trade Center first responders, is now open to new participants for group art sessions. The sessions are free of charge, and are open to all WTC personnel and their families.

Genomics, the study of all the genes in an organism, is providing new insights into this amazing diversity of life on Earth. We begin with the fundamentals of DNA, genes and genomes. We then explore microbial diversity, with an emphasis on how genomics can reveal many aspects of organisms. We follow with examinations of animal and plant diversity. We examine the use of DNA to trace human ancestry, as well as the use of genomics as a diagnostic tool in medicine. We conclude by considering the societal implications of this ability to alter the genomes of crop plants, livestock and potentially humans.                  Study Questions   (1) What are the steps in cloning by nuclear transfer? Why is cloning of adult cells more difficult than cloning of embryonic cells?     (2) How is therapeutic cloning different from reproductive cloning?     ( 3) How is somatic gene therapy different from germline gene therapy?

Kalinkowitz Memorial Lecture - The Oblique Angle: Psychoanalysis and the View from the Side   Co-sponsored by The Psychoanalytic Society of the Postdoctoral Program, Inc.      About the Presentation from Marilyn Charles:  I am intrigued by Lacan\u2019s notion of the oblique angle, the view from the side, in part because of the inherent mystery of seeing beyond our limits and also because of ways in which women have been placed as the object of a gaze that is not their own. From that perspective, the woman is in the \u2018sinister position,\u2019 coming from the side. As a left-handed person in a right-handed world, caught up in emotions opposed by the constraining conventionality esteemed in my family, I have often felt that I stand \u2018outside the gates,\u2019 speaking towards an authority that is not my own, hoping to be authorized by someone who fails to understand me. Therefore, this issue of what stands between the subject and her object remains a compelling question, a clinical dilemma captured by Lacan\u2019s diagram in which the analyst looks from the side to view what stands between the person and the projection of self imposed precisely because of beliefs that keep her from more truly being. We try to capture ourselves from various angles, looking for keys to a mystery we are terrified to reveal. The gaze from the oblique angle catches us in our games, busy pretending that if we close our eyes tightly enough we cannot be seen. The appeal of the oblique angle is also an aesthetic one, capturing a movement in the dance, a moment in the mystery. A case will be offered to explore what this oblique angle may both hide and reveal.

Moderator: William Auerbach, Ph.D.   Faculty of the NYU Postdoctoral Program in Psychotherapy and Psychoanalysis and the Contemplative Studies Project of New York University.      The dissociative processes of caregivers can resurface as the experience of internal blankness in subsequent generations. In such cases a substantial part of the analyst\u2019s task is to enter this blankness and elicit the emergence of complex internal representations that can be loved, hated, and ultimately mourned. An analytic case will be discussed that will focus on the interpersonal processes that allow a patient with a multi-generational legacy of political violence to increase their capacity to organize internal presences and establish a more cohesive personal history.          Location: NYU Kimmel Center, 60 Washington Square South, Room 802                              , -             Event: The Too Muchness of Excitement and The Birth of Desire   The Independent Track of the NYU Postdoctoral Program in Psychotherapy and Psychoanalysis      PRESENTS      The Too Muchness of Excitement and The Birth of Desire      This presentation brings together contemporary thinking about early attachment and affect regulation with our clinical and theoretical understanding of the problems of adult sexuality. Linked to recent theoretical developments, the clinical material and discussion will helps to grasp the relationship between sexual excitement and early affect. Clinical cases will be presented to illustrate this connection between attachment trauma, anxiety about sexuality, as well as shameful experiences of gender identity as an area of trauma. The discussion will emphasize the importance of working through of enactments and ruptures related to overstimulation, as well as the delicate balance of attention to fantasy and intersubjective work in the transference.

She identifies the need for trauma theory to account for the complexity and diversity of responses to traumatic events and the potential for growth and healing in individuals who have encountered tragedy. Through a detailed example from the life of an Auschwitz survivor, Marian Kolodziej, she illustrates the process by which traumatic experiences can be mourned, integrated, and mastered through artistic creation.
