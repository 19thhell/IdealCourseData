It integrates basic information about food intake and nutrition into discussions of nutrition-related issues around the world including evaluations, policies, and programs designed to improve the nutritional status of populations and to overcome barriers to their implementation.    This Honors Seminar will provide an experiential-based, case study approach to understanding nutrition. In particular, we will focus on the burden of malnutrition &ndash; both under- and over-nutrition (obesity)--and will examine several emerging topics including the nutrition transition, weaning and complementary feeding, and women and health. The travel-abroad component of the course will allow the students to compare the main nutrition-related problems between China and the United States, as well as between China and another country of their choice using different data sources as well as the first hand observation in China.

It integrates basic information about food intake and nutrition into discussions of nutrition-related issues around the world including evaluations, policies, and programs designed to improve the nutritional status of populations and to overcome barriers to their implementation.    This Honors Seminar will provide an experiential-based, case study approach to understanding nutrition. In particular, we will focus on the burden of malnutrition &ndash; both under- and over-nutrition (obesity)--and will examine several emerging topics including the nutrition transition, weaning and complementary feeding, and women and health. The travel-abroad component of the course will allow the students to compare the main nutrition-related problems between China and the United States, as well as between China and another country of their choice using different data sources as well as the first hand observation in China.

Students who intend to pursue a career in multinational firms, financial institutions, international organizations, or government agencies are strongly advised to acquire a solid perspective on the global dimensions of business, alongside their functional area of concentration. This insight has been the basis of the continued popularity of global business as a specialization in the MBA program. The Stern School has one of the largest faculties conducting research on the global dimensions of business which helps to support a broad spectrum of internationally focused courses. These courses consider important functional issues such as international trade and international macroeconomic relationships; international accounting and taxation; international marketing; and international banking and finance. They also convey specific skills such as international financial management and international negotiations. The global business specialization builds on the international content of the MBA core, notably the Global Economy course.
