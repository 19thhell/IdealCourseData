Whether you're looking to experience a new culture, learn a new language, deepen your knowledge of an particular area, or all of the above, Summer Abroad offers students an immersive experience outside of the stresses of the normal semester.   NYU's Summer Abroad programs vary greatly \u2013 by program, location, and academic offerings \u2013 but one thing is certain: as a Summer Abroad student with NYU, you will have access to the full range of resources that are the hallmark of NYU's global network. You'll have a hands-on experience, living and learning in which ever city you choose, and learning and exploring with NYU faculty and students.
