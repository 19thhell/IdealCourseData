Cities across time and around the world have profoundly influenced our very understanding of what it means to be human. The City investigates the urban phenomenon concretely and conceptually, as framework and crossroads, focusing on New York City as well as other metropolises. With their wealth of imagery, models, innovations, tensions, challenges, and dynamics, cities provoke both homogeneity and diversity, harmony and bloody conflict. With inexhaustible resources and questions, The City functions as laboratory, workshop, theatre, and teacher to the social sciences and humanities.  Sample Courses:  Students should refer to a current class schedule each semester to   determine current course offerings.The list below is representative, not exhaustive.  Introduction to the City I G65.1108 Introduces   the complex nature of the city and the local and global political,   social, and economic forces that shape it. As these forces manifest   themselves differently in different localities, students study various   city types, including the global city, the modern metropolis, and the   informal city. New York City is the main platform for exploration,   revealing as it does the continuities and congruencies in the forms and   processes that characterize contemporary cities. Garbage in   Gotham: The Anthropology of Trash G65.1813 Traces changing   definitions of value and worthlessness through Enlightenment, modern,   and postmodern theory. Considers these through the perspective of trash,   which is read as a reflection of contemporary social mores, time/space   compression, and fragmentations of cultural identity, among other   themes. Uses New York City as a case study. Introduction to the City II G65.2108 Students   learn various approaches for studying the city by transforming a topic   of interest into a researchable question, developing a research design,   and identifying the most appropriate methods for their chosen research   project. An overview of qualitative research methods is provided, both   through the examination of existing studies and the development of the   students\u2019 own projects. Topics   in the City: A Brief History of Urban Consciousness G65.3003 Starting   with Walter Benjamin\u2019s submission of the flaneur as the prototypical   subject of the modern metropolis, theorists have debated the   Eurocentric, hetero-normative, and bourgeois assumptions that underlie   such as framing of urban subjectivity. Indeed, post-structuralism,   feminist geography, queer theory and subaltern studies have staged   valuable interventions into this original thesis of urban consciousness   as submitted by Benjamin. This course is arranged around the central   premise that understanding urban space requires and interrogation of the   particular subjectivities that it produces and a sustained exploration   of the dialectic between subject and city.  Topics in the City   seminars examine particularly focused subject matter and themes, which   change frequently. Previous seminars have included \u201cMilitarization and   Urban Warfare\u201d and \u201cThe Public City: Public Space and the Public   Sphere.\u201d                   Back to Top                             Updated on 07&#047;29&#047;2010         Contact Us | &copy; New York University , Arts and Science"}]},

Cities across time and around the world have profoundly influenced our very understanding of what it means to be human. The City investigates the urban phenomenon concretely and conceptually, as framework and crossroads, focusing on New York City as well as other metropolises. With their wealth of imagery, models, innovations, tensions, challenges, and dynamics, cities provoke both homogeneity and diversity, harmony and bloody conflict. With inexhaustible resources and questions, The City functions as laboratory, workshop, theatre, and teacher to the social sciences and humanities.  Sample Courses:  Students should refer to a current class schedule each semester to   determine current course offerings.The list below is representative, not exhaustive.  Introduction to the City I G65.1108 Introduces   the complex nature of the city and the local and global political,   social, and economic forces that shape it. As these forces manifest   themselves differently in different localities, students study various   city types, including the global city, the modern metropolis, and the   informal city. New York City is the main platform for exploration,   revealing as it does the continuities and congruencies in the forms and   processes that characterize contemporary cities. Garbage in   Gotham: The Anthropology of Trash G65.1813 Traces changing   definitions of value and worthlessness through Enlightenment, modern,   and postmodern theory. Considers these through the perspective of trash,   which is read as a reflection of contemporary social mores, time/space   compression, and fragmentations of cultural identity, among other   themes. Uses New York City as a case study. Introduction to the City II G65.2108 Students   learn various approaches for studying the city by transforming a topic   of interest into a researchable question, developing a research design,   and identifying the most appropriate methods for their chosen research   project. An overview of qualitative research methods is provided, both   through the examination of existing studies and the development of the   students\u2019 own projects. Topics   in the City: A Brief History of Urban Consciousness G65.3003 Starting   with Walter Benjamin\u2019s submission of the flaneur as the prototypical   subject of the modern metropolis, theorists have debated the   Eurocentric, hetero-normative, and bourgeois assumptions that underlie   such as framing of urban subjectivity. Indeed, post-structuralism,   feminist geography, queer theory and subaltern studies have staged   valuable interventions into this original thesis of urban consciousness   as submitted by Benjamin. This course is arranged around the central   premise that understanding urban space requires and interrogation of the   particular subjectivities that it produces and a sustained exploration   of the dialectic between subject and city.  Topics in the City   seminars examine particularly focused subject matter and themes, which   change frequently. Previous seminars have included \u201cMilitarization and   Urban Warfare\u201d and \u201cThe Public City: Public Space and the Public   Sphere.\u201d                   Back to Top                             Updated on 07&#047;29&#047;2010         Contact Us | &copy; New York University , Arts and Science"}, {"content": "Anjuli | NYU Shanghai                                            Jump to navigation                                      Search form      Search                         \u4e2d\u6587               Research   Campus Life   Academic Life   Admissions   About                                              All Ranks          Professor          Associate Professor          Assistant Professor          Fellows / Instructors / Lecturers                          You are here Home &gt; Academic Life &gt; Our Faculty &gt; Anjuli Pandavar            Anjuli Pandavar                                                                                                     Anjuli Pandavar                                                   Language Lecturer           Email        ap150@nyu.edu           Room        1228           Office Phone        +86 (21) 20595071                                                          Anjuli Pandavar is language lecturer at NYU Shanghai.
