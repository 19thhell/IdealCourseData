Her 1982 dissertation, subsequently published as Chaucer and the Text in 1988, explored the relevance of new critical modes for older literature, while in her 1989 book, Chaucer's Sexual Poetics , she investigated the connection of past and present via the Western discursive tradition of gender. In Getting Medieval: Sexualities and Communities, Pre- and Postmodern (1999), she traced a queer desire for history. In her most recent book, How Soon is Now? Medieval Texts, Amateur Readers, and the Queerness of Time (2012), she looks directly at the experience of time itself, as it is represented in medieval works and as it is experienced in readers of those works. In the classroom, she regularly teaches materials past and present, in courses ranging from Medieval Misogyny to Queer New York City.     In graduate courses such as \u201cTime and Temporality in Medieval Literature,\u201d she has explored expanded notions of history and time\u2014affective history, embodied history, and the feeling of being a body in time\u2014in texts ranging from Boethius\u2019s Consolation of Philosophy to Chaucer\u2019s Troilus and Criseyde to Washington Irving\u2019s \u201cRip van Winkle,\u201d Derrida\u2019s Specters of Marx and Henri Bergson\u2019s Matter and Memory . Dinshaw has recently taught \"Ecological Approaches to Medieval Literature,\" in which students read medieval texts (especially those featuring a figure of Nature) in relation to theoretical materials by, among many others, Timothy Morton, Martin Heidegger, Bruno Latour, Catriona Sandilands and Bruce Erickson, and Dipesh Chakrabarty. Her work in the Department of Social and Cultural Analysis (where she is jointly appointed with the English Department) has provided a rich context in which to develop these ideas theoretically and cross culturally.     Dinshaw\u2019s current research projects extend her interests into the visual field. It\u2019s Not Easy Being Green focuses on the eerie figure of the foliate head \u2013 a decorative motif well nigh ubiquitous in medieval church sculpture in Western Europe that became known in the 20th century as the Green Man. This imagined mixture of human and vegetable (a head sprouting leaves or made up of vegetation) is the point of departure for her research on human/non-human relations, queerness and queer sexual subcultures now, \"the ecological thought\" (as Timothy Morton puts it), and what medieval literature can tell us about it all.     The second project, Exploring Nowhere: Mirages, Digital Maps, and the Historical Problem of Location , is undertaken with visual artist Marget Long. It is a project that explores paradoxical places where time and space operate differently from all other places on earth \u2013 \u201cnowheres that are somewhere\u201d (to adapt Alessandro Scafi\u2019s resonant phrase for medieval representations of Paradise). Long and Dinshaw look to the optical phenomenon of the mirage\u2014a strange and elusive \"nowhere\"\u2014to explore the broad concepts of location and locatability. They investigate the mirage\u2019s visual and cultural history through a wide array of materials: medieval maps and legends of Paradise (which was in at least one instance thought to be a mirage), early 20th-century Arctic exploration, and photographs and video works from Long\u2019s project on mirages. Long and Dinshaw take a long view of the mirage\u2014an illusion that prompts an irrational experience of time and space\u2014in order to imagine (among other things) how to work and play with current digital mapping technologies intended to work us.

Offered periodically. Vitz. 2 points.   Focuses on the saint as a major figure in Western culture. Examines definitions of holiness and models of sanctity in the Old and New Testaments and in the early Christian church, then explores the important role played by saints in medieval culture and beyond. Topics considered include the theology of devotion to the saints and to the Virgin Mary in Catholicism and Eastern Orthodoxy, determination of sainthood, and gender differences among saints. Uses literary, historical, artistic, and religious documents.    Don Quixote   MEDI-UA 371 Dopico-Black. 4 points.   A reading of Cervantes's Don Quixote that explores its privileged position as the first modern novel while also attending to the rich and complex historical context from which it emerged.    The Medieval and Renaissance Love Lyric   MEDI-UA 420 Offered periodically. 4 points.   The courtly love lyric, one of the most enduring genres of Western literature, portrayed love as an experience ranging from a degrading passion to an ennobling force, often crucial to poetic inspiration. The course traces the medieval love lyric from its beginnings in 11th-century Provencal through its developments in Latin, German, Italian, French, Spanish, Portuguese, and English. Examines how the themes and conventions of this lyric are transformed in the Renaissance by such major love poets as Petrarch, Sidney, Shakespeare, and Donne. Medieval Misogyny MEDI-UA 488 4 points. Beginning with the biblical story of creation and moving through the powerful gendered tradition established by Saint Paul, this course will look at key texts of the Western Middle Ages (in modern English translation) in which men lay down the law, and occasionally, women talk back. Among other works we will take up the letters of Abelard and Heloise, the life of the enclosed Christina of Markyate, the fictive but larger than life Wife of Bath, and the imagined feminine utopia of Christine de Pizan.    Medieval Theatre   MEDI-UA 712 Offered periodically. 4 points.   Survey of medieval theatre in Europe: the plays and their contexts in the church, courts, and carnival.

Beginning with early stories of King Arthur and the knights of the Round Table, the course focuses on masterpieces of French, English, and German medieval literature. Through the European literary tradition, students examine larger problems of the development of medieval literature: the conception of history, the rise of the romance genre, the themes of courtly love, the code of chivalry, and philosophical and theological questions as the Arthurian material is developed through the stories of the Holy Grail.    Dante and His World   MEDI-UA 801 Identical to ENGL-UA 143, ITAL-UA 160. Offered every two to three years. Ardizzone, Freccero. 4 points.   Interdisciplinary introduction to late medieval culture, using Dante, its foremost literary artist, as a focus.

Acting Medieval Literature   MEDI-UA 868 Identical to FREN-UA 868, THEA-UT 732. Offered regularly. Vitz. 4 points.   Presents medieval literature as a set of springboards to performance rather than as a series of books to be read. In this strongly performance-oriented course, students approach this \"literature\" as works that were acted out, sung, and narrated from memory as part of a storytelling tradition. Students are invited to draw on their dramatic and musical skills and interests and stage medieval works. For their final project, students participate in staging and putting on a play, performing a substantial piece of narrative poetry, singing or playing a body of medieval songs, or choosing a similar activity. Works studied/performed include songs of the troubadours and trouveres; The Song of Roland; Chretien de Troyes's romance, Yvain; French fabliaux; and Sir Gawain and the Green Knight.

Study of the kinds of loves and desires portrayed in medieval literature: passionate love; refined \"courtly\" love; sexual or \"carnal\" love; love of kin; love of country; love of God. Discusses how literary genres can be largely defined by the nature of the desires represented, explores medieval theorists' views of human love, and investigates the conflicts among different kinds of love for medieval people.

{"detail": [{"content": "Carolyn Dinshaw, Faculty of English | NYU                                                    Back to Home                                             Carolyn Dinshaw   Professor of Social and Cultural Analysis, English; Chair of Social and Cultural Analysis   Ph.D. 1982, (English literature), Princeton; A.B. 1978, Bryn Mawr College.   Office Address: 20 Cooper Square, Room 416  New York, New York (US) 10003 Office Hours: Fall 2014: By Appointment Email:   Phone: (212) 992-8303 Fax: (212) 995-4433         Carolyn Dinshaw has been interested in the relationship between past and present ever since she began to study medieval literature. Her 1982 dissertation, subsequently published as Chaucer and the Text in 1988, explored the relevance of new critical modes for older literature, while in her 1989 book, Chaucer's Sexual Poetics , she investigated the connection of past and present via the Western discursive tradition of gender. In Getting Medieval: Sexualities and Communities, Pre- and Postmodern (1999), she traced a queer desire for history. In her most recent book, How Soon is Now? Medieval Texts, Amateur Readers, and the Queerness of Time (2012), she looks directly at the experience of time itself, as it is represented in medieval works and as it is experienced in readers of those works. In the classroom, she regularly teaches materials past and present, in courses ranging from Medieval Misogyny to Queer New York City.     In graduate courses such as \u201cTime and Temporality in Medieval Literature,\u201d she has explored expanded notions of history and time\u2014affective history, embodied history, and the feeling of being a body in time\u2014in texts ranging from Boethius\u2019s Consolation of Philosophy to Chaucer\u2019s Troilus and Criseyde to Washington Irving\u2019s \u201cRip van Winkle,\u201d Derrida\u2019s Specters of Marx and Henri Bergson\u2019s Matter and Memory . Dinshaw has recently taught \"Ecological Approaches to Medieval Literature,\" in which students read medieval texts (especially those featuring a figure of Nature) in relation to theoretical materials by, among many others, Timothy Morton, Martin Heidegger, Bruno Latour, Catriona Sandilands and Bruce Erickson, and Dipesh Chakrabarty. Her work in the Department of Social and Cultural Analysis (where she is jointly appointed with the English Department) has provided a rich context in which to develop these ideas theoretically and cross culturally.     Dinshaw\u2019s current research projects extend her interests into the visual field. It\u2019s Not Easy Being Green focuses on the eerie figure of the foliate head \u2013 a decorative motif well nigh ubiquitous in medieval church sculpture in Western Europe that became known in the 20th century as the Green Man. This imagined mixture of human and vegetable (a head sprouting leaves or made up of vegetation) is the point of departure for her research on human/non-human relations, queerness and queer sexual subcultures now, \"the ecological thought\" (as Timothy Morton puts it), and what medieval literature can tell us about it all.     The second project, Exploring Nowhere: Mirages, Digital Maps, and the Historical Problem of Location , is undertaken with visual artist Marget Long. It is a project that explores paradoxical places where time and space operate differently from all other places on earth \u2013 \u201cnowheres that are somewhere\u201d (to adapt Alessandro Scafi\u2019s resonant phrase for medieval representations of Paradise). Long and Dinshaw look to the optical phenomenon of the mirage\u2014a strange and elusive \"nowhere\"\u2014to explore the broad concepts of location and locatability. They investigate the mirage\u2019s visual and cultural history through a wide array of materials: medieval maps and legends of Paradise (which was in at least one instance thought to be a mirage), early 20th-century Arctic exploration, and photographs and video works from Long\u2019s project on mirages. Long and Dinshaw take a long view of the mirage\u2014an illusion that prompts an irrational experience of time and space\u2014in order to imagine (among other things) how to work and play with current digital mapping technologies intended to work us.

The Medieval and Renaissance Love Lyric   MEDI-UA 420 Offered periodically. 4 points.   The courtly love lyric, one of the most enduring genres of Western literature, portrayed love as an experience ranging from a degrading passion to an ennobling force, often crucial to poetic inspiration. The course traces the medieval love lyric from its beginnings in 11th-century Provencal through its developments in Latin, German, Italian, French, Spanish, Portuguese, and English. Examines how the themes and conventions of this lyric are transformed in the Renaissance by such major love poets as Petrarch, Sidney, Shakespeare, and Donne. Medieval Misogyny MEDI-UA 488 4 points.
