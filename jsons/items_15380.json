The course includes a one-week visit to a country in either Asia, Europe, or Latin America to experience the culture first-hand and meet with the executives of a major corporation based in that country. A final project is prepared analyzing the competitive positioning of the target company in its global marketplace. This program is currently the only one of its kind offered as part of an undergraduate business degree. Most recently, ISP destinations have included Berlin, Barcelona, Budapest, Buenos Aires, Hong Kong, Santiago, and Singapore.    If you are eligible to participate in ISP, you will receive an email from the International Exchanges &amp; Special Programs team during the summer between your Sophomore and Junior year.
