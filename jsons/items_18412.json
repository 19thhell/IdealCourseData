students with a current MSW student or MSW alumni. Champions draw upon on their experiences at NYU to highlight the opportunities and benefits of an NYU education.   The Champions were established to provide the School with a group of volunteer students who have the necessary skills to help new and prospective students throughout their application process.     How to become a champion   Any MSW student is eligible to become a Social Work Champion. Students are encouraged to get involved early to maintain relationships throughout their time in the program and beyond.   Champions are friendly, committed, and enthusiastic about sharing their NYU Silver stories and experiences. Beyond the satisfaction they gain by making guests to the University feel welcome, Champions develop interpersonal skils and aid prospective MSW students.

I felt warmly welcome and I spoke with several alumni and NYU champions, all of them gave me a clear picture of the depth and breath of this learning community. Joining the NYU Champions program was a way to give back and share my enthusiasm and love for Silver's with others. Joining the SLC and student groups such as Next-Steppers, PiP and LSWSO gave me an opportunity to fully connect with some of my many identities such as being an adult student, a member of the LGBT community and a Latina. The Social Justice components of this program are very important to me and while more work needs to be done, I strongly believe that we are moving in the right direction. The oppotunities for profesional and personal development such as the Undoing Racism training and last week's training on Having Uncomfortable Conversations are truly meaningful to me. I am a Zelda Foster Fellow and it is my honor to be placed at the Palliative Care Program of New York Presbyterian Hospital. I hope to work in Palliative and End of Life Care. This way, I can explore, work and lead into the realm where Social Work and Spirituality intersect.

My first field placement was with Fort Lee public schools in New Jersey and my second is at the Rockland Psychiatric Center in Rockland County, New York. My main reason to attend the Silver School of Social Work was not only because of the clinical focus the curriculum has, but also because of the supportive student body and welcoming faculty he encountered when visiting the school.

I joined NYU Silver mainly because of the sense of community I felt at the accepted student mixer in the Spring. Prior to that I was attracted to NYU Silver's global learning opportunity, I will definitely cease that opportunity in the future. My long term goals are to work with minority and developmentally disabled students function effectively in the school environment and in their communities, and becoming empowered to succeed in life post-graduation.

My current field placement is at Beth Israel's inpatient hospice unit through MJHS. My long term goals are to continue work in oncology, hospice, and palliative care. I also want to obtain a yoga for cancer teacher certificate to work with the cancer community.

I am currently focusing on enhancing my skills and knowledge on working with immigrants, refugees, and asylum seekers. My current field placement is at HealthRight International where I am working with survivors of torture seeking asylum status in the US. My long term goal is to open my own non-profit organization.

However, I am learning that there many levels of clinical practice, and I am excited to find out what those are over the next two years at the Silver School! My current field placement is with Catholic Guardian Services, and my ultimate goal is to work at a legislative level advocating for reproductive rights and sexual health education.

It was truly helpful. I joined the NYU Silver Community because from the beginning, I was supported by many NYU Silver students, staff and alumni and I wanted to be someone like that. I definitely feel as though the education is worth it however the values that have been embodied by the NYU Silver community match the values I have in my life, therefore it was a perfect fit! My long term goals include becoming a LCSW, working in a hospital setting to provide detoxification or rehabilitation to individuals that are chemically dependent and traveling to third world nations to volunteer! I am currently placed at the Center for Community Alternatives, Youth Program.

The NYU Silver community is downright amazing from the teachers to the students and the admissions staff. I am aiming to become a psychotherapist, I am not sure who my target population will turnout to be but I am interested in international social work as I was raised outside of the United States.                                                                            Alexa Roganti Manhattan, NY    2-Year MSW Student    Catholic University of America, BSW    aar479@nyu.edu                                     Biography     During my junior year as an undergraduate I began working at the Lt. Joseph P. Kennedy Institute, a school for children with developmental and cognitive delays. My senior year placement was at Georgetown University Hospital in their division of infectious disease where I counseled patients living with HIV and often helped these patients find basic necessities that they could not afford. I found my place at NYU Silver and could not be happier.                                                                              Lindsay Fortner Long Island, NY    Extended MSW Student    Siena College    lindsay.fortner@nyu.edu                                     Biography     I love the fact that the professors are so approachable and have such a vast knowledge of the field. Coming to Silver for the clinical focus was my goal and I am loving every minute of it! After graduation, I hope to use my clinical skills in a higher education setting either in the counseling center or as career counselor.                                                                            Rose Dumond New York, NY    2-Year MSW Student    SUNY Stony Brook, Psychology & Sociology    rsd283@nyu.edu                                     Biography     I was greatly interested in the NYU Silver Community due to the high reputation of the school and the quality of the Social Work program the school has to offer. Unlike other schools, NYU not only offers direct clinical practice but also offers an opportunity for global learning in Social Work in various places around the world and a variety of electives to choose from which I felt other schools fell short of. I feel that if you have a great interest in the Social Work field but are not quite sure of where you want to head to, the variety of electives you are given can help narrow down your choices. My long term goals are to be able to work in an agency or setting that deals with homeless populations, adolescent/young adult groups or in a hospital setting. Right now my current field placement is called Selfhelp Community Services which deals with an older population and I feel this agency is a good way to ease yourself into the world of Social Work when dealing with a vulnerable population such as the elderly.   NYU had been my top choice for a while, with a generous package I feel I was able to afford the quality education they have provided me making me feel like I have no regrets in my choice. Ultimately, it is what you make of your education but I truly believe if you are interested in client work, global work or anything of the like, NYU is your school.                                                                            Marie DiLeonardo Massapequa Park, NY    2-Year MSW Student    SUNY New Paltz, Sociology    md3007@nyu.edu                                     Biography                   I joined the NYU Silver Community because of its vast social service agency connections throughout the NYC-NJ-Long Island area, its reputation as a global university, and because it has always been a dream of mine to study in NYC. My current field placement is at NYU College of Nursing Office of Student Affairs and Admissions. My long term goals are to work within the higher education or nonprofit administration/program development fields of practice as a social worker.

students with a current MSW student or MSW alumni. Champions draw upon on their experiences at NYU to highlight the opportunities and benefits of an NYU education.   The Champions were established to provide the School with a group of volunteer students who have the necessary skills to help new and prospective students throughout their application process.     How to become a champion   Any MSW student is eligible to become a Social Work Champion. Students are encouraged to get involved early to maintain relationships throughout their time in the program and beyond.   Champions are friendly, committed, and enthusiastic about sharing their NYU Silver stories and experiences. Beyond the satisfaction they gain by making guests to the University feel welcome, Champions develop interpersonal skils and aid prospective MSW students. Please contact our program cordinator to receive more information.   Activities May Include     Presenting at information events and panel presentations   Corresponding with prospective students   Welcoming and congragulating accepted MSW students via email   Attending graduate school fairs                                                                                                                                                             a group of outstanding MSW students                                                       Anahi Galante Jersey City, NJ    2-year MSW Student    Thomas Edison State College, Religion & Counseling    atg240@nyu.edu                                     Biography     NYU's Silver School of Social Work offered me a supportive environment and a challenging intellectual proposition. I felt warmly welcome and I spoke with several alumni and NYU champions, all of them gave me a clear picture of the depth and breath of this learning community. Joining the NYU Champions program was a way to give back and share my enthusiasm and love for Silver's with others. Joining the SLC and student groups such as Next-Steppers, PiP and LSWSO gave me an opportunity to fully connect with some of my many identities such as being an adult student, a member of the LGBT community and a Latina. The Social Justice components of this program are very important to me and while more work needs to be done, I strongly believe that we are moving in the right direction. The oppotunities for profesional and personal development such as the Undoing Racism training and last week's training on Having Uncomfortable Conversations are truly meaningful to me. I am a Zelda Foster Fellow and it is my honor to be placed at the Palliative Care Program of New York Presbyterian Hospital. I hope to work in Palliative and End of Life Care. This way, I can explore, work and lead into the realm where Social Work and Spirituality intersect.

My first field placement was with Fort Lee public schools in New Jersey and my second is at the Rockland Psychiatric Center in Rockland County, New York. My main reason to attend the Silver School of Social Work was not only because of the clinical focus the curriculum has, but also because of the supportive student body and welcoming faculty he encountered when visiting the school.

I joined NYU Silver mainly because of the sense of community I felt at the accepted student mixer in the Spring. Prior to that I was attracted to NYU Silver's global learning opportunity, I will definitely cease that opportunity in the future. My long term goals are to work with minority and developmentally disabled students function effectively in the school environment and in their communities, and becoming empowered to succeed in life post-graduation.

However, I am learning that there many levels of clinical practice, and I am excited to find out what those are over the next two years at the Silver School! My current field placement is with Catholic Guardian Services, and my ultimate goal is to work at a legislative level advocating for reproductive rights and sexual health education.

It was truly helpful. I joined the NYU Silver Community because from the beginning, I was supported by many NYU Silver students, staff and alumni and I wanted to be someone like that. I definitely feel as though the education is worth it however the values that have been embodied by the NYU Silver community match the values I have in my life, therefore it was a perfect fit! My long term goals include becoming a LCSW, working in a hospital setting to provide detoxification or rehabilitation to individuals that are chemically dependent and traveling to third world nations to volunteer! I am currently placed at the Center for Community Alternatives, Youth Program.

The NYU Silver community is downright amazing from the teachers to the students and the admissions staff. I am aiming to become a psychotherapist, I am not sure who my target population will turnout to be but I am interested in international social work as I was raised outside of the United States.                                                                            Alexa Roganti Manhattan, NY    2-Year MSW Student    Catholic University of America, BSW    aar479@nyu.edu                                     Biography     During my junior year as an undergraduate I began working at the Lt. Joseph P. Kennedy Institute, a school for children with developmental and cognitive delays. My senior year placement was at Georgetown University Hospital in their division of infectious disease where I counseled patients living with HIV and often helped these patients find basic necessities that they could not afford. I found my place at NYU Silver and could not be happier.                                                                              Lindsay Fortner Long Island, NY    Extended MSW Student    Siena College    lindsay.fortner@nyu.edu                                     Biography     I love the fact that the professors are so approachable and have such a vast knowledge of the field. Coming to Silver for the clinical focus was my goal and I am loving every minute of it! After graduation, I hope to use my clinical skills in a higher education setting either in the counseling center or as career counselor.                                                                            Rose Dumond New York, NY    2-Year MSW Student    SUNY Stony Brook, Psychology & Sociology    rsd283@nyu.edu                                     Biography     I was greatly interested in the NYU Silver Community due to the high reputation of the school and the quality of the Social Work program the school has to offer. Unlike other schools, NYU not only offers direct clinical practice but also offers an opportunity for global learning in Social Work in various places around the world and a variety of electives to choose from which I felt other schools fell short of. I feel that if you have a great interest in the Social Work field but are not quite sure of where you want to head to, the variety of electives you are given can help narrow down your choices. My long term goals are to be able to work in an agency or setting that deals with homeless populations, adolescent/young adult groups or in a hospital setting. Right now my current field placement is called Selfhelp Community Services which deals with an older population and I feel this agency is a good way to ease yourself into the world of Social Work when dealing with a vulnerable population such as the elderly.   NYU had been my top choice for a while, with a generous package I feel I was able to afford the quality education they have provided me making me feel like I have no regrets in my choice. Ultimately, it is what you make of your education but I truly believe if you are interested in client work, global work or anything of the like, NYU is your school.

My current field placement is at NYU College of Nursing Office of Student Affairs and Admissions. My long term goals are to work within the higher education or nonprofit administration/program development fields of practice as a social worker.

They reinforce concepts that help them strengthen their foundation for more advanced level studies and their own future endeavors.   As leaders on campus, our LAs' talents and accomplishments are appreciated by NYU faculty and administrators. Oftentimes they are asked to work directly with professors, strengthening those relationships. The academic success and professional development of our student staff are just as important to the ULC as the success of the students that are tutored.   Learning Assistants also form a close community of bright and ambitious students that support each other in school and beyond. ULC alumni have gone on to Teach for America, law school, dental and medical school, and graduate school, and have secured positions in banking and finance. They have won numerous awards, including the Fulbright Scholarship and the Paul and Daisy Fellowship for New Americans. They have been class Valedictorians and Diploma Recipients. We're proud of our ULC family, and hope you will join our team!          Roles and Responsibilities:   All Learning Assistants must attend a series of training sessions, beginning with the All-Team Training at the beginning of each semester, and continuing with specific sessions throughout the academic year.     Learning Assistants are also responsible for keeping up with material for any and all classes which they tutor. (Please note that preference is given to candidates who can tutor multiple courses.)     LAs will be given scheduled shifts for walk-in tutoring hours, and are expected to maintain these shifts weekly throughout the semester. Shifts can be anywhere from two to six hours long, and multiple shifts may be assigned per week. While on shift, students will see students on a walk-in basis, answer questions through our on-line platform, develop or prepare for workshops, or work on other projects as assigned.   Through training and tutoring hours, all of our Learning Assistants are required to and will become eligible for ITPC Level 1 Certification (International Tutor Program Certification) (also known as CRLA Certification - College Reading and Learning Association). Opportunities also exist for higher levels of certification.   In addition to walk-in hours, Learning Assistants are responsible for fulfilling TWO of the following roles each semester:     Science PT Leader (General Chemistry, Organic Chemistry, or Biology)   Bio Bits Leader   Study Slam Series Leader   Course-specific Learning Assistant (includes one workshop proposal/facilitation)     Department Liaison (includes one workshop proposal/facilitation)     English Language Support Series (Conversation or Writing)   Workshop development and facilitation (*can be done multiple times to fulfill the roles-requirements of a Learning Assistant)          Qualifications     Currently enrolled as a full-time matriculated undergraduate student in good academic standing at NYU.

Jenna James, Class of 2012, Learning Assistant 2009-2012, currently teaching 6th grade English through Teach for America.     Working at the ULC helped shape me not only as a leader within that community, but as a student and teacher. The learning center fosters an academic and supportive environment that carried me through three years of grueling papers and taxing exams. It also kindled my academic passions by allowing me access to and friendship with some of the brightest and dynamic students on campus. My experience at the ULC is what taught me how to break down concepts for others, and in doing so understanding them better myself. It is what led me to consider myself a teacher, someone who has something to offer others. The learning center stands not only as one of the best experiences of my college career, but also as one that helped determine my future.          Anita Burgos, Class of 2011, Learning Assistant 2010-2011, currently pursuing a PhD in Neuroscience at Columbia University.   Working at the ULC was enjoyable for so many reasons. It introduced me to some of the brightest people at NYU, who were not only smart, but very fun to be around. It helped hone my skills as a tutor because of the constant influx of students coming through the ULC and, most importantly, it cemented my desire to teach science at the university level.          Afaaf Shakir, Class of 2012, Learning Assistant 2010-2012, currently at Stanford School of Medicine.   I loved my time at the ULC. Some of my closest friends in undergrad stemmed from working there. It's a great environment to teach and learn in, and (for those planning on going to med school) tutoring premed classes is a perfect way to start pre-studying for the MCAT. I see myself in the future working in academic medicine, so working in the ULC was a great opportunity to learn my own teaching styles and begin to explore my own professional identity.          Emma Gilmore, Postbacc Class of 2012, Learning Assistant 2011-2012, beginning medical school at Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons.   One of the best memories of my interview day [at Columbia] is that I encountered three ULC people in quick succession before interviewing! Seeing them and feeling their support and enthusiasm was so important and helpful for me that day and I really think it had an effect. The ULC community made my post-bacc experience so much more meaningful than it ever could have been otherwise and I'm so grateful for that. The experience taught me to become more receptive and energetic both in and out of the classroom, and it will help me be better at both learning and teaching for the rest of my life.          Erika Ryan, Class of 2011, Learning Assistant 2008-2011, currently at Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons.   It was only after I graduated from NYU that I started to appreciate the profound impact that working at the ULC had on my college experience. The ULC forged a deep sense of community between all tutors and the students we tutored, initiating long-lasting relationships with the people who are my best friends today. The people I met there gave my time at NYU a sense of purpose and transformed my approach to learning by showing me\u2014over and over again\u2014 that two minds are always better than one. Working as a tutor made me realize the value of collaboration, which inspired me to co-write my Senior Honors Thesis with a fellow ULC tutor. Looking back on college now, I realize that turoing made it possible for me to interact with like-minded people and work with others on an intimate academic level. It\u2019s difficult to forge a community in a large university, and I\u2019m so grateful that the ULC made one for me!          Wilfredo Matias, Class of 2010, Learning Assistant 2008-2010, currently at Harvard Medical School and recent recipient of the Soros Fellowship.   Working at the ULC for two years was one of the most meaningful experiences of my undergraduate career at NYU. I looked forward to going to work because I always had fun with my colleagues, the tutees, and I always ended up learning as much from those that I helped as I hope they learned from me. I encourage everyone to come down and take advantage of the wonderful resources and fun learning environment at the ULC.

Your NetID password is not the same as your NYU Google Apps password; see About Your NYU Password(s) below for details.       You are required to reset your NetID NYU password at least once each year; NYU Google Apps passwords do not currently have an annual reset policy.       For security reasons, you can not reuse passwords that you've used before.                                  related pages            Tips for Choosing a Strong Password       NetID &amp; Password FAQs       About NYUHome       NYU Email                        About Your NYU NetID   Activate Your NYU NetID   About Your NetID Password   How to Set or Change Your NetID Password   About Your Google Apps Password   How to Set or Change Your Google Apps Password   Services Affected by Password Changes   Forgotten Password   Troubleshooting Tips         About Your NYU NetID   All NYU faculty and staff members, as well as students enrolled in degree or diploma programs, are  provided with an NYU NetID ( Net work ID entification). Your NetID is a combination of your initials  and a few random numbers, e.g., aqe123, and is usually printed on the back of your NYUCard. It is  different from your University ID, which is also printed on your NYUCard, but is a longer string of numbers  and starts with an \"N\". Once activated (see below), your NetID is your key to many NYU online resources,  including, for eligible community members, NYUHome .  Your NetID is also used to create your default NYU email address (e.g., aqe123@nyu.edu).      Activate Your NYU NetID   You can activate your NetID at any time, from any Internet-connected computer, using the NYU Start  Page ( start.nyu.edu ).  If you know your NetID (it is usually printed on the back of your NYU ID Card), enter it in the appropriate  field and click START! ; if not, follow the instructions at the top of the page. Then, complete the  steps for setting up a NetID password (visit the Security pages for password tips ,  and see below for an explanation of the difference between your NetID password and your Google Apps password).  If you encounter any problems, contact the IT Service Desk .      About Your NetID Password   Your NetID password is used to log into NYUHome, NYURoam Wireless, and many other NYU services. This password must be changed annually  (or more often, if you wish).    Note that you may need to set a separate NYU Google Apps password if you access  NYU Email with a desktop email program like Outlook or Thunderbird or access NYU Google Apps for Education using a mobile device like an iPad, iPhone  or Android. See below for a table that outlines the different services the two passwords allow you to access .      My NetID password is about to expire--what should I do?   For security reasons, NYU requires that you change your NetID password at least once  each year (no exceptions). You will receive email notifications from ITS when your NetID password  is about to expire; if you do not change your password in time, you will not lose any data stored on NYU systems, but you will  not be able to access that data or any NetID password-protected  services until you follow the instructions below to change your password.    You may need to update saved password information in your browsers or mobile  devices (e.g., iPad, iPhone, Android, Blackberry) once you've updated your password; see the   table below for a summary of affected services.      How to Set or Change Your NetID Password   For instructions on how to change your NetID password, please see Setting and changing your NetID password .      About Your Google Apps Password   If you wish to use a method other than the web interface (e.g., email.nyu.edu )  to access NYU Google Apps for Education&mdash;such as a desktop email program like Outlook or Thunderbird or certain email or calendar apps  on mobile devices like an iPhone, iPad, or other PDA&mdash;you must set a separate Google password.    If you use the web interfaces (e.g., email.nyu.edu ) or   NYUHome to access NYU Google Apps for Education, you can use your NetID and NetID password to log in,  and do not need to set a Google Apps password.        How to Set or Change Your Google Apps Password   For instructions on how to change your Google Apps password, please see Setting and changing your Google Apps password .      Services Affected by Password Changes   As described above, there are two passwords that are associated with the various services offered by ITS:  the NetID password and the Google Apps password. When you change your NetID password, this does not  change your Google Apps password, and vice versa.      NOTE: Mobile Device or Email Program Updates   When you change a password, you may need to update saved password information in your mobile device (e.g., iPhone,  iPad, Android, Blackberry), web browser, or desktop email program (e.g., Outlook or Thunderbird). Search the ServiceLink knowledge base for   setup instructions .      This table offers a summary of the services that are affected by each password:     Service NetID Password   Google Apps Password     NYU Email   Yes    Yes, if you use a desktop email program or mobile device app (e.g., certain apps on iPhone, iPad, Android, Blackberry, etc.) to access your NYU Email       NYU Calendar   Yes    Yes, if you use a mobile device app (e.g., certain apps on iPhone, iPad, Android, Blackberry, etc.) to access your NYU Calendar       Other Google Apps for Education (Documents, Sites, Groups)   Yes    Yes, if you use a mobile device app to access them        NYUHome   Yes    No        NYURoam wireless   Yes    No        VPN    Yes    No        Access to i4 and i5 accounts   Yes    No        NYU-NET Proxy   Yes    No       NYU-NET Computer Registration System   Yes   No        ResNet/Ethernet connections   No    No       Desktop computer administrator passwords  Yes, if the computer is registered with Active Directory; if the computer is not on Active Directory, it will not be affected by a NetID password change    No            Forgotten Password   If you forget your password, visit the NYU Start page  ( start.nyu.edu ),  enter your NetID, and click the START! button. On the next screen,  click the Forgot Your Password? link at the right then follow the instructions.  Contact the IT Service Desk if you encounter any issues.       Troubleshooting Tips     If you try to log in to an NYU website with your NetID and NetID password and receive  an error message telling your that your ID or password is incorrect, try logging  in again, making sure that you have typed your NetID and password correctly.  All NYU NetIDs are in lower case. Check to make sure Caps Lock isn't on by accident,  and you're using the NetID that is usually printed on the back of your NYUCard.   If you try again and you still can't log in, follow the forgotten password instructions  above.   If this still doesn't work, please contact the IT Service Desk for further instructions.

students with a current MSW student or MSW alumni. Champions draw upon on their experiences at NYU to highlight the opportunities and benefits of an NYU education.   The Champions were established to provide the School with a group of volunteer students who have the necessary skills to help new and prospective students throughout their application process.     How to become a champion   Any MSW student is eligible to become a Social Work Champion. Students are encouraged to get involved early to maintain relationships throughout their time in the program and beyond.   Champions are friendly, committed, and enthusiastic about sharing their NYU Silver stories and experiences. Beyond the satisfaction they gain by making guests to the University feel welcome, Champions develop interpersonal skils and aid prospective MSW students. Please contact our program cordinator to receive more information.   Activities May Include     Presenting at information events and panel presentations   Corresponding with prospective students   Welcoming and congragulating accepted MSW students via email   Attending graduate school fairs                                                                                                                                                             a group of outstanding MSW students                                                       Anahi Galante Jersey City, NJ    2-year MSW Student    Thomas Edison State College, Religion & Counseling    atg240@nyu.edu                                     Biography     NYU's Silver School of Social Work offered me a supportive environment and a challenging intellectual proposition. I felt warmly welcome and I spoke with several alumni and NYU champions, all of them gave me a clear picture of the depth and breath of this learning community. Joining the NYU Champions program was a way to give back and share my enthusiasm and love for Silver's with others. Joining the SLC and student groups such as Next-Steppers, PiP and LSWSO gave me an opportunity to fully connect with some of my many identities such as being an adult student, a member of the LGBT community and a Latina. The Social Justice components of this program are very important to me and while more work needs to be done, I strongly believe that we are moving in the right direction. The oppotunities for profesional and personal development such as the Undoing Racism training and last week's training on Having Uncomfortable Conversations are truly meaningful to me. I am a Zelda Foster Fellow and it is my honor to be placed at the Palliative Care Program of New York Presbyterian Hospital. I hope to work in Palliative and End of Life Care. This way, I can explore, work and lead into the realm where Social Work and Spirituality intersect.

My first field placement was with Fort Lee public schools in New Jersey and my second is at the Rockland Psychiatric Center in Rockland County, New York. My main reason to attend the Silver School of Social Work was not only because of the clinical focus the curriculum has, but also because of the supportive student body and welcoming faculty he encountered when visiting the school.

I joined NYU Silver mainly because of the sense of community I felt at the accepted student mixer in the Spring. Prior to that I was attracted to NYU Silver's global learning opportunity, I will definitely cease that opportunity in the future. My long term goals are to work with minority and developmentally disabled students function effectively in the school environment and in their communities, and becoming empowered to succeed in life post-graduation.

It was truly helpful. I joined the NYU Silver Community because from the beginning, I was supported by many NYU Silver students, staff and alumni and I wanted to be someone like that. I definitely feel as though the education is worth it however the values that have been embodied by the NYU Silver community match the values I have in my life, therefore it was a perfect fit!

The NYU Silver community is downright amazing from the teachers to the students and the admissions staff. I am aiming to become a psychotherapist, I am not sure who my target population will turnout to be but I am interested in international social work as I was raised outside of the United States.                                                                            Alexa Roganti Manhattan, NY    2-Year MSW Student    Catholic University of America, BSW    aar479@nyu.edu                                     Biography     During my junior year as an undergraduate I began working at the Lt. Joseph P. Kennedy Institute, a school for children with developmental and cognitive delays. My senior year placement was at Georgetown University Hospital in their division of infectious disease where I counseled patients living with HIV and often helped these patients find basic necessities that they could not afford. I found my place at NYU Silver and could not be happier.                                                                              Lindsay Fortner Long Island, NY    Extended MSW Student    Siena College    lindsay.fortner@nyu.edu                                     Biography     I love the fact that the professors are so approachable and have such a vast knowledge of the field. Coming to Silver for the clinical focus was my goal and I am loving every minute of it! After graduation, I hope to use my clinical skills in a higher education setting either in the counseling center or as career counselor.                                                                            Rose Dumond New York, NY    2-Year MSW Student    SUNY Stony Brook, Psychology & Sociology    rsd283@nyu.edu                                     Biography     I was greatly interested in the NYU Silver Community due to the high reputation of the school and the quality of the Social Work program the school has to offer. Unlike other schools, NYU not only offers direct clinical practice but also offers an opportunity for global learning in Social Work in various places around the world and a variety of electives to choose from which I felt other schools fell short of. I feel that if you have a great interest in the Social Work field but are not quite sure of where you want to head to, the variety of electives you are given can help narrow down your choices. My long term goals are to be able to work in an agency or setting that deals with homeless populations, adolescent/young adult groups or in a hospital setting. Right now my current field placement is called Selfhelp Community Services which deals with an older population and I feel this agency is a good way to ease yourself into the world of Social Work when dealing with a vulnerable population such as the elderly.   NYU had been my top choice for a while, with a generous package I feel I was able to afford the quality education they have provided me making me feel like I have no regrets in my choice. Ultimately, it is what you make of your education but I truly believe if you are interested in client work, global work or anything of the like, NYU is your school.

My current field placement is at NYU College of Nursing Office of Student Affairs and Admissions. My long term goals are to work within the higher education or nonprofit administration/program development fields of practice as a social worker.

They reinforce concepts that help them strengthen their foundation for more advanced level studies and their own future endeavors.   As leaders on campus, our LAs' talents and accomplishments are appreciated by NYU faculty and administrators. Oftentimes they are asked to work directly with professors, strengthening those relationships. The academic success and professional development of our student staff are just as important to the ULC as the success of the students that are tutored.   Learning Assistants also form a close community of bright and ambitious students that support each other in school and beyond. ULC alumni have gone on to Teach for America, law school, dental and medical school, and graduate school, and have secured positions in banking and finance. They have won numerous awards, including the Fulbright Scholarship and the Paul and Daisy Fellowship for New Americans. They have been class Valedictorians and Diploma Recipients. We're proud of our ULC family, and hope you will join our team!          Roles and Responsibilities:   All Learning Assistants must attend a series of training sessions, beginning with the All-Team Training at the beginning of each semester, and continuing with specific sessions throughout the academic year.     Learning Assistants are also responsible for keeping up with material for any and all classes which they tutor. (Please note that preference is given to candidates who can tutor multiple courses.)     LAs will be given scheduled shifts for walk-in tutoring hours, and are expected to maintain these shifts weekly throughout the semester. Shifts can be anywhere from two to six hours long, and multiple shifts may be assigned per week. While on shift, students will see students on a walk-in basis, answer questions through our on-line platform, develop or prepare for workshops, or work on other projects as assigned.   Through training and tutoring hours, all of our Learning Assistants are required to and will become eligible for ITPC Level 1 Certification (International Tutor Program Certification) (also known as CRLA Certification - College Reading and Learning Association). Opportunities also exist for higher levels of certification.   In addition to walk-in hours, Learning Assistants are responsible for fulfilling TWO of the following roles each semester:     Science PT Leader (General Chemistry, Organic Chemistry, or Biology)   Bio Bits Leader   Study Slam Series Leader   Course-specific Learning Assistant (includes one workshop proposal/facilitation)     Department Liaison (includes one workshop proposal/facilitation)     English Language Support Series (Conversation or Writing)   Workshop development and facilitation (*can be done multiple times to fulfill the roles-requirements of a Learning Assistant)          Qualifications     Currently enrolled as a full-time matriculated undergraduate student in good academic standing at NYU. Consideration could also be given to students enrolled in the Postbaccalaureate Prehealth Studies Program.     Sophomore, Junior, or Senior status by start date.   Minimum 3.5 grade point average within major and overall.   Recommended by two references. Two academic references preferred.   At least one recommendation must be from a professor at NYU in any of the subjects in which you would like to tutor.   The second reference should also be from a professor, but can be an NYU administrator (advisor, Dean\u2019s office, etc.) or a supervisor from a part-time job who can speak to your qualities as a potential ULC Learning Assistant.   Taken and earned a grade of \u201cA-\u201c or higher in the course(s) for which you would like to tutor.   Comfortable working in a collaborative group environment.

Join Our Team                                       Read what some of our distinguished alumni have to say about their time at the ULC!          Jenna James, Class of 2012, Learning Assistant 2009-2012, currently teaching 6th grade English through Teach for America.     Working at the ULC helped shape me not only as a leader within that community, but as a student and teacher. The learning center fosters an academic and supportive environment that carried me through three years of grueling papers and taxing exams. It also kindled my academic passions by allowing me access to and friendship with some of the brightest and dynamic students on campus. My experience at the ULC is what taught me how to break down concepts for others, and in doing so understanding them better myself. It is what led me to consider myself a teacher, someone who has something to offer others. The learning center stands not only as one of the best experiences of my college career, but also as one that helped determine my future.          Anita Burgos, Class of 2011, Learning Assistant 2010-2011, currently pursuing a PhD in Neuroscience at Columbia University.   Working at the ULC was enjoyable for so many reasons. It introduced me to some of the brightest people at NYU, who were not only smart, but very fun to be around. It helped hone my skills as a tutor because of the constant influx of students coming through the ULC and, most importantly, it cemented my desire to teach science at the university level.          Afaaf Shakir, Class of 2012, Learning Assistant 2010-2012, currently at Stanford School of Medicine.   I loved my time at the ULC. Some of my closest friends in undergrad stemmed from working there. It's a great environment to teach and learn in, and (for those planning on going to med school) tutoring premed classes is a perfect way to start pre-studying for the MCAT. I see myself in the future working in academic medicine, so working in the ULC was a great opportunity to learn my own teaching styles and begin to explore my own professional identity.          Emma Gilmore, Postbacc Class of 2012, Learning Assistant 2011-2012, beginning medical school at Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons.   One of the best memories of my interview day [at Columbia] is that I encountered three ULC people in quick succession before interviewing! Seeing them and feeling their support and enthusiasm was so important and helpful for me that day and I really think it had an effect. The ULC community made my post-bacc experience so much more meaningful than it ever could have been otherwise and I'm so grateful for that. The experience taught me to become more receptive and energetic both in and out of the classroom, and it will help me be better at both learning and teaching for the rest of my life.          Erika Ryan, Class of 2011, Learning Assistant 2008-2011, currently at Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons.   It was only after I graduated from NYU that I started to appreciate the profound impact that working at the ULC had on my college experience. The ULC forged a deep sense of community between all tutors and the students we tutored, initiating long-lasting relationships with the people who are my best friends today. The people I met there gave my time at NYU a sense of purpose and transformed my approach to learning by showing me\u2014over and over again\u2014 that two minds are always better than one. Working as a tutor made me realize the value of collaboration, which inspired me to co-write my Senior Honors Thesis with a fellow ULC tutor. Looking back on college now, I realize that turoing made it possible for me to interact with like-minded people and work with others on an intimate academic level. It\u2019s difficult to forge a community in a large university, and I\u2019m so grateful that the ULC made one for me!          Wilfredo Matias, Class of 2010, Learning Assistant 2008-2010, currently at Harvard Medical School and recent recipient of the Soros Fellowship.   Working at the ULC for two years was one of the most meaningful experiences of my undergraduate career at NYU. I looked forward to going to work because I always had fun with my colleagues, the tutees, and I always ended up learning as much from those that I helped as I hope they learned from me. I encourage everyone to come down and take advantage of the wonderful resources and fun learning environment at the ULC.

Your NetID password is not the same as your NYU Google Apps password; see About Your NYU Password(s) below for details.       You are required to reset your NetID NYU password at least once each year; NYU Google Apps passwords do not currently have an annual reset policy.       For security reasons, you can not reuse passwords that you've used before.                                  related pages            Tips for Choosing a Strong Password       NetID &amp; Password FAQs       About NYUHome       NYU Email                        About Your NYU NetID   Activate Your NYU NetID   About Your NetID Password   How to Set or Change Your NetID Password   About Your Google Apps Password   How to Set or Change Your Google Apps Password   Services Affected by Password Changes   Forgotten Password   Troubleshooting Tips         About Your NYU NetID   All NYU faculty and staff members, as well as students enrolled in degree or diploma programs, are  provided with an NYU NetID ( Net work ID entification). Your NetID is a combination of your initials  and a few random numbers, e.g., aqe123, and is usually printed on the back of your NYUCard. It is  different from your University ID, which is also printed on your NYUCard, but is a longer string of numbers  and starts with an \"N\". Once activated (see below), your NetID is your key to many NYU online resources,  including, for eligible community members, NYUHome .  Your NetID is also used to create your default NYU email address (e.g., aqe123@nyu.edu).      Activate Your NYU NetID   You can activate your NetID at any time, from any Internet-connected computer, using the NYU Start  Page ( start.nyu.edu ).  If you know your NetID (it is usually printed on the back of your NYU ID Card), enter it in the appropriate  field and click START! ; if not, follow the instructions at the top of the page. Then, complete the  steps for setting up a NetID password (visit the Security pages for password tips ,  and see below for an explanation of the difference between your NetID password and your Google Apps password).  If you encounter any problems, contact the IT Service Desk .      About Your NetID Password   Your NetID password is used to log into NYUHome, NYURoam Wireless, and many other NYU services. This password must be changed annually  (or more often, if you wish).    Note that you may need to set a separate NYU Google Apps password if you access  NYU Email with a desktop email program like Outlook or Thunderbird or access NYU Google Apps for Education using a mobile device like an iPad, iPhone  or Android. See below for a table that outlines the different services the two passwords allow you to access .      My NetID password is about to expire--what should I do?   For security reasons, NYU requires that you change your NetID password at least once  each year (no exceptions). You will receive email notifications from ITS when your NetID password  is about to expire; if you do not change your password in time, you will not lose any data stored on NYU systems, but you will  not be able to access that data or any NetID password-protected  services until you follow the instructions below to change your password.    You may need to update saved password information in your browsers or mobile  devices (e.g., iPad, iPhone, Android, Blackberry) once you've updated your password; see the   table below for a summary of affected services.      How to Set or Change Your NetID Password   For instructions on how to change your NetID password, please see Setting and changing your NetID password .      About Your Google Apps Password   If you wish to use a method other than the web interface (e.g., email.nyu.edu )  to access NYU Google Apps for Education&mdash;such as a desktop email program like Outlook or Thunderbird or certain email or calendar apps  on mobile devices like an iPhone, iPad, or other PDA&mdash;you must set a separate Google password.    If you use the web interfaces (e.g., email.nyu.edu ) or   NYUHome to access NYU Google Apps for Education, you can use your NetID and NetID password to log in,  and do not need to set a Google Apps password.        How to Set or Change Your Google Apps Password   For instructions on how to change your Google Apps password, please see Setting and changing your Google Apps password .      Services Affected by Password Changes   As described above, there are two passwords that are associated with the various services offered by ITS:  the NetID password and the Google Apps password. When you change your NetID password, this does not  change your Google Apps password, and vice versa.      NOTE: Mobile Device or Email Program Updates   When you change a password, you may need to update saved password information in your mobile device (e.g., iPhone,  iPad, Android, Blackberry), web browser, or desktop email program (e.g., Outlook or Thunderbird). Search the ServiceLink knowledge base for   setup instructions .      This table offers a summary of the services that are affected by each password:     Service NetID Password   Google Apps Password     NYU Email   Yes    Yes, if you use a desktop email program or mobile device app (e.g., certain apps on iPhone, iPad, Android, Blackberry, etc.) to access your NYU Email       NYU Calendar   Yes    Yes, if you use a mobile device app (e.g., certain apps on iPhone, iPad, Android, Blackberry, etc.) to access your NYU Calendar       Other Google Apps for Education (Documents, Sites, Groups)   Yes    Yes, if you use a mobile device app to access them        NYUHome   Yes    No        NYURoam wireless   Yes    No        VPN    Yes    No        Access to i4 and i5 accounts   Yes    No        NYU-NET Proxy   Yes    No       NYU-NET Computer Registration System   Yes   No        ResNet/Ethernet connections   No    No       Desktop computer administrator passwords  Yes, if the computer is registered with Active Directory; if the computer is not on Active Directory, it will not be affected by a NetID password change    No            Forgotten Password   If you forget your password, visit the NYU Start page  ( start.nyu.edu ),  enter your NetID, and click the START! button. On the next screen,  click the Forgot Your Password? link at the right then follow the instructions.  Contact the IT Service Desk if you encounter any issues.       Troubleshooting Tips     If you try to log in to an NYU website with your NetID and NetID password and receive  an error message telling your that your ID or password is incorrect, try logging  in again, making sure that you have typed your NetID and password correctly.  All NYU NetIDs are in lower case. Check to make sure Caps Lock isn't on by accident,  and you're using the NetID that is usually printed on the back of your NYUCard.   If you try again and you still can't log in, follow the forgotten password instructions  above.   If this still doesn't work, please contact the IT Service Desk for further instructions.
