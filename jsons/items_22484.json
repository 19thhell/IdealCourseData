The degree focuses on legal and financial translation as well as software localization. It is offered in English to Spanish , French to English and Spanish to English online, and in Chinese to English on-site, in New York City.   The program's rigorous curriculum prepares you to become an effective, professional translator by providing a foundation in translation and language theory, while addressing the practical aspects of translation as applied to the fields of business, finance, and law. You will learn to produce accurate, clear, and elegant texts in English. In addition, you will acquire the skills and the knowledge base needed to ensure textually and culturally accurate terminology in the preparation of business contracts, and books and articles on global commerce, trade, or the law. The program is taught by a faculty of accomplished translators and scholars who incorporate their applied professional experience into a curriculum that is rooted in translation theory and linguistic analysis.   Course offerings are organized into three groups: translation and language theory, legal and financial subject matter, and practical translation courses, with both required and elective courses in each group. While there are no required concentrations, the balance of required and elective courses allows you to focus more on legal or financial translation. The curriculum of the Chinese to English program reflects the needs of that specific market, covering a broader area of commercial translation and a course in technical translation. The final course is a capstone project, which can be either of a theoretical nature or a complex translation of significant length, which is defended in person at NYU or via video link in real time.   Students have the opportunity to expand the range of their skills and knowledge by auditing courses offered in our continuing education Certificates in Translation , enriching their portfolios by taking courses in areas of translation not offered in the master's program. All students, both online and on-site, benefit from the NYU Wasserman Center for Career Development at the NYU School of Professional Studies , where advisors work with them on job searches, interviewing skills, r\u00e9sum\u00e9 preparation, and other career-related areas.

The degree focuses on legal and financial translation as well as software localization. It is offered in English to Spanish , French to English and Spanish to English online, and in Chinese to English on-site, in New York City.   The program's rigorous curriculum prepares you to become an effective, professional translator by providing a foundation in translation and language theory, while addressing the practical aspects of translation as applied to the fields of business, finance, and law. You will learn to produce accurate, clear, and elegant texts in English. In addition, you will acquire the skills and the knowledge base needed to ensure textually and culturally accurate terminology in the preparation of business contracts, and books and articles on global commerce, trade, or the law. The program is taught by a faculty of accomplished translators and scholars who incorporate their applied professional experience into a curriculum that is rooted in translation theory and linguistic analysis.   Course offerings are organized into three groups: translation and language theory, legal and financial subject matter, and practical translation courses, with both required and elective courses in each group. While there are no required concentrations, the balance of required and elective courses allows you to focus more on legal or financial translation. The curriculum of the Chinese to English program reflects the needs of that specific market, covering a broader area of commercial translation and a course in technical translation. The final course is a capstone project, which can be either of a theoretical nature or a complex translation of significant length, which is defended in person at NYU or via video link in real time.   Students have the opportunity to expand the range of their skills and knowledge by auditing courses offered in our continuing education Certificates in Translation , enriching their portfolios by taking courses in areas of translation not offered in the master's program. All students, both online and on-site, benefit from the NYU Wasserman Center for Career Development at the NYU School of Professional Studies , where advisors work with them on job searches, interviewing skills, r\u00e9sum\u00e9 preparation, and other career-related areas.

M.A. in Teaching Spanish as a Foreign Language and TESOL Jointly offered by NYU's Graduate School of Arts and Science and Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development, this innovative degree program allows students to spend one year at NYU Madrid and one year at NYU's main campus in New York City. The goal of this program is to provide students with professional training in teaching of English and Spanish as second languages. Students will also gain mastery of the Spanish language through an immersive year living and studying in Spain. For more information about this program and to apply, please click here .  M.A. in Spanish and Latin American Linguistic, Literary, and Cultural Studies NYU\u2019s Graduate School of Arts and Science offers a unique one-year M.A. in Spanish and Latin American Linguistic, Literary, and Cultural Studies at NYU Madrid. With courses taught entirely in Spanish by NYU Madrid faculty, as well as by professors from Spanish universities, the M.A. brings an interdisciplinary and transatlantic perspective to the study of the Spanish-speaking world. A young, ethnically diverse, and culturally vibrant city, Madrid is home to growing Latin American communities, a focal point where the Iberian and Latin American worlds meet. The program takes full advantage of the vast range of cultural activities and events in Madrid, which form an integral part of the curriculum. Students have access to some of the most resourceful libraries and archives in the world and also benefit from membership to the historic Instituto Internacional and its excellent library. Depending on their interests and career goals, students choose one of two concentrations: Literary and Cultural Studies: Spain and Latin America or Applied Linguistics: Spain and Latin America . The capstone M.A. project allows students to develop an original scholarly work with the guidance of a faculty advisor, and to present a portion of this work at the Graduate Research Conference. The M.A. program is designed to encourage students to immerse themselves linguistically and culturally in Madrid life. All students are provided with a Madrid Cultura y Arte membership card to attend events, screenings, talks, shows, and exhibitions of their choice throughout the year. An integral part of the core curriculum and orientation program, visits and study trips give students the unique opportunity to investigate Spanish culture in situ. Whether studying urban space in Bilbao, transatlantic trade in Seville, or Roman architecture in Segovia, students are guided by faculty experts. Concentration in Literary and Cultural Studies: Spain and Latin America Students with a concentration in Literary and Cultural Studies develop their interests in literary and critical theory, peninsular and Latin American literature, and the arts and culture of both regions. While most students who choose this option are interested in pursuing a doctoral degree and/or teaching at the college or university level, others go on to careers in secondary education or in other fields in which they can use their thorough knowledge and understanding of the Spanish-speaking world. Concentration in Applied Linguistics: Spain and Latin America The concentration in Applied Linguistics emphasizes three main research areas within the historical, political, and cultural context of the Spanish-speaking world: general linguistics, psycholinguistic and sociolinguistic theories, second language teaching and acquisition, and translation studies. The program is designed for students interested in pursuing a doctoral degree in these fields or others related to Applied Linguistics, as well as for those whose professions (primary or secondary education, business, community service, government, international affairs, etc.) would benefit from advanced training. The concentration is not designed for students who wish to go on to a Ph.D. degree in literature. Why choose NYU Madrid? The unique one-year M.A. program offers graduate students rigorous academic training to develop their own research interests and approaches to debates in linguistic, literary, and cultural studies, often cutting across disciplinary boundaries. The design of the program aims to foster student responsibility and independence when exploring and generating new areas of knowledge in dialogue with the academic community at large, and beyond. NYU Madrid draws from the diverse expertise of its faculty within a local and global network of universities, research institutions, and cultural centers and museums, at the very core of our graduate students\u2019 experience in Madrid. Our challenge to students to develop their own goals for the program, met with the flexibility of its design and faculty encouragement to pursue independent research, has made for a successful combination. The M.A. program has served as a platform for students who wish to pursue a doctoral degree in their chosen field of studies and for those who aim to use their linguistic and cultural knowledge of the Spanish-speaking world for the benefit of their professions. Attracting students from diverse backgrounds in the United States and abroad, the M.A. program provides a forum to exchange ideas and explore new critical perspectives in which academic pursuits are inseparable from vital experience.
