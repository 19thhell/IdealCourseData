  \u00a0   About the Program   Journalism schools produce good reporters; MFA programs train beautiful writers. In the Literary Reportage concentration, we combine the best of both. Our students pursue their own long form projects, mentored by veteran writers in reporting classes, literature seminars, writing workshops and master classes taught by working editors .   Reporting is at the center of everything Literary Reportage students do. Whether you want to write a memoir, an expose, a portrait of a person or place, an extended consideration on the subject of your passion, it all starts with reporting. We\u2019ll teach you how to do what Tom Wolfe once termed \u201cstylish reporting.\u201d Many writing programs teach memoir, and that's something you can do in Literary Reportage, as well. The difference here is that we stress reporting \u2013 adding value to personal experience by collecting relevant information from the world outside one's head. Did your sister join a cult? Part of your mission would be to learn about the cult, past and present. Are there acquaintances from days gone by who could help set a remembered story in context? Part of your job might be to find them. That way, when you sit down to fashion your narrative, you'll have a richer set of materials to work with.You will then channel that reporting into well-researched, compelling narratives, which you will publish in professional venues while at NYU and, of course, beyond.   How do you apply? Like an aspiring novelist who submits short stories to an MFA program in the hopes of writing a novel, you submit a sample of your existing work (articles, blogs, videos, podcasts, essays--published or not), and a description of what you want to do while at NYU, whether a specific project or a kind of project. Think big, but also think concretely: What particular works or authors have inspired you and your project? What journalistic forms could you imagine it taking? What models do you have in mind?   Projects can be local, national, or international in scope. But since much of your reporting will be done while in residence at NYU, your project should have an NYC dimension. Some students divide their time between their final international or national project and its local iterations. In addition, access is important. You can\u2019t report on a subject if your subject won\u2019t talk to you. We\u2019ll help you as much as we can, but there are some worlds, like Hollywood, that simply can\u2019t be covered by NYC-based reporters. We don\u2019t care if you change your mind later \u2013 experimentation is part of the idea. That goes for form, as well: Some Literary Reportage students want to write books, others want to write articles. Some want to combine podcasts, video, books and articles. We will teach you how to work in all of these forms. We\u2019ll teach you how to use the technology (come visit and see our high tech facilities), whether in semester-long classes or intensive, week-long workshops. (All Literary Reportage students take a month-long, non-credit introductory multimedia course covering video, audio, slideshow and web skills.) But the most important thing we teach is how think in terms of \u201cstories.\u201d Rigorously reported, well-researched, imaginative, artfully written stories.   \u00a0   How does Literary Reportage work?   The courses are divided between journalism seminars and writing workshops. The first semester leans toward the former, while the remaining semesters leans toward the latter. For an overview of the curriculum click here . Literary Reportage became a full-fledged concentration in 2009, growing out of the Portfolio honors track , in which students learned how to build a coherent body of work over the course of two semesters. It worked well, and we suspected it would work even better if students applied with projects already in mind and had more time to complete their work. How does Literary Reportage differ from other the Arthur L. Carter Journalism Institute\u2019s other concentrations and programs? Our applicants must apply with a project in mind and, like the Global program, Literary Reportage students produce a master\u2019s project in their fourth and final semester, during which you need not be in residence.   \u00a0   Final Projects   Here are some of the final projects Literary Reportage students have produced in our first three years:   \"We Were All Going To Be Queens,\" a reported memoir about the Catholic cult Regnum Christi   \"Ballerina 2.0,\" about dancer Drew Jacoby's use of new media for self-promotion   \"Mother of Invention,\u201d a reported memoir about a single woman's decision to have a child   \u201cOn Trails,\u201d a meditation on the twists and turns of human navigation   \u201cAlone in America,\u201d a report on Korean students studying abroad   \u201cSikhing for God,\u201d a report on a New Mexican yoga cult   \u201cWrecking the House that Ruth Built,\u201d a proposal, sample chapter and outline for a book about corruption and Yankee Stadium   \u201cChristianity 2.0,\u201d a report on home worship and the reaction against the mega-church phenomenon   \u201cWhen the Facts of Life Aren\u2019t Facts,\u201d a report on sex education for students with special needs   \u00a0   Literary Reportage Master Class   The Fall 2014 Literary Reportage Master Class was taught by Sasha Weiss, the literary editor of\u00a0 Newyorker.com . Before \u00a0Before coming to\u00a0 The New Yorker , she was an editor at\u00a0 The New York Review of Books .\u00a0 Her writing has appeared on the\u00a0 Newyorker.com ,\u00a0 The Paris Review , Tablet, and elsewhere.   \u00a0     \u00a0       Upcoming Events         Program News   Congratulations to:   Laura Smith , Literary Reportage Kristian Jebsen , Magazine   Kristian Jebsen and Laura Smith, graduate students at New York University\u2019s Arthur L.

Carter Journalism Institute are pleased to announce a fully funded fellowship for students in, and alumni of, the Literary Reportage concentration.\u00a0 The fellowship offers an opportunity to develop a major essay, memoir, or feature piece during a month-long residency. Writers will work on their manuscript during weekly consultations with faculty editors, and round-table discussions with the other participants. By placing writers in a situation designed to challenge and stimulate their creativity, the program encourages the exploration of new ideas in journalism and experimentation with writing a piece that might otherwise be difficult to complete. The fellowship covers round trip airfare to Banff, and food and lodging during the month at the Banff Centre for the Arts.

This fellowship provided me with the necessary structure, freedom, and support to create a piece that I might not have completed otherwise\u00ad\u2014in my case, a piece of challenging, personal writing. Besides room and board, the Centre gives each writer a private cabin in the forested Leighton Artists\u2019 Colony, and plenty of time to write... I did not want to leave.

  \u00a0   About the Program   Journalism schools produce good reporters; MFA programs train beautiful writers. In the Literary Reportage concentration, we combine the best of both. Our students pursue their own long form projects, mentored by veteran writers in reporting classes, literature seminars, writing workshops and master classes taught by working editors .   Reporting is at the center of everything Literary Reportage students do. Whether you want to write a memoir, an expose, a portrait of a person or place, an extended consideration on the subject of your passion, it all starts with reporting. We\u2019ll teach you how to do what Tom Wolfe once termed \u201cstylish reporting.\u201d Many writing programs teach memoir, and that's something you can do in Literary Reportage, as well. The difference here is that we stress reporting \u2013 adding value to personal experience by collecting relevant information from the world outside one's head. Did your sister join a cult? Part of your mission would be to learn about the cult, past and present. Are there acquaintances from days gone by who could help set a remembered story in context? Part of your job might be to find them. That way, when you sit down to fashion your narrative, you'll have a richer set of materials to work with.You will then channel that reporting into well-researched, compelling narratives, which you will publish in professional venues while at NYU and, of course, beyond.   How do you apply? Like an aspiring novelist who submits short stories to an MFA program in the hopes of writing a novel, you submit a sample of your existing work (articles, blogs, videos, podcasts, essays--published or not), and a description of what you want to do while at NYU, whether a specific project or a kind of project. Think big, but also think concretely: What particular works or authors have inspired you and your project? What journalistic forms could you imagine it taking? What models do you have in mind?   Projects can be local, national, or international in scope. But since much of your reporting will be done while in residence at NYU, your project should have an NYC dimension. Some students divide their time between their final international or national project and its local iterations. In addition, access is important. You can\u2019t report on a subject if your subject won\u2019t talk to you. We\u2019ll help you as much as we can, but there are some worlds, like Hollywood, that simply can\u2019t be covered by NYC-based reporters. We don\u2019t care if you change your mind later \u2013 experimentation is part of the idea. That goes for form, as well: Some Literary Reportage students want to write books, others want to write articles. Some want to combine podcasts, video, books and articles. We will teach you how to work in all of these forms. We\u2019ll teach you how to use the technology (come visit and see our high tech facilities), whether in semester-long classes or intensive, week-long workshops. (All Literary Reportage students take a month-long, non-credit introductory multimedia course covering video, audio, slideshow and web skills.) But the most important thing we teach is how think in terms of \u201cstories.\u201d Rigorously reported, well-researched, imaginative, artfully written stories.   \u00a0   How does Literary Reportage work?   The courses are divided between journalism seminars and writing workshops. The first semester leans toward the former, while the remaining semesters leans toward the latter. For an overview of the curriculum click here . Literary Reportage became a full-fledged concentration in 2009, growing out of the Portfolio honors track , in which students learned how to build a coherent body of work over the course of two semesters. It worked well, and we suspected it would work even better if students applied with projects already in mind and had more time to complete their work. How does Literary Reportage differ from other the Arthur L. Carter Journalism Institute\u2019s other concentrations and programs? Our applicants must apply with a project in mind and, like the Global program, Literary Reportage students produce a master\u2019s project in their fourth and final semester, during which you need not be in residence.   \u00a0   Final Projects   Here are some of the final projects Literary Reportage students have produced in our first three years:   \"We Were All Going To Be Queens,\" a reported memoir about the Catholic cult Regnum Christi   \"Ballerina 2.0,\" about dancer Drew Jacoby's use of new media for self-promotion   \"Mother of Invention,\u201d a reported memoir about a single woman's decision to have a child   \u201cOn Trails,\u201d a meditation on the twists and turns of human navigation   \u201cAlone in America,\u201d a report on Korean students studying abroad   \u201cSikhing for God,\u201d a report on a New Mexican yoga cult   \u201cWrecking the House that Ruth Built,\u201d a proposal, sample chapter and outline for a book about corruption and Yankee Stadium   \u201cChristianity 2.0,\u201d a report on home worship and the reaction against the mega-church phenomenon   \u201cWhen the Facts of Life Aren\u2019t Facts,\u201d a report on sex education for students with special needs   \u00a0   Literary Reportage Master Class   The Fall 2014 Literary Reportage Master Class was taught by Sasha Weiss, the literary editor of\u00a0 Newyorker.com . Before \u00a0Before coming to\u00a0 The New Yorker , she was an editor at\u00a0 The New York Review of Books .\u00a0 Her writing has appeared on the\u00a0 Newyorker.com ,\u00a0 The Paris Review , Tablet, and elsewhere.   \u00a0     \u00a0       Upcoming Events         Program News   Congratulations to:   Laura Smith , Literary Reportage Kristian Jebsen , Magazine   Kristian Jebsen and Laura Smith, graduate students at New York University\u2019s Arthur L.

Carter Journalism Institute are pleased to announce a fully funded fellowship for students in, and alumni of, the Literary Reportage concentration.\u00a0 The fellowship offers an opportunity to develop a major essay, memoir, or feature piece during a month-long residency. Writers will work on their manuscript during weekly consultations with faculty editors, and round-table discussions with the other participants. By placing writers in a situation designed to challenge and stimulate their creativity, the program encourages the exploration of new ideas in journalism and experimentation with writing a piece that might otherwise be difficult to complete. The fellowship covers round trip airfare to Banff, and food and lodging during the month at the Banff Centre for the Arts.

Besides room and board, the Centre gives each writer a private cabin in the forested Leighton Artists\u2019 Colony, and plenty of time to write... I did not want to leave.

Literary walking tours of Paris and field-trips to sites frequented by Hemingway, Proust, Zola, Balzac, Hugo, Stein, Fitzgerald, Wilde, Voltaire, Diderot, Verlaine, Sartre, Kerouac, Joyce and other writers will provide a sense of the literary history of the city. Students may also visit museums with special guided tours to learn more about current exhibitions.            ACADEMICS      Students who participate in Writers in Paris choose to focus on either poetry or fiction and attend daily writing workshops and craft seminars. Students are mentored by accomplished professional writers and attend readings and special seminars led by visiting writers and editors. Writing and reading assignments are designed to encourage immersion in the city. For example, poets might visit the Louvre to write ekphrastic poems or create Parisian street sonnets by taking a 14-block walk of the St. Denis area, where Fran\u00e7ois Villon lived, and generating a line of poetry per block. Fiction writers might study dialogue by listening for overheard speech at a sidewalk caf\u00e9 or learn about description and setting by writing a story set in the neighborhood where Hemingway lived and worked. Students in the program work intensively to generate new writing and also attend a lively series of readings, lectures, literary walking tours, and special events.          HOUSING &amp; MEALS       All students participating in the program are required to live in NYU-provided housing. There are multiple choices for student housing in summer 2015. Students who select to stay in the Cit\u00e9 / Republique or Bastille / Republique (single or double) options will be required to move housing to R\u00e9sidence R\u00e9publique mid-program. Details of the exact date and time of the move will be shared soon. There will also be a bus to help facilitate this process, and NYU Paris staff will be on-site for move support. We hope to make this transition as smooth as possible for students.    For the last half of the program, all students are housed in single studios with kitchenettes in the R\u00e9sidence R\u00e9publique, operated by Les Estudines and located in the 11th arrondissement. There are laundry facilities and a small gym on-site. In R\u00e9sidence R\u00e9publique, students are situated near the Place de la Bastille, site of the legendary storming of the Bastille prison by masses of workers at the outset of the French Revolution. Though no trace of the Bastille prison remains, the Place de la Bastille is now the site of the Opera Bastille, home of the Paris National Opera. The residence is also just a short, 15-minute walk to Notre Dame and a quick Metro ride to all sites within Paris. The 11th arrondissement of Paris (called \u201cle Onzi\u00e8me\u201d by locals) is home to a bustling cosmopolitan community of artists, musicians, filmmakers, craftspeople, students, and writers; it is stocked with plenty of hip caf\u00e9s, quirky neighborhood restaurants, and trendy music venues.            EXCURSIONS    Program activities include literary readings, panels, and tours; a Bastille Day cruise on the Seine (with fireworks!) and visits to parks, restaurants, caf\u00e9s, and historic neighborhoods where famous writers have lived and worked.             COURSES      All courses are taught in English. All students must register for 8 points of undergraduate credit.      Coursework consists of alternating afternoons of craft seminars and writing workshops. Evenings feature readings, lectures, panel discussions, and special events. The schedule includes time for writing, reading, and exploring Paris, and the program culminates in a celebratory reading showcasing student work.     Students must register for one of the following courses:     CRWRI-UA 9818 \u2013 Writers in Paris: Fiction \u2500 8 points     CRWRI-UA 9819 \u2013 Writers in Paris: Poetry \u2500 8 Points      Each of these courses is comprised of a writing workshop, craft seminar, and nightly literary events. Students work closely with two accomplished world-class writers\u2014one in the context of the writing workshop, and another in the context of the craft seminar.     Workshops provide students with guidance on the art of revision, as well as with experience giving and receiving feedback. Individual private conferences supplement coursework, and each student submits a final portfolio of writing at the end of the program. In the craft seminars\u2014 literature courses taught by writers for writers\u2014 students study great works of literature in order to learn how to create their own. Emphasis is on close reading and the basic elements of craft. Poetry students read exemplary poems and study voice, style, line, image, music, metaphor, syntax, and diction. Fiction writers consider stories and novels with a focus on the basic techniques of fiction, including plot, narrative, dialogue, tone, structure, rhythm, setting, and style.      Students also attend a nightly series of readings, lectures, panel discussions, publishing forums, literary walking tours, and special events. These events feature program faculty as well as Paris-based and visiting writers, teachers, and editors.

  \u00a0   About the Program   Journalism schools produce good reporters; MFA programs train beautiful writers. In the Literary Reportage concentration, we combine the best of both. Our students pursue their own long form projects, mentored by veteran writers in reporting classes, literature seminars, writing workshops and master classes taught by working editors .   Reporting is at the center of everything Literary Reportage students do. Whether you want to write a memoir, an expose, a portrait of a person or place, an extended consideration on the subject of your passion, it all starts with reporting. We\u2019ll teach you how to do what Tom Wolfe once termed \u201cstylish reporting.\u201d Many writing programs teach memoir, and that's something you can do in Literary Reportage, as well. The difference here is that we stress reporting \u2013 adding value to personal experience by collecting relevant information from the world outside one's head. Did your sister join a cult? Part of your mission would be to learn about the cult, past and present. Are there acquaintances from days gone by who could help set a remembered story in context? Part of your job might be to find them. That way, when you sit down to fashion your narrative, you'll have a richer set of materials to work with.You will then channel that reporting into well-researched, compelling narratives, which you will publish in professional venues while at NYU and, of course, beyond.   How do you apply? Like an aspiring novelist who submits short stories to an MFA program in the hopes of writing a novel, you submit a sample of your existing work (articles, blogs, videos, podcasts, essays--published or not), and a description of what you want to do while at NYU, whether a specific project or a kind of project. Think big, but also think concretely: What particular works or authors have inspired you and your project? What journalistic forms could you imagine it taking? What models do you have in mind?   Projects can be local, national, or international in scope. But since much of your reporting will be done while in residence at NYU, your project should have an NYC dimension. Some students divide their time between their final international or national project and its local iterations. In addition, access is important. You can\u2019t report on a subject if your subject won\u2019t talk to you. We\u2019ll help you as much as we can, but there are some worlds, like Hollywood, that simply can\u2019t be covered by NYC-based reporters. We don\u2019t care if you change your mind later \u2013 experimentation is part of the idea. That goes for form, as well: Some Literary Reportage students want to write books, others want to write articles. Some want to combine podcasts, video, books and articles. We will teach you how to work in all of these forms. We\u2019ll teach you how to use the technology (come visit and see our high tech facilities), whether in semester-long classes or intensive, week-long workshops. (All Literary Reportage students take a month-long, non-credit introductory multimedia course covering video, audio, slideshow and web skills.) But the most important thing we teach is how think in terms of \u201cstories.\u201d Rigorously reported, well-researched, imaginative, artfully written stories.   \u00a0   How does Literary Reportage work?   The courses are divided between journalism seminars and writing workshops. The first semester leans toward the former, while the remaining semesters leans toward the latter. For an overview of the curriculum click here . Literary Reportage became a full-fledged concentration in 2009, growing out of the Portfolio honors track , in which students learned how to build a coherent body of work over the course of two semesters. It worked well, and we suspected it would work even better if students applied with projects already in mind and had more time to complete their work. How does Literary Reportage differ from other the Arthur L. Carter Journalism Institute\u2019s other concentrations and programs? Our applicants must apply with a project in mind and, like the Global program, Literary Reportage students produce a master\u2019s project in their fourth and final semester, during which you need not be in residence.   \u00a0   Final Projects   Here are some of the final projects Literary Reportage students have produced in our first three years:   \"We Were All Going To Be Queens,\" a reported memoir about the Catholic cult Regnum Christi   \"Ballerina 2.0,\" about dancer Drew Jacoby's use of new media for self-promotion   \"Mother of Invention,\u201d a reported memoir about a single woman's decision to have a child   \u201cOn Trails,\u201d a meditation on the twists and turns of human navigation   \u201cAlone in America,\u201d a report on Korean students studying abroad   \u201cSikhing for God,\u201d a report on a New Mexican yoga cult   \u201cWrecking the House that Ruth Built,\u201d a proposal, sample chapter and outline for a book about corruption and Yankee Stadium   \u201cChristianity 2.0,\u201d a report on home worship and the reaction against the mega-church phenomenon   \u201cWhen the Facts of Life Aren\u2019t Facts,\u201d a report on sex education for students with special needs   \u00a0   Literary Reportage Master Class   The Fall 2014 Literary Reportage Master Class was taught by Sasha Weiss, the literary editor of\u00a0 Newyorker.com . Before \u00a0Before coming to\u00a0 The New Yorker , she was an editor at\u00a0 The New York Review of Books .\u00a0 Her writing has appeared on the\u00a0 Newyorker.com ,\u00a0 The Paris Review , Tablet, and elsewhere.   \u00a0     \u00a0       Upcoming Events         Program News   Congratulations to:   Laura Smith , Literary Reportage Kristian Jebsen , Magazine   Kristian Jebsen and Laura Smith, graduate students at New York University\u2019s Arthur L.

Carter Journalism Institute are pleased to announce a fully funded fellowship for students in, and alumni of, the Literary Reportage concentration.\u00a0 The fellowship offers an opportunity to develop a major essay, memoir, or feature piece during a month-long residency. Writers will work on their manuscript during weekly consultations with faculty editors, and round-table discussions with the other participants. By placing writers in a situation designed to challenge and stimulate their creativity, the program encourages the exploration of new ideas in journalism and experimentation with writing a piece that might otherwise be difficult to complete. The fellowship covers round trip airfare to Banff, and food and lodging during the month at the Banff Centre for the Arts.

Besides room and board, the Centre gives each writer a private cabin in the forested Leighton Artists\u2019 Colony, and plenty of time to write... I did not want to leave.

Literary walking tours of Paris and field-trips to sites frequented by Hemingway, Proust, Zola, Balzac, Hugo, Stein, Fitzgerald, Wilde, Voltaire, Diderot, Verlaine, Sartre, Kerouac, Joyce and other writers will provide a sense of the literary history of the city. Students may also visit museums with special guided tours to learn more about current exhibitions.            ACADEMICS      Students who participate in Writers in Paris choose to focus on either poetry or fiction and attend daily writing workshops and craft seminars. Students are mentored by accomplished professional writers and attend readings and special seminars led by visiting writers and editors. Writing and reading assignments are designed to encourage immersion in the city. For example, poets might visit the Louvre to write ekphrastic poems or create Parisian street sonnets by taking a 14-block walk of the St. Denis area, where Fran\u00e7ois Villon lived, and generating a line of poetry per block. Fiction writers might study dialogue by listening for overheard speech at a sidewalk caf\u00e9 or learn about description and setting by writing a story set in the neighborhood where Hemingway lived and worked. Students in the program work intensively to generate new writing and also attend a lively series of readings, lectures, literary walking tours, and special events.          HOUSING &amp; MEALS       All students participating in the program are required to live in NYU-provided housing. There are multiple choices for student housing in summer 2015. Students who select to stay in the Cit\u00e9 / Republique or Bastille / Republique (single or double) options will be required to move housing to R\u00e9sidence R\u00e9publique mid-program. Details of the exact date and time of the move will be shared soon. There will also be a bus to help facilitate this process, and NYU Paris staff will be on-site for move support. We hope to make this transition as smooth as possible for students.    For the last half of the program, all students are housed in single studios with kitchenettes in the R\u00e9sidence R\u00e9publique, operated by Les Estudines and located in the 11th arrondissement. There are laundry facilities and a small gym on-site. In R\u00e9sidence R\u00e9publique, students are situated near the Place de la Bastille, site of the legendary storming of the Bastille prison by masses of workers at the outset of the French Revolution. Though no trace of the Bastille prison remains, the Place de la Bastille is now the site of the Opera Bastille, home of the Paris National Opera. The residence is also just a short, 15-minute walk to Notre Dame and a quick Metro ride to all sites within Paris. The 11th arrondissement of Paris (called \u201cle Onzi\u00e8me\u201d by locals) is home to a bustling cosmopolitan community of artists, musicians, filmmakers, craftspeople, students, and writers; it is stocked with plenty of hip caf\u00e9s, quirky neighborhood restaurants, and trendy music venues.            EXCURSIONS    Program activities include literary readings, panels, and tours; a Bastille Day cruise on the Seine (with fireworks!) and visits to parks, restaurants, caf\u00e9s, and historic neighborhoods where famous writers have lived and worked.             COURSES      All courses are taught in English. All students must register for 8 points of undergraduate credit.      Coursework consists of alternating afternoons of craft seminars and writing workshops. Evenings feature readings, lectures, panel discussions, and special events. The schedule includes time for writing, reading, and exploring Paris, and the program culminates in a celebratory reading showcasing student work.     Students must register for one of the following courses:     CRWRI-UA 9818 \u2013 Writers in Paris: Fiction \u2500 8 points     CRWRI-UA 9819 \u2013 Writers in Paris: Poetry \u2500 8 Points      Each of these courses is comprised of a writing workshop, craft seminar, and nightly literary events. Students work closely with two accomplished world-class writers\u2014one in the context of the writing workshop, and another in the context of the craft seminar.     Workshops provide students with guidance on the art of revision, as well as with experience giving and receiving feedback. Individual private conferences supplement coursework, and each student submits a final portfolio of writing at the end of the program. In the craft seminars\u2014 literature courses taught by writers for writers\u2014 students study great works of literature in order to learn how to create their own. Emphasis is on close reading and the basic elements of craft. Poetry students read exemplary poems and study voice, style, line, image, music, metaphor, syntax, and diction. Fiction writers consider stories and novels with a focus on the basic techniques of fiction, including plot, narrative, dialogue, tone, structure, rhythm, setting, and style.      Students also attend a nightly series of readings, lectures, panel discussions, publishing forums, literary walking tours, and special events. These events feature program faculty as well as Paris-based and visiting writers, teachers, and editors.
