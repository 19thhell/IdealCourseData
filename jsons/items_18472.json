Senior Projects may include, but are not limited to, a paper based on original research, a written assessment of a community-learning initiative, or an artistic project (such as design-based work, art exhibit, or theatrical production) accompanied by an analytic essay (comprising artistic background, aims, and technique). Completed Senior Projects are graded by faculty mentors and can be nominated for Honors. Please note that Senior Projects are separate and distinct from Independent Studies in their selection, expectations, and potential to earn Honors. All questions about the Senior Project should be directed to the Senior Class Adviser.           Students interested in undertaking a Senior Project should read all sections of the policy and procedures below before submitting a proposal:       Planning   Timing   Units   Requirements   Mentors   Proposal   Approval and Registration     Evaluation and Honors     Deadlines                 Planning     Senior Projects are student-generated. Generally they are an opportunity to continue a sustained line of inquiry that the student has already begun. A Senior Project may grow out of a piece of work (a research paper, a creative writing piece, a CLI project, a stage production, an art exhibit, etc.) a student has done in a course, tutorial, or independent study. It may also derive from questions or ideas spurred by a student\u2019s colloquium. Successful Senior Projects will involve significant preparation. As such students interested in pursuing a Senior Project are strongly encouraged to consult with their advisers early in their undergraduate program in order to plan for appropriate coursework and research well in advance. Indeed, students are strongly encouraged to consider undertaking an Independent Study in the semester prior to applying for a Senior Project, as a way to engage relevant secondary literature, formulate plausible research designs/creative processes, and generally lay the foundations for their potential Senior Projects.        Timing     Senior Projects may only be undertaken in the Fall or Spring semesters. Generally, students will complete Senior Projects in their final semester at Gallatin, following completion of their colloquia in their penultimate semester. In rare cases, students may complete their Senior Projects in their penultimate semester at Gallatin, and their colloquia in their final semester. However, only in exceptional circumstances may students undertake Senior Projects in the same semester when they intend to complete their colloquia. Students planning to graduate in September should plan to complete Senior Projects in the preceding Spring semester.          Units     The Senior Project is a four-unit course of study, requiring a minimum of seven contact hours between student and mentor during the course of the convening semester. The arrangement of contact hours will vary depending on the needs of the specific project and the student\u2019s level of progress. Please remember that according to Gallatin policy, students may register for no more than eight units per semester in any combination of independent study, tutorial, and/or Senior Project.         Requirements     While expectations for Senior Projects will differ depending on the nature of the work undertaken, certain minimum standards apply generally. In particular, all Senior Projects require a written component:       In general, research papers should be of substantial depth and length, and span approximately 40 pages. These papers should follow appropriate academic standards of documentation, argumentation, and analysis, as determined and developed in consultation with faculty mentors.   In general, artistic or design projects should be accompanied by essays of substantial depth and length \u2013 approximately 20 pages \u2013 that address the project\u2019s background (locating students\u2019 projects within a larger artistic or design context), artistic or design aims (articulating students\u2019 goals in mounting a particular project, and explaining how the actual project met those goals), and technical issues (such as character development, stage design, storyline creation, directorial choices, etc), as determined and developed in consultation with faculty mentors.           Note: In some cases Senior Projects may require and in fact be designed as part of an ensemble or group (for instance a play where the Senior Project is stage direction, or an ensemble production where the Senior Project is a student\u2019s individual performance, etc). However, all Senior Projects should be individually proposed and will be individually assessed by faculty mentors on their own merits.        Mentors     Students arrange to execute their Senior Projects under the guidance of an NYU faculty member. In most cases, students are already acquainted with the faculty mentor who will be supervising the study. The faculty mentor should help the student clarify the Senior Project proposal to ensure that it includes all necessary components. In the semester that the Senior Project is undertaken, faculty mentors meet regularly with the student to discuss readings and progress, as well as provide feedback on the development of the final product. At the end of the term, faculty mentors submit anecdotal grade reports that briefly describe and provide a final evaluation of the student\u2019s work to accompany the assignment of a letter grade. Please note that faculty mentors wishing to nominate the student work for honors designation should do so no later than one week before the last day of classes. Faculty members (both full-time and part-time) are limited to supervising no more than five independent studies and/or Senior Projects per Fall and Spring term.          Proposal     Only complete proposals will be considered. A completed Senior Project proposal will include the following elements:   1. Project Description: The description should be approximately three double spaced pages, and should clearly state the proposed research question or artistic aim(s) of the project. The proposal must explain how the student has prepared to carry out this project and how the student intends to complete the project within one semester. The project\u2019s relation to the student\u2019s ongoing work or area of concentration should be clear. The proposal should also clearly specify the expected output (i.e., a research paper, design project, or artistic project) and discuss the specific methods with which the project will be completed. These criteria will be determined between the student and the faculty mentor, and they will be used in evaluating the final project at the end of the semester.   2. Annotated Bibliography or Relevant Works: The bibliography should situate a student\u2019s project within a body of work in their field. This should include 8-12 books, articles, key documents, films, plays, catalogs, etc. Please provide the full citation and a short description of the relevance of each text or work to the proposed project.   3. Form : Completed Senior Project Proposal Form                Approval and Registration       Enrollment in a Senior Project requires the approval of the Gallatin School. Students should submit completed Senior Project proposals to Gallatin\u2019s Office of Student Services where it will be reviewed by Gallatin\u2019s Senior Project Committee according to the deadline below. Proposals will be reviewed with an eye toward selecting projects of exceptional promise. The committee will evaluate proposals based on the following criteria:     clarity of project goal(s), mode of inquiry, and final product   project\u2019s relation to concentration and course of study   feasibility of the project within one semester through an articulated timeline   clear articulation of student/mentor relationship, including schedule of meetings   the degree to which the project would culminate in an original artistic or scholarly work       Upon approval, students will receive a permission number required for registration from the Office of Student Services. Students may then register for the Senior Project on Albert, or in person if Albert is not available. Please note that students are responsible for the registration process .     Decisions regarding Senior Project proposals cannot be appealed. Proposals not selected as a Senior Project can be submitted as a non-honors track Independent Study. The Committee strongly suggests this option for students who are passionate about completing their proposed projects.          Evaluation and Honors     Evaluation : Each Senior Project will be evaluated by the faculty mentor for its ability to meet project aims as delineated in the project proposal as well as the degree to which the final product exemplifies original interdisciplinary work. Successful completion of the Senior Project will be noted in two ways: the student will receive a letter grade awarded by the faculty mentor for the course titled \u201cSenior Project,\u201d and upon graduation a notation will appear on the transcript listing the title of the Senior Project. All Senior Projects will also receive written evaluations from faculty mentors, submitted to the Gallatin Office of Student Services.     Honors : To be considered for Honors, Senior Projects should be nominated in writing by faculty mentors to the Gallatin Senior Project Committee no later than one week before the last day of classes. Letters of nomination should provide a description of why the Senior Project merits Honors. Upon review of the Senior Project, the Gallatin Senior Project Committee will award Honors to projects deemed exceptional according to the selection criteria. The Honors designation will appear on students\u2019 transcripts.     Note : To be considered for Honors, Senior Projects comprised of limited run engagements that cannot be fully submitted as text \u2013 such as exhibits, stage productions, recitals, etc \u2013 require the student and faculty mentor to coordinate with the Gallatin Senior Project Committee to have the Project assessed by Committee members at a mutually convenient time and place. We regret that we cannot consider anecdotal reports of such Projects in awarding Honors.        Deadlines     Proposals : Senior Project proposals and final papers/projects must be submitted according to the following firm schedule of submission deadlines:          Semester of Senior Project:      Senior Project proposal due:      To be considered for honors, project is due:       For non-honors grading, project is due:        Fall      May 1*      Two weeks prior to the last day of Fall classes      The last day of Fall classes      Spring      December 1*      Two weeks prior to the last day of Spring classes     The last day of Spring classes         *If this date is a Saturday or Sunday, proposals will be due the following Monday.                    top of page                           Quick Links                 Student Checklist Senior Project Proposal form Individualized Projects Deadlines                                                                                      NYU Gallatin Footer              Gallatin School of Individualized Study     1 Washington Place     New York, NY 10003     (212) 998-7370                   A&#8211;Z Index      Directions      Contact Us      Job Opportunities               News      Support Gallatin      Feedback                         Follow us on Facebook      Follow us on Twitter      Follow us on Youtube         Follow us Instagram                 Unless otherwise noted, all content copyright NYU Gallatin.

Carlyle Court Towers 2 and 3 will remain open through the Fall 2015 and Spring 2016 terms.     As indicated in an email sent to the NYU residence hall community by Marc Wais, Vice President of Student Affairs and Tom Ellett, Senior Associate Vice President of Student Affairs on February 6, 2015, the University has decided to move forward with significant facility upgrades to Tower 1 at Carlyle Court, upper-class residence hall accommodations. (Towers 2 and 3 will be scheduled for similar renovations the following years.). Consequently, the plan is to close Carlyle Court for renovation beginning December 23, 2015, and to reopen it on August 15, 2016.   Accommodations in Carlyle Court Tower 1 will be part of the 2015-2016 room selection process for upper-class students, and in particular, those planning to either study-away during the Spring 2016 semester or who have December 2015 graduation plans. Fall 2015 residents of Carlyle Court Tower 1 who plan to continue their studies at NYU-New York for the Spring 2016 semester will be reassigned to other space on campus prior to the December 23rd closure of the tower.   Please also note, we are looking forward to re-opening Hayden Hall for first-year students for Fall 2015, which means that some space in University Hall and Palladium Hall may become available for use by upperclassmen.     With the assistance of the NYU Office of Global Programs, we are pleased to announce a number of offerings in place for the Fall 2015 semester only, that seek to address the unique issues posed by a one semester placement in the Carlyle Court Tower 1.   Please review the following information carefully as it may influence your decisions relating to roommates and space selection options:     Spring 2016 Study Away Early Decision Admission - For this year, returning undergraduates may apply for a Spring 2016 Study Away early decision admission process. Students who select into Carlyle Court Tower 1 for the Fall 2015 semester will be eligible for priority notification of their study away admission. Students who meet the Study Away application requirements will receive special consideration for admission into one of their two site preferences. The Spring 2016 Study Away early decision admission application will open on March 2, 2015 and will be available via the &quot;Application Center&quot; on Albert. The deadline for the early admission consideration is May 1, 2015. Students who select into Carlyle Court Tower 1 and meet the deadline will receive priority notification by May 15, 2015.     Room Selection Priority for Academic Year 2016-2017 \u2013 Students who choose to live in Carlyle Court Tower 1 for the Fall 2015 semester will be given top priority for the Academic Year 2016-2017 room selection process.   Programmatic Enhancements - In addition to typical hall programming, there will be themed study away offerings in Carlyle Court Tower 1 designed to prepare students for the study away experience.   Fall Check-out -  Carlyle Court residents in towers 1 will be required to vacate their assignment no later than December 23, 2015. The University will provide appropriate accommodations for those students continuing their Fall 2015 housing assignment through Spring 2016.                          Important Updates   Room selection for 2015-2016 is now closed.

Senior Projects may include, but are not limited to, a paper based on original research, a written assessment of a community-learning initiative, or an artistic project (such as design-based work, art exhibit, or theatrical production) accompanied by an analytic essay (comprising artistic background, aims, and technique). Completed Senior Projects are graded by faculty mentors and can be nominated for Honors. Please note that Senior Projects are separate and distinct from Independent Studies in their selection, expectations, and potential to earn Honors. All questions about the Senior Project should be directed to the Senior Class Adviser.           Students interested in undertaking a Senior Project should read all sections of the policy and procedures below before submitting a proposal:       Planning   Timing   Units   Requirements   Mentors   Proposal   Approval and Registration     Evaluation and Honors     Deadlines                 Planning     Senior Projects are student-generated. Generally they are an opportunity to continue a sustained line of inquiry that the student has already begun. A Senior Project may grow out of a piece of work (a research paper, a creative writing piece, a CLI project, a stage production, an art exhibit, etc.) a student has done in a course, tutorial, or independent study. It may also derive from questions or ideas spurred by a student\u2019s colloquium. Successful Senior Projects will involve significant preparation. As such students interested in pursuing a Senior Project are strongly encouraged to consult with their advisers early in their undergraduate program in order to plan for appropriate coursework and research well in advance. Indeed, students are strongly encouraged to consider undertaking an Independent Study in the semester prior to applying for a Senior Project, as a way to engage relevant secondary literature, formulate plausible research designs/creative processes, and generally lay the foundations for their potential Senior Projects.        Timing     Senior Projects may only be undertaken in the Fall or Spring semesters. Generally, students will complete Senior Projects in their final semester at Gallatin, following completion of their colloquia in their penultimate semester. In rare cases, students may complete their Senior Projects in their penultimate semester at Gallatin, and their colloquia in their final semester. However, only in exceptional circumstances may students undertake Senior Projects in the same semester when they intend to complete their colloquia. Students planning to graduate in September should plan to complete Senior Projects in the preceding Spring semester.          Units     The Senior Project is a four-unit course of study, requiring a minimum of seven contact hours between student and mentor during the course of the convening semester. The arrangement of contact hours will vary depending on the needs of the specific project and the student\u2019s level of progress. Please remember that according to Gallatin policy, students may register for no more than eight units per semester in any combination of independent study, tutorial, and/or Senior Project.         Requirements     While expectations for Senior Projects will differ depending on the nature of the work undertaken, certain minimum standards apply generally. In particular, all Senior Projects require a written component:       In general, research papers should be of substantial depth and length, and span approximately 40 pages. These papers should follow appropriate academic standards of documentation, argumentation, and analysis, as determined and developed in consultation with faculty mentors.   In general, artistic or design projects should be accompanied by essays of substantial depth and length \u2013 approximately 20 pages \u2013 that address the project\u2019s background (locating students\u2019 projects within a larger artistic or design context), artistic or design aims (articulating students\u2019 goals in mounting a particular project, and explaining how the actual project met those goals), and technical issues (such as character development, stage design, storyline creation, directorial choices, etc), as determined and developed in consultation with faculty mentors.           Note: In some cases Senior Projects may require and in fact be designed as part of an ensemble or group (for instance a play where the Senior Project is stage direction, or an ensemble production where the Senior Project is a student\u2019s individual performance, etc). However, all Senior Projects should be individually proposed and will be individually assessed by faculty mentors on their own merits.        Mentors     Students arrange to execute their Senior Projects under the guidance of an NYU faculty member. In most cases, students are already acquainted with the faculty mentor who will be supervising the study. The faculty mentor should help the student clarify the Senior Project proposal to ensure that it includes all necessary components. In the semester that the Senior Project is undertaken, faculty mentors meet regularly with the student to discuss readings and progress, as well as provide feedback on the development of the final product. At the end of the term, faculty mentors submit anecdotal grade reports that briefly describe and provide a final evaluation of the student\u2019s work to accompany the assignment of a letter grade. Please note that faculty mentors wishing to nominate the student work for honors designation should do so no later than one week before the last day of classes. Faculty members (both full-time and part-time) are limited to supervising no more than five independent studies and/or Senior Projects per Fall and Spring term.          Proposal     Only complete proposals will be considered. A completed Senior Project proposal will include the following elements:   1. Project Description: The description should be approximately three double spaced pages, and should clearly state the proposed research question or artistic aim(s) of the project. The proposal must explain how the student has prepared to carry out this project and how the student intends to complete the project within one semester. The project\u2019s relation to the student\u2019s ongoing work or area of concentration should be clear. The proposal should also clearly specify the expected output (i.e., a research paper, design project, or artistic project) and discuss the specific methods with which the project will be completed. These criteria will be determined between the student and the faculty mentor, and they will be used in evaluating the final project at the end of the semester.   2. Annotated Bibliography or Relevant Works: The bibliography should situate a student\u2019s project within a body of work in their field. This should include 8-12 books, articles, key documents, films, plays, catalogs, etc. Please provide the full citation and a short description of the relevance of each text or work to the proposed project.   3. Form : Completed Senior Project Proposal Form                Approval and Registration       Enrollment in a Senior Project requires the approval of the Gallatin School. Students should submit completed Senior Project proposals to Gallatin\u2019s Office of Student Services where it will be reviewed by Gallatin\u2019s Senior Project Committee according to the deadline below. Proposals will be reviewed with an eye toward selecting projects of exceptional promise. The committee will evaluate proposals based on the following criteria:     clarity of project goal(s), mode of inquiry, and final product   project\u2019s relation to concentration and course of study   feasibility of the project within one semester through an articulated timeline   clear articulation of student/mentor relationship, including schedule of meetings   the degree to which the project would culminate in an original artistic or scholarly work       Upon approval, students will receive a permission number required for registration from the Office of Student Services. Students may then register for the Senior Project on Albert, or in person if Albert is not available. Please note that students are responsible for the registration process .     Decisions regarding Senior Project proposals cannot be appealed. Proposals not selected as a Senior Project can be submitted as a non-honors track Independent Study. The Committee strongly suggests this option for students who are passionate about completing their proposed projects.          Evaluation and Honors     Evaluation : Each Senior Project will be evaluated by the faculty mentor for its ability to meet project aims as delineated in the project proposal as well as the degree to which the final product exemplifies original interdisciplinary work. Successful completion of the Senior Project will be noted in two ways: the student will receive a letter grade awarded by the faculty mentor for the course titled \u201cSenior Project,\u201d and upon graduation a notation will appear on the transcript listing the title of the Senior Project. All Senior Projects will also receive written evaluations from faculty mentors, submitted to the Gallatin Office of Student Services.     Honors : To be considered for Honors, Senior Projects should be nominated in writing by faculty mentors to the Gallatin Senior Project Committee no later than one week before the last day of classes. Letters of nomination should provide a description of why the Senior Project merits Honors. Upon review of the Senior Project, the Gallatin Senior Project Committee will award Honors to projects deemed exceptional according to the selection criteria. The Honors designation will appear on students\u2019 transcripts.     Note : To be considered for Honors, Senior Projects comprised of limited run engagements that cannot be fully submitted as text \u2013 such as exhibits, stage productions, recitals, etc \u2013 require the student and faculty mentor to coordinate with the Gallatin Senior Project Committee to have the Project assessed by Committee members at a mutually convenient time and place. We regret that we cannot consider anecdotal reports of such Projects in awarding Honors.        Deadlines     Proposals : Senior Project proposals and final papers/projects must be submitted according to the following firm schedule of submission deadlines:          Semester of Senior Project:      Senior Project proposal due:      To be considered for honors, project is due:       For non-honors grading, project is due:        Fall      May 1*      Two weeks prior to the last day of Fall classes      The last day of Fall classes      Spring      December 1*      Two weeks prior to the last day of Spring classes     The last day of Spring classes         *If this date is a Saturday or Sunday, proposals will be due the following Monday.                    top of page                           Quick Links                 Student Checklist Senior Project Proposal form Individualized Projects Deadlines                                                                                      NYU Gallatin Footer              Gallatin School of Individualized Study     1 Washington Place     New York, NY 10003     (212) 998-7370                   A&#8211;Z Index      Directions      Contact Us      Job Opportunities               News      Support Gallatin      Feedback                         Follow us on Facebook      Follow us on Twitter      Follow us on Youtube         Follow us Instagram                 Unless otherwise noted, all content copyright NYU Gallatin.

Carlyle Court Towers 2 and 3 will remain open through the Fall 2015 and Spring 2016 terms.     As indicated in an email sent to the NYU residence hall community by Marc Wais, Vice President of Student Affairs and Tom Ellett, Senior Associate Vice President of Student Affairs on February 6, 2015, the University has decided to move forward with significant facility upgrades to Tower 1 at Carlyle Court, upper-class residence hall accommodations. (Towers 2 and 3 will be scheduled for similar renovations the following years.). Consequently, the plan is to close Carlyle Court for renovation beginning December 23, 2015, and to reopen it on August 15, 2016.   Accommodations in Carlyle Court Tower 1 will be part of the 2015-2016 room selection process for upper-class students, and in particular, those planning to either study-away during the Spring 2016 semester or who have December 2015 graduation plans. Fall 2015 residents of Carlyle Court Tower 1 who plan to continue their studies at NYU-New York for the Spring 2016 semester will be reassigned to other space on campus prior to the December 23rd closure of the tower.   Please also note, we are looking forward to re-opening Hayden Hall for first-year students for Fall 2015, which means that some space in University Hall and Palladium Hall may become available for use by upperclassmen.     With the assistance of the NYU Office of Global Programs, we are pleased to announce a number of offerings in place for the Fall 2015 semester only, that seek to address the unique issues posed by a one semester placement in the Carlyle Court Tower 1.   Please review the following information carefully as it may influence your decisions relating to roommates and space selection options:     Spring 2016 Study Away Early Decision Admission - For this year, returning undergraduates may apply for a Spring 2016 Study Away early decision admission process. Students who select into Carlyle Court Tower 1 for the Fall 2015 semester will be eligible for priority notification of their study away admission. Students who meet the Study Away application requirements will receive special consideration for admission into one of their two site preferences. The Spring 2016 Study Away early decision admission application will open on March 2, 2015 and will be available via the &quot;Application Center&quot; on Albert. The deadline for the early admission consideration is May 1, 2015. Students who select into Carlyle Court Tower 1 and meet the deadline will receive priority notification by May 15, 2015.     Room Selection Priority for Academic Year 2016-2017 \u2013 Students who choose to live in Carlyle Court Tower 1 for the Fall 2015 semester will be given top priority for the Academic Year 2016-2017 room selection process.   Programmatic Enhancements - In addition to typical hall programming, there will be themed study away offerings in Carlyle Court Tower 1 designed to prepare students for the study away experience.   Fall Check-out -  Carlyle Court residents in towers 1 will be required to vacate their assignment no later than December 23, 2015. The University will provide appropriate accommodations for those students continuing their Fall 2015 housing assignment through Spring 2016.

Senior Projects may include, but are not limited to, a paper based on original research, a written assessment of a community-learning initiative, or an artistic project (such as design-based work, art exhibit, or theatrical production) accompanied by an analytic essay (comprising artistic background, aims, and technique). Completed Senior Projects are graded by faculty mentors and can be nominated for Honors. Please note that Senior Projects are separate and distinct from Independent Studies in their selection, expectations, and potential to earn Honors. All questions about the Senior Project should be directed to the Senior Class Adviser.           Students interested in undertaking a Senior Project should read all sections of the policy and procedures below before submitting a proposal:       Planning   Timing   Units   Requirements   Mentors   Proposal   Approval and Registration     Evaluation and Honors     Deadlines                 Planning     Senior Projects are student-generated. Generally they are an opportunity to continue a sustained line of inquiry that the student has already begun. A Senior Project may grow out of a piece of work (a research paper, a creative writing piece, a CLI project, a stage production, an art exhibit, etc.) a student has done in a course, tutorial, or independent study. It may also derive from questions or ideas spurred by a student\u2019s colloquium. Successful Senior Projects will involve significant preparation. As such students interested in pursuing a Senior Project are strongly encouraged to consult with their advisers early in their undergraduate program in order to plan for appropriate coursework and research well in advance. Indeed, students are strongly encouraged to consider undertaking an Independent Study in the semester prior to applying for a Senior Project, as a way to engage relevant secondary literature, formulate plausible research designs/creative processes, and generally lay the foundations for their potential Senior Projects.        Timing     Senior Projects may only be undertaken in the Fall or Spring semesters. Generally, students will complete Senior Projects in their final semester at Gallatin, following completion of their colloquia in their penultimate semester. In rare cases, students may complete their Senior Projects in their penultimate semester at Gallatin, and their colloquia in their final semester. However, only in exceptional circumstances may students undertake Senior Projects in the same semester when they intend to complete their colloquia. Students planning to graduate in September should plan to complete Senior Projects in the preceding Spring semester.          Units     The Senior Project is a four-unit course of study, requiring a minimum of seven contact hours between student and mentor during the course of the convening semester. The arrangement of contact hours will vary depending on the needs of the specific project and the student\u2019s level of progress. Please remember that according to Gallatin policy, students may register for no more than eight units per semester in any combination of independent study, tutorial, and/or Senior Project.         Requirements     While expectations for Senior Projects will differ depending on the nature of the work undertaken, certain minimum standards apply generally. In particular, all Senior Projects require a written component:       In general, research papers should be of substantial depth and length, and span approximately 40 pages. These papers should follow appropriate academic standards of documentation, argumentation, and analysis, as determined and developed in consultation with faculty mentors.   In general, artistic or design projects should be accompanied by essays of substantial depth and length \u2013 approximately 20 pages \u2013 that address the project\u2019s background (locating students\u2019 projects within a larger artistic or design context), artistic or design aims (articulating students\u2019 goals in mounting a particular project, and explaining how the actual project met those goals), and technical issues (such as character development, stage design, storyline creation, directorial choices, etc), as determined and developed in consultation with faculty mentors.           Note: In some cases Senior Projects may require and in fact be designed as part of an ensemble or group (for instance a play where the Senior Project is stage direction, or an ensemble production where the Senior Project is a student\u2019s individual performance, etc). However, all Senior Projects should be individually proposed and will be individually assessed by faculty mentors on their own merits.        Mentors     Students arrange to execute their Senior Projects under the guidance of an NYU faculty member. In most cases, students are already acquainted with the faculty mentor who will be supervising the study. The faculty mentor should help the student clarify the Senior Project proposal to ensure that it includes all necessary components. In the semester that the Senior Project is undertaken, faculty mentors meet regularly with the student to discuss readings and progress, as well as provide feedback on the development of the final product. At the end of the term, faculty mentors submit anecdotal grade reports that briefly describe and provide a final evaluation of the student\u2019s work to accompany the assignment of a letter grade. Please note that faculty mentors wishing to nominate the student work for honors designation should do so no later than one week before the last day of classes. Faculty members (both full-time and part-time) are limited to supervising no more than five independent studies and/or Senior Projects per Fall and Spring term.          Proposal     Only complete proposals will be considered. A completed Senior Project proposal will include the following elements:   1. Project Description: The description should be approximately three double spaced pages, and should clearly state the proposed research question or artistic aim(s) of the project. The proposal must explain how the student has prepared to carry out this project and how the student intends to complete the project within one semester. The project\u2019s relation to the student\u2019s ongoing work or area of concentration should be clear. The proposal should also clearly specify the expected output (i.e., a research paper, design project, or artistic project) and discuss the specific methods with which the project will be completed. These criteria will be determined between the student and the faculty mentor, and they will be used in evaluating the final project at the end of the semester.   2. Annotated Bibliography or Relevant Works: The bibliography should situate a student\u2019s project within a body of work in their field. This should include 8-12 books, articles, key documents, films, plays, catalogs, etc. Please provide the full citation and a short description of the relevance of each text or work to the proposed project.   3. Form : Completed Senior Project Proposal Form                Approval and Registration       Enrollment in a Senior Project requires the approval of the Gallatin School. Students should submit completed Senior Project proposals to Gallatin\u2019s Office of Student Services where it will be reviewed by Gallatin\u2019s Senior Project Committee according to the deadline below. Proposals will be reviewed with an eye toward selecting projects of exceptional promise. The committee will evaluate proposals based on the following criteria:     clarity of project goal(s), mode of inquiry, and final product   project\u2019s relation to concentration and course of study   feasibility of the project within one semester through an articulated timeline   clear articulation of student/mentor relationship, including schedule of meetings   the degree to which the project would culminate in an original artistic or scholarly work       Upon approval, students will receive a permission number required for registration from the Office of Student Services. Students may then register for the Senior Project on Albert, or in person if Albert is not available. Please note that students are responsible for the registration process .     Decisions regarding Senior Project proposals cannot be appealed. Proposals not selected as a Senior Project can be submitted as a non-honors track Independent Study. The Committee strongly suggests this option for students who are passionate about completing their proposed projects.          Evaluation and Honors     Evaluation : Each Senior Project will be evaluated by the faculty mentor for its ability to meet project aims as delineated in the project proposal as well as the degree to which the final product exemplifies original interdisciplinary work. Successful completion of the Senior Project will be noted in two ways: the student will receive a letter grade awarded by the faculty mentor for the course titled \u201cSenior Project,\u201d and upon graduation a notation will appear on the transcript listing the title of the Senior Project. All Senior Projects will also receive written evaluations from faculty mentors, submitted to the Gallatin Office of Student Services.     Honors : To be considered for Honors, Senior Projects should be nominated in writing by faculty mentors to the Gallatin Senior Project Committee no later than one week before the last day of classes. Letters of nomination should provide a description of why the Senior Project merits Honors. Upon review of the Senior Project, the Gallatin Senior Project Committee will award Honors to projects deemed exceptional according to the selection criteria. The Honors designation will appear on students\u2019 transcripts.     Note : To be considered for Honors, Senior Projects comprised of limited run engagements that cannot be fully submitted as text \u2013 such as exhibits, stage productions, recitals, etc \u2013 require the student and faculty mentor to coordinate with the Gallatin Senior Project Committee to have the Project assessed by Committee members at a mutually convenient time and place. We regret that we cannot consider anecdotal reports of such Projects in awarding Honors.        Deadlines     Proposals : Senior Project proposals and final papers/projects must be submitted according to the following firm schedule of submission deadlines:          Semester of Senior Project:      Senior Project proposal due:      To be considered for honors, project is due:       For non-honors grading, project is due:        Fall      May 1*      Two weeks prior to the last day of Fall classes      The last day of Fall classes      Spring      December 1*      Two weeks prior to the last day of Spring classes     The last day of Spring classes         *If this date is a Saturday or Sunday, proposals will be due the following Monday.                    top of page                           Quick Links                 Student Checklist Senior Project Proposal form Individualized Projects Deadlines                                                                                      NYU Gallatin Footer              Gallatin School of Individualized Study     1 Washington Place     New York, NY 10003     (212) 998-7370                   A&#8211;Z Index      Directions      Contact Us      Job Opportunities               News      Support Gallatin      Feedback                         Follow us on Facebook      Follow us on Twitter      Follow us on Youtube         Follow us Instagram                 Unless otherwise noted, all content copyright NYU Gallatin.

As indicated in an email sent to the NYU residence hall community by Marc Wais, Vice President of Student Affairs and Tom Ellett, Senior Associate Vice President of Student Affairs on February 6, 2015, the University has decided to move forward with significant facility upgrades to Tower 1 at Carlyle Court, upper-class residence hall accommodations. (Towers 2 and 3 will be scheduled for similar renovations the following years.). Consequently, the plan is to close Carlyle Court for renovation beginning December 23, 2015, and to reopen it on August 15, 2016.   Accommodations in Carlyle Court Tower 1 will be part of the 2015-2016 room selection process for upper-class students, and in particular, those planning to either study-away during the Spring 2016 semester or who have December 2015 graduation plans. Fall 2015 residents of Carlyle Court Tower 1 who plan to continue their studies at NYU-New York for the Spring 2016 semester will be reassigned to other space on campus prior to the December 23rd closure of the tower.   Please also note, we are looking forward to re-opening Hayden Hall for first-year students for Fall 2015, which means that some space in University Hall and Palladium Hall may become available for use by upperclassmen.     With the assistance of the NYU Office of Global Programs, we are pleased to announce a number of offerings in place for the Fall 2015 semester only, that seek to address the unique issues posed by a one semester placement in the Carlyle Court Tower 1.   Please review the following information carefully as it may influence your decisions relating to roommates and space selection options:     Spring 2016 Study Away Early Decision Admission - For this year, returning undergraduates may apply for a Spring 2016 Study Away early decision admission process. Students who select into Carlyle Court Tower 1 for the Fall 2015 semester will be eligible for priority notification of their study away admission. Students who meet the Study Away application requirements will receive special consideration for admission into one of their two site preferences. The Spring 2016 Study Away early decision admission application will open on March 2, 2015 and will be available via the &quot;Application Center&quot; on Albert. The deadline for the early admission consideration is May 1, 2015. Students who select into Carlyle Court Tower 1 and meet the deadline will receive priority notification by May 15, 2015.     Room Selection Priority for Academic Year 2016-2017 \u2013 Students who choose to live in Carlyle Court Tower 1 for the Fall 2015 semester will be given top priority for the Academic Year 2016-2017 room selection process.   Programmatic Enhancements - In addition to typical hall programming, there will be themed study away offerings in Carlyle Court Tower 1 designed to prepare students for the study away experience.   Fall Check-out -  Carlyle Court residents in towers 1 will be required to vacate their assignment no later than December 23, 2015. The University will provide appropriate accommodations for those students continuing their Fall 2015 housing assignment through Spring 2016.                          Important Updates   Room selection for 2015-2016 is now closed.
