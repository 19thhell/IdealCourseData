Scientists in the department strive to learn basic principles about the function of genes and gain understanding of changes that occur during the normal lifecycle and in disease. Cellular approaches to cancer biology, developmental biology, stem cell biology, structural biology, immunology and neurobiology are particularly strongly represented in our department. Quantitative aspects of cell biology and in vivo imaging play an increasingly important role in our research. The department\u2019s research is intertwined with its teaching mission, which aims to transmit scientific knowledge and the methods leading to discovery to medical and graduate students.
