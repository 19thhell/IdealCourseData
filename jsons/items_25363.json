CWS offers students short-term individual counseling, group counseling, self-improvement classes, referrals, and psychiatric medication services. All services except psychiatric medication services are free of charge.   Short-term Counseling   Counseling - or psychotherapy - is a professional relationship that focuses on personal problems. The counseling relationship differs from both social friendships and patient-doctor contacts. Unlike friends, counselors are able to be objective; they are not involved in your daily lives. Unlike most doctors, counselors don't give specific advice or tell you what to do. Instead, they serve as skilled listeners who help you to clarify issues, discover your true wishes and feelings, and deal effectively with problems.   CWS counselors are psychologists, psychiatrists, social workers, nurse practitioners, and advanced trainees in those professions. There are male and female counselors, counselors from different racial and national backgrounds, and counselors who specialize in substance abuse, gay/lesbian/bisexual concerns, eating disorders, international students, and other concerns. We also have counselors who specialize in the issues of students from different schools: CAS, Gallatin, Law, Social Work, Steinhardt, Tisch, and students living in residence halls.   Length of counseling varies. Some problems lend themselves to a one or two session consultation. Others require a series of appointments, the length to be decided by you and your counselor. If you need longer than short-term counseling, your counselor will discuss with you affordable referral resources in the community.   Many problems lend themselves to Group Counseling or a Toolkit , rather than individual counseling.   What kind of problem is appropriate to discuss with a CWS counselor? Anything that troubles you. Here is a partial list of common student concerns:     Depression   Homesickness   Stress   Anxiety   Alcohol or drugs   Eating concerns   Academic anxieties   Roommate and friendship problems   Family problems   Suicidal thoughts   Sexual concerns   Identity concerns     Confidentiality                                Quick Links                      Counseling Services           Counseling Counseling by Appointment Group Counseling Psychiatry Relaxation Oasis Substance, Assessment, Feedback, and Evalution Toolkits Walk-in Counseling                                                                                                                                                           Counseling and Wellness   Contact Information     726 Broadway, 4th Floor, Suite 471   Telephone: 212-998-4780   Fax: 212-995-4096   wellness.exchange@nyu.edu   By Appointment :*   Mon-Thu: 9am-8pm   Fri: 9am-5pm   Sat-Sun: Closed (Call 212-443-9999)     --------------------------   Walk-in Counseling : *   (No appointment necessary)     726 Broadway, 4th Floor, Suite 402  (3rd Floor, Suit 353 on Saturdays)     Mon-Thu: 10am-8:30pm   (Short-term refills available 5-8pm)   Fri: 10am-6pm   (Short-term refills available 3-5pm)   Sat: 10am-3pm (3rd Fl, Ste 353)   Sun: Closed (Call 212-443-9999)   --------------------------   Polytechnic School of Engineering Counseling Services   5 Metrotech, Suite 232  Brooklyn, NY   Telephone: 718-260-3456                                  Staff Directory                  Learn about our Providers.

Psychiatry     Our innovative model for psychiatric medication management services provides students with access to psychiatric medication services throughout their NYU career at a maximum out-of-pocket expense of $30 per visit. Counseling and Wellness Services at SHC has always offered free short-term counseling (talk therapy) to NYU students; these services remain free of charge. Read more...          Group Counseling     Sometimes a problem is better addressed through group counseling than individual appointments. Talking to other students who have had similar experiences provides support and perspective. A counseling group can be powerfully healing - for some students, one of the most rewarding experiences during their NYU years. To sign up for a group, you must arrange to speak to the group leader (except where noted) by calling (212) 998-4780. Read more...          Toolkits     Toolkits are two-part workshops designed to help students develop and practice new skills to enhance personal, academic and social well-being. All students interested in participating in a toolkit workshop should call (212) 998-4780 for further information and registration. Read more...           Relaxation Oasis     The Relaxation Oasis is a tool to help integrate the instruction and practice of mindfulness into the services provided through the SHC promoting compassion, well-being, and academic success. We emphasize a non-sectarian approach to mindfulness, drawing on the contemplative practices of a variety of traditions. Read more...          Consults for Study Abroad     Many NYU students study abroad. Health and mental health services vary from country to country. Consults are recommended to clarify counseling and medication services that might be available abroad. Read more...

Counseling and Wellness Services at SHC has always offered free short-term counseling (talk therapy) to NYU students; these services remain free of charge.   Psychiatric medication services are available to all matriculated full-time and part-time students enrolled in a degree-granting program who require assessment and treatment with psychiatric medications. This applies to:     Students currently enrolled in short term psychotherapy (talk therapy) with NYU Counseling and Wellness Services     Students who currently are receiving psychiatric medication care in the community and wish to transfer their care to the new service at the Student Health Center   Students requiring a new initial psychiatric medication evaluation and ongoing care     In all cases, psychiatric professionals at the SHC will work with you to determine the best course of treatment for you and if your care can be managed appropriately at SHC.   Insurance and Billing   University policy requires that all matriculated students maintain health insurance coverage which includes medical and mental health benefits for treatment in New York City. The new, expanded SHC psychiatric service is designed to work in conjunction with the benefits that your health insurance provides.   As with all other medical specialty services at the SHC, we will bill your insurance carrier for psychiatric assessment and treatment provided by SHC psychiatrists and nurse practitioners. We know that costs for short and longer-term psychiatric care can become financially burdensome because mental health benefits within insurance plans can be associated with higher out-of-pocket costs. These costs can become deterrents to continued care. For this reason, the SHC will cap students' out-of-pocket costs at $30 per visit (inclusive of applicable co-pays, co-insurances, and deductibles).   For example, many students who receive psychiatric care in the community may be responsible for copays at each visit which can vary from $10 to $40, a 40-50% coinsurance requirement for an out of network provider, and possibly an annual deductible. These out-of-pocket costs for each visit can be daunting especially when considering how difficult it is to locate a psychiatric provider that participates with specific health insurance carriers in NYC. The Health Services Fee paid by all matriculated students will be used to cover student's out-of-pocket costs in excess of $30 per-visit, up to an annual maximum of $1000. The annual maximum pertains to any expected costs borne by students in deductibles, copayments, co-insurance and other patient responsibilities in excess of the $30 cap per visit. Please know that the SHC is committed to working with any students who may face difficulty in meeting these expenses.   Of note, this model and its cap on out-of-pocket costs only pertains to psychiatric services provided by Student Health Center medical personnel. Students will continue to be responsible for ALL out-of-pocket costs for psychiatric care received from providers outside the NYU Student Health Center at 726 Broadway.   Students who wish to schedule an appointment for a psychiatric evaluation should call Counseling and Wellness Services at (212) 998-4780.   Short-term Counseling and Crisis Care   Short-term counseling (talk therapy) sessions at Counseling and Wellness Services are provided without charge. In addition, the Counseling Walk-In Service at SHC (Wellness Exchange) provides a safety net for students in crisis situations; same day counseling assessments and psychiatric (medication and assessment) services received through the Wellness Exchange will continue at no cost to students. However, medication prescriptions written by psychiatric professionals during walk-in hours at the Wellness Exchange will be limited to a 5-day supply to address urgent situations only. For continuous psychiatric care and medication management, students will be referred to the psychiatric services model described above, or to another provider in the community as requested. The Wellness Exchange is located in the SHC, on the 4th floor of 726 Broadway, and can be reached at (212) 443-9999.   We believe this initiative responds directly to feedback received from students and families asking the SHC to ensure that accessible and affordable psychiatric care is available at the SHC for any matriculated NYU student in need of these services. Please contact the Wellness Exchange at 212-443-9999 between the hours of 9am and 5pm Mondays through Friday if you have questions about this model.

CWS offers students short-term individual counseling, group counseling, self-improvement classes, referrals, and psychiatric medication services. All services except psychiatric medication services are free of charge.   Short-term Counseling   Counseling - or psychotherapy - is a professional relationship that focuses on personal problems. The counseling relationship differs from both social friendships and patient-doctor contacts. Unlike friends, counselors are able to be objective; they are not involved in your daily lives. Unlike most doctors, counselors don't give specific advice or tell you what to do. Instead, they serve as skilled listeners who help you to clarify issues, discover your true wishes and feelings, and deal effectively with problems.   CWS counselors are psychologists, psychiatrists, social workers, nurse practitioners, and advanced trainees in those professions. There are male and female counselors, counselors from different racial and national backgrounds, and counselors who specialize in substance abuse, gay/lesbian/bisexual concerns, eating disorders, international students, and other concerns. We also have counselors who specialize in the issues of students from different schools: CAS, Gallatin, Law, Social Work, Steinhardt, Tisch, and students living in residence halls.   Length of counseling varies. Some problems lend themselves to a one or two session consultation. Others require a series of appointments, the length to be decided by you and your counselor. If you need longer than short-term counseling, your counselor will discuss with you affordable referral resources in the community.   Many problems lend themselves to Group Counseling or a Toolkit , rather than individual counseling.   What kind of problem is appropriate to discuss with a CWS counselor? Anything that troubles you. Here is a partial list of common student concerns:     Depression   Homesickness   Stress   Anxiety   Alcohol or drugs   Eating concerns   Academic anxieties   Roommate and friendship problems   Family problems   Suicidal thoughts   Sexual concerns   Identity concerns     Confidentiality                                Quick Links                      Counseling Services           Counseling Counseling by Appointment Group Counseling Psychiatry Relaxation Oasis Substance, Assessment, Feedback, and Evalution Toolkits Walk-in Counseling                                                                                                                                                           Counseling and Wellness   Contact Information     726 Broadway, 4th Floor, Suite 471   Telephone: 212-998-4780   Fax: 212-995-4096   wellness.exchange@nyu.edu   By Appointment :*   Mon-Thu: 9am-8pm   Fri: 9am-5pm   Sat-Sun: Closed (Call 212-443-9999)     --------------------------   Walk-in Counseling : *   (No appointment necessary)     726 Broadway, 4th Floor, Suite 402  (3rd Floor, Suit 353 on Saturdays)     Mon-Thu: 10am-8:30pm   (Short-term refills available 5-8pm)   Fri: 10am-6pm   (Short-term refills available 3-5pm)   Sat: 10am-3pm (3rd Fl, Ste 353)   Sun: Closed (Call 212-443-9999)   --------------------------   Polytechnic School of Engineering Counseling Services   5 Metrotech, Suite 232  Brooklyn, NY   Telephone: 718-260-3456                                  Staff Directory                  Learn about our Providers.

Group Counseling     Sometimes a problem is better addressed through group counseling than individual appointments. Talking to other students who have had similar experiences provides support and perspective. A counseling group can be powerfully healing - for some students, one of the most rewarding experiences during their NYU years. To sign up for a group, you must arrange to speak to the group leader (except where noted) by calling (212) 998-4780. Read more...

Counseling and Wellness Services at SHC has always offered free short-term counseling (talk therapy) to NYU students; these services remain free of charge.   Psychiatric medication services are available to all matriculated full-time and part-time students enrolled in a degree-granting program who require assessment and treatment with psychiatric medications. This applies to:     Students currently enrolled in short term psychotherapy (talk therapy) with NYU Counseling and Wellness Services     Students who currently are receiving psychiatric medication care in the community and wish to transfer their care to the new service at the Student Health Center   Students requiring a new initial psychiatric medication evaluation and ongoing care     In all cases, psychiatric professionals at the SHC will work with you to determine the best course of treatment for you and if your care can be managed appropriately at SHC.   Insurance and Billing   University policy requires that all matriculated students maintain health insurance coverage which includes medical and mental health benefits for treatment in New York City. The new, expanded SHC psychiatric service is designed to work in conjunction with the benefits that your health insurance provides.   As with all other medical specialty services at the SHC, we will bill your insurance carrier for psychiatric assessment and treatment provided by SHC psychiatrists and nurse practitioners. We know that costs for short and longer-term psychiatric care can become financially burdensome because mental health benefits within insurance plans can be associated with higher out-of-pocket costs. These costs can become deterrents to continued care. For this reason, the SHC will cap students' out-of-pocket costs at $30 per visit (inclusive of applicable co-pays, co-insurances, and deductibles).   For example, many students who receive psychiatric care in the community may be responsible for copays at each visit which can vary from $10 to $40, a 40-50% coinsurance requirement for an out of network provider, and possibly an annual deductible. These out-of-pocket costs for each visit can be daunting especially when considering how difficult it is to locate a psychiatric provider that participates with specific health insurance carriers in NYC. The Health Services Fee paid by all matriculated students will be used to cover student's out-of-pocket costs in excess of $30 per-visit, up to an annual maximum of $1000. The annual maximum pertains to any expected costs borne by students in deductibles, copayments, co-insurance and other patient responsibilities in excess of the $30 cap per visit. Please know that the SHC is committed to working with any students who may face difficulty in meeting these expenses.   Of note, this model and its cap on out-of-pocket costs only pertains to psychiatric services provided by Student Health Center medical personnel. Students will continue to be responsible for ALL out-of-pocket costs for psychiatric care received from providers outside the NYU Student Health Center at 726 Broadway.   Students who wish to schedule an appointment for a psychiatric evaluation should call Counseling and Wellness Services at (212) 998-4780.   Short-term Counseling and Crisis Care   Short-term counseling (talk therapy) sessions at Counseling and Wellness Services are provided without charge. In addition, the Counseling Walk-In Service at SHC (Wellness Exchange) provides a safety net for students in crisis situations; same day counseling assessments and psychiatric (medication and assessment) services received through the Wellness Exchange will continue at no cost to students. However, medication prescriptions written by psychiatric professionals during walk-in hours at the Wellness Exchange will be limited to a 5-day supply to address urgent situations only. For continuous psychiatric care and medication management, students will be referred to the psychiatric services model described above, or to another provider in the community as requested. The Wellness Exchange is located in the SHC, on the 4th floor of 726 Broadway, and can be reached at (212) 443-9999.   We believe this initiative responds directly to feedback received from students and families asking the SHC to ensure that accessible and affordable psychiatric care is available at the SHC for any matriculated NYU student in need of these services. Please contact the Wellness Exchange at 212-443-9999 between the hours of 9am and 5pm Mondays through Friday if you have questions about this model.
