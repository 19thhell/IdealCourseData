It has wide use and powerful reach yet remains contested and fluid. What opportunities does the invocation of human rights enable, and what does it constrain? How do we understand the intellectual genealogy of human rights? Is human rights the terrain of resistance\u2014or the new orthodoxy? The Gallatin Human Rights Initiative seeks to catalyze critical reflection and engagement with these and related questions.   The Gallatin Global Fellowship in Human Rights supports selected students with up to $5,000 in funding for extended research or experiential learning projects that focus on these issues.        Students will propose their own summer projects and/or internships in the human rights field. These should be affiliated with human rights organizations that operate from within a human rights framework and have the capacity to host students and incorporate them into the substantive aspects of their human rights work in meaningful ways. The aim of the fellowship is to allow students to contribute to the organization\u2019s work while gaining experience in the human rights field in ways that complement their academic trajectory at NYU.        A Year-Long Program          Fall Semester of Acceptance   Accepted fellows must register for two Spring courses: a 0-credit biweekly seminar focusing on human rights, led by Academic Director Vasuki Nesiah, and a 2-credit independent study with a faculty mentor\u2014either their adviser or another NYU faculty member\u2014in which they will explore some aspect of their intended summer project.    Gallatin students must complete a Gallatin independent study application by December 1. Other NYU students may register through their home schools by December 1 or may use the Gallatin independent study application if necessary.   Spring Semester   Fellows must have at least five meetings of the independent study with their selected faculty mentor. Fellows are also required to attend and participate actively in the 0-credit biweekly seminar.     Summer Term   Fellows must commit 9-12 weeks of full-time work on a summer project with an organization working in the human rights field. This means living on-site for between 9 to 12 weeks. Fellows must write and publish at least four blog posts about their experiences.   Fall Semester   Fellows must present their work to the NYU community at the group\u2019s annual Human Rights Symposium. This will involve a substantial 10- to 12-page paper and/or a panel presentation.   NOTE: All fellows must plan to be in residence in NYU Washington Square during the spring semester following the application deadline, and undergraduate fellows must plan to graduate no earlier than the following January.

Biography Updated April 2015 Sally Engle Merry is Silver Professor and Professor of Anthropology at New York University. She is also Associate Department Chair, Faculty Co-director of the Center for Human Rights and Global Justice at the New York University School of Law, and past president of the American Ethnological Society. She is the author or editor of fifteen books and special journal issues and over one hundred and twenty-five articles and reviews. Her recent books include Colonizing Hawai\u2018i (Princeton, 2000), Human Rights and Gender Violence (Chicago, 2006), Gender Violence: A Cultural Perspective (Blackwells, 2009) and The Practice of Human Rights, (co-edited with Mark Goodale; Cambridge, 2007). She received the Hurst Prize for Colonizing Hawai\u2018i in 2002, the Kalven Prize for scholarly contributions to sociolegal scholarship in 2007, and the J.I. Staley Prize for Human Rights and Gender Violence in 2010. In 2013 she received an honorary degree from McGill School of Law and was the focus of an Author Colloquium at the Center for Interdisciplinary Research (ZIF) at the University of Bielefeld, Germany. She is an adjunct professor at Australian National University. Her forthcoming book, The Seductions of Quantification: Measuring Human Rights, Violence against Women, and Sex Trafficking (Chicago: University of Chicago Press) examines indicators as a technology of knowledge used for human rights monitoring and global governance.  Current News/Projects Updated February 2013 My current research interests focus on the impact of technologies of measurement and counting on human rights law and global governance. This is a technology fundamental to new forms of governance as well as activism and advocacy. I am completing a book, tentatively titled The Seductions of Quantification: Human Rights and the Rise of Indicator Culture , that explores the way quantitative knowledge is produced and used in the context of global governance. I focus in particular on areas of soft law, where compliance depends on monitoring behavior with reference to a set of standards. Monitoring requires gathering information about a country\u2019s or an organization\u2019s performance which is then assessed against broad standards or laws such as human rights conventions. My focus is human rights law, particularly areas that focus on gender such as violence against women and sex trafficking. This NSF-funded project focuses on the construction and data collection of three global indicators: human rights indicators for the committees monitoring human rights treaties, violence against women surveys, and the US State Department Trafficking in Persons report that ranks countries in terms of their compliance with anti-trafficking activities. I have taken an ethnographic and genealogical approach to studying each of these initiatives by attending international meetings, interviewing those who create and use them, and tracking their historical evolution through documents of conferences and programs. The core concern of the project is the relationship between the technology of knowledge production and power. As a form of power, technologies of quantification typically fly under the radar. I am investigating the techniques by which information is gathered and analyzed as well as who determines relevant categories, who collects the data, and who disseminates it. Is this a technology of experts in rich countries which serves to govern the rest? Do the subjects of surveillance have a voice? Is the same technology used by radical activists seeking to destabilize the system as by governing elites? Since organizations and groups seeking to develop this kind of knowledge differ significantly in resources and expertise, their ability to generate and use such knowledge is quite different. Measurement and ranking systems typically incorporate theories about social change that are embedded in their design but not explicitly described. The US State Department trafficking indicators, for example, assume that prosecuting traffickers is the key strategy for eliminating trafficking, although it is only one of several standards that they articulate. Since this form of knowledge has a direct impact on the way publics understand the world as well as how policy-makers and others with governmental power make decisions, it represents a subtle form of power. Consequently, it is critical to examine the social, political, and economic context of knowledge production. \u2028My project on human rights indicators grows out of my earlier research on women\u2019s human rights and the process of vernacularization. I am taking a governmentality perspective on the rise of indicators in the area of global governance, asking what kinds of knowledge they produce, how they affect decisions, and how the use of this kind of knowledge changes the power dynamics of decision-making. I hypothesize that the use of indicators as a form of knowledge places power in the hands of technical experts, who often come from the global North. This is a new development in the human rights field, but it follows a vast expansion of this form of knowledge in economic development and health.  \u2028\u2028The project includes two in-depth ethnographic studies done by Anthropology graduate students. In Tanzania, Summer Wood examined the processes of data collection and pilot testing of an indicator for child rights designed to assist the committee monitoring the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. In India, Vibhuti Ramachandran tracked the processes by which data on anti-trafficking efforts and accomplishments in India is gathered for the US State Department. We are in the process of writing articles based on both studies. A third student, Jessica Shimmin, who received her Ph.D. in the Media, Culture, and Communication program, spent a year as a research assistant helping me track down background information on these and other indicators and co-authored a paper with me on human rights and gender violence in the US. In addition to my own research on indicators and global governance, I have teamed up with Kevin Davis and Benedict Kingsbury at the New York University School of Law to create an NSF-funded research network that brings together scholars from around the world in conferences to discuss and analyze a variety of indicators in practice. We are planning to publish an initial set of articles from this collaboration and to continue to expand the network in the next two years with further conferences. My current activities include serving as president of the American Ethnological Society, editing a book series, the Cambridge Series on Law and Society, from Cambridge University Press, and serving on numerous journal editorial boards. I am an adjunct professor at Australian National University and will receive an honorary degree from McGill School of Law in 2013. In 2010, I was awarded the J.I. Staley Prize of the School of Advanced Research for my book, Human Rights and Gender Violence (Univ. of Chicago Press, 2006). I am a faculty co-director of the Center for Human Rights and Global Justice of the NYU School of Law and will teach a course on human rights in the Law School in Fall 2013. I work with many wonderful graduate students in Anthropology and Law and Society and enjoy watching their projects develop and come to fruition. The Anthropology Department at NYU continues to offer me an exciting and supportive environment for scholarly work in the field.

It has wide use and powerful reach yet remains contested and fluid. What opportunities does the invocation of human rights enable, and what does it constrain? How do we understand the intellectual genealogy of human rights? Is human rights the terrain of resistance\u2014or the new orthodoxy? The Gallatin Human Rights Initiative seeks to catalyze critical reflection and engagement with these and related questions.   The Gallatin Global Fellowship in Human Rights supports selected students with up to $5,000 in funding for extended research or experiential learning projects that focus on these issues.        Students will propose their own summer projects and/or internships in the human rights field. These should be affiliated with human rights organizations that operate from within a human rights framework and have the capacity to host students and incorporate them into the substantive aspects of their human rights work in meaningful ways. The aim of the fellowship is to allow students to contribute to the organization\u2019s work while gaining experience in the human rights field in ways that complement their academic trajectory at NYU.        A Year-Long Program          Fall Semester of Acceptance   Accepted fellows must register for two Spring courses: a 0-credit biweekly seminar focusing on human rights, led by Academic Director Vasuki Nesiah, and a 2-credit independent study with a faculty mentor\u2014either their adviser or another NYU faculty member\u2014in which they will explore some aspect of their intended summer project.    Gallatin students must complete a Gallatin independent study application by December 1. Other NYU students may register through their home schools by December 1 or may use the Gallatin independent study application if necessary.   Spring Semester   Fellows must have at least five meetings of the independent study with their selected faculty mentor. Fellows are also required to attend and participate actively in the 0-credit biweekly seminar.     Summer Term   Fellows must commit 9-12 weeks of full-time work on a summer project with an organization working in the human rights field. This means living on-site for between 9 to 12 weeks. Fellows must write and publish at least four blog posts about their experiences.   Fall Semester   Fellows must present their work to the NYU community at the group\u2019s annual Human Rights Symposium. This will involve a substantial 10- to 12-page paper and/or a panel presentation.   NOTE: All fellows must plan to be in residence in NYU Washington Square during the spring semester following the application deadline, and undergraduate fellows must plan to graduate no earlier than the following January.        Meet the Fellows        Gallatin has sponsored 50 Global Fellows to date\u2014eleven in 2015, nine in 2014, nine in 2013, eleven in 2012, and ten in 2011.

Biography Updated April 2015 Sally Engle Merry is Silver Professor and Professor of Anthropology at New York University. She is also Associate Department Chair, Faculty Co-director of the Center for Human Rights and Global Justice at the New York University School of Law, and past president of the American Ethnological Society. She is the author or editor of fifteen books and special journal issues and over one hundred and twenty-five articles and reviews. Her recent books include Colonizing Hawai\u2018i (Princeton, 2000), Human Rights and Gender Violence (Chicago, 2006), Gender Violence: A Cultural Perspective (Blackwells, 2009) and The Practice of Human Rights, (co-edited with Mark Goodale; Cambridge, 2007). She received the Hurst Prize for Colonizing Hawai\u2018i in 2002, the Kalven Prize for scholarly contributions to sociolegal scholarship in 2007, and the J.I. Staley Prize for Human Rights and Gender Violence in 2010. In 2013 she received an honorary degree from McGill School of Law and was the focus of an Author Colloquium at the Center for Interdisciplinary Research (ZIF) at the University of Bielefeld, Germany. She is an adjunct professor at Australian National University. Her forthcoming book, The Seductions of Quantification: Measuring Human Rights, Violence against Women, and Sex Trafficking (Chicago: University of Chicago Press) examines indicators as a technology of knowledge used for human rights monitoring and global governance.  Current News/Projects Updated February 2013 My current research interests focus on the impact of technologies of measurement and counting on human rights law and global governance. This is a technology fundamental to new forms of governance as well as activism and advocacy. I am completing a book, tentatively titled The Seductions of Quantification: Human Rights and the Rise of Indicator Culture , that explores the way quantitative knowledge is produced and used in the context of global governance. I focus in particular on areas of soft law, where compliance depends on monitoring behavior with reference to a set of standards. Monitoring requires gathering information about a country\u2019s or an organization\u2019s performance which is then assessed against broad standards or laws such as human rights conventions. My focus is human rights law, particularly areas that focus on gender such as violence against women and sex trafficking. This NSF-funded project focuses on the construction and data collection of three global indicators: human rights indicators for the committees monitoring human rights treaties, violence against women surveys, and the US State Department Trafficking in Persons report that ranks countries in terms of their compliance with anti-trafficking activities. I have taken an ethnographic and genealogical approach to studying each of these initiatives by attending international meetings, interviewing those who create and use them, and tracking their historical evolution through documents of conferences and programs. The core concern of the project is the relationship between the technology of knowledge production and power. As a form of power, technologies of quantification typically fly under the radar. I am investigating the techniques by which information is gathered and analyzed as well as who determines relevant categories, who collects the data, and who disseminates it. Is this a technology of experts in rich countries which serves to govern the rest? Do the subjects of surveillance have a voice? Is the same technology used by radical activists seeking to destabilize the system as by governing elites? Since organizations and groups seeking to develop this kind of knowledge differ significantly in resources and expertise, their ability to generate and use such knowledge is quite different. Measurement and ranking systems typically incorporate theories about social change that are embedded in their design but not explicitly described. The US State Department trafficking indicators, for example, assume that prosecuting traffickers is the key strategy for eliminating trafficking, although it is only one of several standards that they articulate. Since this form of knowledge has a direct impact on the way publics understand the world as well as how policy-makers and others with governmental power make decisions, it represents a subtle form of power. Consequently, it is critical to examine the social, political, and economic context of knowledge production. \u2028My project on human rights indicators grows out of my earlier research on women\u2019s human rights and the process of vernacularization. I am taking a governmentality perspective on the rise of indicators in the area of global governance, asking what kinds of knowledge they produce, how they affect decisions, and how the use of this kind of knowledge changes the power dynamics of decision-making. I hypothesize that the use of indicators as a form of knowledge places power in the hands of technical experts, who often come from the global North. This is a new development in the human rights field, but it follows a vast expansion of this form of knowledge in economic development and health.  \u2028\u2028The project includes two in-depth ethnographic studies done by Anthropology graduate students. In Tanzania, Summer Wood examined the processes of data collection and pilot testing of an indicator for child rights designed to assist the committee monitoring the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. In India, Vibhuti Ramachandran tracked the processes by which data on anti-trafficking efforts and accomplishments in India is gathered for the US State Department. We are in the process of writing articles based on both studies. A third student, Jessica Shimmin, who received her Ph.D. in the Media, Culture, and Communication program, spent a year as a research assistant helping me track down background information on these and other indicators and co-authored a paper with me on human rights and gender violence in the US. In addition to my own research on indicators and global governance, I have teamed up with Kevin Davis and Benedict Kingsbury at the New York University School of Law to create an NSF-funded research network that brings together scholars from around the world in conferences to discuss and analyze a variety of indicators in practice. We are planning to publish an initial set of articles from this collaboration and to continue to expand the network in the next two years with further conferences. My current activities include serving as president of the American Ethnological Society, editing a book series, the Cambridge Series on Law and Society, from Cambridge University Press, and serving on numerous journal editorial boards. I am an adjunct professor at Australian National University and will receive an honorary degree from McGill School of Law in 2013. In 2010, I was awarded the J.I. Staley Prize of the School of Advanced Research for my book, Human Rights and Gender Violence (Univ. of Chicago Press, 2006). I am a faculty co-director of the Center for Human Rights and Global Justice of the NYU School of Law and will teach a course on human rights in the Law School in Fall 2013. I work with many wonderful graduate students in Anthropology and Law and Society and enjoy watching their projects develop and come to fruition. The Anthropology Department at NYU continues to offer me an exciting and supportive environment for scholarly work in the field.

Description       One of the most distinctive dimensions of contemporary globalization has been the flourishing of transnational activism. Causes, organizations and activist networks have crossed borders alongside capital, goods and labor to reshape the terrain of political engagement. This class examines the enabling conditions and (intended and unintended) consequences of this turn to transnational activism in relation to other dimensions of contemporary global governance. The course will focus on human rights initiatives, including international non-governmental organizations such as Amnesty International and transnational campaigns such as \u2018Save Darfur\u2019. Reading important critical interventions of the last decade, the class will collectively analyze how different approaches mobilize and challenge different actors, causes and alternative imaginings of 'the global'. The course is open to graduate students and advanced undergraduates. Readings are likely to draw from Sydney Tarrow, Clifford Bob, Daniel Bell, Kathryin Sikkink, Sally Merry, Stephen Hopgood, Mahmoud Mamdani, Kamari Clark, Wendy Hesford and Valerie Sperling.
