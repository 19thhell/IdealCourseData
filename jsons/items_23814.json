The minor provides an opportunity for undergraduates to explore the possibility of becoming a teacher in early childhood, elementary, middle, or high schools.    Open to all NYU students, except majors in teacher education.    Special Note : Effective Fall 2012, students may no longer declare the General Education Minor or any of the S econdary Education Minors . If you have already declared one of these minors, do not despair -- you can visit our archived website for information on those minors, including course requirements.    The Minor in Teacher Education is appropriate for students considering:       Careers in the classroom as a teacher through graduate study in a teacher certification program or through such programs as Teach for America or similar initiatives    Careers or further study in education, including:       Advocacy work on behalf of children, youth, parents, and families in and outside schools    Non-profit work    Domestic and international NGO work    Government positions in education both in the US and abroad    The Peace Corps and other international development or education work       Careers or further study in related fields, including:       Psychology or Counseling    Social work    Publishing    Educational technology    Health-related fields, especially those interested in working with children or adolescents with special needs          Why become a teacher?    Among the careers you can choose, teaching has one of the best futures. No other career offers you so much diversity and so many options. You can select the age group you would like to work with - from youngsters in preschool or elementary school to teenagers or adult learners - and the subject you would like to teach.    Within the teaching profession, you will always find opportunities to grow as your goals change. You may decide to specialize in teaching students with disabilities or gifted youngsters, or to make your impact outside the classroom as a school administrator or educational consultant, a parent advocate or program evaluator. You may decide to pursue a totally different career - in counseling, social work, medicine or law - or someday become a university professor in your field. Teaching skills are also highly marketable assets for positions in museums, hospitals, children's book publishing or television, corporate training programs, and human resources. In fact, an education background is an excellent foundation for any career.    Learn more about how to become a fully certified classroom teacher.    Course Requirements    The Minor in Teacher Education does not qualify you for initial teacher certification. If you are interested in becoming a fully certified teacher, consider any of Steinhardt&rsquo;s undergraduate or master&rsquo;s programs in teacher education .

The minor provides an opportunity for undergraduates to explore the possibility of becoming a teacher in early childhood, elementary, middle, or high schools.    Open to all NYU students, except majors in teacher education.    Special Note : Effective Fall 2012, students may no longer declare the General Education Minor or any of the S econdary Education Minors . If you have already declared one of these minors, do not despair -- you can visit our archived website for information on those minors, including course requirements.    The Minor in Teacher Education is appropriate for students considering:       Careers in the classroom as a teacher through graduate study in a teacher certification program or through such programs as Teach for America or similar initiatives    Careers or further study in education, including:       Advocacy work on behalf of children, youth, parents, and families in and outside schools    Non-profit work    Domestic and international NGO work    Government positions in education both in the US and abroad    The Peace Corps and other international development or education work       Careers or further study in related fields, including:       Psychology or Counseling    Social work    Publishing    Educational technology    Health-related fields, especially those interested in working with children or adolescents with special needs          Why become a teacher?    Among the careers you can choose, teaching has one of the best futures. No other career offers you so much diversity and so many options. You can select the age group you would like to work with - from youngsters in preschool or elementary school to teenagers or adult learners - and the subject you would like to teach.    Within the teaching profession, you will always find opportunities to grow as your goals change. You may decide to specialize in teaching students with disabilities or gifted youngsters, or to make your impact outside the classroom as a school administrator or educational consultant, a parent advocate or program evaluator. You may decide to pursue a totally different career - in counseling, social work, medicine or law - or someday become a university professor in your field. Teaching skills are also highly marketable assets for positions in museums, hospitals, children's book publishing or television, corporate training programs, and human resources.
