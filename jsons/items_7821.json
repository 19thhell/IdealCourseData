These vaccines are billed to the student\u2019s medical insurance. Under the Affordable Care Act, most medical insurances will cover these vaccinations as preventive care if the insured student meets the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) criteria for immunization.     ACIP recommendations for Adult Immunization   ACIP recommendations for Teen Immunization     New York State requires that all students have the necessary inoculations (link to Health Requirements page) to ensure your well-being and the vitality of the NYU community. The Immunology Department at the Student Health Center offers the required immunizations for a fee.     Measles, Mumps, and Rubella (MMR) Titers can be performed for students who have been immunized but are lacking vaccination documentation required by New York State and NYU upon admission. The blood tests are sent to Quest Diagnostics and are billed to the student\u2019s medical insurance. Students are responsible to verify their insurance plan coverage for laboratory testing and to verify that Quest Diagnostics is an in-network provider for their insurance plan.              Flu Shots for Students   Please Note: Flu shots at the Student Health Center are available for students only. Flu shots for NYU employees are available through the Human Resources LiveSmart Program.   Flu vaccine is recommended for everyone, but is especially important for those individuals at higher risk for complications resulting from the flu. You are at high risk if you:       Have a chronic high risk condition   Are pregnant   Are taking care of an infant less than 6 months of age   Are a health care worker and have patient care responsibilities   Are 50 years of age or older              Free Flu Vaccine Outreach Events  (for NYU Students only)        Flu shots at the NY Student Health Center are billed to your insurance plan.
