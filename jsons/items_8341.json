This includes:   Investigator's signature;   Faculty sponsor's signature (if required);   All applicable attachments (recruitment materials, consent or permission forms, institutional approval letters, research instruments, and any other additional materials).           1 copy of the full research proposal if:         Funding is being sought from an outside sponsor;   The project is for dissertation research (Please include written confirmation of Dissertation Committee approval. Students in departments with no formal dissertation proposal requirements should submit a 5 page summary of their proposed project.);   The project is for a master's theses, or faculty-directed non-funded research.             Incomplete submissions will be returned un-reviewed to the researcher for revision and resubmission.   Additional Materials   Recruitment Materials   Any material used to inform potential participants of the opportunity to participate as a subject (e.g. flyers, letters, etc.) should clearly identify the investigator, New York University, the school and department, the investigator's status (e.g., faculty, doctoral candidate, etc), the faculty sponsor (if applicable), and the institution.   Materials should give a brief idea of the purpose of the research, what participation entails (including any important subject inclusion/exclusion criteria), and a way for potential participants to contact the investigator if interested in participating.   Recruitment materials should also include sample letters to potential subjects and applications to organizations which are being asked to take part (or are taking part) in the project effort. This includes:     Assisting in the recruitment of subjects;   Providing space for meeting with potential/actual subjects;   Access to records of individuals or the organization.     Investigators who are planning work with any organization that has an Institutional Review Board must apply to that IRB for review and approval. They then must provide written approval from that IRB to the UCAIHS before the UCAIHS may provide final approval. Investigators should take into account when planning their research that IRBs vary widely in the time required for review and approval.   Statement to Subjects   This statement is provided by the investigator to potential participants prior to obtaining informed consent and carrying out the proposed work. It explains in more detail (than the recruitment materials) the purpose(s) of the research and what the subject will be asked to do if s/he agrees to participate.   The statement is generally provided as a response by the investigator to interest generated through a recruitment effort. It may be written or verbal and may be delivered in person, by phone, by mail, or by email. In some cases, the recruitment material and statement to the subjects may be combined in one document.   Informed Consent and Permission Forms and Assent Scripts   Informed consent is designed to provide potential subjects, or those who must give permission for potential subjects, all the information they need to decide whether or not to participate in a research project.   Consent, permission, and assent materials must be written in language appropriate to the intended subjects, but in no case in higher than 10th grade language. If an investigator plans to recruit subjects from non-English speakers, or those who do not speak it well, certified translations should be provided once the English versions of the consent, permission, and assent materials have been approved by the UCAIHS.   The UCAIHS provides a Language for Consent &amp; Other Forms and Child Assent (under age 12) ; investigators are expected to use that language unless there is a strong reason to make changes. These changes, if requested, must be justified in the application.   The materials should be on University departmental letterhead in a format which will allow them to be copied and distributed to subjects as is .

This includes:   Investigator's signature;   Faculty sponsor's signature (if required);   All applicable attachments (recruitment materials, consent or permission forms, institutional approval letters, research instruments, and any other additional materials).           1 copy of the full research proposal if:         Funding is being sought from an outside sponsor;   The project is for dissertation research (Please include written confirmation of Dissertation Committee approval. Students in departments with no formal dissertation proposal requirements should submit a 5 page summary of their proposed project.);   The project is for a master's theses, or faculty-directed non-funded research.             Incomplete submissions will be returned un-reviewed to the researcher for revision and resubmission.   Additional Materials   Recruitment Materials   Any material used to inform potential participants of the opportunity to participate as a subject (e.g. flyers, letters, etc.) should clearly identify the investigator, New York University, the school and department, the investigator's status (e.g., faculty, doctoral candidate, etc), the faculty sponsor (if applicable), and the institution.   Materials should give a brief idea of the purpose of the research, what participation entails (including any important subject inclusion/exclusion criteria), and a way for potential participants to contact the investigator if interested in participating.   Recruitment materials should also include sample letters to potential subjects and applications to organizations which are being asked to take part (or are taking part) in the project effort. This includes:     Assisting in the recruitment of subjects;   Providing space for meeting with potential/actual subjects;   Access to records of individuals or the organization.     Investigators who are planning work with any organization that has an Institutional Review Board must apply to that IRB for review and approval. They then must provide written approval from that IRB to the UCAIHS before the UCAIHS may provide final approval. Investigators should take into account when planning their research that IRBs vary widely in the time required for review and approval.   Statement to Subjects   This statement is provided by the investigator to potential participants prior to obtaining informed consent and carrying out the proposed work. It explains in more detail (than the recruitment materials) the purpose(s) of the research and what the subject will be asked to do if s/he agrees to participate.   The statement is generally provided as a response by the investigator to interest generated through a recruitment effort. It may be written or verbal and may be delivered in person, by phone, by mail, or by email. In some cases, the recruitment material and statement to the subjects may be combined in one document.   Informed Consent and Permission Forms and Assent Scripts   Informed consent is designed to provide potential subjects, or those who must give permission for potential subjects, all the information they need to decide whether or not to participate in a research project.   Consent, permission, and assent materials must be written in language appropriate to the intended subjects, but in no case in higher than 10th grade language. If an investigator plans to recruit subjects from non-English speakers, or those who do not speak it well, certified translations should be provided once the English versions of the consent, permission, and assent materials have been approved by the UCAIHS.   The UCAIHS provides a Language for Consent &amp; Other Forms and Child Assent (under age 12) ; investigators are expected to use that language unless there is a strong reason to make changes. These changes, if requested, must be justified in the application.   The materials should be on University departmental letterhead in a format which will allow them to be copied and distributed to subjects as is . Once approved by the UCAIHS, they will be stamped to signify Committee approval. Only stamped forms may be used to obtain a subject's consent.   The following information must be included in all consent forms and permission forms:     New York University cannot provide either medical treatment or financial compensation for any physical injury resulting from the subject\u2019s participation in the research; and   that inquiries concerning this policy may be made to the principal investigator or the UCAIHS email: ask.humansubjects@nyu.edu or call (212) 998-4808       a statement that the study involves research and an explanation of the purpose(s) of the research   names and contact information of the investigator(s), of the faculty sponsor, including institutional affiliation and status   Contact information for each investigator and faculty sponsor including school and department, phone number (including a local phone number if the work is to be done out of the United States), university and email addresses   a description of the procedures to be followed, what the subject will be expected to do, and whether there are any procedures which are experimental   how long participation will take, including how many sessions will be held if more than one will be needed   a description of any benefits to the subject or to others which may reasonably be expected from the research, or, more commonly, since the benefits of research to the subjects are usually tenuous at best, a statement that there will be no direct benefit to the subjects   a description of any reasonably foreseeable risks or discomforts to the subject, including any intervention which may be offered, OR the statement that there are no risks beyond those of everyday life   for research involving more than minimal risk, a clear description of the risks and where further information may be obtained (note that no research with minors involving more than minimal risk may be carried out unless it holds the prospect of direct benefit to the subject)   if the research involves more than minimal risk, a statement concerning the availability of medical treatment or compensation in the event of physical injury resulting from participation in the research.
