The atomistic and molecular structure and properties of matter are fundamental to the investigation of the physical world and to the understanding of living systems. Modern chemistry spans chemical physics, materials science, and molecular biology, merging the traditional divisions of analytical, organic, inorganic, and physical chemistry. Recently, the department has focused its growth on physical, biophysical, and bioorganic chemistry, exploiting interdisciplinary areas of theory, nanoscience and materials, and biological and biomedical chemistry. The department has a large and active theoretical group in the areas of chemical physics and biomolecular modeling. Graduates of the department find rewarding careers and achieve distinction in all phases of scientific life, from basic research to commercial product development. The late Gertrude Elion, a 1941 M.S. in Chemistry from New York University, shared the 1988 Nobel Prize in Medicine or Physiology for her research in pharmaceutical chemistry. Phil Baran, a BS recipient recently earned a MacArthur Foundation \"genius\" grant in 2013. The department offers majors in Chemistry and in Biochemistry. Students have the opportunity to earn either a B.A. or B.S. in chemistry. A selection of elective advanced courses, undergraduate and graduate, can be combined to provide a broad, varied program of study in chemistry. The department also offers a number of courses for non-science students and service courses for students in the other schools of NYU. The programs of study in chemistry prepare students for graduate work toward the master's degree or the doctorate for careers in research, development, and teaching and/or for further study in areas such as medicine, dentistry, basic medical sciences, and allied health fields (including forensic science). In addition, both majors prepare students for alternative careers, especially when paired with a minor in economics or business studies: for example, patent law, technology investment, or management in the chemical industry. The department offers advanced courses in general and organic chemistry required for several science majors and for the pre-health curriculum in medicine, dentistry, and basic medical sciences. Students need permission from the department to register for these advanced courses. Permission for the first-year advanced general chemistry course is based on several factors, including performance in high school advanced placement chemistry, physics and calculus as well as SAT or IB test scores.     Majors    Students thinking of majoring in Chemistry or Biochemistry are strongly urged to seek course advisement from the Director of Undergraduate Studies as early in their academic careers as possible. Chemistry is a sequential subject with courses building on earlier courses. Delay in taking certain key prerequisite courses can make it impossible to complete a major in four years without summer attendance.    A grade of C or better in Chemistry and the other mandated courses is required for the fulfillment of the Chemistry or Biochemistry major in the department. Students who do not have an average of 2.0 in departmentally required courses by the time they have completed 64 points in all courses will be asked to change their major.    The major in Chemistry or Biochemistry builds on a core of required courses in chemistry, physics, and mathematics. The six required core courses (28 points) in chemistry are:       General Chemistry I and Laboratory (CHEM-UA 125)    General Chemistry II and Laboratory (CHEM-UA 126)    Organic Chemistry I and Laboratory (CHEM-UA 225)    Organic Chemistry II and Laboratory (CHEM-UA 226)    Physical Chemistry: Quantum Mechanics and Spectroscopy (CHEM-UA 651)    Physical Chemistry: Thermodynamics and Kinetics (CHEM-UA 652)       The advanced and/or majors versions of the general and organic sequences\u2014CHEM-UA 127, CHEM-UA 128, CHEM-UA 227, and CHEM-UA 228 (see course descriptions)\u2014substitute for CHEM-UA 125, CHEM-UA 126, CHEM-UA 225, and CHEM-UA 226, respectively.    In addition to these chemistry courses, the Chemistry and Biochemistry majors require four courses (18 points) in mathematics and physics:       Calculus I (MATH-UA 121)    Calculus II (MATH-UA 122)    General Physics I (PHYS-UA 11)    General Physics II (PHYS-UA 12)       Calculus III (MATH-UA 123) and Linear Algebra (MATH-UA 140) are strongly recommended as preparation for both Physical Chemistry: Quantum Mechanics &amp; Spectroscopy (CHEM-UA 651) and Physical Chemistry: Thermodynamics &amp; Kinetics (CHEM-UA 652), as well as for students interested in pursuing chemistry on the graduate level or who have an interest in theoretical chemistry.    The following sequence covers the content of Calculus II and III (MATH-UA 122, 123) as well as Linear Algebra (MATH-UA 140) in two semesters, and carries a pre-requisite of Calculus I or equivalent:       MATH-UA 221 Honors Calculus I: Accelerated Calculus with Linear Algebra I    MATH-UA 222 Honors Calculus II: Accelerated Calculus with Linear Algebra II       The core, described above, provides a basic background in chemistry. Students normally are required to complete the courses in general chemistry, organic chemistry, physics, and calculus prior to entry into CHEM UA-651, 652 (physical chemistry) in the third year. Alternative programs are also possible. It is strongly advised, however, that an advanced-level chemistry course be taken in the third year of study, allowing at least three more semesters to complete all major requirements.    Undergraduate specialization in organic, biochemical, physical, or theoretical chemistry may be accomplished through combinations of advanced elective undergraduate and graduate courses open to undergraduates. These courses should be chosen in consultation with the director of undergraduate studies.    For students interested in preparation for careers in the chemical industry, several alternatives are available\u2014for example, pairing the major in Chemistry with a minor in Economics or Business Studies.    Students interested in careers in medicine, dentistry, or basic medical sciences may wish to consider the major in Biochemistry. Additional courses in biology may be desirable for such students. The appropriate preprofessional adviser should be consulted for details.    The Department of Chemistry offers the following majors:    Major in Chemistry, B.A.    For students entering NYU in and after fall 2013: The minimum major requirements, in addition to the core courses cited above, are completion of the Physical Chemistry Laboratory course (CHEM-UA 661), Inorganic Chemistry (CHEM-UA 711), and two advanced chemistry elective courses for the B.A. degree. For students who entered NYU prior to fall 2013: The minimum major requirements, in addition to the core courses cited above, are completion of the Physical Chemistry Laboratory course (CHEM-UA 661), Inorganic Chemistry (CHEM-UA 711), and one advanced chemistry elective course for the B.A. degree.    Major in Biochemistry    For students entering NYU in and after fall 2013: The minimum requirements, in addition to the core courses cited above, are Biochemistry I and II (CHEM-UA 881, 882), Experimental Biochemistry and Laboratory (CHEM-UA 885), Advanced Biochemistry (CHEM-UA 890), and one advanced chemistry elective. Students in this major are reminded that these courses must be taken in the proper order. Careful course planning is required to ensure that this can be done within a normal four-year program. For students who entered NYU prior to fall 2013: The minimum requirements, in addition to the core courses cited above, are Biochemistry I and II (CHEM-UA 881, 882), Experimental Biochemistry and Laboratory (CHEM-UA 885), and Advanced Biochemistry (CHEM-UA 890).    Biochemistry students are strongly encouraged to take Cellular and Molecular Biology I and II (BIOL-UA 21, 22) along with Biochemistry. This is especially important for those students wishing to enter graduate programs in biochemistry.    In addition to these majors, the department offers several programs and options that may be of interest to students:    Program in Chemistry and Engineering   The College of Arts and Science offers a joint B.S/B.S. program with the Polytechnic Institute of NYU . For students interested in chemistry, the program leads to the B.S. degree from New York University and the B.S. degree in chemical and biomolecular engineering from Polytechnic. Further information is available from Mr. Tyrell Davis in the College Advising Center, Silver Center, 100 Washington Square East, Room 905; 212-998-8130.    Bachelor of Science (B.S.) Degree   Students who complete the required core courses as outlined above, including the Physical Chemistry Laboratory course (CHEM-UA 661); Inorganic Chemistry (CHEM-UA 711); three advanced electives in chemistry; at least two semesters of Advanced Independent Study and Research (CHEM-UA 997, 998) or Senior Honors in Chemistry (CHEM-UA 995, 996); and one course in Computer Science (at or above the level of CSCI-UA 2; CSCI-UA 101 preferred) will graduate with the degree of Bachelor of Science (B.S.) instead of the Bachelor of Arts (B.A.). Students should note that the B.S. program is very difficult to complete within a normal four-year academic program and that it confers no particular advantage to students in premedical or predental programs. Minor    Completion of the following four 5-point courses constitutes a minor in chemistry: CHEM-UA 125 or 127, 126 or 128, 225 or 227, and 226 or 228. Only three of the four courses may also be used to satisfy another department's major. No grade lower than C will count toward the minor, and an average of 2.0 or better in all chemistry courses is required.      General Information    Laboratory courses in chemistry: Due to the potential hazard of any chemical experimentation, safety goggles, laboratory coats, and other protective gear must be worn at all times in the laboratories. Laboratory equipment, which is lent to the student for the duration of the course, must be replaced by the student if it is damaged or broken.    Students who do not return borrowed laboratory equipment at the end of a course are charged an additional fee, and their grade may be recorded as incomplete and not released until \"checkout\" is completed.    Research: The department endeavors to make research opportunities available during the summer and the academic year to well-qualified students at all levels. We strongly urge students who are interested in research to begin as early as freshman year. Students are encouraged to apply for the FAST and DURF grants awarded by the College. To participate in research in the department, students must both meet the prerequisites and register for the research courses Advanced Independent Study and Research (CHEM-UA 997, 998) or, if eligible, Senior Honors in Chemistry (CHEM-UA 995, 996). In either case, permission of the director of undergraduate studies is required before registering in these courses.      Honors Program While the department of chemistry has several accelerated courses, for example, Advanced General Chemistry and Laboratory (CHEM-UA 127 and 128), or Majors Organic Chemistry and Laboratory (CHEM-UA 227 and 228) these offerings need not be taken to earn a chemistry or biochemistry degree with departmental honors. The main requirement for earning an honors degree is the completion of an honors thesis based upon independent experimental or theoretical research. Students interested in research and an honors degree must enroll in Senior Honors in Chemistry (CHEM-UA 995, 996). However, students must become involved in research for at least one semester or one summer prior to the senior year. Two semesters of research only, is arguably not enough time to execute a successful research project. Depending on the number of credits the student is registered for, the initial exposure to research may or may not be for credit. Students desiring entry into the honors program must obtain the approval of the Director of Undergraduate Studies prior to the end of their junior year. Candidates for a degree with honors in Chemistry must have an overall GPA of 3.65 and a GPA of 3.65 in required courses for the Chemistry or Biochemistry degree. A senior thesis based on this work must be prepared, approved by the adviser, and presented in a seminar format during the spring term of the senior year. Please contact Carol Hollingsworth, academic program administrator, or Professor Alexej Jerschow, Director of Undergraduate Studies, for more detailed information.

The atomistic and molecular structure and properties of matter are fundamental to the investigation of the physical world and to the understanding of living systems. Modern chemistry spans chemical physics, materials science, and molecular biology, merging the traditional divisions of analytical, organic, inorganic, and physical chemistry. Recently, the department has focused its growth on physical, biophysical, and bioorganic chemistry, exploiting interdisciplinary areas of theory, nanoscience and materials, and biological and biomedical chemistry. The department has a large and active theoretical group in the areas of chemical physics and biomolecular modeling. Graduates of the department find rewarding careers and achieve distinction in all phases of scientific life, from basic research to commercial product development. The late Gertrude Elion, a 1941 M.S. in Chemistry from New York University, shared the 1988 Nobel Prize in Medicine or Physiology for her research in pharmaceutical chemistry. Phil Baran, a BS recipient recently earned a MacArthur Foundation \"genius\" grant in 2013. The department offers majors in Chemistry and in Biochemistry. Students have the opportunity to earn either a B.A. or B.S. in chemistry. A selection of elective advanced courses, undergraduate and graduate, can be combined to provide a broad, varied program of study in chemistry. The department also offers a number of courses for non-science students and service courses for students in the other schools of NYU. The programs of study in chemistry prepare students for graduate work toward the master's degree or the doctorate for careers in research, development, and teaching and/or for further study in areas such as medicine, dentistry, basic medical sciences, and allied health fields (including forensic science). In addition, both majors prepare students for alternative careers, especially when paired with a minor in economics or business studies: for example, patent law, technology investment, or management in the chemical industry. The department offers advanced courses in general and organic chemistry required for several science majors and for the pre-health curriculum in medicine, dentistry, and basic medical sciences. Students need permission from the department to register for these advanced courses. Permission for the first-year advanced general chemistry course is based on several factors, including performance in high school advanced placement chemistry, physics and calculus as well as SAT or IB test scores.     Majors    Students thinking of majoring in Chemistry or Biochemistry are strongly urged to seek course advisement from the Director of Undergraduate Studies as early in their academic careers as possible. Chemistry is a sequential subject with courses building on earlier courses. Delay in taking certain key prerequisite courses can make it impossible to complete a major in four years without summer attendance.    A grade of C or better in Chemistry and the other mandated courses is required for the fulfillment of the Chemistry or Biochemistry major in the department. Students who do not have an average of 2.0 in departmentally required courses by the time they have completed 64 points in all courses will be asked to change their major.    The major in Chemistry or Biochemistry builds on a core of required courses in chemistry, physics, and mathematics. The six required core courses (28 points) in chemistry are:       General Chemistry I and Laboratory (CHEM-UA 125)    General Chemistry II and Laboratory (CHEM-UA 126)    Organic Chemistry I and Laboratory (CHEM-UA 225)    Organic Chemistry II and Laboratory (CHEM-UA 226)    Physical Chemistry: Quantum Mechanics and Spectroscopy (CHEM-UA 651)    Physical Chemistry: Thermodynamics and Kinetics (CHEM-UA 652)       The advanced and/or majors versions of the general and organic sequences\u2014CHEM-UA 127, CHEM-UA 128, CHEM-UA 227, and CHEM-UA 228 (see course descriptions)\u2014substitute for CHEM-UA 125, CHEM-UA 126, CHEM-UA 225, and CHEM-UA 226, respectively.    In addition to these chemistry courses, the Chemistry and Biochemistry majors require four courses (18 points) in mathematics and physics:       Calculus I (MATH-UA 121)    Calculus II (MATH-UA 122)    General Physics I (PHYS-UA 11)    General Physics II (PHYS-UA 12)       Calculus III (MATH-UA 123) and Linear Algebra (MATH-UA 140) are strongly recommended as preparation for both Physical Chemistry: Quantum Mechanics &amp; Spectroscopy (CHEM-UA 651) and Physical Chemistry: Thermodynamics &amp; Kinetics (CHEM-UA 652), as well as for students interested in pursuing chemistry on the graduate level or who have an interest in theoretical chemistry.    The following sequence covers the content of Calculus II and III (MATH-UA 122, 123) as well as Linear Algebra (MATH-UA 140) in two semesters, and carries a pre-requisite of Calculus I or equivalent:       MATH-UA 221 Honors Calculus I: Accelerated Calculus with Linear Algebra I    MATH-UA 222 Honors Calculus II: Accelerated Calculus with Linear Algebra II       The core, described above, provides a basic background in chemistry. Students normally are required to complete the courses in general chemistry, organic chemistry, physics, and calculus prior to entry into CHEM UA-651, 652 (physical chemistry) in the third year. Alternative programs are also possible. It is strongly advised, however, that an advanced-level chemistry course be taken in the third year of study, allowing at least three more semesters to complete all major requirements.    Undergraduate specialization in organic, biochemical, physical, or theoretical chemistry may be accomplished through combinations of advanced elective undergraduate and graduate courses open to undergraduates. These courses should be chosen in consultation with the director of undergraduate studies.    For students interested in preparation for careers in the chemical industry, several alternatives are available\u2014for example, pairing the major in Chemistry with a minor in Economics or Business Studies.    Students interested in careers in medicine, dentistry, or basic medical sciences may wish to consider the major in Biochemistry. Additional courses in biology may be desirable for such students. The appropriate preprofessional adviser should be consulted for details.    The Department of Chemistry offers the following majors:    Major in Chemistry, B.A.    For students entering NYU in and after fall 2013: The minimum major requirements, in addition to the core courses cited above, are completion of the Physical Chemistry Laboratory course (CHEM-UA 661), Inorganic Chemistry (CHEM-UA 711), and two advanced chemistry elective courses for the B.A. degree. For students who entered NYU prior to fall 2013: The minimum major requirements, in addition to the core courses cited above, are completion of the Physical Chemistry Laboratory course (CHEM-UA 661), Inorganic Chemistry (CHEM-UA 711), and one advanced chemistry elective course for the B.A. degree.    Major in Biochemistry    For students entering NYU in and after fall 2013: The minimum requirements, in addition to the core courses cited above, are Biochemistry I and II (CHEM-UA 881, 882), Experimental Biochemistry and Laboratory (CHEM-UA 885), Advanced Biochemistry (CHEM-UA 890), and one advanced chemistry elective. Students in this major are reminded that these courses must be taken in the proper order. Careful course planning is required to ensure that this can be done within a normal four-year program. For students who entered NYU prior to fall 2013: The minimum requirements, in addition to the core courses cited above, are Biochemistry I and II (CHEM-UA 881, 882), Experimental Biochemistry and Laboratory (CHEM-UA 885), and Advanced Biochemistry (CHEM-UA 890).    Biochemistry students are strongly encouraged to take Cellular and Molecular Biology I and II (BIOL-UA 21, 22) along with Biochemistry. This is especially important for those students wishing to enter graduate programs in biochemistry.    In addition to these majors, the department offers several programs and options that may be of interest to students:    Program in Chemistry and Engineering   The College of Arts and Science offers a joint B.S/B.S. program with the Polytechnic Institute of NYU . For students interested in chemistry, the program leads to the B.S. degree from New York University and the B.S. degree in chemical and biomolecular engineering from Polytechnic. Further information is available from Mr. Tyrell Davis in the College Advising Center, Silver Center, 100 Washington Square East, Room 905; 212-998-8130.    Bachelor of Science (B.S.) Degree   Students who complete the required core courses as outlined above, including the Physical Chemistry Laboratory course (CHEM-UA 661); Inorganic Chemistry (CHEM-UA 711); three advanced electives in chemistry; at least two semesters of Advanced Independent Study and Research (CHEM-UA 997, 998) or Senior Honors in Chemistry (CHEM-UA 995, 996); and one course in Computer Science (at or above the level of CSCI-UA 2; CSCI-UA 101 preferred) will graduate with the degree of Bachelor of Science (B.S.) instead of the Bachelor of Arts (B.A.). Students should note that the B.S. program is very difficult to complete within a normal four-year academic program and that it confers no particular advantage to students in premedical or predental programs. Minor    Completion of the following four 5-point courses constitutes a minor in chemistry: CHEM-UA 125 or 127, 126 or 128, 225 or 227, and 226 or 228. Only three of the four courses may also be used to satisfy another department's major. No grade lower than C will count toward the minor, and an average of 2.0 or better in all chemistry courses is required.      General Information    Laboratory courses in chemistry: Due to the potential hazard of any chemical experimentation, safety goggles, laboratory coats, and other protective gear must be worn at all times in the laboratories. Laboratory equipment, which is lent to the student for the duration of the course, must be replaced by the student if it is damaged or broken.    Students who do not return borrowed laboratory equipment at the end of a course are charged an additional fee, and their grade may be recorded as incomplete and not released until \"checkout\" is completed.    Research: The department endeavors to make research opportunities available during the summer and the academic year to well-qualified students at all levels. We strongly urge students who are interested in research to begin as early as freshman year. Students are encouraged to apply for the FAST and DURF grants awarded by the College. To participate in research in the department, students must both meet the prerequisites and register for the research courses Advanced Independent Study and Research (CHEM-UA 997, 998) or, if eligible, Senior Honors in Chemistry (CHEM-UA 995, 996). In either case, permission of the director of undergraduate studies is required before registering in these courses.      Honors Program While the department of chemistry has several accelerated courses, for example, Advanced General Chemistry and Laboratory (CHEM-UA 127 and 128), or Majors Organic Chemistry and Laboratory (CHEM-UA 227 and 228) these offerings need not be taken to earn a chemistry or biochemistry degree with departmental honors. The main requirement for earning an honors degree is the completion of an honors thesis based upon independent experimental or theoretical research. Students interested in research and an honors degree must enroll in Senior Honors in Chemistry (CHEM-UA 995, 996). However, students must become involved in research for at least one semester or one summer prior to the senior year. Two semesters of research only, is arguably not enough time to execute a successful research project. Depending on the number of credits the student is registered for, the initial exposure to research may or may not be for credit. Students desiring entry into the honors program must obtain the approval of the Director of Undergraduate Studies prior to the end of their junior year. Candidates for a degree with honors in Chemistry must have an overall GPA of 3.65 and a GPA of 3.65 in required courses for the Chemistry or Biochemistry degree. A senior thesis based on this work must be prepared, approved by the adviser, and presented in a seminar format during the spring term of the senior year. Please contact Carol Hollingsworth, academic program administrator, or Professor Alexej Jerschow, Director of Undergraduate Studies, for more detailed information.

molecules, how they are created from atoms, how their chemical and physical properties are affected by their structures, and how they unite or assemble to form the kinds of matter that make up the physical world. Knowledge of chemistry is fundamental to an in-depth understanding of the structural properties and biochemical reactions that define all living systems. In fact, chemistry interfaces with the life sciences and with physics and mathematics. The range of applications of modern chemistry is broad, spanning many aspects of human activities such as the improvement of agriculture, the discovery of new drugs, and the creation of new materials by learning from nature how molecules are assembled and how they recognize one another. Chemistry drives the exciting field of nanotechnology that generates new materials for devising ever smaller electronic devices with enhanced computing or information storage characteristics; that invents novel materials for innovative applications in industry and everyday life; and that constructs novel photosensitive materials for solar energy conversion to electricity, to cite just a few examples    The Chemistry major builds on the Foundations of Science program and offers students the opportunity to pursue their interests in more specialized fields of chemistry such as biochemistry, organic and physical/biological chemistry, and materials sciences. The major offers elective courses that exploit the interdisciplinary areas of biochemistry, materials science, and biological and biophysical chemistry. The major in Chemistry prepares students for graduate work and rewarding careers in all phases of scientific life, from basic research to commercial product development.

In contrast to classical mechanics, which describes the interaction of energy and matter on large bodies, quantum mechanics focuses on the interactions of energy and matter at the atomic and subatomic level. Hence, this course provides detailed insight into modern approaches that explain the structure and spectra of atoms and molecules. After completion of this course, students are able to understand the origins and meanings of key chemical concepts, including wave functions, atomic and molecular orbitals, energy levels, hybridization, atomic and molecular spectra, and electron spin. They are also able to interpret various spectra&mdash; electronic, rotational, infrared, and nuclear magnetic resonance&mdash;and to correlate these to the structures of atoms and molecules.

The course introduces the principles and practices of &ldquo;classical&rdquo; physicochemical methods in chemical thermodynamics and kinetics, and continues with modern experimental and computational methods that are widely used in contemporary analytical, organic, physical, and biological chemistry laboratories. The experiments include thermochemical techniques such as calorimetry to determine the heat exchange during chemical reactions or physical processes, construction and interpretation of phase diagrams of binary and ternary mixtures, measurement and prediction of kinetic rates of chemical reactions, determination of rate constants, characterization of colloids, and measuring the electrochemical properties of matter. The experiments will be supported by computer simulations, and are highly focused on the processes of experimentation, data recording, correct analysis, and meaningful interpretation of the observations. After completion of this course, the students will be able to approach a chemical problem, set up a hypothesis, perform accurate measurement, interpret the results, verify the hypothesis, draw conclusions, and communicate effectively the results orally and in writing.    * 2 credits    *Pre or co-requisites are CHEM-AD 103                                                                       Fall 2013 ;             14 Weeks                                                                                                   Mazin Magzoub , Wael M.

Through the exposure to NYUAD faculty research students identify potential areas of interest for their own capstone research, and over the course of the semester develop and put into writing an in-depth chemistry capstone proposal. The final capstone proposal is due at the end of the seminar series so that students can begin the Capstone Project in the fall semester of their senior year.

Applications to other disciplines are emphasized. Since the derivative measures the instantaneous rate of change of a function and the definite integral measures the total accumulation of a function over an interval, these two ideas form the basis for nearly all mathematical formulas in science, engineering, economics, and other fields. This course also provides instruction in how to model situations in order to solve problems. Applications include graphing, and maximizing and minimizing functions. In addition to two weekly lectures, students attend a weekly recitation focused on applications. Placement into Calculus with Applications is decided by discussion with mentors and the results of a mathematics placement examination.    May not be taken if MATH-AD 110 Calculus is completed    This is a required course for Economics majors until the class of 2017.

Integration and differentiation of functions of several variables require new concepts and techniques. The course has applications to science and engineering as well as economics. Specific topics include vectors in the plane and space; partial derivatives with applications; double and triple integrals; spherical and cylindrical coordinates; surface and line integrals; and divergence, gradient, and curl. In addition, the theorems of Gauss and Stokes are rigorously introduced.

Following an introduction to the physical sciences, the course focuses on velocity, acceleration, forces, and energy, while simultaneously introducing students to atoms and molecules. Chemical reactions are examined, and the energy changes associated with them are investigated via a thorough analysis of the three laws of thermodynamics. Laboratory exercises focus on the guiding principles of the scientific method and an introduction to experimental design, and scientific presentation, including technical writing. Weekly discussion sections are designed to hone proficiency at solving problems in a collaborative, team environment.

Concurrently, atomic theory, the theory of molecular bonding, and atomic and molecular structures and shapes, in which forces and energy play a role, are investigated. Students apply these concepts to understanding molecules related to the life sciences. Laboratory exercises focus on acquisition of data and analysis with a continued emphasis on technical presentation. Weekly discussion sections are designed to hone proficiency at solving problems in a collaborative, team environment.

Capacitors, current, and basic circuits are explored with an eye toward understanding their applications to chemical reactions and the behavior of living cells. The rates and directions of chemical reactions are explored as chemical kinetics and chemical equilibrium are investigated with a special focus on acid-base chemistry. These fundamental physical and chemical principles are used to describe basic cellular monomers and polymers including DNA, RNA, and protein, and the sequence of events that leads to information flow and its regulation in the cell nucleus. They are also applied to macroscopic systems found in the biosphere. Laboratory exercises focus on fundamental protocols and tools needed to sharpen basic laboratory skills. Weekly discussion sections are designed to hone proficiency at solving problems in a collaborative, team environment.

This leads to another question: If a specific function is desired, can a form or shape be engineered or modified to execute or improve that function? The course examines the form/function concept in magnetic and electrical fields, the behavior and design of small molecules, and the activity of proteins as the workhorse in biological systems. Laboratory exercises require students to design experiments related to crystals and crystallography, and to examine chemical forms at the macroscopic and microscopic levels. Weekly discussion sections are designed to hone proficiency at solving problems in a collaborative, team environment.

In physics, disturbances generate waves that are associated with the transmission of light and sound. These same waves generate responses in living organisms as sensory systems detect them, including nerves in some species. Electromagnetic waves, interactions among light, matter, and living systems are examined. Change during the growth of cells is explored at the molecular level as well. Laboratory exercises fuse physics, chemistry, and biology as students engage in projects related to recombinant DNA technology, gene cloning, and protein synthesis and characterization.

This is embodied in physics and chemistry in quantum theory and the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. But living systems provide countless examples of oscillatory events that possess inherent uncertainty when scientists try to predict outcomes. Indeed, this final chapter in Foundations of Science challenges students to consider the very nature of studying complex problems and systems and assessing the uncertainty associated with the scientific method. The laboratory exercises involve collaborative projects in which teams of students must apply their acquired knowledge and skills to design experiments focused on answering a question or solving a problem, keeping uncertainty in mind as they report their results and discuss additional data that would be need to provide a better answer or solution.

The focus of the Biochemistry program is similar to that of the Chemistry program, but with an emphasis on the chemistry of living systems. In fact, biochemistry also studies the world of molecules, how they are created from atoms, how their chemical and physical properties are affected by their structures, and how they unite or assemble to form the kinds of matter that make up the living world. A basic knowledge of chemistry, which is provided in the Foundations of Science curriculum, is fundamental to an in-depth understanding of the structural properties and biochemical reactions that define all living systems.   Outstanding and highly motivated students are offered special opportunities for research, independent study, summer laboratory research, internships, and other enhancements at the NYU campuses in New York and Abu Dhabi, with strong interactive ties with laboratories at the two sites. Additional studies in mathematics, especially linear algebra and multivariable calculus, are highly recommended for students planning on graduate work in chemistry or biochemistry. The specialization in Biochemistry requires three courses. Instead of Chemical Experimental Methods, students take Experimental Biochemistry, and as the two Chemistry electives, students take Biochemistry 1 and 2.
