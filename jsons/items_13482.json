My research in Systems and Networks focuses on  how to make better systems for users. Better can be measured  by traditional metrics -- speed, reliability, cost -- or user  experience. And users can be systems administrators or people  who just want to get things done with computers. I am figuring  out how to do this thing called \"systems research\" under the  guidance  of Jinyang  Li , Helen  Nissenbaum ,  and Lakshminarayanan  Subramanian .         I am a core member of  the Networking and  Wide-area Systems (NeWS) group  and Systems Reading  Group ; I am also affiliated with the   NYU   Law Privacy Research Group    ( group   blog ). I assisted the organizational foundation of the   NYU and NYU: Abu Dhabi Center   for Technology and Economic Development (CTED) , in   association   with CATER:   Cost-effective Appropriate Technologies for Emerging   Regions .     I received an Undergraduate Degree   in Computer Science    from Harvard University    in 2009, where I worked   with Rohan   Murty , Ian   Rose , and Matt   Welsh on   the CitySense project.             What do I like to do?    I am currently making my way back to the realms of traditional systems and  networking research, with a focus on privacy.
