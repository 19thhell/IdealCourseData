The online application will only allow one application submission per login name within an application cycle (the 2015 application cycle is summer 2015, fall 2015, and spring 2016). For example, if you apply for admission to the fall 2015 term and wish to apply again for the spring 2016 term, you must create a new login name (usually an email address) to the Embark system. However, if you applied for the fall 2014 term, and now wish to apply for the fall 2015 term, you will be able to use your same login name since it is a new application cycle.      Please see our Application Resource Center for complete information about applying for admission to the Graduate School.
