Blom claims the true piano style had been worked out by two sons of Bach's, that is, Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach who defened the harpsichord, and his brother, Johann Christian, who championed the new instrument, before Beethoven was ready to tackle the piano sonata as a vehicle of his much more vital thought and his much suppler form.    The author presents that Beethoven was an impossible man to live with, but though that intractable personality peeps out everywhere from the sonatas, they have not only proved endurable: they have endured, Their greatness has softened the composer's asperities and rudenesses and made them for us, over and above their purely musical wonders, into an intensely individual expression of the most irresistible fascination. Beethoven was a magnificently independent creator. He did not merely assimilate influences. He converted great masters by the unfathomable secret of genius into assets of his own.    Readers of this book could take an interest in a consideration of a new kind of Beethoven criticism. Beethoven's music could be divided into three periods, each showing a distinctive style.

Marshall. In the first chapter, the author, Laurence Libin, mentions about the development of keyboard instrument, and the background of the century. We can understand why musicians preferred some types of keyboard instruments against this background. The scientific inquiry, technological innovation, and status symbols shaped the century and embody the spirit of the enlightenment. To the performance nowadays, we need to understand why the composer's intentions residing behind the notation of the works, so that we can play in style. Moreover, we can know how to play ornamentation written by different composers. The author mentions Quantz's flute treatise entitled &quot;Of Good Execution in general in singing and playing&quot; to list the qualities necessary of being a good musician. Every author in the book lists the repertoire of keyboard music from J.S. Bach to Early Beethoven. C.P.E. Bach employs periodic rondo-like themes, avoiding the asymmetrical, even fragmented phrasing found in some early pieces. But the apparent increase in the use of periodic symmetry represents not a development toward Viennese classical style, but a borrowing from certain French dances and other late-Baroque genres characterized by simple symmetrical themes. J. C. Bach and the Early classical Italian masters provided the principal stylistic alternative to the north German empfindsamer stil during the mid-century of eighteenth century. J. C. Bach also has direct stylistic influence on Mozart. In a remark to Haydn's biographer Griesinger, Haydn evoked the image of a composer who worked at the keyboard, whose fingers gave voice to his inspiration: Haydn always composed his works at the clavier.&quot; I sat down, began to improvise, according to my mood, sad or happy, serious or playful. Once I had seized upon an idea, my entire effort went toward putting it into effect and sustaining it according to the rules of art.&quot;(Gotwals, 61). To Dies he made the keyboard even more intimate: If it's an Allegro that persecutes me then my pulse beats harder and harder, I can't sleep. If it's an Adagio then I notice that my pulse beats slowly. My imagination (Phantasie) plays on me as if I were a keyboard. I am really just a living keyboard. (Gotwals, 141). Mozart's piano music is structural variety, rhetorical whimsy. The character pieces that formed the basis of salon music may be its social heirs. His procedure for transcribing solo pieces in binary form into concerto movement was straightforward. Beethoven used a much larger scale in sonatas than either Haydn or Mozart . He thought that the subtle inflections of texture would not be sufficient, and that a much wider range of expression was needed. This book is good for us to know the form of each piece and the style of each composer.   .....Hsiao-Ting Yang"}]},
