The program is ideal for the student interested in science and engineering who is also eager for a liberal arts experience before entering an undergraduate engineering environment. Upon completion of this five-year program, students receive the Bachelor of Science degree from the College of Arts and Science at New York University and the Bachelor of Science degree from the Polytechnic Institute of NYU. Students with this combination of degrees are likely to find excellent employment opportunities. The available dual-degree combination are as follows: \u2022 B.S. in biology/B.S. in chemical and biomolecular engineering \u2022 B.S. in chemistry/B.S. in chemical and biomolecular engineering \u2022 B.S. in computer science/B.S. in computer engineering \u2022 B.S. in computer science/B.S. in electrical engineering \u2022 B.S. in mathematics/B.S. in civil engineering \u2022 B.S. in mathematics/B.S. in computer engineering \u2022 B.S. in mathematics/B.S. in electrical engineering \u2022 B.S. in mathematics/B.S. in mechanical engineering \u2022 B.S. in physics/B.S. in civil engineering \u2022 B.S. in physics/B.S. in computer engineering \u2022 B.S. in physics/B.S. in electrical engineering \u2022 B.S. in physics/B.S. in mechanical engineering Students in the program complete all of the Morse Academic Plan (MAP) requirements, with the exception of the foreign language requirement, from which they are excused. (Their required math and science courses automatically satisfy the MAP\u2019s Foundations of Scientific Inquiry requirements.) There is usually some flexibility concerning the semester in which a given course can be taken, and students with Advanced Placement credit can typically lighten some of their semester course loads and/or have room for more electives. Detailed programs of study for each of the curricula are available from Tyrell Davis, the adviser for all students in the various programs. He may be contacted at the College Advising Center, Silver Center, 100 Washington Square East, Room 905; 212-998-8130. Application materials for this dual-degree program may be requested from New York University, Office of Undergraduate Admissions, 665 Broadway, 11th Floor, New York, NY 10012-2339. REQUIREMENTS The dual-degree program is designed to meet the educational and career interests of students with strong qualifications, as evidenced by their GPA in high school and by their performance in mathematics and science. Students who rank near the top of their class and who have done well on standardized tests, particularly in mathematics, are especially well suited.  Students should have completed a rigorous college preparation program, including mathematics (through trigonometry), chemistry, and physics and exhibited substantial extracurricular activity and leadership. Students are usually admitted to the program as freshmen and must be prepared to begin with Calculus I (V63.0121) in the first semester of college. Given the highly structured curricula, transfer into the program after the first year is very difficult. Students must maintain satisfactory performance and must complete the required courses in a timely fashion in order to remain in the program. Their records are reviewed yearly by a faculty committee. THE PROGRAM Students accepted into the program spend their first three years of study in the College of Arts and Science at New York University. In the first year at the College, the different curricula call for many of the same courses. This gives students time to consult with faculty at both schools before committing themselves to a particular science/engineering major.                                      During Freshman Orientation, if they have not already done so, students select a major area for their study at New York University from the disciplines of biology, chemistry, computer science, mathematics, and physics. In their first year, students will have the opportunity to change this major and to reflect on their choice of an engineering major. In the spring of the third year, an orientation program helps students prepare for the transition to Poly in the fourth year. In the first three years of the program, students satisfy their MAP requirements and also take some of the Poly courses required for their choice of engineering major. Students may elect to withdraw from the dual-degree program in engineering and complete only the College of Arts and Science general and major requirements at New York University. The final two years of study are undertaken at the Polytechnic Institute of NYU in downtown Brooklyn, across the East River and a short subway ride from New York University\u2019s Greenwich Village campus.                      At Poly, students complete the remaining technical courses required for their engineering major. Programs in engineering available to students in the NYU-Poly dual-degree program include chemical and biolmolecular engineering, civil engineering, computer engineering, electrical engineering, and mechanical engineering.

They provide  good preparation for graduate school; indeed, many of our students go on to  some of the world's best graduate programs. They develop a range of technical  skills, most of which relate to the challenging intellectual problems of  building quantitative theoretical models and making precise measurements of physically  interesting phenomena. The programs are also designed to satisfy curiosity  about the fundamental laws that govern every aspect of the world, from the  interactions of subatomic particles to the origin and behavior of the entire  universe.          The  programs are simultaneously very deep and very broad. Course work includes both  theoretical subjects and experimental activity in laboratories. The programs  are designed to give students flexibility in years three and four to pursue  interdisciplinary activities, spend time abroad, or delve into greater depth in  a subject or into original research.          The  department is a collegial place where faculty and students get to know one  another well. There are regular formal and informal seminars, as well as a  thriving Society of Physics Students, and students and faculty often  collaborate on original research problems. Many of the students participate in  original research and coauthor scientific publications. For all of these  reasons, and in addition to the rigor of the courses, students are extremely  well prepared for a wide range of activities\u2014not just in scientific research,  but also in professional and engineering pursuits, or any area where abstract  thinking and quantitative modeling of real systems are necessary and rewarded.          Nonmajors    For  nonscience majors, there are nontechnical courses that introduce some of the  concepts and events that are most important to understanding physics and its  impact. For science majors outside of physics, there are technical courses that  provide a breadth of ideas about the fundamental laws that underpin the other  sciences. The department provides courses designed to meet the preprofessional  goals of prehealth students and students in engineering disciplines          Minors Students  who are interested in obtaining significant exposure to the ideas of physics  without committing to the major or without obtaining a comprehensive  mathematical background can minor in physics or astronomy.               Majors            Bachelor  of Arts (B.A.) Program          The  major in physics consists of the following eighteen courses (53 to 55 points):          Year  1:   Calculus I (MATH-UA 121)   Calculus II (MATH-UA 122)   Physics I (PHYS-UA 91) and Introductory Experimental Physics I (PHYS-UA 71) (5  points together)   Physics II (PHYS-UA 93) and Introductory Experimental Physics II (PHYS-UA 72)  (5 points together) Year  2:   Calculus III (MATH-UA 123)   Physics III (PHYS-UA 95) and Intermediate Experimental Physics I (PHYS-UA 73)  (5 points together)   Classical and Quantum Waves (PHYS-UA 105) and Intermediate Experimental Physics  II (PHYS-UA 74) (5 points together)   Mathematical Physics (PHYS-UA 106) Years  3 and 4:   Advanced Experimental Physics (PHYS-UA 112)   Quantum Mechanics I (PHYS-UA 123)   Electricity and Magnetism I (PHYS-UA 131)   Thermal and Statistical Physics (PHYS-UA 140)   Two advanced physics electives (3 or 4 points each) Mathematics  requirement: The  calculus requirement is satisfied by taking either the Calculus I, II, III  sequence (MATH-UA 121-123) or the sequence Honors Calculus I, II: Accelerated  Calculus with Linear Algebra (MATH-UA 221, 222; 5 points per term). Potential  physics majors should begin their calculus sequence in the fall semester of  their freshman year. Variations may be constructed with the approval of the director  of undergraduate studies. In addition, students are advised to take advanced  mathematics courses\u2014such as Linear Algebra (MATH-UA 140)\u2014as they proceed in the  major.          Double  major with physics:   The major offers flexibility to complete the requirements for a second major in  the College. Students may wish to combine a major in physics with a major in a  field such as mathematics, computer science, chemistry, economics, or biology.  Students should consult the director of undergraduate studies in their freshman  year to outline a program that is best tailored to their needs.          Bachelor  of Science (B.S.) Program          The  B.S. degree provides breadth in the sciences in addition to the physics major.  The B.S. degree in physics will be granted to students completing the  following:   The required courses for the B.A. major (see above), including one advanced  physics elective   Computational Physics (PHYS-UA 210)   Two courses in chemistry at or above the level of General Chemistry I, II and  Laboratory (CHEM-UA 125, 126)   One course in biology at or above the level of Principles of Biology I (BIOL-UA  11), or in chemistry above the level of General Chemistry II and Laboratory  (CHEM-UA 126)        Minors          Minor  in Physics          Consists  of four of the following courses, or three of the following courses plus one of  the courses listed under the minor in astronomy:   Sound and Music (PHYS-UA 10)   General Physics I (PHYS-UA 11)   General Physics II (PHYS-UA 12)   20th-Century Concepts of Space, Time, and Matter (PHYS-UA 20)   Any course at or above Physics I (PHYS-UA 91), except for pure laboratory  courses Minor  in Astronomy          Consists  of four courses. The Universe: Its Nature and History (PHYS-UA 7) is required,  plus the three following courses (or two of the following and one of the  courses listed under the minor in physics):   Origins of Astronomy (PHYS-UA 8)   Observational Astronomy (PHYS-UA 13)   Astrophysics (PHYS-UA 150)          Honors  Program          Candidates  for a degree with honors in physics must complete the requirements for the B.A.  major described above and attain a 3.65 GPA, both overall and in physics. They  must also complete the equivalent of a semester of experimental or theoretical  research. Students who wish to fulfill this requirement should discuss possible  options, such as independent study courses, with the director of undergraduate  studies.

It is concerned with understanding the world on all scales of length, time, and energy. The methods of physics are diverse, but they share a common objective to develop and refine fundamental models that quantitatively explain observations and the results of experiments. The discoveries of physics, exemplified by the laws of physics, rank among the most important achievements of human inquiry, and have had an enormous impact on human culture and civilization. Members of the department carry out research in the fields of astrophysics, biophysics, cosmology, elementary particle physics, gravitation, hard and soft condensed matter physics, and statistical physics. Experimental work is carried out in state-of-the art laboratories in the department and at national and international facilities such as the Large Hadron Collider at CERN and astronomical telescopes in space. The majority of NYU physics graduates go to graduate school in physics, and the rest pursue careers in medicine, finance, engineering and law. 27 percent of majors are women; 5% black, 16% Asian, and 8% Latino.      The NYU SPS chapter organizes a mentoring program that pairs first-year students with upper division Physics Majors, organizes lunches for students, and sponsors weekly sessions where faculty are invited to discuss their research. There are many opportunities for faculty-student interaction. These include the weekly colloquium and weekly events such as the CCPP (Center for Cosmology and Particle Physics) Brown Bag, in which faculty present talks on their research.       The educational programs of the Department are aimed at providing a range of courses to meet the needs of different student groups. For undergraduate physics majors, there is a rigorous core program, exposure to current frontiers, and opportunities for research. For science majors outside physics there are technical courses that emphasize the fundamental physical laws that underpin other sciences; and for non-science majors there are non-technical courses that introduce some of the most important concepts of physics and their impact on the contemporary world.      Faculty       Professors Emeriti:    Bederson, Borowitz, Brown, Glassgold, Hoffert, Levy, Lowenstein, Richardson, Robinson, Rosenberg, Sculli, Yarmus      Silver Professors; Professors of Physics:    Chaikin, Dvali, Pine      Collegiate Professors; Professors of Physics:    Farrar, Mincer      Professors:    Budick, Gabadadze, Grier, Grosberg, Hohenberg, Kent, Nemethy, Percus, Porrati, Schucking, Sokal, Stein, Stroke, Zhang, Zwanziger      Associate Professors:   Blanton, Gruzinov, Hogg, Kleban, MacFadyen, Mitra, Scoccimarro, Sleator, Weiner      Assistant Professors:    Brujic, Cranmer, Dubovsky, Gershow, Haas, Modjaz, Wyart      Clinical Associate Professor:    Adler            Program       DEPARTMENTAL OBJECTIVES       Majors: The Major programs are designed to meet a number of goals: They provide good preparation for graduate school; indeed many of the Majors go on to some of the world's best graduate programs. They develop a range of technical skills, most of which relate to the challenging intellectual problems of building quantitative theoretical models and making precise measurements of physically interesting phenomena. The Major programs are also designed to satisfy curiosity about the fundamental laws that govern every aspect of the world from the interactions of subatomic particles to the origin and behavior of the entire Universe.      The Major programs are simultaneously very deep and very broad. Course work includes both theoretical subjects and experimental activity in laboratories. The programs are designed to give students flexibility in Years 3 and 4 to pursue interdisciplinary activities, spend time abroad, or go into greater depth in a subject or into original research.      The Department is a collegial place where the faculty and the students get to know one another well; there are regular formal and informal seminars; there is a thriving Society of Physics Students; and students and faculty often collaborate on original research problems. Many of the Majors participate in original research and co-author scientific publications. For all of these reasons, and in addition to the rigor of the courses, the Majors are extremely well prepared for a wide range of activities\u2014not just in scientific research, but also in professional and engineering pursuits\u2014or any area where abstract thinking and quantitative modeling of real systems is necessary and rewarded.      Non-majors: For non-science majors, there are non-technical courses that introduce some of the concepts and events that are most important to understanding physics and its impact on the contemporary world. For science majors outside of physics, there are technical courses that bring breadth or ideas about fundamental laws that underpin the other sciences. The Department provides courses designed to meet the pre-professional goals of pre-health students and students in engineering disciplines.      Minors: There are Minor programs in Physics and Astrophysics for students who are interested in obtaining significant experience in the ideas of physics without committing to the Major or without obtaining a comprehensive mathematical background.
