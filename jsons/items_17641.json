Admissions Requirements   The admissions requirements for this program are parallel to the on-campus requirements. View the Electrical Engineering, MS admissions requirements .   Curriculum   Course Requirements   To obtain the MS in Electrical Engineering degree, students must complete a total of 30 credits, with restrictions described below. The 30 credit requirement is equivalent to 10 required courses broken down as follows:     Core Courses (2 courses required)   EL Courses (6 additional EL courses required): In addition to the core courses, the student must select additional 6 courses from graduate level EE courses (with prefix EL-GY) listed within the concentrations.   Out-of-department courses and 5000-level EL courses: At most 2 non-EL graduate level courses (6 credits) in science, engineering, or management can be used to count towards the 30 credits. A 3-credit graduate course taken at other science or engineering departments of NYU that is closely related to electrical engineering may be approved by the MSEE program advisor. The total number of non-EL courses and 5000-level EL courses cannot exceed 4 (12 credits).     For a more detailed breakdown of course requirement, please see http://bulletin.engineering.nyu.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=9&amp;poid=2836&amp;returnto=863   Core Courses (two courses required):   The core courses cover fundamental material and should be taken as early as possible.
