The International Exchange Program enables select NYU students to study at a variety of institutions \u2013 all distinguished research universities \u2013 while earning NYU credit and being immersed in the culture of some of the world's most exciting cities.   Many universities offer course work in English and others require advanced knowledge of a foreign language.   Students who are approved to enroll in the NYU exchange pay NYU tuition which allows you to maintain your financial aid package, including grants and scholarships (unique partner fees may be required). You may also apply for additional financial aid (in the form of loans) for study abroad through the NYU Office of Financial Aid.

NYU Faculty Resource Network Student Exchange   The Faculty Resource Network has established a student exchange program for outstanding undergraduates between New York University and three historically black and two Hispanic-serving colleges: Morehouse College, Spelman College, Xavier University of Louisiana, University of Puerto Rico (Rio Piedras), and University of Sacred Heart in Puerto Rico.
