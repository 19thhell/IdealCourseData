For further information, please click here       The  M.A. in Spanish and Latin American Linguistic, Literary, and Cultural Studies is  a one-year program offered at NYU Madrid by NYU\u2019s Graduate School of Arts and  Sciences. With courses taught entirely in Spanish.      The program takes full advantage of the vast range of cultural activities and events in Madrid, which form an integral part of the curriculum. Students have access to some of the most resourceful libraries and archives in the world and also benefit from membership to the historic Instituto Internacional and its excellent library. Depending on their interests and career goals, students choose one of two concentrations: Literary and Cultural Studies: Spain and Latin America or Applied Linguistics: Spain and Latin America . The capstone M.A. project allows students to develop an original scholarly work with the guidance of a faculty advisor, and to present a portion of this work at the Graduate Research Conference. The M.A. program is designed to encourage students to immerse themselves linguistically and culturally in Madrid life. All students are provided with a Madrid Cultura y Arte membership card to attend events, screenings, talks, shows, and exhibitions of their choice throughout the year. An integral part of the core curriculum and orientation program, visits and study trips give students the unique opportunity to investigate Spanish culture in situ. Whether studying urban space in Bilbao, transatlantic trade in Seville, or Roman architecture in Segovia, students are guided by faculty experts. Concentration in Literary and Cultural Studies: Spain and Latin America Students with a concentration in Literary and Cultural Studies develop their interests in literary and critical theory, peninsular and Latin American literature, and the arts and culture of both regions. While most students who choose this option are interested in pursuing a doctoral degree and/or teaching at the college or university level, others go on to careers in secondary education or in other fields in which they can use their thorough knowledge and understanding of the Spanish-speaking world. Concentration in Applied Linguistics: Spain and Latin America The concentration in Applied Linguistics emphasizes three main research areas within the historical, political, and cultural context of the Spanish-speaking world: general linguistics, psycholinguistic and sociolinguistic theories, second language teaching and acquisition, and translation studies. The program is designed for students interested in pursuing a doctoral degree in these fields or others related to Applied Linguistics, as well as for those whose professions (primary or secondary education, business, community service, government, international affairs, etc.) would benefit from advanced training.

The design of the program aims to foster student responsibility and independence when exploring and generating new areas of knowledge in dialogue with the academic community at large, and beyond. NYU Madrid draws from the diverse expertise of its faculty within a local and global network of universities, research institutions, and cultural centers and museums, at the very core of our graduate students\u2019 experience in Madrid. Our challenge to students to develop their own goals for the program, met with the flexibility of its design and faculty encouragement to pursue independent research, has made for a successful combination. The M.A. program has served as a platform for students who wish to pursue a doctoral degree in their chosen field of studies and for those who aim to use their linguistic and cultural knowledge of the Spanish-speaking world for the benefit of their professions. Attracting students from diverse backgrounds in the United States and abroad, the M.A. program provides a forum to exchange ideas and explore new critical perspectives in which academic pursuits are inseparable from vital experience.
