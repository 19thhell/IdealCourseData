Our visiting or 'transitioning' population, includes (but is not limited to) participants in Fall and/or Spring in New York, Paths to Peace, Spring at Tisch, Global Liberal Studies students and NYU Abu Dhabi students who may be studying at Washington Square for a semester.

Dr. King's speech entitled, \u201cThe Future of Integration,&quot; advocated for civil rights and nonviolent protest for social change. He said, &quot;Human progress is neither automatic nor inevitable... Every step toward the goal of justice requires sacrifice, suffering, and struggle; the tireless exertions and passionate concern of dedicated individuals.&quot;   As we prepare to celebrate the 10th Annual NYU MLK Week, we are eager to continue the conversation around action and lead our community to live beyond the dream of Dr. King. The 2015 NYU MLK Week event theme &quot;Beyond A Dream\u201d will serve as a guiding force to commemorate Dr. King\u2019s honor and vision to make the world a better place. Three concepts - Reflect, Engage, Ignite - will be explored during this week of conversation and action. The highlight of the week will be the NYU MLK Week University-Wide Event on Thursday, February 5th.
