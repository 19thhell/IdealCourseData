Description       This workshop focuses on the nature of creativity for the public space and the \u201cmodel to monument\u201d design and bronze casting. We will explores the process by which a concept becomes a three dimensional model and consequently a public monument. We will also investigate how ideas, or concepts in history have influenced individual artist in making public monuments. Some examples of this type of didactic art that we will explore are: Perikles\u2019 Athenian building program after the Persian wars, Michelangelo\u2019s David, the Columbia University \u201cAlma Mater\u201d in the middle of Columbia\u2019s campus, the Peace Fountain next to St. John the Divine, Ghandi\u2019s bronze on Union Square, Grand Army Plaza, \u201cSherman Memorial,\u201d Avenue of Americas \u201cLiberators Monuments,\u201d Central Park \u201cLiterary Walk-Shakespeare\u201d and \u201cAngel of the Waters\u201d and other sculptures and architectural sights in New York City. In addition to visiting most of the above New York City\u2019s public monuments, each student in the class will adopt-a-monument that is in a decaying state and develop plans to restore it or study the possibilities to prevent it from further decay. Some sessions of this workshop will be conducted at the Art Students League with visits to the Queens Modern Art Foundry. Readings may include Plato\u2019s Timaeus, Benvenuto Cellini\u2019s Autobiography, Cezanne\u2019s Letters, Delacroix\u2019s Jounal, as well as Goethe and Leonardo on painting.

The arts curriculum includes more than 20 different workshops each semester in music, dance, theater, the visual arts, architecture and design. Outside of the classroom, students may intern in arts agencies and performance companies and study at various private studios in New York City. Annually, the arts program sponsors the Gallatin Arts Festival , a weeklong, community-wide celebration of the artistry of students at the Gallatin School. Located at Gallatin, the Gallatin Galleries provide a yearlong venue for the exhibition of art work by students, faculty and working artists. The Jerry H. Labowitz Theatre for the Performing Arts is a small, black box theater showcasing student performances and other productions during the academic year.

He earned his M.A. degree at Columbia University, Teachers College in ceramic arts in 1974, Ed.D. (candidate), completed his doctoral coursework in art education in 1976. Greg Wyatt is a native of Grand View-on-Hudson, New York, located south of Nyack, home of Edward Hopper. Mr. Wyatt was nurtured in the artistic tradition of his native Hudson River Valley at an early age by his father, William Stanley Wyatt, painter and fine arts professor at Columbia University and the City College of the City University of New York. Cast bronze is his primary medium of artistic expression. Dr. Anthony Janson, editor of W.H. Janson's History of Art, has stated that Mr. Wyatt's work is based on the philosophy of &quot;spiritual realism.&quot; His mature style merges realistic images inspired by his readings of the Great Books content with creative masses of form, space and energy. His lyricism evokes poetry while his work process is very attentive to craftsmanship and the fine details of cast bronze.                                     top of page                                     Contact Information     Greg Wyatt             Part-time Faculty              wyattgreg@me.com             715 B&#039;way, Room 431             (212) 992-7772      Download as vCard           \u00a0                                    Courses                                                   2015             Fall                            The Public Square: From Concepts--to Models--to Monuments                  Mon      9:30 AM -      12:15 PM                                                   2014             Fall                            The Public Square: From Concepts--to Models--to Monuments                  Mon      9:30 AM -      12:15 PM                                                   2013             Fall                            The Public Square: From Concepts--to Models--to Monuments                  Mon      9:30 AM -      12:15 PM                                                   2012             Fall                            The Public Square: From Concepts--to Models--to Monuments                  Mon      9:30 AM -      12:15 PM                                                   2011             Fall                            The Public Square: From Concepts--to Models--to Monuments                  Mon      9:30 AM -      12:15 PM                                       Research and Teaching Interests       sculpture studio studies; craftsmanship and its relationship to mastery, creativity and three-dimensional design theory; historical artistic influences upon public art monuments; art history and philosophy                                                                                                              NYU Gallatin Footer              Gallatin School of Individualized Study     1 Washington Place     New York, NY 10003     (212) 998-7370                   A&#8211;Z Index      Directions      Contact Us      Job Opportunities               News      Support Gallatin      Feedback                         Follow us on Facebook      Follow us on Twitter      Follow us on Youtube         Follow us Instagram                 Unless otherwise noted, all content copyright NYU Gallatin.

Description       This workshop focuses on the nature of creativity for the public space and the \u201cmodel to monument\u201d design and bronze casting. We will explores the process by which a concept becomes a three dimensional model and consequently a public monument. We will also investigate how ideas, or concepts in history have influenced individual artist in making public monuments. Some examples of this type of didactic art that we will explore are: Perikles\u2019 Athenian building program after the Persian wars, Michelangelo\u2019s David, the Columbia University \u201cAlma Mater\u201d in the middle of Columbia\u2019s campus, the Peace Fountain next to St. John the Divine, Ghandi\u2019s bronze on Union Square, Grand Army Plaza, \u201cSherman Memorial,\u201d Avenue of Americas \u201cLiberators Monuments,\u201d Central Park \u201cLiterary Walk-Shakespeare\u201d and \u201cAngel of the Waters\u201d and other sculptures and architectural sights in New York City. In addition to visiting most of the above New York City\u2019s public monuments, each student in the class will adopt-a-monument that is in a decaying state and develop plans to restore it or study the possibilities to prevent it from further decay. Some sessions of this workshop will be conducted at the Art Students League with visits to the Queens Modern Art Foundry.

The arts curriculum includes more than 20 different workshops each semester in music, dance, theater, the visual arts, architecture and design. Outside of the classroom, students may intern in arts agencies and performance companies and study at various private studios in New York City. Annually, the arts program sponsors the Gallatin Arts Festival , a weeklong, community-wide celebration of the artistry of students at the Gallatin School. Located at Gallatin, the Gallatin Galleries provide a yearlong venue for the exhibition of art work by students, faculty and working artists. The Jerry H. Labowitz Theatre for the Performing Arts is a small, black box theater showcasing student performances and other productions during the academic year. Gallatin also houses a rehearsal room for dance and other performance and an arts studio for painting, drawing, and architectural design.

He earned his M.A. degree at Columbia University, Teachers College in ceramic arts in 1974, Ed.D. (candidate), completed his doctoral coursework in art education in 1976. Greg Wyatt is a native of Grand View-on-Hudson, New York, located south of Nyack, home of Edward Hopper. Mr. Wyatt was nurtured in the artistic tradition of his native Hudson River Valley at an early age by his father, William Stanley Wyatt, painter and fine arts professor at Columbia University and the City College of the City University of New York. Cast bronze is his primary medium of artistic expression. Dr. Anthony Janson, editor of W.H. Janson's History of Art, has stated that Mr. Wyatt's work is based on the philosophy of &quot;spiritual realism.&quot; His mature style merges realistic images inspired by his readings of the Great Books content with creative masses of form, space and energy. His lyricism evokes poetry while his work process is very attentive to craftsmanship and the fine details of cast bronze.                                     top of page                                     Contact Information     Greg Wyatt             Part-time Faculty              wyattgreg@me.com             715 B&#039;way, Room 431             (212) 992-7772      Download as vCard           \u00a0                                    Courses                                                   2015             Fall                            The Public Square: From Concepts--to Models--to Monuments                  Mon      9:30 AM -      12:15 PM                                                   2014             Fall                            The Public Square: From Concepts--to Models--to Monuments                  Mon      9:30 AM -      12:15 PM                                                   2013             Fall                            The Public Square: From Concepts--to Models--to Monuments                  Mon      9:30 AM -      12:15 PM                                                   2012             Fall                            The Public Square: From Concepts--to Models--to Monuments                  Mon      9:30 AM -      12:15 PM                                                   2011             Fall                            The Public Square: From Concepts--to Models--to Monuments                  Mon      9:30 AM -      12:15 PM                                       Research and Teaching Interests       sculpture studio studies; craftsmanship and its relationship to mastery, creativity and three-dimensional design theory; historical artistic influences upon public art monuments; art history and philosophy                                                                                                              NYU Gallatin Footer              Gallatin School of Individualized Study     1 Washington Place     New York, NY 10003     (212) 998-7370                   A&#8211;Z Index      Directions      Contact Us      Job Opportunities               News      Support Gallatin      Feedback                         Follow us on Facebook      Follow us on Twitter      Follow us on Youtube         Follow us Instagram                 Unless otherwise noted, all content copyright NYU Gallatin.
