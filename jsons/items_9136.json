Gardner's        Art Through The Ages, Eleventh Edition, Volume II,  2001.        (required)         Barnet, Sylvan. A Short Guide to Writing About Art, Fifth  Edition,        1997. (optional)                            Course Reader: In addition to your  textbook,        you will be responsible for 6 more articles which  can be        found in the course reader available at Unique Copy  Center,        252 Greene Street, between Waverly Place and Eighth  Street.        Copies of these articles, and the original books  from which        they were drawn are also on reserve at Bobst library  level        A, should you choose not to purchase the course  reader.                                        Web Site: I have set up a web site for  this        class which can be accessed at:  http://www.nyu.edu/classes/finearts/art2         On the web site you will find  additional        images that relate to the material in the course,  for which        you are also responsible. Images 1-13 correspond to  those        found in your course reader, which as you will see  did not        reproduce very well when xeroxed. Images14-45 are  all works        that will be discussed during the semester, but are  not        in Gardner. In addition, there are two web links  included        on the site which offer additional images of the  Vietnam        Veteran's Memorial, which you may wish to consult  when reading        the Marita Sturken article (summary 6) in August.                                  Course Work: Due to the condensed nature of the summer  semester and        the vast amount of material we will be covering, the  exam        format for this class will consist of two 30 minute  quizzes        (containing slide identifications, vocabulary and a  20 minute        essay) and a final exam (same format but probably 90  minutes).        The final exam will not be  cumulative.        You will also be assigned two papers: a short paper (2-3  pages) and        a longer paper (4-6) pages. Both papers will be  based on        works seen during visits to New York museums and  will not        require outside research. Finally students must  write a        brief summary of each of the 6 articles in the  course reader.        The summaries should be between * of a page and 1 *  pages        in length. In writing your summaries, please do not  just        quote the author, but discuss, in your own words,  the thesis        and main points of the article. Other issues to  consider        might be: How the author uses evidence to support  his or        her thesis, if, in your opinion, the argument is  convincing,        and why or why not.                         Note:       with the exception of the in-class exams, all work  must be       typed and double- spaced. No handwritten or emailed  papers       or summaries will be accepted. All summaries and  papers are       due at the beginning of class on the due date  specified on       the syllabus. Late papers will be marked down. Exams  and quizzes       must be taken on the dates given in class, as  indicated on       the syllabus. There can be no make ups. The only  acceptable       excuse for missing an exam or quiz is a medical excuse  or       real family/personal emergency. In either of these  instances,       you must contact me or the department (998-8180)  before the       exam and a doctor's note (or some other written  documentation)       to me as soon as possible. I am also handing out the  departmental       policy on final exams, which will be applied to this  class.                   Warning:       Last year we ran into some unfortunate incidents  having to       do with cheating and plagiarism. Right away I need to  make       the policy clear. Cheating on an exam results in  automatic       failure on the exam. Please do not give me a reason to  question       you. Be very careful to keep your eyes on your own  work and       to cover your papers during exams. As for plagiarism,  the       policy at NYU is to fail any paper that has been  plagiarized       either fully or partially. If you want to quote  outside sources,       be sure to either footnote them or cite them in some  other       appropriate way in your paper. You should refer to  Barnet       or look in your textbook for the proper ways of doing  this.                          Museum        Visit: I was able to get money from NYU's Equal fund  to        be able to take you to a museum and lecture there in  front        of the works. I have tentatively set aside Wednesday  July        25th for our museum visit. On that day, class will  be held        at the museum and will end in plenty of time for  those of        you who have classes back downtown right after this  one.        I will fill you in on the details about the museum  visit        closer to the date.
