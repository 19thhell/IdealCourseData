Writers in New York (May 26\u2013June 18, 2015) offers students of poetry, fiction , and creative nonfiction an opportunity to develop their craft while living the writer's life in Greenwich Village. Daily workshops and craft seminars are supplemented by readings and lectures by New York-based writers and publishing professionals. Field trips, cultural activities, readings, and guest lectures constitute an integral component of the program.    Most classes and readings are held in the Lillian Vernon Creative Writers House , home of the NYU Creative Writing Program.

Cummings, James Baldwin, Willa Cather, Marianne Moore, Richard Wright, and Frank O\u2019Hara\u2014have lived and worked.

Evenings (6:00pm-8:00pm) after class feature readings, lectures, panel discussions, and special events. The schedule includes time for writing, reading, and exploring New York.
