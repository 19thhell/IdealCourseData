New technologies for Smart Mass Transit and Intelligent Transportation Systems are discussed.     Engineering Connection:   A broad range of engineering disciplines, including city planning, highway engineering, transportation engineering, and traffic engineering, are involved in the design of green, sustainable Intelligent Transportation Systems. Rather than replacing existing infrastructure, these systems are enhancements and improvements to our current transportation system. These systems use embedded intelligence to connect vehicles to each other, to various urban infrastructures and to a central command and control center.     Pre-Requisite Knowledge:   Students should be aware of the current technologies available in today\u2019s vehicles and transportation network.     Learning Objectives:   After this lesson, students will be able to:     Understand how ITS maximizes the efficiency of an existing transportation system   Identify the various components of a Smart Mass Transit System   Explain how a smart transportation system contributes to the operation of a smart city.       Introduction/Motivation:     Balancing modern transportation needs with Global Warming Mitigation   The transportation industry is a major source of greenhouse gas emissions, comprising 28% of the total U.S. contributions in 2006. 59.3% of that 28% is from light duty vehicles (personal vehicles), which means 16.6% of the total U.S. GHG emissions are from personal vehicles.     Greenhouse gases contribute to global warming because they trap infrared radiation reflecting off the earth\u2019s surface, instead of letting it escape into space. This keeps the heat in the atmosphere, and warms the earth. Global Warming Potential is a number that takes into consideration how much energy a greenhouse gas absorbs and how long it stays in the atmosphere over a 100 year time period.     Since the GWP of CO2 is 1, all the gases are compared to CO2. The GWP of methane (CH4) is 21 and nitrous oxide (N2O) has a GWP of 300. So, N2O can trap 300 times as much heat in the atmosphere as CO2. Though the majority of GHG released is in the form of CO2, methane and nitrous oxide have much greater effects on global warming. Transportation contributes to emissions of both N2O and CO2.     What is the city\u2019s role in reducing GHG emissions? The Driver\u2019s role?        Individual drivers and city planners share responsibility for GHG emissions from traffic. In some cities, a driver trying to park in a central business district (downtown) can spend up to an hour circling around the neighborhood looking for a parking spot, causing congestion and unnecessary driving. In fact, the majority of the GHG emissions from the transportation industry are from traffic jams and congestion. Congestion is a man-made urban problem that can be relieved with a smart transportation network.     City traffic engineers are responsible for trying to decrease congestion through timing traffic signals and regulating traffic. It is the Traffic Engineer\u2019s job to predict where traffic will be heavy, and when congestion will occur. Transportation Engineers are responsible for the physical infrastructure of the transportation network. Inadequate infrastructure, not enough lanes, poorly designed highway exit/entrances, and narrow lanes all increase the potential for congestion and accidents. Drivers also have a responsibility to exercise due care when driving because careless, negligent and selfish driving leads to accidents, which contribute to congestion.     Encouraging Mass Transit   Mass transit is more efficient, cheaper and sometimes faster than personal vehicles, but Americans are accustomed to driving. How should Americans be encouraged to use mass transit? What would make mass transit more appealing than driving a car?     High gas prices, congestion, and limited numbers of parking spots are all factors that tend to contribute to people choosing mass transit over driving. To encourage use of mass transit, fares need to be affordable, and the quality of the service must be high \u2013 frequent service with high coverage and good communication to customers are all important factors.       Smart Mass Transit Systems     When designing a public transportation system, engineers must keep in mind where people are coming from and where they are going. Some of the major places people will go to or come from will be:     Home   Work   Parks   Entertainment Centers (movies, theater, restaurants, etc.)   Government buildings   Shopping     Keep in mind that the goal of the public transportation system is to get people to within a few blocks of the place they want to go without using a car.       Two important types of public transportation in modern cities are buses and subways. In a city like New York City, these systems help to provide access along major traffic hubs and high traffic areas (where service is usually by subway) and into less-trafficked areas (where busses are more likely). The population density of New York City makes its subway system efficient, much more efficient than it might be in a less populous place.     There are many new ideas for smart transportation systems being developed and tested in cities across the world. Intelligent transportation systems are systems are designed to achieve smart policy goals such as enhanced mobility, lower emissions, reduced fuel consumption, improved safety and economic competitiveness.         Personal Rapid Transit. In this system, a network of individual pods travels on a rail system through a city. Each person goes to a station, gives it a destination and a pod with people heading towards the same destination picks up the customer to take them off to their destination. These have been implemented on a small scale in places such as Morgantown, West Virginia and Heathrow Airport in London. (See Extension Section for link if you wish to show it to students). These pods are ideal for small cities or communities; a network like this would not work in NYC because there are too many people.   Centralized Fleet Vehicle Management. This is a system that leases cars to the public allowing people to share vehicles (similar to Zip Cars).   Straddling Bus. Developed in mainland China, this bus is tall enough to allow cars to pass underneath it, but short enough to pass under overpasses. This helps to decrease congestion.   Smart Mass Transit (SMT) Rail is is a type of magnetic levitation train system. Magnetic levitation helps to reduce wasted energy from friction on the tracks.\u00a0 Solar panels on the roof of the train help it recharge, and lightweight recycled alloys are used in its construction.   Real-time traveler information uses sensors placed throughout the transportation network to wirelessly transmit information to drivers about accidents, congestion and recommend detours. Transit riders can know before they leave the house whether their train is on time or delayed.   Smart electric vehicle charging allows electric cars to wirelessly charge. This can be manipulated so that the car charges where and when demand is low and electricity is the cheapest. The charging system can interact with the driver, so that the driver can control how much to charge the car.   Citywide traffic monitoring allows traffic engineers to remotely control traffic lights. Traffic lights can analyze data collected from their cameras and sensors, and decide how to adjust their timing to traffic needs.   Transit signal prioritization systems allow priority vehicles to move through the transportation network faster. Buses and emergency vehicles are considered priority vehicles. Sensors placed on these vehicles send an encoded request to the traffic lights at the intersection to increase the green time for them to pass.   Parking availability technology makes use of sensors placed on the streets that can notify drivers whether a parking spot is available, reducing circling for a parking spot. San Francisco\u2019s Municipal Agency Parking App allows drivers to take advantage of this new technology, and NYC currently has a pilot program in the Bronx.   Variable speed limits can help a highway adjust its rules in response to changing traffic conditions. Highway speed limit signs can be digitized and changed depending on weather and road conditions          Image Source: http://walimemon.com            Safety Issues   None     Investigating Questions     What are the benefits and drawbacks of driving?
