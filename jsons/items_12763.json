His works allow us to rethink the traditional   relationship between the author and the reader. For my research, I have   selected texts by Artaud in which the suspension of interpretation is   particularly blatant. By analyzing these different experiences of   reading, I demonstrate how the closure of interpretation takes place,   allowing to theorize a non-hermeneutical reading. Research Interests: 20th   century literature and poetry, literary theory &amp; theories of   reading, intersection of literature and philosophy, the sacred,   epistolary writing, literary reviews.

Nicholas\u2019s dissertation research examines higher education access and equity in contemporary France, with a particular focus on the relationship of publicuniversit\u00e9s to poverty- and working-class students. He investigates how these students experience curricular, student-life, and social-aid offerings in the wake of demographic changes to the profile of \u201cthe student.\u201d His work also examines how universit\u00e9s teach and administer poverty- and working-class students amid the political context of uncertainty regarding educational \u201cdemocratization,\u201d \u201cmeritocracy,\u201d and \u201cequality of opportunity.\u201d Additionally, Nicholas has designed an undergraduate syllabus that uses detective fiction to approach the study of literary genres and consecration as well as problems in French history.

His works allow us to rethink the traditional   relationship between the author and the reader. For my research, I have   selected texts by Artaud in which the suspension of interpretation is   particularly blatant. By analyzing these different experiences of   reading, I demonstrate how the closure of interpretation takes place,   allowing to theorize a non-hermeneutical reading. Research Interests: 20th   century literature and poetry, literary theory &amp; theories of   reading, intersection of literature and philosophy, the sacred,   epistolary writing, literary reviews.

Nicholas\u2019s dissertation research examines higher education access and equity in contemporary France, with a particular focus on the relationship of publicuniversit\u00e9s to poverty- and working-class students. He investigates how these students experience curricular, student-life, and social-aid offerings in the wake of demographic changes to the profile of \u201cthe student.\u201d His work also examines how universit\u00e9s teach and administer poverty- and working-class students amid the political context of uncertainty regarding educational \u201cdemocratization,\u201d \u201cmeritocracy,\u201d and \u201cequality of opportunity.\u201d Additionally, Nicholas has designed an undergraduate syllabus that uses detective fiction to approach the study of literary genres and consecration as well as problems in French history.
