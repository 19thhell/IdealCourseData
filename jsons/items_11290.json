The dismantling of Apartheid and a democratically elected government in South Africa affords students   the opportunity to explore firsthand the unique changes that are taking place in the visual arts. Through site visits, the seminar series,   prominent guest speakers, and artists, students will gain a perspective on the issues, problems, and successes that surround the democratization   of the visual arts in South Africa. Students will study the practice of art making and the spaces where artists create from studios   and galleries to site visits in rural areas. Students investigate traditional and contemporary art in urban and rural spaces and explore   the South African model comparing it to the contemporary art scene in the United States.
