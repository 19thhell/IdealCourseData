Imagine  a picture that shows the structure of the physical stimulus reaching your  ear. On the horizontal axis we have time, and on the vertical axis we will  plot the instantaneous density of the air molecules at your ear. Thus, we  plot signal strength as a function of time. In the case of a simple hand-clap,  the disturbance is a short, transient burst and is aptly named an impulse .  It looks like a single upwards blip on the graph: the sound pressure momentarily  increases when the clap hits your ear. More complex sounds look like more  complex graphs on this kind of plot. This sort of graph offers a general  way to describe all of the possible auditory stimuli.    One possible way to characterize the response of the ear to sound might   be to build a look-up table : a table that shows the exact neural response  for every possible auditory stimulus. Obviously, it would take an infinite  amount of time to construct such a table, because the number of possible  sounds is unlimited.    Instead, we must find some way of making a finite number of measurements   that allow us to infer how the system will respond to other stimuli that we  have not yet measured. We can only do this for certain kinds of systems with  certain properties. If we have a good theory about the kind of system we  are studying, we can save a lot of time and energy by using the appropriate   theory about the system's responsiveness. Linear systems theory is a good   time-saving theory for linear systems which obey certain rules. Not  all systems are linear, but many important ones are.          Linear Systems    To see whether a system is linear, we need to test whether it obeys certain   rules that all linear systems obey. The two basic tests of linearity are homogeneity  and additivity.    Homogeneity: As we increase the strength of a simple input to a  linear system, say we double it, then we predict that the output function   will also be doubled. For example, if a person's voice becomes twice as loud,  the ear should respond twice as much if it's a linear system. This is called  homogeneity or sometimes the scalar rule of linear systems. Clearly, systems  that obey Steven's Power Law do not obey homogeneity and are not linear,  because they show response compression or response expansion.                   Additivity: Suppose we present a complex stimulus S1 such as the  sound of a person's voice to the inner ear, and we measure the electrical   responses of several nerve fibers coming from the inner ear. Next, we present   a second stimulus S2 that is a little different: a different person's voice.   The second stimulus also generates a set of responses which we measure and  write down. Then, we present the sum of the two stimuli S1 + S2: we present  both voices together and see what happens. If the system is linear, then  the measured response will be just the sum of its responses to each of the  two stimuli presented separately.                   Superposition: Systems that satisfy both homogeneity and additivity   are considered to be linear systems. These two rules, taken together, are   often referred to as the principle of superposition.    Shift-invariance: Suppose that we stimulate your ear once with an  impulse (hand clap) and we measure the electrical response. Then we stimulate  it again with a similar impulse at a different point in time, and again we  measure the response. If we haven't damaged your ear with the first impulse  then we should expect that the response to the second impulse will be the  same as the response to the first impulse. The only difference between them  will be that the second impulse has occurred later in time, that is, it is  shifted in time. When the responses to the identical stimulus presented shifted  in time are the same, except for the corresponding shift in time, then we  have a special kind of linear system called a shift-invariant linear system.  Just as not all systems are linear, not all linear systems are shift-invariant.                      Why impulses are special: Homogeneity, additivity, and shift invariance  may, at first, sound a bit abstract but they are very useful. They suggest  that the system's response to an impulse can be the key measurement to make.  The trick is to conceive of the complex stimuli we encounter (such as a person's  voice) as a combination of impulses. We can approximate any complex  stimulus as if it were simply the sum of a number of impulses that are scaled  copies of one another and shifted in time. (A digital compact disc, for example,  stores whole complex pieces of music as lots of simple numbers representing  very short impulses, and then the CD player adds all the impulses back together  one after another to recreate the complex musical waveform.)    For shift-invariant linear systems, we can measure the system's response   to an impulse and we will know how to predict the response to any stimulus   (combinations of impulses) through the principle of superposition. To characterize   shift-invariant linear systems, then, we need to measure only one thing: the  way the system responds to an impulse of a particular intensity. This response  is called the impulse response function of the system.    The problem of characterizing a complex system has become simpler now.   For shift-invariant linear systems, there is only a single impulse response   function to measure. Once we've measured this function, we can predict how  the system will respond to any other possible stimulus.                   The way we use the impulse response function is illustrated in the above   Figure. We conceive of the input stimulus, in this case a sinusoid, as if  it were the sum of a set of impulses. We know the responses we would get  if each impulse was presented separately (i.e., scaled and shifted copies  of the impulse response). We simply add together all of the (scaled and shifted)  impulse responses to predict how the system will respond to the complete  stimulus.       Sinusoidal stimuli    Sinusoidal stimuli have a special relationship to shift-invariant linear   systems. A sinusoid is a regular, repeating curve, that oscillates around   a mean level. The sinusoid has a zero-value at time zero. The cosinusoid is  a shifted version of the sinusoid; it has a value of one at time zero.    The sine wave repeats itself regularly. The distance from one peak of the  wave to the next peak is called the wavelength or period of  the sinusoid and it is generally indicated by the greek letter lambda. The  inverse of wavelength is frequency: the number of peaks in the stimulus that  arrive per second at the ear. The longer the wavelength, the lower the frequency.  The units for the frequency of a sine-wave are hertz, named after a famous  19th century physicist who was a student of Helmholtz. Apart from frequency,  sinusoids also have various amplitudes, which represent how high they get  at the peak of the wave and how low they get at the trough. Thus, we can  describe a sine wave completely by its frequency and by its amplitude. Loud,  high-pitched sounds have high frequency and high amplitude.    When we write the mathematical expression of a sine-wave, the two mathematical   variables that correspond to the amplitude and the frequency are A   and f , respectively:       A sin(2 pi f t )          The height of the peaks increase as the value of the amplitude, A ,   increases. The spacing between the peaks becomes smaller as the frequency,    f , increases.    The response of shift-invariant systems to sine waves: Just as we  can express any stimulus as the sum of a series of shifted and scaled impulses,  so too we can express any periodic stimulus (a stimulus that repeats itself  over time) as the sum of a series of (shifted and scaled) sinusoids at different  frequencies. This is called the Fourier Series expansion of the stimulus.  The equation describing this expansion works as follows. Suppose that s(t)   is a periodic stimulus. Then we can always express s(t) as a sum of  sinusoids:       s(t) = A 0 + A 1 sin(2 p f 1   t + f 1) + A 2 sin(2 p f 2 t + f 2)  + A 3 sin(2 p f 3 t + f 3) + ...          (Do not memorize this equation!) You can go either way: if you know the  coefficients (the A 's and f 's), you  can reconstruct the original stimulus s(t) ; if you know the stimulus,  you can compute the coefficients by a method called the Fourier Transform  (a way of decomposing complex stimuli into its component sinusoids).                   This decomposition is important because if we know the response of the   system to sinusoids at many different frequencies, then we can use the same  kind of trick we used with impulses to predict the response via the impulse  response function. First, we measure the system's response to sinusoids of  all different frequencies. Next, we take our input stimulus (a complex sound)  and use the Fourier Transform to compute the values of the coefficients in  the Fourier Series expansion. At this point the stimulus has been broken down  as the sum of its component sinusoids. Finally, we can predict the system's  response to the (complex) stimulus simply by adding the responses for all  the component sinusoids.    Why bother with sinusoids when we were doing just fine with impulses? The  reason is that sinusoids have a very special relationship to shift-invariant   linear systems. When we use a sinusoidal stimulus as input to a shift-invariant   linear system, the system's responses is always a (shifted and scaled) copy  of the input, at the same frequency as the input . That is, when the  input is sin(2 p f t ) the output is always  of the form A sin(2 p f t + f ). Here, f determines  the amount of shift and A determines the amount of scaling. Thus,  measuring the response to a sinusoid for a shift-invariant linear system  entails measuring only two numbers: the shift and the scale. This makes the  job of measuring the response to sinusoids at many different frequencies  quite practical.                   Often, then, when scientists characterize the response of a shift-invariant   linear system they will not tell you the impulse response. Rather, they will  give you plots that tell you about the values of the shift and scale for  each of the possible input frequencies. This representation of how the shift-invariant  linear system behaves is equivalent to providing you with the impulse response  function. We can use these numbers to compute the response to any stimulus.  This is the main point of all this stuff: a simple, fast, economical way  to measure the responsiveness of complex systems. If you know the responses  for sine waves of all frequencies, then you can determine how the system  will respond to any possible periodic stimulus.                         Example 1: Stereos as shift-invariant systems    Many people find the characterization in terms of frequency response to be  intuitive. And most of you have seen graphs that describe systems this way.  Stereo systems, for example, are pretty good shift-invariant linear systems.  They can be evaluated by measuring the signal at different frequencies. And  the stereo controls are designed around the frequency representation. Adjusting  the bass alters the level of the low frequency signals, while adjusting the  treble adjust the level of the high frequency signals. Equalizers divide  up the signal into many frequency bands to give you finer control.       Example 2: Swinging pendula as frequency analyzers    Remember the class demonstration with two weights suspended from strings   of different lengths. Each weight on a string is a pendulum. The longer the  string's length, the lower the pendulum's natural frequency, also called it  resonant frequency. By moving the stick back and forth at different frequencies  corresponding to one or the other pendulum's resonant frequency, we can get  one or the other weight to move back and forth.    The swinging pendula act as frequency analyzers (just like the Fourier   Transform): they inform us about the motion of the stick and the hand that   moves it. When the short pendulum swings a lot you can infer that the stick   is moving at a relatively high frequency back and forth. When the long pendulum  swings a lot you can infer that the stick is moving at a relatively low frequency.  Thus, which pendulum is moving identifies the nature of the stick movement.  In general, this sort of pendulum motion satisfies the principle of superposition  and therefore the system that transforms from the input of the stick moving,  to the output of the pendula swinging, is a linear system.    The cochlea transforms the complex periodic motion of the input at the   oval window to the simple oscillation of different frequency analyzers along  the basilar membrane. Different points along the basilar membrane respond  based on the frequency components in the signal. This representation is used  by the brain to analyze sounds for pitch and for meaning.

Homogeneity: As we increase the strength of a simple input to a  linear system, say we double it, then we predict that the output function   will also be doubled. For example, if a person's voice becomes twice as loud,  the ear should respond twice as much if it's a linear system. This is called  homogeneity or sometimes the scalar rule of linear systems. Clearly, systems  that obey Steven's Power Law do not obey homogeneity and are not linear,  because they show response compression or response expansion.

This is called the Fourier Series expansion of the stimulus.  The equation describing this expansion works as follows. Suppose that s(t)   is a periodic stimulus. Then we can always express s(t) as a sum of  sinusoids:       s(t) = A 0 + A 1 sin(2 p f 1   t + f 1) + A 2 sin(2 p f 2 t + f 2)  + A 3 sin(2 p f 3 t + f 3) + ...

Rangan            Prerequisites : Undergraduate linear     algebra.            Linear algebra is two things in one: a general methodology     for solving linear systems, and a beautiful abstract     structure underlying much of mathematics and the sciences.     This course will try to strike a balance between both. We     will follow the book of our own Peter Lax, which does a     superb job in describing the mathematical structure of     linear algebra, and complement it with applications and     computing. The most advanced topics include spectral theory,     convexity, duality, and various matrix decompositions.             Text : Lax, P.D. (2007).

Prerequisites : Elements of linear algebra and the     theory of rings and fields.            The objects of study in algebraic geometry are systems     defined by polynomial equations. Here are some examples:      1. x^2+y^2+z^2-w^2=0;      2. y^2=x^3-2x      3. x^2+y^2=u^2, x^2+z^2=v^2, y^2+z^2=w^2, x^2+y^2+z^2=t^2.            The first example gives a projective quadric; the second one     defines an elliptic curve. The rational solutions of the     third one provide a rectangular box such that the lengths of     the edges, face diagonals, and long diagonals are rational     numbers. The existence of such a solution is still not     known.            We will start this introductory course with some topics from     the commutative algebra, such as ideals in polynomial rings     and the famous Nullstellensatz theorem. We will also discuss     some projective geometry in dimension two. A large part of     the course will be devoted to the study of elliptic curves     over various fields: finite fields, fields of rational or     complex numbers. For elliptic curves defined over finite     fields we will discuss as well applications in cryptography.                                                                        MATH-GA     2170.001 INTRODUCTION TO CRYPTOGRAPHY      3 points. Fall term.      Monday, 11:00-12:50, O. Regev.                 Prerequisites : Strong mathematical     background.            The primary focus of this course will be on definitions and     constructions of various cryptographic objects, such as     pseudo-random generators, encryption schemes, digital     signature schemes, message authentication codes, block     ciphers, and others time permitting. We will try to     understand what security properties are desirable in such     objects, how to properly define these properties, and how to     design objects that satisfy them. Once we establish a good     definition for a particular object, the emphasis will be on     constructing examples that provably satisfy the definition.     Thus, a main prerequisite of this course is mathematical     maturity and a certain comfort level with proofs. Secondary     topics that we will cover only briefly will be current     cryptographic practice and the history of cryptography and     cryptanalisys.

Prerequisites : (Serial) programming experience with     C/C++ or FORTRAN (C will mostly be used in class), and some     familiarity with numerical methods.           This class will be an introduction to the fundamentals of     parallel scientific computing. We will establish a basic     understanding of modern computer architectures (CPUs and     accelerators, memory hierarchies, interconnects) and of     parallel approaches to programming these machines (distributed     vs. shared memory parallelism: MPI, OpenMP, OpenCL). Issues     such as load balancing, communication, and synchronization     will be covered and illustrated in the context of parallel     numerical algorithms. Since a prerequisite for good parallel     performance is good serial performance, this aspect will also     be addressed. Along the way you will be exposed to important     tools for high performance computing such as debuggers,     schedulers, visualization, and version control systems.           This will be a hands-on class, with several parallel (and     serial) computing assignments, in which students can and will     have to explore material independently. Students will learn     some Unix in this course.           Text : Rauber, T., &amp; Runger, G. (2013). Parallel                       Programming for Multicore and Cluster Systems (2nd     ed.).

Spring Term                Risk Management is arguably one of the most     important tools for managing a trading book and quantifying     the effects of leverage and diversification (or lack     thereof).            This course is an introduction to risk-management techniques     for portfolios of (i) equities and delta-1 securities and     futures (ii) equity derivatives (iii) fixed income     securities and derivatives, including credit derivatives,     and (iv) mortgage-backed securities.            A systematic approach to the subject is adopted, based on     selection of risk factors, econometric analysis,     extreme-value theory for tail estimation, correlation     analysis, and copulas to estimate joint factor     distributions. We will cover the construction of     risk-measures (e,g. VaR and Expected Shortfall) and     historical back-testing of portfolios. We also review     current risk-models and practices used by large financial     institutions and clearinghouses.

The first part of the course will     also review subprime mortgages, CDO\u2019s, Commercial Mortgage     Backed Securities (CMBS), Auto Asset Backed Securities     (ABS), Credit Card ABS, and CLO\u2019s, and will discuss drivers     of the financial crisis and model risk.            The second part of the course will focus on energy     commodities and derivatives, from their basic fundamentals     and valuation, to practical issues in managing structured     energy portfolios. We develop a risk neutral valuation     framework starting from basic GBM and extend this to more     sophisticated multifactor models. These approaches are then     used for the valuation of common, yet challenging,     structures. Particular emphasis is placed on the potential     pitfalls of modeling methods and the practical aspects of     implementation in production trading platforms. We survey     market mechanics and valuation of inventory options and     delivery risk in the emissions markets.             Recommended Texts : Hayre, L. (2007).

MATH-GA 2797.001 CREDIT MARKETS     AND MODELS      3 points. Fall term.      Wednesday, 7:10-9:00, Instructor TBA.           Prerequisites : Computing in     Finance (or equivalent), Derivative Securities (or     equivalent), familiarity with analytical methods applied to     interest rate derivatives.            This course addresses a number of practical issues concerned     with modeling, pricing and risk management of a range of     fixed-income securities and structured products exposed to     default risk. Emphasis is on developing intuition and     practical skills in analyzing pricing and hedging problems.     In particular, significant attention is devoted to credit     derivatives.            We begin with discussing default mechanism and its     mathematical representation. Then we proceed to building     risky discount curves from market prices and applying this     analytics to pricing corporate bonds, asset swaps, and     credit default swaps. Risk management of credit books will     be addressed as well. We will next examine pricing and     hedging of options on assets exposed to default risk.            After that, we will discuss structural (Merton-style) models     that connect corporate debt and equity through the firm\u2019s     total asset value. Applications of this approach include the     estimation of default probability and credit spread from     equity prices and effective hedging of credit curve     exposures.            A final segment of the course will focus on credit     structured products. We start with cross-currency swaps with     a credit overlay. We will next analyze models for pricing     portfolio transactions using Merton-style approach. We also     will discuss portfolio loss model based on a transition     matrix approach. These models will then be applied to the     pricing of collateralized debt obligation tranches and     pricing counterparty credit risk taking wrong-way exposure     into account.

Thursday, 5:10-7:00, Instructor TBA.           Prerequisites : Derivative     Securities, Stochastic Calculus, and Computing in Finance     (or equivalent familiarity with financial models, stochastic     methods, and computing skills).            The course is divided into two parts. The first addresses     the fixed-income models most frequently used in the finance     industry, and their applications to the pricing and hedging     of interest-based derivatives. The second part covers the     foreign exchange derivatives markets, with a focus on     vanilla options and first-generation (flow) exotics.     Throughout both parts, the emphasis is on practical aspects     of modeling, and the significance of the models for the     valuation and risk management of widely-used derivative     instruments.

Prerequisites : Knowledge of PDE,     complex analysis, numerical methods, and experience in     programming are strongly recommended.            This course will be an introduction to several numerical     methods known as \"fast analysis-based algorithms,\" including     fast multiple methods, butterfly algorithms, hierarchical     matrix compression and fast direct solvers. These     algorithms can be used to solve many of the PDE governing     classical mathematical physics, namely electromagnetics,     acoustics, heat diffusion, and fluid dynamics. There are     additional applications in signal processing and data     analysis. Methods from potential theory, applied     analysis, functional analysis, numerical linear algebra,     complex analysis, and asymptotic analysis are central to the     construction of almost all such algorithms.            Grading will be based on a course project.                MATH-GA     2830.003 ADVANCED TOPICS IN APPLIED MATHEMATICS (Convex     Duality in Math Finance)      3 points. Fall term.

Spring term.      Monday, 1:25-3:15, C.      Fernandez-Granda .             Prerequisites : Basic knowledge of probability and     linear algebra.             In recent years, optimization-based techniques have had     a major impact in two areas of data analysis: inverse     problems and statistical estimation in high-dimensional     spaces. The main principle underlying these techniques is to     exploit nonparametric prior knowledge about the data by     solving tractable optimization problems. Some representative     examples include sparse regression analysis of genomic data,     compressed sensing in medical imaging and signal processing,     and low-rank models in recommender systems and computer     vision. This course provides an introduction to     optimization-based methods by describing the theoretical     tools used to analyze them, the computational algorithms     developed to implement them and some of their main     applications.

Tuesday, 9:00-10:50, D. Giannakis .           This course serves as an introduction to     the fundamentals of geophysical fluid dynamics. No prior     knowledge of fluid dynamics will be assumed, but the course     will move quickly into the subtopic of rapidly rotating,     stratified flows. Topics to be covered include (but are not     limited to): the advective derivative, momentum conservation     and continuity, the rotating Navier-Stokes equations and     non-dimensional parameters, equations of state and     thermodynamics of Newtonian fluids, atmospheric and oceanic     basic states, the fundamental balances (thermal wind,     geostrophic and hydrostatic), the rotating shallow water     model, vorticity and potential vorticity, inertia-gravity     waves, geostrophic adjustment, the quasi-geostrophic     approximation and other small-Rossby number limits, Rossby     waves, baroclinic and barotropic instabilities, Rayleigh and     Charney-Stern theorems, geostrophic turbulence. Students     will be assigned bi-weekly homework assignments and some     computer exercises, and will be expected to complete a final     project. This course will be supplemented with out-of-class     instruction.             Recommended Texts : Vallis, G.K. (2006).

Tuesday, 1:25-3:15, O.     Pauluis .           What effects the large scale circulation of the     atmosphere? Like the antiquated heating system of     a New York apartment, solar radiation unevenly warms the     Earth, leading to gradients in energy in both altitude and     latitude. But unlike the simple convection of air in     your drafty home, the effects of rotation, stratification, and     moisture lead to exotic variations in weather and climate,     giving us something to chat about over morning coffee... and     occasionally bringing modern life to a standstill.           The goals of this course are to describe and understand the     processes that govern atmospheric fluid flow, from the Hadley     cells of the tropical troposphere to the polar night jet of     the extratropical stratosphere, and to prepare you for     research in the climate sciences. Building on your     foundation in Geophysical Fluid Dynamics, we will explore how     stratification and rotation regulate the atmosphere's response     to gradients in heat and moisture. Much of our work will     be to explain the zonal mean circulation of the atmosphere,     but in order to accomplish this we\u2019ll need to learn a great     deal about deviations from the zonal mean: eddies and     waves. It turns out that eddies and waves, planetary,     synoptic (weather system size) and smaller in scale, are the     primary drivers of the zonal mean circulation throughout much,     if not all, of the atmosphere.           There will also be a significant numerical modeling component     to the course. You will learn how to run an atmospheric     model on NYU's High Performance Computing facility, and then     design and conduct experiments to test the theory developed in     class for a final course project.

Amidst the shouting over climate change and what action should     be taken about it, this course seeks to focus in on the     science of climate prediction. We will work our way through     the components of state-of-the-art climate models, endeavoring     to understand, or at least appreciate, the science and     approximations that lie behind predictions of future climate     change. The course will proceed in seminar format.     Participants will be expected to read background material on     climate models and complete a research oriented project,     running and/or analyzing the output from an IPCC class climate     model. No experience in climate modeling is required, but a     basic knowledge of fluid dynamics and physics will help.           Our goal is to work through the key components of a climate     model. The Earth\u2019s climate is determined by interactions     between the atmosphere, oceans, cryosphere (ice sheets,     glaciers, sea ice) and land surfaces (terrestrial hydrology,     biology, etc.). This course will be biased towards the     atmospheric component of a climate model, but we will seek to     understand how interactions between the atmosphere and the     other elements of the climate system are represented in     models.

Monday, 9:00-10:50, Y.                            Bakhtin .            To understand the behavior of a deterministic or random     dynamical system, it is often useful to find and study     stationary regimes or invariant distributions, since they     govern long-term statisticalproperties of the system. From     this point of view, existence and uniqueness of invariant     distributions and, more generally, description of all     invariant distributions along with convergence to     equilibrium become important questions that this course will     be centered around.            The course will begin with a discussion of deterministic     dynamics, then proceed to Markov processes and random     dynamics. The state space      for Markov processes will be consecutively assumed to be     finite, countable, finite dimensional, infinite dimensional,     and appropriate methods and notions will be discussed such     as compactness, Krylov--Bogolyubov method, coupling,     regularity conditions of minorization type, Doeblin and     Harris conditions, strong Feller property, Lyapunov     functions, asymptotic strong Feller property, asymptotic     coupling, one force -- one solution principle. In the end of     this course, these notions will be applied to stochastic     PDEs such as stochastic Navier--Stokes system and stochastic     Burgers equation.            Good knowledge of probability and measure theory is required     (at the level of Probability: Limit Theorems 1). No     knowledge of ergodic theory, dynamical systems, or Markov     processes will be assumed (although acquaintance with those     subjects will make the course more meaningful). A     significant amount of time in this course will be devoted to     material that may be viewed as preparatory.
