Business is the most powerful tool for transforming lives and creating value. - Dean Peter Henry                  \u201cThis is an extraordinary place,\u201d Dean Peter Henry told incoming Langone MBA students as they arrived for Langone Lab, a weekend-long orientation program for Stern\u2019s working professionals. \u201cWe\u2019re going to help you make the most out of this extraordinary environment.\u201d    As students introduced themselves to one another over breakfast and group meetings, Dean Henry encouraged them to get to know the peers who were most different from them and to take advantage of the community of outliers \u2013 the incredible students, faculty, CEOs, captains of industry and other risk-takers \u2013 who call Stern home. \u201cOne of your greatest assets in this program will be your classmates,\u201d he said, referencing the power of networking for both personal and professional fulfillment.    The intersection of personal and professional lives was one key theme of Langone Lab, beginning with a welcome address by Dean of MBA Students Conor Grennan (MBA \u201910), whose personal journey volunteering at an orphanage in post-war Nepal led to the founding of a non-governmental organization (NGO), Next Generation Nepal.    Keynote speaker Steven Fulop, Mayor of Jersey City and Langone MBA alumnus (\u201807), similarly focused on ways in which students, organizations and governments can be both socially conscious and economically friendly to improve the lives of others and support business goals at the same time. He emphasized the importance of building a strong network and skill set while at Stern as well as taking professional risks in order to follow a personal passion or help others who might otherwise be left behind. \u201cBe relentless. You will always be able to bounce back with the skills you develop here. Always.\u201d    Under the guidance of Professor Luke Williams , Executive Director of the Berkley Center for Entrepreneurship &amp; Innovation, students then transitioned to classrooms to begin collaborating on innovative solutions to their team challenge: What product or service can increase our capacity to adapt to the rapid changes in our business lives? As they prepared to tackle the task ahead and the many opportunities awaiting them during their MBA program, Dean Henry offered parting words to frame their journeys.    \u201cThe professional reasons for coming to an MBA program are only a small subset,\u201d he said. \u201cBusiness is the most powerful tool for transforming lives and creating value.\u201d                                                                                                                     News      NYU Stern Center for Business and Human Rights to Tackle Migrant Labor Rights in the Construction Industry    Foreign Policy Association Awards Medal to Dean Peter Henry    Follow @NYUStern on Twitter and like NYU Stern on Facebook         Basics      Directions &amp; Maps    Faculty Directory    Contact Us                                 FACULTY OPINIONS    Read Stern faculty opinions on  relevant business topics             Sitemap | Privacy | &copy; 2015 Leonard N.

Business is the most powerful tool for transforming lives and creating value. - Dean Peter Henry                  \u201cThis is an extraordinary place,\u201d Dean Peter Henry told incoming Langone MBA students as they arrived for Langone Lab, a weekend-long orientation program for Stern\u2019s working professionals. \u201cWe\u2019re going to help you make the most out of this extraordinary environment.\u201d    As students introduced themselves to one another over breakfast and group meetings, Dean Henry encouraged them to get to know the peers who were most different from them and to take advantage of the community of outliers \u2013 the incredible students, faculty, CEOs, captains of industry and other risk-takers \u2013 who call Stern home. \u201cOne of your greatest assets in this program will be your classmates,\u201d he said, referencing the power of networking for both personal and professional fulfillment.    The intersection of personal and professional lives was one key theme of Langone Lab, beginning with a welcome address by Dean of MBA Students Conor Grennan (MBA \u201910), whose personal journey volunteering at an orphanage in post-war Nepal led to the founding of a non-governmental organization (NGO), Next Generation Nepal.    Keynote speaker Steven Fulop, Mayor of Jersey City and Langone MBA alumnus (\u201807), similarly focused on ways in which students, organizations and governments can be both socially conscious and economically friendly to improve the lives of others and support business goals at the same time. He emphasized the importance of building a strong network and skill set while at Stern as well as taking professional risks in order to follow a personal passion or help others who might otherwise be left behind. \u201cBe relentless. You will always be able to bounce back with the skills you develop here. Always.\u201d    Under the guidance of Professor Luke Williams , Executive Director of the Berkley Center for Entrepreneurship &amp; Innovation, students then transitioned to classrooms to begin collaborating on innovative solutions to their team challenge: What product or service can increase our capacity to adapt to the rapid changes in our business lives? As they prepared to tackle the task ahead and the many opportunities awaiting them during their MBA program, Dean Henry offered parting words to frame their journeys.    \u201cThe professional reasons for coming to an MBA program are only a small subset,\u201d he said. \u201cBusiness is the most powerful tool for transforming lives and creating value.\u201d                                                                                                                     News      NYU Stern Center for Business and Human Rights to Tackle Migrant Labor Rights in the Construction Industry    Foreign Policy Association Awards Medal to Dean Peter Henry    Follow @NYUStern on Twitter and like NYU Stern on Facebook         Basics      Directions &amp; Maps    Faculty Directory    Contact Us                                 FACULTY OPINIONS    Read Stern faculty opinions on  relevant business topics             Sitemap | Privacy | &copy; 2015 Leonard N.

The possibilities of what I see myself achieving going forward has started with TRIUM as a part of my foundation.                  &ldquo;Three years ago, my close friend, TRIUM alumna Swaady Martin-Leke , urged me to consider the TRIUM program ,&rdquo; recalls TRIUM student Tina Taylor, Chief Information Officer and Chief Quality Officer for GE Lighting. &ldquo;I saw that the program offers the rare global component I was looking for, and the average age of the TRIUM cohort (40) appealed to me; it brings a higher level of conversation. I also recognized that I would be able to apply a high percentage of my classroom knowledge to my job, so the timing felt right.&rdquo; &ldquo;My colleagues at GE have been very supportive of my decision to pursue an executive MBA,&rdquo; Tina reports. &ldquo;They recognize that it&rsquo;s a personal goal that also benefits my professional life at the company. My career at GE has provided indispensable real life productive experience, and now I&rsquo;m adding the theoretical component. I&rsquo;m also gaining a global, multi-dimensional perspective.&rdquo; Tina&rsquo;s career has accelerated since joining the program: &ldquo;I was recently promoted to Chief Information Officer of GE Lighting, in addition to retaining my current responsibilities as Chief Quality Officer for GE Lighting,&rdquo; she reports. &ldquo;In my new role as CIO, I will be making sure we have the right tools in place to foster growth for the business. It&rsquo;s a nice complement to what I already do in quality and product regulatory compliance.&rdquo; She has also been appointed African American Operating Leader for GE. &ldquo;There are a lot of changes happening in both IT and the lighting industry, and it makes sense to have one position look at both the systems and our business operating processes,&rdquo; Tina describes. &ldquo;On the IT side, we&rsquo;re figuring out how to best use data and more contemporary tools to develop services for business. Meanwhile, moving to the LED has changed the manufacturing processes and the regulations we need to comply with. Everything has been impacted.&rdquo; &ldquo;The Capstone Project was another aspect that really appealed to me when I was considering the TRIUM program,&rdquo; Tina says. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not a competition with other students. You compete with yourself and push against paradigms, which is especially valuable for anyone who has been at the same company for his or her whole career or is exploring a new career.&rdquo; Tina&rsquo;s Capstone Project will be the development of an all-girls STEM education model that could be set up in Latin America, Asia, Africa, China and India. &ldquo;There are 16 million girls under the age of 18 in Asia and sub-Saharan Africa who are out of school, and addressing that is a huge challenge,&rdquo; she explains. &ldquo;My idea is to create a school for girls only &ndash; where they have few distractions &ndash; offering a STEM education. There will be a focus on math and science with a slant towards health/healthcare as many of the students I envision attending would have had limited proper healthcare. In my vision, the school would be attached to a clinic or hospital that serves the community, and the staff becomes faculty as well. This has been an ongoing passion and now I get to further explore this model, develop a business plan with a team of other talented professionals and receive coaching and guidance from some of the best professors and entrepreneurs around the world. I am looking forward to starting on the project and working with world leaders to drive change in a more sustainable way for our youth.&rdquo; Tina adds, &ldquo;I can already see how being a part of TRIUM is transforming me as a person and a global leader and thinker. The possibilities of what I see myself achieving going forward has started with TRIUM as a part of my foundation.&rdquo;                                                                                                                 News      NYU Stern Center for Business and Human Rights to Tackle Migrant Labor Rights in the Construction Industry    Foreign Policy Association Awards Medal to Dean Peter Henry    Follow @NYUStern on Twitter and like NYU Stern on Facebook         Basics      Directions &amp; Maps    Faculty Directory    Contact Us                                 FACULTY OPINIONS    Read Stern faculty opinions on  relevant business topics             Sitemap | Privacy | &copy; 2015 Leonard N.
