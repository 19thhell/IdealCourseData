A reading of Cervantes's Don Quixote that explores its privileged position as the first modern novel while also attending to the rich and complex historical context from which it emerged.    The Medieval and Renaissance Love Lyric   MEDI-UA 420 Offered periodically. 4 points.   The courtly love lyric, one of the most enduring genres of Western literature, portrayed love as an experience ranging from a degrading passion to an ennobling force, often crucial to poetic inspiration. The course traces the medieval love lyric from its beginnings in 11th-century Provencal through its developments in Latin, German, Italian, French, Spanish, Portuguese, and English. Examines how the themes and conventions of this lyric are transformed in the Renaissance by such major love poets as Petrarch, Sidney, Shakespeare, and Donne. Medieval Misogyny MEDI-UA 488 4 points. Beginning with the biblical story of creation and moving through the powerful gendered tradition established by Saint Paul, this course will look at key texts of the Western Middle Ages (in modern English translation) in which men lay down the law, and occasionally, women talk back. Among other works we will take up the letters of Abelard and Heloise, the life of the enclosed Christina of Markyate, the fictive but larger than life Wife of Bath, and the imagined feminine utopia of Christine de Pizan.    Medieval Theatre   MEDI-UA 712 Offered periodically. 4 points.   Survey of medieval theatre in Europe: the plays and their contexts in the church, courts, and carnival.

Beginning with early stories of King Arthur and the knights of the Round Table, the course focuses on masterpieces of French, English, and German medieval literature. Through the European literary tradition, students examine larger problems of the development of medieval literature: the conception of history, the rise of the romance genre, the themes of courtly love, the code of chivalry, and philosophical and theological questions as the Arthurian material is developed through the stories of the Holy Grail.    Dante and His World   MEDI-UA 801 Identical to ENGL-UA 143, ITAL-UA 160. Offered every two to three years. Ardizzone, Freccero. 4 points.

Acting Medieval Literature   MEDI-UA 868 Identical to FREN-UA 868, THEA-UT 732. Offered regularly. Vitz. 4 points.   Presents medieval literature as a set of springboards to performance rather than as a series of books to be read. In this strongly performance-oriented course, students approach this \"literature\" as works that were acted out, sung, and narrated from memory as part of a storytelling tradition. Students are invited to draw on their dramatic and musical skills and interests and stage medieval works. For their final project, students participate in staging and putting on a play, performing a substantial piece of narrative poetry, singing or playing a body of medieval songs, or choosing a similar activity. Works studied/performed include songs of the troubadours and trouveres; The Song of Roland; Chretien de Troyes's romance, Yvain; French fabliaux; and Sir Gawain and the Green Knight.

Reale (copyright 2007)                      Troubadour bound with Gold Thread of Love Manesse Codex 1310-20 (Click for Zoomable Image)                  During the eleventh century, a group of poets who were composing secular lyrics for the courtly audiences of southern France began to emerge. By the twelfth century, a tradition of such poetry was already established, and it is to that tradition we refer when we discuss troubadour poetry. Troubadour lyric was at its height during the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, and it seems to have declined in popularity during the mid-fourteenth century, possibly as a consequence of the spread of the Black Death that so decimated the European population.       Technically, the term &ldquo;troubadour&rdquo; refers to male poets from southern France who were writing in a dialect we call Proven&ccedil;al or lange d&rsquo;oc (&ldquo;oc&rdquo; is the word for &ldquo;yes&rdquo; in Proven&ccedil;al); their female counterparts are known as the trobairitz . The trobairitz were no doubt aristocratic women who may have had both responsibilities and freedoms extraordinary for the Middle Ages because their husbands and sons were absent, fighting in the Crusades. The style of trobairitz lyric is somewhat different from that of the troubadours, the former favoring directness and plainness of style, and the latter using more elaborate, metaphorical language. One of the most famous of the trobairitz was the Comtessa de Dia, who flourished in the mid-twelfth century. There were also male lyric poets who wrote for the courts in northern France, and today we call them the trouv&egrave;res ; these poets wrote in a dialect of Old French called lange d&rsquo;o&iuml;l , from which modern French descends (&ldquo;o&iuml;l&rdquo; is the word for &ldquo;yes&rdquo; in this dialect).         The terms used for the poets are themselves quite interesting because they shed light on the kind of poetry that was being composed and on its uses. All three share a common linguistic root, the verb trobar , which means both &ldquo;to find&rdquo; and &ldquo;to invent.&rdquo; The idea is, of course, that the poet is an inventor, but, beyond that, it seems that the words suggest that the audiences for the poems would be engaged in discovering meaning. It has also been suggested that the Arabic word tarrab , which means &ldquo;to sing,&rdquo; is the source of the three words that signify the poets.  The term trobar clus (&ldquo;closed form&rdquo;) referred to very highly sophisticated poetry whose style was difficult to master and meaning difficult to decipher; trobar leu (&ldquo;open form&rdquo;) is more readily apprehended by an unpracticed audience.        Troubadour poetry was meant to be heard, and was in fact set to music, probably also composed by the poet. The performers, called jongleurs (the word means both &ldquo;juggler&rdquo; and &ldquo;trickster&rdquo;; it derives from the Latin word for &ldquo;joke&rdquo; or &ldquo;jest&rdquo;), were court entertainers who might also have been jugglers and/or acrobats. Sometimes the poets performed their own works, but it was more often the case that the professional minstrels were the ones heard by the court audiences. There are about 2,500 extant troubadour lyrics, for most of which the music has been lost. Of the approximately 2,100 trobairitz poems that have survived, we do today have a considerable amount of the original music, but it should be understood that there was a very flexible relationship between music and text&mdash;a given text could be set to variant musical compositions.      It should be noted that lyric poetry was also flourishing in Germany during this period. The so-called minnesang (&ldquo;love song&rdquo;) was the court poetry of the era, and we call the poets minnes&auml;nger . Their language was Middle High German. The most popular form was the Liet (Modern German &ldquo; Lied &rdquo;), a strophic song, which means that it is built on the repetition of simple stanzas. This German form of medieval lyric is similar to the troubadour lyric, but it tends to be less highly embellished, relying in part on inherited Germanic poetic traditions. Among the most well-known of the minnes&auml;nger are Wolfram von Eschenbach and Gottfried von Strassburg, both of whom are also known for their epic verse. The former wrote the epic Parzival , and the latter Tristan . Hartmann von Aue wrote many works, including Arthurian romances.    It appears increasingly clear to scholars that troubadour lyric is deeply indebted to the poetry of the Middle East, with which Europeans had considerable contact during the period of the First Crusade (1095-99). Further, Andalusian Spain, then under Muslim rule, was a cultural melting pot, and Arabic love poetry made its mark there, later to spread its influence throughout western Europe. Poetic forms were borrowed, but perhaps more important is the fact that what we now refer to as the convention of courtly love (or fin&rsquo;amor , &ldquo;true love&rdquo;) had its origins in eastern verse forms. One important element in both Arabic love poetry and the tradition of courtly love is the overt sensuousness of the verse. In the western tradition of courtly love, a man typically declares his love for and service to a lady (this love is often adulterous), but there is rarely a realization of a love affair. Rather, the loving itself is the goal, and it serves as a purification of spirit, the mistress serving as an idol or sorts to whom the lover devotes himself and his undertakings. This type of love poetry paved the way for the lyrics Dante wrote for his beloved Beatrice and Petrarch wrote for Laura.                           Troubadour love poetry was various in form; the dawn song , also called the alba, aubade, or Tagelied , was quite popular. The subject of the poem is the separation of lovers at dawn after a night spent together, and such poems can often be fairly dramatic, involving dialogue between the two lovers. Sometimes the lover converses with a watchman, and there is often a refrain sung by the watchman, a jealous lover, or someone else who is not one of the lovers.       The canso or song is a courtly love song performed by a single voice. It is stanzaic in form, usually consisting of five or six stanzas followed by an envoi , often an address to a particular individual. The canso was a very popular form, and it was considered by many to be the epitome of the troubadour verse forms.    One example is the strophic (stanzaic) song by Bernart de Ventadorn called &ldquo; Can vei la lauzeta &rdquo; (&ldquo;When I see the Lark&rdquo;).       Another strophic troubadour song, the only one extant for which we have music and words found together in the same manuscript, is &ldquo; Kalenda Maya &rdquo; (&ldquo;The First of May&rdquo;), and it was written by Raimbaut de Vaqueiras.            An interesting form of troubadour lyric is the pastorelle (pastorela) , which involves an attempt by a knight or sometimes the poet to seduce a country girl, usually a shepherdess. Sometimes the pastorelle even involves a rape of the woman being pursued.       Others forms of love poetry include the dansa or the balata (balada, ballade) , based on dance forms, the planh or lament, and the escondig or lover&rsquo;s apology. A notable ballade called &ldquo; Dame, de qui toute ma joie vient ,&rdquo; (&ldquo;Lady, from whom all my joy comes&rdquo;) was written by Guillaume de Machaut, a mid-fourteenth-century composer.        Not all troubadour and trouv&egrave;re poetry is about love, however. Indeed, there is a variety of forms that are particularly associated with politics, such as the sirventes . The sirventes used satire to attack social ills, political figures, and even private individuals. Occasionally, a sirventes could be positive rather than negative, but it was always highly charged. In form, the sirventes is like a canso , meaning that it opens with an exordium or statement of purpose, which is followed by the main body of the lyric arranged in stanzas; this is, in turn, followed by a closing envoi or tornada (or tornata ), in essence an abbreviated stanza. The tenso and the jeu-parti (joc-partit), or partimen, are forms of debate poetry. The first of these presents a dialogue in alternating stanzas, usually about either love or an ethical topic. The jeu-parti or partimen allows for serious extended debate: it has an initial speaker who presents a problem that has two solutions. A second speaker chooses a solution to defend, and the first speaker then assumes the role of defending the remaining position.      Among the early troubadour poets, Marcabru is important. He flourished in the first half of the twelfth century and was apparently of humble birth. He wrote in the obscure trobar clus style, often moralistically denouncing courtly life and courtly love itself. A favorite theme is the distinction between false and true love.      One of the troubadours best known today is Bertran de Born, to whom Dante refers in Canto 28 of the Inferno. Bertran was born around 1140 and was a minor nobleman who participated in a revolt against the English king Henry II and his son, Richard the Lion-hearted (who was himself both a Crusader and a poet). Because this revolt was led by another of Henry&rsquo;s sons, Bertran himself and his poetry were implicated in the discord between father and son, to which Dante refers in his poem.       Arnaut Daniel, who flourished in the last two decades of the twelfth century, was also a nobleman who probably knew Bertran de Born. He was well respected for his poetic craftsmanship that involved heavy ornamentation, and he is usually credited with having invented the sestina .       Girault de Borhelh flourished at the end of the twelfth century and the beginning of the thirteenth. His poetry often dealt with moral themes, and he wrote both the trobar clus and trobar leu styles.    The Comtessa de Dia, who is sometimes referred to as Beatritz, is the best known of the trobairitz; she was a contemporary of Girault, Bertran, and Arnault. Almost nothing is known of her life, and there are five extant works by her.      Among the trouv&egrave;res was Gace Brule, who also flourished around the same time as Girault and company. He was well respected both as a poet and a knight; he served in the Third Crusade, and possibly the Fourth Crusade. The poet Marie de France, who wrote short romances called lais and fables, among other works, was possibly one of his many noble patrons.      Also from the Champagne area of France was Tibault, who lived during the first half of the thirteenth century; he was the great-grandson of Louis VII, the King of France, and Eleanor of Aquitaine. Tibault was King of Navarre, but was not thought of highly there.      Finally, Adam de la Halle, also known as &ldquo;the Hunchback,&rdquo; was another trouv&egrave;re who lived in the second half of the thirteenth century; he was well known for his plays as well as his lyric poetry. One of his plays, Jeu de Robin et Marion , deals with the legend of Robin Hood. Here's a short piece by Adam called &ldquo; Bonne Amourete ,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Good Little Love.&rdquo;                        Some Types of Troubadour Lyric     alba : The word &ldquo;alba&rdquo; means &ldquo;dawn&rdquo; in Latin, and the alba or &ldquo;dawn song&rdquo; is a lament or love song sung by a lover or lovers who must part from the beloved at the break of day. The German term for dawn song is Tagelied . Aubade is another word for the same type of lyric.     balada or balata : a song based on a dance with a repeated refrain. The modern idea of the ballad descends from this form.     canso : strophic (i.e., stanzaic ) love song sung by a single voice; usually five or six stanzas, followed by a short envoi , usually an address to a particular individual.     escondig : a lover&rsquo;s apology.     kyrielle : a religious poem in rhyming couplets or quatrains that is based on the Kyrie , a part of the Christian mass. Usually the refrain of the kyrielle is some version of the phrase &ldquo;Kyrie eleison,&rdquo; Greek for &ldquo;Lord have mercy.&rdquo;     partimen , d&eacute;bat , or jeu parti . ( joc-partit ): a form of debate poetry in which the initial speaker posits a problem with two solutions and the second speaker chooses a position, leaving the first speaker to defend the remaining position.     pastorelle, pastorela : a seduction of a country girl by a knight. The term refers to &ldquo;pastoral&rdquo; or country life; it derives from the Latin &ldquo;pastor,&rdquo; which means &ldquo;shepherd.&rdquo;    planh : a lament, usually a lover&rsquo;s. sestina : an intricate poetic form possibly invented by Arnault Daniel in the twelfth century. The basic form requires six six-line stanzas with a particular rhyme scheme: The six last words of the first stanza are repeated in subsequent stanzas, but in different line positions, and this follows from one stanza to the next. So, if we number the last words of the first stanza thus:                    1                      2                      3                      4                      5                      6 then we see the next stanza using the following end-word placement:                    6                      1                      5                      2                      4                      3    The following stanzas use this pattern, each in relation to the immediately preceding stanza.    These six stanzas are followed by a shorter verse (usually three lines) called an envoi in which all six end words are used again.      tenso : a debate between two speakers, who alternate stanzas; usually on the nature of love.
