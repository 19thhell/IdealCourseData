The course of study emphasizes exposure to new work, world music, and contemporary, global, diverse performance forms.  Teaching students the power and value of the ensemble, the young practitioners of music theatre will have their core acting, speech and movement classes together. The New Studio stresses a unified training in all skill areas essential to the performer\u2019s craft. This will equip young artists to meet the fluid demands of a progressive, diverse and global stage.  New Studio focuses on the union of rigorous physical and vocal training always connected to the manifestation of character, the clear playing of a dramatic action, and the illumination of ideas within the text, as these are the fundamentals of the actor\u2019s process. Rather than embracing and espousing a single methodology or approach, classes offer practical application of competencies required for an actor to develop a dynamic versatility that will enable them to fluidly move through a range of performance idioms. Our objective is to provide the actor with the requisite skill set necessary to sustain a lifelong career as a professional actor, at play with global audiences onstage, in the musical theatre, in the new technologies and in whatever lies beyond. Master artist/teachers working in the field at a national and international level will teach all courses.

The course of study emphasizes exposure to new work, world music, and contemporary, global, diverse performance forms.  Teaching students the power and value of the ensemble, the young practitioners of music theatre will have their core acting, speech and movement classes together. The New Studio stresses a unified training in all skill areas essential to the performer\u2019s craft. This will equip young artists to meet the fluid demands of a progressive, diverse and global stage.  New Studio focuses on the union of rigorous physical and vocal training always connected to the manifestation of character, the clear playing of a dramatic action, and the illumination of ideas within the text, as these are the fundamentals of the actor\u2019s process. Rather than embracing and espousing a single methodology or approach, classes offer practical application of competencies required for an actor to develop a dynamic versatility that will enable them to fluidly move through a range of performance idioms. Our objective is to provide the actor with the requisite skill set necessary to sustain a lifelong career as a professional actor, at play with global audiences onstage, in the musical theatre, in the new technologies and in whatever lies beyond. Master artist/teachers working in the field at a national and international level will teach all courses.
