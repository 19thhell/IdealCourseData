Our programs are unique in their focus across broad learning contexts and in the linkage between design and research (including our studio-based learning approach).    Our master's in Digital Media Design for Learning and Advanced Certificate in Digital Media Design for Learning (formerly Educational Communication and Technology) prepare students to create, use, and evaluate media and technology for learning, from software and websites, to games, video and mobile phone applications. The master's in Games for Learning prepares students to create, use and evaluate serious games for learning and social change. The PhD in Educational Communication and Technology prepares world-class scholars to theorize and study the relationship between design, media, technology, and learning in a variety of paradigms: from social science, to design, to humanistic and cultural studies.
