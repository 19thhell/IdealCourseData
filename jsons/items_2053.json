Research is central in our graduate training. Students are exposed to a broad range of knowledge in cognition and perception and they are trained to think creatively and to develop independent research careers.                   Our program spans cognition and perception, examining mental processes such as perception, attention, memory, categorization, language, emotion, development, motor control, and cognitive neuroscience. How do we identify the letter &quot;a&quot;? How do we perceive depth and shape? What representational resources are innate? How do human cultures, and individual children, go beyond innate representational capacities? How do toddlers make decisions about their world? How are explicit and implicit memories coded in the brain? How do we inhibit inappropriate responses? How are sentences understood? How are new concepts acquired? How does attention affect perception?                   Students and faculty work closely with researchers in other departments ( Neural Science , Computer Science , Linguistics , and Philosophy ). Every week there are journal club discussions and talks by leading researchers that take place within the Psychology Department, in other NYU departments, and at other nearby schools in New York City (see Events ). Ready access to researchers at several great universities and to incredible cultural resources makes New York City a great place to study perception and cognition.                  Our graduate students begin research immediately. Students benefit from interaction with their faculty advisers and the lively exchange of research ideas among students, postdocs, and faculty at weekly Cognition and Perception colloquia and brown bag talks , research seminars, journal clubs ( cognitive neuroscience , development , ... see Events ) and our annual miniconvention. As a result of this focus on research, our students publish regularly in high-impact journals and go on to become researchers at the best research universities and industrial laboratories.                               Curriculum             What follows is a brief version of our curriculum. Full details may be found in our Graduate Student Guide . Our curriculum is designed to help students master the skills required to accomplish high quality research. Within the first two years, most students have completed the bulk of our primary course requirements. We require all students to take at least four courses in core, content-based areas of the discipline such as Memory, Perception, Attention, Cognitive Development, Psycholinguistics and Cognitive Neuroscience. In addition, we require all students to take at least two courses in quantitative methods, which can be the two-semester departmental statistics sequence, or other courses in probability theory, simulation, advanced statistical methods, etc. In addition, there are advanced seminars in areas related to the research areas of the faculty and students. The course catalog and schedule are online.                  A key aspect of our program is its strength in cognitive neuroscience, which students can select as their &quot;concentration&quot;. One aspect of this is the new, on-site, research-dedicated Center for Brain Imaging that includes a 3T MRI scanner and EEG facility, and will soon include a TMS facility as well. The center is designed to allow students the training and opportunity to become experts in cognitive neuroscience. Through a combination of course work and hands-on experience, students who select this concentration will receive training in the techniques of cognitive neuroscience and will apply these techniques to their chosen research questions.                   Students join a laboratory and begin to design and carry out a research project in their first semester. They are required to write a paper based on research they have performed as well as give a talk in our annual miniconvention at the end of their first and second years. The 2nd-year paper and completion of our basic course requirements generally result in the awarding of an MA degree. We encourage students to collaborate with more than one faculty member, including doing a full laboratory rotation or two. Students may work with primary Cognition &amp; Perception faculty or with affiliates from other programs (e.g., Social Psychology) or departments (e.g., the Center for Neural Science). (See faculty listed alphabetically with a sentence about their research interests, or by area .) In their third and fourth years, PhD students are focused primarily on research.                  We consider the best experience that students can have to become productive researchers is to carry out, write up, and present their research projects. The 1st- and 2nd-year research requirements emphasize this goal. The content and methods courses are designed to provide students with the context and tools they need to produce world-class research on their own. After graduating, most of our students have gone on to research careers. (See Recent PhDs .)                                                 Support             All students accepted into our graduate program are fully funded through the Henry M. MacCracken Program. MacCracken funding is provided through a combination of teaching assistantship, research assistantship, and fellowship, in proportions to be determined. The award package typically includes a full tuition scholarship, comprehensive health insurance and a stipend. Funding is typically guaranteed for five years, although students with substantial graduate credits or a Master's degree may only be guaranteed four years of support. For current information on the Psychology Department's aid package, please see our doctoral financial aid page .                         There is a very limited supply of subsidized housing available for graduate students which is generally used for a subset of each entering class to provide them the opportunity to get settled in New York City during their first year of residence.                               Admissions             To apply for admission to the Graduate Program in Cognition &amp; Perception, you'll need the application form , which is available from the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences. Apply for admission to the Department of Psychology. In the forms there is a place where you specify the particular program in which you are interested (e.g. Cognition &amp; Perception), as well as whether you are also interested in the Developmental Concentration.                 In the application, it is requested that you supply a personal statement. You are free to include any information in that statement that you feel will help us in our admissions decision. However, as we are a research-based program, it is especially useful if you include a review of any research experience you have had (explain what was interesting about it) as well as your current research interests.                  Together with your application, the Graduate School of Arts and Science will require you to upload official transcripts of grades from other schools you have attended, both undergraduate and graduate. In addition, it is required that you take the Graduate Record Exam ( GRE ). Some of our students also submit scores from the Advanced Psychology GRE test. We place very little weight on that score, and do not encourage you to take it.      Please do NOT mail any documents (transcripts etc) to the department. Everything needs to be uploaded and submitted through the online application.             International applicants must take the TOEFL exams if English is not their first language unless they earned a Bachelor's or Master's degree at an English speaking university. Additional information of concern to international applicants is available online from the Office of Global Services .                 We recommend that you submit your application so as to arrive by December 12th.

At the core of Cognitive Science, this endeavor has emerged as a preeminent research frontier, forging links across the humanities, the social sciences and the hard sciences. Reflecting the inter-disciplinary character of this frontier, NYU\u2019s Language &amp; Mind study program is strongly integrative, drawing courses from three departments: Linguistics, Psychology and Philosophy. Human language is at the center of the Language &amp; Mind study program, but the major is broader than Linguistics; the program also incorporates Psychological experimentation techniques and Philosophical inquiry. The aim is to give students the necessary background for exploration of new perspectives for both language and the human mind.

How does attention affect perception?                   Students and faculty work closely with researchers in other departments ( Neural Science , Computer Science , Linguistics , and Philosophy ). Every week there are journal club discussions and talks by leading researchers that take place within the Psychology Department, in other NYU departments, and at other nearby schools in New York City (see Events ). Ready access to researchers at several great universities and to incredible cultural resources makes New York City a great place to study perception and cognition.                  Our graduate students begin research immediately. Students benefit from interaction with their faculty advisers and the lively exchange of research ideas among students, postdocs, and faculty at weekly Cognition and Perception colloquia and brown bag talks , research seminars, journal clubs ( cognitive neuroscience , development , ... see Events ) and our annual miniconvention. As a result of this focus on research, our students publish regularly in high-impact journals and go on to become researchers at the best research universities and industrial laboratories.                               Curriculum             What follows is a brief version of our curriculum. Full details may be found in our Graduate Student Guide . Our curriculum is designed to help students master the skills required to accomplish high quality research. Within the first two years, most students have completed the bulk of our primary course requirements. We require all students to take at least four courses in core, content-based areas of the discipline such as Memory, Perception, Attention, Cognitive Development, Psycholinguistics and Cognitive Neuroscience. In addition, we require all students to take at least two courses in quantitative methods, which can be the two-semester departmental statistics sequence, or other courses in probability theory, simulation, advanced statistical methods, etc. In addition, there are advanced seminars in areas related to the research areas of the faculty and students. The course catalog and schedule are online.                  A key aspect of our program is its strength in cognitive neuroscience, which students can select as their &quot;concentration&quot;. One aspect of this is the new, on-site, research-dedicated Center for Brain Imaging that includes a 3T MRI scanner and EEG facility, and will soon include a TMS facility as well. The center is designed to allow students the training and opportunity to become experts in cognitive neuroscience. Through a combination of course work and hands-on experience, students who select this concentration will receive training in the techniques of cognitive neuroscience and will apply these techniques to their chosen research questions.                   Students join a laboratory and begin to design and carry out a research project in their first semester. They are required to write a paper based on research they have performed as well as give a talk in our annual miniconvention at the end of their first and second years. The 2nd-year paper and completion of our basic course requirements generally result in the awarding of an MA degree. We encourage students to collaborate with more than one faculty member, including doing a full laboratory rotation or two. Students may work with primary Cognition &amp; Perception faculty or with affiliates from other programs (e.g., Social Psychology) or departments (e.g., the Center for Neural Science). (See faculty listed alphabetically with a sentence about their research interests, or by area .) In their third and fourth years, PhD students are focused primarily on research.                  We consider the best experience that students can have to become productive researchers is to carry out, write up, and present their research projects. The 1st- and 2nd-year research requirements emphasize this goal. The content and methods courses are designed to provide students with the context and tools they need to produce world-class research on their own. After graduating, most of our students have gone on to research careers. (See Recent PhDs .)                                                 Support             All students accepted into our graduate program are fully funded through the Henry M. MacCracken Program. MacCracken funding is provided through a combination of teaching assistantship, research assistantship, and fellowship, in proportions to be determined. The award package typically includes a full tuition scholarship, comprehensive health insurance and a stipend. Funding is typically guaranteed for five years, although students with substantial graduate credits or a Master's degree may only be guaranteed four years of support. For current information on the Psychology Department's aid package, please see our doctoral financial aid page .                         There is a very limited supply of subsidized housing available for graduate students which is generally used for a subset of each entering class to provide them the opportunity to get settled in New York City during their first year of residence.                               Admissions             To apply for admission to the Graduate Program in Cognition &amp; Perception, you'll need the application form , which is available from the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences. Apply for admission to the Department of Psychology. In the forms there is a place where you specify the particular program in which you are interested (e.g. Cognition &amp; Perception), as well as whether you are also interested in the Developmental Concentration.                 In the application, it is requested that you supply a personal statement. You are free to include any information in that statement that you feel will help us in our admissions decision. However, as we are a research-based program, it is especially useful if you include a review of any research experience you have had (explain what was interesting about it) as well as your current research interests.                  Together with your application, the Graduate School of Arts and Science will require you to upload official transcripts of grades from other schools you have attended, both undergraduate and graduate. In addition, it is required that you take the Graduate Record Exam ( GRE ). Some of our students also submit scores from the Advanced Psychology GRE test. We place very little weight on that score, and do not encourage you to take it.      Please do NOT mail any documents (transcripts etc) to the department. Everything needs to be uploaded and submitted through the online application.             International applicants must take the TOEFL exams if English is not their first language unless they earned a Bachelor's or Master's degree at an English speaking university. Additional information of concern to international applicants is available online from the Office of Global Services .                 We recommend that you submit your application so as to arrive by December 12th.

At the core of Cognitive Science, this endeavor has emerged as a preeminent research frontier, forging links across the humanities, the social sciences and the hard sciences. Reflecting the inter-disciplinary character of this frontier, NYU\u2019s Language &amp; Mind study program is strongly integrative, drawing courses from three departments: Linguistics, Psychology and Philosophy. Human language is at the center of the Language &amp; Mind study program, but the major is broader than Linguistics; the program also incorporates Psychological experimentation techniques and Philosophical inquiry. The aim is to give students the necessary background for exploration of new perspectives for both language and the human mind.

The name of our lab is \"computation and cognition\" which reflect the two main strands that         inform our work. Principally, we attempt to understand the nature of human cognition by         developing computational theories of human information processing. By comparing the operation         formal models and the behavior of humans, we can gain insight into the mechanisms that people         use to to solve problems and adapt their behavior. In addition, insights from these           models can inform the development of artificial systems capable of learning on their own.                                      We are particularly interested in how people learn from experience. Our research ranges         from studies of the different neural systems that contribute to         category and concept acquisition, to the interactions between categorization, memory, and         perceptual processes, to (more recently) studies of how people learn by interacting with          the world through exploration and information-search behaviors.                                      To give you a better sense of some of the basic scientific questions we are interested          in, we've highlighted below some of the main lines of work we are currently developing.          Our lab paper archive has a full list of papers         and abstracts.                                                            Our first, and in some sense primary, line of work deals with category and concept learning or how people learn          to generalize from the instances they see in the world. For example, how do young children learn which plants          belong to the category \"tree\" and which are \"flowers\"? Category learning is a critical cognitive ability which          underlies a vast array of abilities such as object recognition and language acquisition. Our research in this area          seeks a better understanding of the learning processes which support this ability and how they might be organized          or implemented in the brain. Our work in this area combines a variety of methodologies including behavioral          studies, neuro-imaging, and computational modeling.                               An example finding from our work:                               In one recent study, we looked at the influence that categories have on our perceptual abilities (Gureckis & Goldstone, 2008, in prep).         In this study we asked people to discriminate between a set of highly similar human faces. Then we taught them to assign         different subsets of the faces into categories. After learning, we again tested participant's discrimination ability.          The key finding is that, after learning, participants were less able to discriminate items that were assigned to the same         category and were better able to discrimination faces from different categories (a effect known as categorical perception).         More interestingly, we also found that the distribution of exemplars within each category also had an influence on people's         perception. Items that belonged to the same \"cluster\" of items inside a category were harder to discriminate after         learning than items that belong two different clusters within the same category. Thus, distinctions that were not         directly relevant for success in the learning task ended up influencing people's perception. We are currently following up         these studies to better understand the interplay of language, learning, and perception.

A second line of work considers how learning can be viewed as an active (or interactive) process.         Imagine a young child just beginning to learn about how the world works. Some of the time, an adult is          nearby to provide feedback or instruction, but often times the child must learn on their own by trial          and error. In some of our recent work, we've looked at how people learn effective behavioral strategies          through interacting with dynamic task environments where reward structure continually changes in response          to the actions of the individual. In contrast to approaches that treat learners as passive   observers, our goal in this work is to          develop theories of learning that can account for the active way in which we search, sample, and          explore our environment. On the computational side, this work applies the framework of          reinforcement learning (Sutton & Barto, 1998) to understand higher-level cognitive behavior and decision making.            Reinforcement learning is an agent-based approach to learning through interaction with the environment in          pursuit of goal-directed behavior. Reinforcement          learning is also a promising theoretical approach to studying higher-level human learning since it emphasizes the role of a         situated agent interacting with their environment. For example, RL models specify how learners should balance exploration          versus exploitation of resources in their environment, how they take into account delayed rewards while learning, and how          to assign credit to actions that later lead to successful outcomes.

In other words, how are categories represented in the brain, and how do different brain systems          influence what we learn? However, these efforts have tended to focus on the localization of particular          functions to particular brain regions in the absence of useful linking theories which detail how these          regions interact. One project we have been apart of over the past few years has been to consider the role          that models developed in cognitive science can play in helping to integrate these often disparate findings.          In general, we are very interested in how findings from cognitive neuroscience can constrain and improve theories of                behavior developed at the computational/behavioral level.

From the ability to move our hands         when we are typing to our ability to sequence actions of our mouths to make words,          a key aspect of human cognition is our ability to learn about event arranged in time.          However, what are the representational primitives that support such behavior? In this line of         work, we have examined how the statistical structure of the environment interacts with the          representations of the world we adopt to determine which things are easier or harder for people          to learn.
