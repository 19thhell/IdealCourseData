With this in mind, May graduates should submit the adviser-approved rationale and booklist by October 1 of their senior year.   For other students, rationale and booklist submissions will be sent out for second reader review on the first of each month. Students (and their primary advisers) can expect reviewer feedback in the second half of the month.   The academic calendar requires a few caveats to these general principles, as follows:   1. To accommodate winter break, the last day of fall classes in December is the last day to register a January colloquium, and rationale and booklist submissions after December 1 will be sent out for second review on February 1.   2. For students hoping to participate in the May graduation ceremonies, the rationale and booklist submission must be received before March 1, and the petition to march deadline of April 15 will be the last day to register a spring colloquium.   3. September graduates should submit the rationale and booklist no later than May 1 (the deadline for fall senior project proposals) so that their rationale and booklist submissions may be sent out for second review before faculty leave for the summer.            Scheduling the Colloquium   Selecting Your Committee Members     Your committee will consist of your adviser and two other NYU faculty members. Of the three committee members, one must be a full-time Gallatin faculty member. Please keep in mind that committee members should be appropriate for your colloquium topic. You may also review the Gallatin faculty list to locate a panel member for your committee. If you do not have specific requests for your committee, your Class Adviser will help you find appropriate faculty members.   Graduation Deadlines   Students should note the following deadlines for colloquium completion when making plans with their adviser and committee members. These dates represent the last day to complete the colloquium in time for specific graduation cycles:   September 2014 BA: September 19, 2014   January 2015 BA: January 13, 2015   May 2015 BA: May 15, 2015   September 2015 BA: September 25, 2015   Note that January degree candidates are strongly encouraged to schedule their colloquium before the end of the fall term, and to not plan for a colloquium during the winter recess.     Setting a Date and Time   After you submit the book list and rationale, you can proceed with the scheduling process. It is your responsibility to schedule the date and time of your colloquium with committee members. Since the scheduling process may take a few days or even longer (depending on the availability of your committee members), please start this process as soon as possible and far in advance of the colloquium registration deadline.   You should also be aware that you may encounter some difficulties in finding committee members or arranging a date for a colloquium in January or September because of the limited availability of faculty during the summer months and winter recess.     Submitting the Registration Form   Once you have selected your committee members and have scheduled a date and time, you will need to register for your colloquium . The registration form must be submitted by the deadline specified in the colloquium calendar regardless of any pending approval of the rationale and book list.     Approximately two weeks prior to your colloquium date, Gallatin will email a schedule confirmation to committee members with a room assignment, as well as a copy of your rationale and booklist.   If you have already submitted the registration form to Gallatin and you would like to change a panel member or the date and time of your colloquium, you will need to notify the Office of Advising at least two weeks prior to the date of your colloquium, and you must confirm a new date/time with all committee members.

In a sense, you have already begun getting ready for the colloquium - by taking Gallatin courses and through academic success in areas incorporated in your concentration. By the start of the junior year, you should collaborate with your primary faculty adviser to plan for the timing of your rationale and booklist development, submission for second reader review, and the colloquium.     When should I complete my colloquium?   Students are strongly encourage to complete the colloquium in the penultimate semester before graduation. This timing will allow you to do a Senior Project in your final semester, if you choose. Read through the information in the calendars and scheduling section.       How can I collaborate with my adviser to prepare for the conversation?   Your primary faculty adviser can help you to focus your interests, provide feedback on rationale drafts, recommend texts for your booklist, and discuss texts to help you prepare to orally communicate your ideas. Your adviser must approve the booklist and rationale before they are submitted for second reader review.     What kinds of texts should be included in my booklist?   Students need to devise a booklist that includes a minimum of 20 texts fulfilling four categories: Ancient, Medieval &amp; Renaissance Classics; Modernity - The Humanities; Modernity - The Social &amp; Natural Sciences; and Area of Concentration. The texts should be of high quality - the kinds of texts you encounter in your courses, but they do not have to be part of a recognized canon of great books. Avoid pop fiction, how-to manuals, self-help books, and textbooks unless you plan to engage critically with these forms. Work closely with your primary faculty adviser regarding text decisions.     When should I submit my rationale and booklist for second reader review?   Rationale and booklist submissions will be sent out for second reader review on the first of each month. Students (and their primary advisers) can expect reviewer feedback in the second half of the month. Note that we do not have review cycles in January during winter recess, and June, July, and August during summer recess.     Students are expected to complete the colloquium during the penultimate semester. With this in mind, May graduation candidates should submit the adviser-approved rationale and booklist for the October 1 review cycle.   Note the following caveats regarding rationale and booklist review cycles:   1. To accommodate winter break, rationale and booklist submissions received after December 1 will be reviewed during the February 1 review cycle.     2. For students hoping to participate in the May graduation ceremonies, the rationale and booklist submission must be received before March 1, and the petition to march deadline of April 15 will be the last day to register a spring colloquium.   3. September graduates should submit the rationale and booklist no later than May 1 so that their rationale and booklist submissions are reviewed in the May review cycle before faculty leave for the summer.     How do I submit my rationale and booklist?   Once your primary faculty adviser has approved your final drafts, please use the online rationale and booklist submission form . Upon submission, your adviser will automatically be asked to confirm his/her approval.     Can I change my booklist and rationale once they have been submitted to Gallatin and approved by the second faculty reviewer?   If you find it necessary to change one or two texts on your list, you may do so as long as your revised list still fulfills the minimum number of texts in each required category. Your primary faculty adviser must approve changes to the booklist &amp; rationale. Additionally, you will need to send your committee and the Office of Advising the revised documents. We expect your ideas to expand and change as you prepare for the colloquium. For that reason, we discourage students from making more substantial changes that would necessitate another review process and possibly delay graduation.     Can I invite my committee members?   Yes, you can select your committee members. Be mindful that your committee must fulfill certain characteristics. The committee must include your primary faculty adviser, a full-time member of the Gallatin faculty (this may be your primary faculty adviser), and everyone should have a faculty affiliation with NYU.     How do I schedule the colloquium?   Scheduling the colloquium is a multi-step process. You'll want to ensure that you have a committee meeting the composition requirements (above) available during the general time of year that you would like to hold the colloquium. For example, you can ask faculty if they are available during a given month (ex. November) or able to participate during a certain window (ex. first two weeks of the spring semester). Once everyone has agreed to a general time frame, then work with the group to find a two-hour window open in everyone's schedule. Some students use online schedulers (ex. doodle.com) to streamline the scheduling process. Once you've found a two-hour period when everyone agrees to hold your colloquium, submit a colloquium registration form . Gallatin will confirm the date, time, and location of your colloquium. As well, Gallatin will send the committee your approved rationale and booklist.   Please note that in order to accommodate winter break, the last day of fall classes in December is the last day to register a January colloquium.       Can I change the date and time of my colloquium or a panel member after I have submitted the colloquium registration form to Gallatin?   Yes, but you must notify the Office of Advising of the change at least two weeks prior to the date of the colloquium by resubmitting the colloquium registration form .     What kinds of questions will the committee ask me?   During the colloquium, your committee will ask questions that are usually broad and thematic, and you may be asked to clarify your point by providing specific examples from the texts. Generally, questions come from the content of your rationale. The committee is interested to understand your ideas and how they relate to those found in texts on your list. Work closely with your adviser to prepare for the conversation.       Will the title of colloquium be printed on my diploma or my transcript?   If you entered a colloquium title on your colloquium registration form, then your title will appear on your transcript. After your colloquium is completed, we cannot add a title or change one previously submitted. Your diploma states that you earned a Bachelor of Arts in Individualized Major.     Where will my colloquium be held? Do I need to find a room?   Depending on availability, colloquia are usually held in the colloquium room (427) or your primary faculty adviser\u2019s office. You will be notified as to the location of your colloquium in the colloquium confirmation email sent to you, your adviser, and the rest of the committee by the Office of Advising. You are not responsible for finding a location.       How should I explain the colloquium to a potential committee member?   Each year Gallatin enjoys including faculty from across the university in the colloquium requirement. If you are inviting a member of the faculty who has not participated in a colloquium previously, be prepared to tell them about the colloquium and your specific focus.   You can send a potential committee member the following description of the event and the expectations for his/her participation: &quot;The Gallatin colloquium provides an opportunity to explore ways of integrating a student's academic, professional, and intellectual odyssey through conversation with the adviser and two other members of the NYU community. The discussion will be supported with the ideas and themes from texts that have been significant to the student's undergraduate education. The colloquium should be viewed as a student-driven conversation, not a defense, allowing space to reflect on the student's time at Gallatin.   Committee members should read the student's rationale and booklist, which come attached to the colloquium registration confirmation sent by the Office of Advising in advance of the colloquium, and come prepared with a few questions or points of conversation. Committee members are not required to have read all of the texts on the booklist. Two hours should be set aside for this event.&quot;   If your potential committee member has additional questions, you may put him/her in touch with the Senior Class Adviser.     What happens if I fail the colloquium?   If your colloquium needs to be repeated, you will have one more opportunity to pass the requirement. Your committee will make specific recommendations to help you prepare for the reprisal. The Senior Class Adviser will provide you with information about next steps should this situation arise.     I still have questions regarding the colloquium, what should I do?   After reading the colloquium-related sections of the Gallatin website, speak with your primary faculty adviser.

This is meant to recognize the significant amount of work and time that students and advisers spend preparing for successful colloquia. Registration for \u201cColloquium\u201d (COLLQ-UG, 2 units) is recommended but not required for students admitted prior to summer 2015. For incoming first-year students and transfer students admitted summer 2015 and later, the colloquium credit will be required.   Awarding two units for the colloquium provides the necessary time in a student\u2019s schedule to prepare for the colloquium. Students will have the flexibility to register for \u201cColloquium\u201d (COLLQ-UG, 2 units) on top of a conventional 16-unit course load without going over the 18-unit semester maximum, or they might opt to include the two units in a part-time schedule. All students who enroll in \u201cColloquium\u201d (COLLQ-UG, 2 units) will receive credit for the work of preparing for the colloquium in the semester in which they expect to sit for the colloquium.                                                    Registering for \u201cColloquium\u201d (COLLQ-UG, 2 units)                               Students should register for \u201cColloquium\u201d (COLLQ-UG, 2 units) in the semester when they expect to sit for the colloquium. The \u201cColloquium\u201d (COLLQ-UG, 2 units) will appear on the Course Search in Albert, and students should add this to the Plan of Study form that will be submitted to their adviser for registration approval. Once the Plan of Study is approved by the adviser, students will be issued a permission number for \u201cColloquium\u201d (COLLQ-UG, 2 units) to register on Albert in the same way as they register for courses. \u201cColloquium\u201d (COLLQ-UG, 2 units) will appear on the transcript along with any other registered courses in the semester.   \u201cColloquium\u201d (COLLQ-UG, 2 units) is not repeatable for credit. If a registered student delays the colloquium until a future semester, the student will receive an incomplete grade and should not register a second time for \u201cColloquium\u201d (COLLQ-UG, 2 units). Instead, the student will carry the incomplete grade until he or she takes the colloquium in a future semester, or unless the student withdraws (see Grading below for information about withdrawn students).                                                                Contact Hours Between Adviser and Student                               Registration for the two-unit \u201cColloquium\u201d comes with the expectation that students will work with their primary academic adviser for at least 3.5 hours over the course of the semester in which they plan to sit for the colloquium.                                                              Grading                               The final grades for \u201cColloquium\u201d (COLLQ-UG, 2 units) will be coordinated and submitted by the Office of Advising. The \u201cColloquium\u201d (COLLQ-UG, 2 units) will appear on the transcript and will be graded Pass/Fail (P/F) as follows:     Students who pass the colloquium will receive a grade of P on the transcript for the \u201cColloquium\u201d (COLLQ-UG, 2-units).   A student who does not pass the colloquium, will receive a grade of I (incomplete) on the transcript for the \u201cColloquium\u201d (COLLQ-UG, 2-units), which will remain until the student takes the colloquium a second time. If the student passes on the second attempt, a grade of P will be submitted for the \u201cColloquium\u201d (COLLQ-UG, 2-units). If a student fails the colloquium two times, a grade of F will be submitted for \u201cColloquium\u201d (COLLQ-UG, 2-units), and the student will be dismissed from the School.   If a student withdraws from Gallatin with an incomplete grade (I) for \u201cColloquium\u201d (COLLQ-UG, 2 units), the I will be changed to a final grade of W for \u201cwithdrawn.\u201d Withdrawn students who receive a grade of W for \u201cColloquium\u201d (COLLQ-UG, 2-units) and who are readmitted to Gallatin must re-register in a future semester for \u201cColloquium\u201d (COLLQ-UG, 2-units).   A student who does not take the colloquium in the semester in which he or she registers for \u201cColloquium\u201d (COLLQ-UG, 2 units), will receive a grade of I (incomplete) on the transcript for the \u201cColloquium\u201d (COLLQ-UG, 2-units), which will remain until the student takes the colloquium in a future semester, or unless the student withdraws.                                    top of page                                                                        NYU Gallatin Footer              Gallatin School of Individualized Study     1 Washington Place     New York, NY 10003     (212) 998-7370                   A&#8211;Z Index      Directions      Contact Us      Job Opportunities               News      Support Gallatin      Feedback                         Follow us on Facebook      Follow us on Twitter      Follow us on Youtube         Follow us Instagram                 Unless otherwise noted, all content copyright NYU Gallatin.

With this in mind, May graduates should submit the adviser-approved rationale and booklist by October 1 of their senior year.   For other students, rationale and booklist submissions will be sent out for second reader review on the first of each month. Students (and their primary advisers) can expect reviewer feedback in the second half of the month.   The academic calendar requires a few caveats to these general principles, as follows:   1. To accommodate winter break, the last day of fall classes in December is the last day to register a January colloquium, and rationale and booklist submissions after December 1 will be sent out for second review on February 1.   2. For students hoping to participate in the May graduation ceremonies, the rationale and booklist submission must be received before March 1, and the petition to march deadline of April 15 will be the last day to register a spring colloquium.   3. September graduates should submit the rationale and booklist no later than May 1 (the deadline for fall senior project proposals) so that their rationale and booklist submissions may be sent out for second review before faculty leave for the summer.            Scheduling the Colloquium   Selecting Your Committee Members     Your committee will consist of your adviser and two other NYU faculty members. Of the three committee members, one must be a full-time Gallatin faculty member. Please keep in mind that committee members should be appropriate for your colloquium topic. You may also review the Gallatin faculty list to locate a panel member for your committee. If you do not have specific requests for your committee, your Class Adviser will help you find appropriate faculty members.   Graduation Deadlines   Students should note the following deadlines for colloquium completion when making plans with their adviser and committee members. These dates represent the last day to complete the colloquium in time for specific graduation cycles:   September 2014 BA: September 19, 2014   January 2015 BA: January 13, 2015   May 2015 BA: May 15, 2015   September 2015 BA: September 25, 2015   Note that January degree candidates are strongly encouraged to schedule their colloquium before the end of the fall term, and to not plan for a colloquium during the winter recess.     Setting a Date and Time   After you submit the book list and rationale, you can proceed with the scheduling process. It is your responsibility to schedule the date and time of your colloquium with committee members. Since the scheduling process may take a few days or even longer (depending on the availability of your committee members), please start this process as soon as possible and far in advance of the colloquium registration deadline.   You should also be aware that you may encounter some difficulties in finding committee members or arranging a date for a colloquium in January or September because of the limited availability of faculty during the summer months and winter recess.     Submitting the Registration Form   Once you have selected your committee members and have scheduled a date and time, you will need to register for your colloquium . The registration form must be submitted by the deadline specified in the colloquium calendar regardless of any pending approval of the rationale and book list.     Approximately two weeks prior to your colloquium date, Gallatin will email a schedule confirmation to committee members with a room assignment, as well as a copy of your rationale and booklist.   If you have already submitted the registration form to Gallatin and you would like to change a panel member or the date and time of your colloquium, you will need to notify the Office of Advising at least two weeks prior to the date of your colloquium, and you must confirm a new date/time with all committee members.

In a sense, you have already begun getting ready for the colloquium - by taking Gallatin courses and through academic success in areas incorporated in your concentration. By the start of the junior year, you should collaborate with your primary faculty adviser to plan for the timing of your rationale and booklist development, submission for second reader review, and the colloquium.     When should I complete my colloquium?   Students are strongly encourage to complete the colloquium in the penultimate semester before graduation. This timing will allow you to do a Senior Project in your final semester, if you choose. Read through the information in the calendars and scheduling section.       How can I collaborate with my adviser to prepare for the conversation?   Your primary faculty adviser can help you to focus your interests, provide feedback on rationale drafts, recommend texts for your booklist, and discuss texts to help you prepare to orally communicate your ideas. Your adviser must approve the booklist and rationale before they are submitted for second reader review.     What kinds of texts should be included in my booklist?   Students need to devise a booklist that includes a minimum of 20 texts fulfilling four categories: Ancient, Medieval &amp; Renaissance Classics; Modernity - The Humanities; Modernity - The Social &amp; Natural Sciences; and Area of Concentration. The texts should be of high quality - the kinds of texts you encounter in your courses, but they do not have to be part of a recognized canon of great books. Avoid pop fiction, how-to manuals, self-help books, and textbooks unless you plan to engage critically with these forms. Work closely with your primary faculty adviser regarding text decisions.     When should I submit my rationale and booklist for second reader review?   Rationale and booklist submissions will be sent out for second reader review on the first of each month. Students (and their primary advisers) can expect reviewer feedback in the second half of the month. Note that we do not have review cycles in January during winter recess, and June, July, and August during summer recess.     Students are expected to complete the colloquium during the penultimate semester. With this in mind, May graduation candidates should submit the adviser-approved rationale and booklist for the October 1 review cycle.   Note the following caveats regarding rationale and booklist review cycles:   1. To accommodate winter break, rationale and booklist submissions received after December 1 will be reviewed during the February 1 review cycle.     2. For students hoping to participate in the May graduation ceremonies, the rationale and booklist submission must be received before March 1, and the petition to march deadline of April 15 will be the last day to register a spring colloquium.   3. September graduates should submit the rationale and booklist no later than May 1 so that their rationale and booklist submissions are reviewed in the May review cycle before faculty leave for the summer.     How do I submit my rationale and booklist?   Once your primary faculty adviser has approved your final drafts, please use the online rationale and booklist submission form . Upon submission, your adviser will automatically be asked to confirm his/her approval.     Can I change my booklist and rationale once they have been submitted to Gallatin and approved by the second faculty reviewer?   If you find it necessary to change one or two texts on your list, you may do so as long as your revised list still fulfills the minimum number of texts in each required category. Your primary faculty adviser must approve changes to the booklist &amp; rationale. Additionally, you will need to send your committee and the Office of Advising the revised documents. We expect your ideas to expand and change as you prepare for the colloquium. For that reason, we discourage students from making more substantial changes that would necessitate another review process and possibly delay graduation.     Can I invite my committee members?   Yes, you can select your committee members. Be mindful that your committee must fulfill certain characteristics. The committee must include your primary faculty adviser, a full-time member of the Gallatin faculty (this may be your primary faculty adviser), and everyone should have a faculty affiliation with NYU.     How do I schedule the colloquium?   Scheduling the colloquium is a multi-step process. You'll want to ensure that you have a committee meeting the composition requirements (above) available during the general time of year that you would like to hold the colloquium. For example, you can ask faculty if they are available during a given month (ex. November) or able to participate during a certain window (ex. first two weeks of the spring semester). Once everyone has agreed to a general time frame, then work with the group to find a two-hour window open in everyone's schedule. Some students use online schedulers (ex. doodle.com) to streamline the scheduling process. Once you've found a two-hour period when everyone agrees to hold your colloquium, submit a colloquium registration form . Gallatin will confirm the date, time, and location of your colloquium. As well, Gallatin will send the committee your approved rationale and booklist.   Please note that in order to accommodate winter break, the last day of fall classes in December is the last day to register a January colloquium.       Can I change the date and time of my colloquium or a panel member after I have submitted the colloquium registration form to Gallatin?   Yes, but you must notify the Office of Advising of the change at least two weeks prior to the date of the colloquium by resubmitting the colloquium registration form .     What kinds of questions will the committee ask me?   During the colloquium, your committee will ask questions that are usually broad and thematic, and you may be asked to clarify your point by providing specific examples from the texts. Generally, questions come from the content of your rationale. The committee is interested to understand your ideas and how they relate to those found in texts on your list. Work closely with your adviser to prepare for the conversation.       Will the title of colloquium be printed on my diploma or my transcript?   If you entered a colloquium title on your colloquium registration form, then your title will appear on your transcript. After your colloquium is completed, we cannot add a title or change one previously submitted. Your diploma states that you earned a Bachelor of Arts in Individualized Major.     Where will my colloquium be held? Do I need to find a room?   Depending on availability, colloquia are usually held in the colloquium room (427) or your primary faculty adviser\u2019s office. You will be notified as to the location of your colloquium in the colloquium confirmation email sent to you, your adviser, and the rest of the committee by the Office of Advising. You are not responsible for finding a location.       How should I explain the colloquium to a potential committee member?   Each year Gallatin enjoys including faculty from across the university in the colloquium requirement. If you are inviting a member of the faculty who has not participated in a colloquium previously, be prepared to tell them about the colloquium and your specific focus.   You can send a potential committee member the following description of the event and the expectations for his/her participation: &quot;The Gallatin colloquium provides an opportunity to explore ways of integrating a student's academic, professional, and intellectual odyssey through conversation with the adviser and two other members of the NYU community. The discussion will be supported with the ideas and themes from texts that have been significant to the student's undergraduate education. The colloquium should be viewed as a student-driven conversation, not a defense, allowing space to reflect on the student's time at Gallatin.   Committee members should read the student's rationale and booklist, which come attached to the colloquium registration confirmation sent by the Office of Advising in advance of the colloquium, and come prepared with a few questions or points of conversation. Committee members are not required to have read all of the texts on the booklist. Two hours should be set aside for this event.&quot;   If your potential committee member has additional questions, you may put him/her in touch with the Senior Class Adviser.     What happens if I fail the colloquium?   If your colloquium needs to be repeated, you will have one more opportunity to pass the requirement. Your committee will make specific recommendations to help you prepare for the reprisal. The Senior Class Adviser will provide you with information about next steps should this situation arise.     I still have questions regarding the colloquium, what should I do?   After reading the colloquium-related sections of the Gallatin website, speak with your primary faculty adviser. You can also be in touch with the Senior Class Advise r.                      top of page                           Quick Links                 Rationale and Booklist Submission Form Colloquium Registration Form                                                                                      NYU Gallatin Footer              Gallatin School of Individualized Study     1 Washington Place     New York, NY 10003     (212) 998-7370                   A&#8211;Z Index      Directions      Contact Us      Job Opportunities               News      Support Gallatin      Feedback                         Follow us on Facebook      Follow us on Twitter      Follow us on Youtube         Follow us Instagram                 Unless otherwise noted, all content copyright NYU Gallatin.

This is meant to recognize the significant amount of work and time that students and advisers spend preparing for successful colloquia. Registration for \u201cColloquium\u201d (COLLQ-UG, 2 units) is recommended but not required for students admitted prior to summer 2015. For incoming first-year students and transfer students admitted summer 2015 and later, the colloquium credit will be required.   Awarding two units for the colloquium provides the necessary time in a student\u2019s schedule to prepare for the colloquium. Students will have the flexibility to register for \u201cColloquium\u201d (COLLQ-UG, 2 units) on top of a conventional 16-unit course load without going over the 18-unit semester maximum, or they might opt to include the two units in a part-time schedule. All students who enroll in \u201cColloquium\u201d (COLLQ-UG, 2 units) will receive credit for the work of preparing for the colloquium in the semester in which they expect to sit for the colloquium.                                                    Registering for \u201cColloquium\u201d (COLLQ-UG, 2 units)                               Students should register for \u201cColloquium\u201d (COLLQ-UG, 2 units) in the semester when they expect to sit for the colloquium. The \u201cColloquium\u201d (COLLQ-UG, 2 units) will appear on the Course Search in Albert, and students should add this to the Plan of Study form that will be submitted to their adviser for registration approval. Once the Plan of Study is approved by the adviser, students will be issued a permission number for \u201cColloquium\u201d (COLLQ-UG, 2 units) to register on Albert in the same way as they register for courses. \u201cColloquium\u201d (COLLQ-UG, 2 units) will appear on the transcript along with any other registered courses in the semester.   \u201cColloquium\u201d (COLLQ-UG, 2 units) is not repeatable for credit. If a registered student delays the colloquium until a future semester, the student will receive an incomplete grade and should not register a second time for \u201cColloquium\u201d (COLLQ-UG, 2 units). Instead, the student will carry the incomplete grade until he or she takes the colloquium in a future semester, or unless the student withdraws (see Grading below for information about withdrawn students).                                                                Contact Hours Between Adviser and Student                               Registration for the two-unit \u201cColloquium\u201d comes with the expectation that students will work with their primary academic adviser for at least 3.5 hours over the course of the semester in which they plan to sit for the colloquium.                                                              Grading                               The final grades for \u201cColloquium\u201d (COLLQ-UG, 2 units) will be coordinated and submitted by the Office of Advising. The \u201cColloquium\u201d (COLLQ-UG, 2 units) will appear on the transcript and will be graded Pass/Fail (P/F) as follows:     Students who pass the colloquium will receive a grade of P on the transcript for the \u201cColloquium\u201d (COLLQ-UG, 2-units).   A student who does not pass the colloquium, will receive a grade of I (incomplete) on the transcript for the \u201cColloquium\u201d (COLLQ-UG, 2-units), which will remain until the student takes the colloquium a second time. If the student passes on the second attempt, a grade of P will be submitted for the \u201cColloquium\u201d (COLLQ-UG, 2-units). If a student fails the colloquium two times, a grade of F will be submitted for \u201cColloquium\u201d (COLLQ-UG, 2-units), and the student will be dismissed from the School.   If a student withdraws from Gallatin with an incomplete grade (I) for \u201cColloquium\u201d (COLLQ-UG, 2 units), the I will be changed to a final grade of W for \u201cwithdrawn.\u201d Withdrawn students who receive a grade of W for \u201cColloquium\u201d (COLLQ-UG, 2-units) and who are readmitted to Gallatin must re-register in a future semester for \u201cColloquium\u201d (COLLQ-UG, 2-units).   A student who does not take the colloquium in the semester in which he or she registers for \u201cColloquium\u201d (COLLQ-UG, 2 units), will receive a grade of I (incomplete) on the transcript for the \u201cColloquium\u201d (COLLQ-UG, 2-units), which will remain until the student takes the colloquium in a future semester, or unless the student withdraws.                                    top of page                                                                        NYU Gallatin Footer              Gallatin School of Individualized Study     1 Washington Place     New York, NY 10003     (212) 998-7370                   A&#8211;Z Index      Directions      Contact Us      Job Opportunities               News      Support Gallatin      Feedback                         Follow us on Facebook      Follow us on Twitter      Follow us on Youtube         Follow us Instagram                 Unless otherwise noted, all content copyright NYU Gallatin.

In a sense, you have already begun getting ready for the colloquium - by taking Gallatin courses and through academic success in areas incorporated in your concentration. By the start of the junior year, you should collaborate with your primary faculty adviser to plan for the timing of your rationale and booklist development, submission for second reader review, and the colloquium.     When should I complete my colloquium?   Students are strongly encourage to complete the colloquium in the penultimate semester before graduation. This timing will allow you to do a Senior Project in your final semester, if you choose. Read through the information in the calendars and scheduling section.       How can I collaborate with my adviser to prepare for the conversation?   Your primary faculty adviser can help you to focus your interests, provide feedback on rationale drafts, recommend texts for your booklist, and discuss texts to help you prepare to orally communicate your ideas. Your adviser must approve the booklist and rationale before they are submitted for second reader review.     What kinds of texts should be included in my booklist?   Students need to devise a booklist that includes a minimum of 20 texts fulfilling four categories: Ancient, Medieval &amp; Renaissance Classics; Modernity - The Humanities; Modernity - The Social &amp; Natural Sciences; and Area of Concentration. The texts should be of high quality - the kinds of texts you encounter in your courses, but they do not have to be part of a recognized canon of great books. Avoid pop fiction, how-to manuals, self-help books, and textbooks unless you plan to engage critically with these forms. Work closely with your primary faculty adviser regarding text decisions.     When should I submit my rationale and booklist for second reader review?   Rationale and booklist submissions will be sent out for second reader review on the first of each month. Students (and their primary advisers) can expect reviewer feedback in the second half of the month. Note that we do not have review cycles in January during winter recess, and June, July, and August during summer recess.     Students are expected to complete the colloquium during the penultimate semester. With this in mind, May graduation candidates should submit the adviser-approved rationale and booklist for the October 1 review cycle.   Note the following caveats regarding rationale and booklist review cycles:   1. To accommodate winter break, rationale and booklist submissions received after December 1 will be reviewed during the February 1 review cycle.     2. For students hoping to participate in the May graduation ceremonies, the rationale and booklist submission must be received before March 1, and the petition to march deadline of April 15 will be the last day to register a spring colloquium.   3. September graduates should submit the rationale and booklist no later than May 1 so that their rationale and booklist submissions are reviewed in the May review cycle before faculty leave for the summer.     How do I submit my rationale and booklist?   Once your primary faculty adviser has approved your final drafts, please use the online rationale and booklist submission form . Upon submission, your adviser will automatically be asked to confirm his/her approval.     Can I change my booklist and rationale once they have been submitted to Gallatin and approved by the second faculty reviewer?   If you find it necessary to change one or two texts on your list, you may do so as long as your revised list still fulfills the minimum number of texts in each required category. Your primary faculty adviser must approve changes to the booklist &amp; rationale. Additionally, you will need to send your committee and the Office of Advising the revised documents. We expect your ideas to expand and change as you prepare for the colloquium. For that reason, we discourage students from making more substantial changes that would necessitate another review process and possibly delay graduation.     Can I invite my committee members?   Yes, you can select your committee members. Be mindful that your committee must fulfill certain characteristics. The committee must include your primary faculty adviser, a full-time member of the Gallatin faculty (this may be your primary faculty adviser), and everyone should have a faculty affiliation with NYU.     How do I schedule the colloquium?   Scheduling the colloquium is a multi-step process. You'll want to ensure that you have a committee meeting the composition requirements (above) available during the general time of year that you would like to hold the colloquium. For example, you can ask faculty if they are available during a given month (ex. November) or able to participate during a certain window (ex. first two weeks of the spring semester). Once everyone has agreed to a general time frame, then work with the group to find a two-hour window open in everyone's schedule. Some students use online schedulers (ex. doodle.com) to streamline the scheduling process. Once you've found a two-hour period when everyone agrees to hold your colloquium, submit a colloquium registration form . Gallatin will confirm the date, time, and location of your colloquium. As well, Gallatin will send the committee your approved rationale and booklist.   Please note that in order to accommodate winter break, the last day of fall classes in December is the last day to register a January colloquium.       Can I change the date and time of my colloquium or a panel member after I have submitted the colloquium registration form to Gallatin?   Yes, but you must notify the Office of Advising of the change at least two weeks prior to the date of the colloquium by resubmitting the colloquium registration form .     What kinds of questions will the committee ask me?   During the colloquium, your committee will ask questions that are usually broad and thematic, and you may be asked to clarify your point by providing specific examples from the texts. Generally, questions come from the content of your rationale. The committee is interested to understand your ideas and how they relate to those found in texts on your list. Work closely with your adviser to prepare for the conversation.       Will the title of colloquium be printed on my diploma or my transcript?   If you entered a colloquium title on your colloquium registration form, then your title will appear on your transcript. After your colloquium is completed, we cannot add a title or change one previously submitted. Your diploma states that you earned a Bachelor of Arts in Individualized Major.     Where will my colloquium be held? Do I need to find a room?   Depending on availability, colloquia are usually held in the colloquium room (427) or your primary faculty adviser\u2019s office. You will be notified as to the location of your colloquium in the colloquium confirmation email sent to you, your adviser, and the rest of the committee by the Office of Advising. You are not responsible for finding a location.       How should I explain the colloquium to a potential committee member?   Each year Gallatin enjoys including faculty from across the university in the colloquium requirement. If you are inviting a member of the faculty who has not participated in a colloquium previously, be prepared to tell them about the colloquium and your specific focus.   You can send a potential committee member the following description of the event and the expectations for his/her participation: &quot;The Gallatin colloquium provides an opportunity to explore ways of integrating a student's academic, professional, and intellectual odyssey through conversation with the adviser and two other members of the NYU community. The discussion will be supported with the ideas and themes from texts that have been significant to the student's undergraduate education. The colloquium should be viewed as a student-driven conversation, not a defense, allowing space to reflect on the student's time at Gallatin.   Committee members should read the student's rationale and booklist, which come attached to the colloquium registration confirmation sent by the Office of Advising in advance of the colloquium, and come prepared with a few questions or points of conversation. Committee members are not required to have read all of the texts on the booklist. Two hours should be set aside for this event.&quot;   If your potential committee member has additional questions, you may put him/her in touch with the Senior Class Adviser.     What happens if I fail the colloquium?   If your colloquium needs to be repeated, you will have one more opportunity to pass the requirement.

In a sense, you have already begun getting ready for the colloquium - by taking Gallatin courses and through academic success in areas incorporated in your concentration. By the start of the junior year, you should collaborate with your primary faculty adviser to plan for the timing of your rationale and booklist development, submission for second reader review, and the colloquium.     When should I complete my colloquium?   Students are strongly encourage to complete the colloquium in the penultimate semester before graduation. This timing will allow you to do a Senior Project in your final semester, if you choose. Read through the information in the calendars and scheduling section.       How can I collaborate with my adviser to prepare for the conversation?   Your primary faculty adviser can help you to focus your interests, provide feedback on rationale drafts, recommend texts for your booklist, and discuss texts to help you prepare to orally communicate your ideas. Your adviser must approve the booklist and rationale before they are submitted for second reader review.     What kinds of texts should be included in my booklist?   Students need to devise a booklist that includes a minimum of 20 texts fulfilling four categories: Ancient, Medieval &amp; Renaissance Classics; Modernity - The Humanities; Modernity - The Social &amp; Natural Sciences; and Area of Concentration. The texts should be of high quality - the kinds of texts you encounter in your courses, but they do not have to be part of a recognized canon of great books. Avoid pop fiction, how-to manuals, self-help books, and textbooks unless you plan to engage critically with these forms. Work closely with your primary faculty adviser regarding text decisions.     When should I submit my rationale and booklist for second reader review?   Rationale and booklist submissions will be sent out for second reader review on the first of each month. Students (and their primary advisers) can expect reviewer feedback in the second half of the month. Note that we do not have review cycles in January during winter recess, and June, July, and August during summer recess.     Students are expected to complete the colloquium during the penultimate semester. With this in mind, May graduation candidates should submit the adviser-approved rationale and booklist for the October 1 review cycle.   Note the following caveats regarding rationale and booklist review cycles:   1. To accommodate winter break, rationale and booklist submissions received after December 1 will be reviewed during the February 1 review cycle.     2. For students hoping to participate in the May graduation ceremonies, the rationale and booklist submission must be received before March 1, and the petition to march deadline of April 15 will be the last day to register a spring colloquium.   3. September graduates should submit the rationale and booklist no later than May 1 so that their rationale and booklist submissions are reviewed in the May review cycle before faculty leave for the summer.     How do I submit my rationale and booklist?   Once your primary faculty adviser has approved your final drafts, please use the online rationale and booklist submission form . Upon submission, your adviser will automatically be asked to confirm his/her approval.     Can I change my booklist and rationale once they have been submitted to Gallatin and approved by the second faculty reviewer?   If you find it necessary to change one or two texts on your list, you may do so as long as your revised list still fulfills the minimum number of texts in each required category. Your primary faculty adviser must approve changes to the booklist &amp; rationale. Additionally, you will need to send your committee and the Office of Advising the revised documents. We expect your ideas to expand and change as you prepare for the colloquium. For that reason, we discourage students from making more substantial changes that would necessitate another review process and possibly delay graduation.     Can I invite my committee members?   Yes, you can select your committee members. Be mindful that your committee must fulfill certain characteristics. The committee must include your primary faculty adviser, a full-time member of the Gallatin faculty (this may be your primary faculty adviser), and everyone should have a faculty affiliation with NYU.     How do I schedule the colloquium?   Scheduling the colloquium is a multi-step process. You'll want to ensure that you have a committee meeting the composition requirements (above) available during the general time of year that you would like to hold the colloquium. For example, you can ask faculty if they are available during a given month (ex. November) or able to participate during a certain window (ex. first two weeks of the spring semester). Once everyone has agreed to a general time frame, then work with the group to find a two-hour window open in everyone's schedule. Some students use online schedulers (ex. doodle.com) to streamline the scheduling process. Once you've found a two-hour period when everyone agrees to hold your colloquium, submit a colloquium registration form . Gallatin will confirm the date, time, and location of your colloquium. As well, Gallatin will send the committee your approved rationale and booklist.   Please note that in order to accommodate winter break, the last day of fall classes in December is the last day to register a January colloquium.       Can I change the date and time of my colloquium or a panel member after I have submitted the colloquium registration form to Gallatin?   Yes, but you must notify the Office of Advising of the change at least two weeks prior to the date of the colloquium by resubmitting the colloquium registration form .     What kinds of questions will the committee ask me?   During the colloquium, your committee will ask questions that are usually broad and thematic, and you may be asked to clarify your point by providing specific examples from the texts. Generally, questions come from the content of your rationale. The committee is interested to understand your ideas and how they relate to those found in texts on your list. Work closely with your adviser to prepare for the conversation.       Will the title of colloquium be printed on my diploma or my transcript?   If you entered a colloquium title on your colloquium registration form, then your title will appear on your transcript. After your colloquium is completed, we cannot add a title or change one previously submitted. Your diploma states that you earned a Bachelor of Arts in Individualized Major.     Where will my colloquium be held? Do I need to find a room?   Depending on availability, colloquia are usually held in the colloquium room (427) or your primary faculty adviser\u2019s office. You will be notified as to the location of your colloquium in the colloquium confirmation email sent to you, your adviser, and the rest of the committee by the Office of Advising. You are not responsible for finding a location.       How should I explain the colloquium to a potential committee member?   Each year Gallatin enjoys including faculty from across the university in the colloquium requirement. If you are inviting a member of the faculty who has not participated in a colloquium previously, be prepared to tell them about the colloquium and your specific focus.   You can send a potential committee member the following description of the event and the expectations for his/her participation: &quot;The Gallatin colloquium provides an opportunity to explore ways of integrating a student's academic, professional, and intellectual odyssey through conversation with the adviser and two other members of the NYU community. The discussion will be supported with the ideas and themes from texts that have been significant to the student's undergraduate education. The colloquium should be viewed as a student-driven conversation, not a defense, allowing space to reflect on the student's time at Gallatin.   Committee members should read the student's rationale and booklist, which come attached to the colloquium registration confirmation sent by the Office of Advising in advance of the colloquium, and come prepared with a few questions or points of conversation. Committee members are not required to have read all of the texts on the booklist. Two hours should be set aside for this event.&quot;   If your potential committee member has additional questions, you may put him/her in touch with the Senior Class Adviser.     What happens if I fail the colloquium?   If your colloquium needs to be repeated, you will have one more opportunity to pass the requirement. Your committee will make specific recommendations to help you prepare for the reprisal. The Senior Class Adviser will provide you with information about next steps should this situation arise.     I still have questions regarding the colloquium, what should I do?   After reading the colloquium-related sections of the Gallatin website, speak with your primary faculty adviser.

This is meant to recognize the significant amount of work and time that students and advisers spend preparing for successful colloquia. Registration for \u201cColloquium\u201d (COLLQ-UG, 2 units) is recommended but not required for students admitted prior to summer 2015. For incoming first-year students and transfer students admitted summer 2015 and later, the colloquium credit will be required.   Awarding two units for the colloquium provides the necessary time in a student\u2019s schedule to prepare for the colloquium. Students will have the flexibility to register for \u201cColloquium\u201d (COLLQ-UG, 2 units) on top of a conventional 16-unit course load without going over the 18-unit semester maximum, or they might opt to include the two units in a part-time schedule. All students who enroll in \u201cColloquium\u201d (COLLQ-UG, 2 units) will receive credit for the work of preparing for the colloquium in the semester in which they expect to sit for the colloquium.                                                    Registering for \u201cColloquium\u201d (COLLQ-UG, 2 units)                               Students should register for \u201cColloquium\u201d (COLLQ-UG, 2 units) in the semester when they expect to sit for the colloquium. The \u201cColloquium\u201d (COLLQ-UG, 2 units) will appear on the Course Search in Albert, and students should add this to the Plan of Study form that will be submitted to their adviser for registration approval. Once the Plan of Study is approved by the adviser, students will be issued a permission number for \u201cColloquium\u201d (COLLQ-UG, 2 units) to register on Albert in the same way as they register for courses. \u201cColloquium\u201d (COLLQ-UG, 2 units) will appear on the transcript along with any other registered courses in the semester.   \u201cColloquium\u201d (COLLQ-UG, 2 units) is not repeatable for credit. If a registered student delays the colloquium until a future semester, the student will receive an incomplete grade and should not register a second time for \u201cColloquium\u201d (COLLQ-UG, 2 units). Instead, the student will carry the incomplete grade until he or she takes the colloquium in a future semester, or unless the student withdraws (see Grading below for information about withdrawn students).                                                                Contact Hours Between Adviser and Student                               Registration for the two-unit \u201cColloquium\u201d comes with the expectation that students will work with their primary academic adviser for at least 3.5 hours over the course of the semester in which they plan to sit for the colloquium.                                                              Grading                               The final grades for \u201cColloquium\u201d (COLLQ-UG, 2 units) will be coordinated and submitted by the Office of Advising. The \u201cColloquium\u201d (COLLQ-UG, 2 units) will appear on the transcript and will be graded Pass/Fail (P/F) as follows:     Students who pass the colloquium will receive a grade of P on the transcript for the \u201cColloquium\u201d (COLLQ-UG, 2-units).   A student who does not pass the colloquium, will receive a grade of I (incomplete) on the transcript for the \u201cColloquium\u201d (COLLQ-UG, 2-units), which will remain until the student takes the colloquium a second time. If the student passes on the second attempt, a grade of P will be submitted for the \u201cColloquium\u201d (COLLQ-UG, 2-units). If a student fails the colloquium two times, a grade of F will be submitted for \u201cColloquium\u201d (COLLQ-UG, 2-units), and the student will be dismissed from the School.   If a student withdraws from Gallatin with an incomplete grade (I) for \u201cColloquium\u201d (COLLQ-UG, 2 units), the I will be changed to a final grade of W for \u201cwithdrawn.\u201d Withdrawn students who receive a grade of W for \u201cColloquium\u201d (COLLQ-UG, 2-units) and who are readmitted to Gallatin must re-register in a future semester for \u201cColloquium\u201d (COLLQ-UG, 2-units).   A student who does not take the colloquium in the semester in which he or she registers for \u201cColloquium\u201d (COLLQ-UG, 2 units), will receive a grade of I (incomplete) on the transcript for the \u201cColloquium\u201d (COLLQ-UG, 2-units), which will remain until the student takes the colloquium in a future semester, or unless the student withdraws.                                    top of page                                                                        NYU Gallatin Footer              Gallatin School of Individualized Study     1 Washington Place     New York, NY 10003     (212) 998-7370                   A&#8211;Z Index      Directions      Contact Us      Job Opportunities               News      Support Gallatin      Feedback                         Follow us on Facebook      Follow us on Twitter      Follow us on Youtube         Follow us Instagram                 Unless otherwise noted, all content copyright NYU Gallatin.

With this in mind, May graduates should submit the adviser-approved rationale and booklist by October 1 of their senior year.   For other students, rationale and booklist submissions will be sent out for second reader review on the first of each month. Students (and their primary advisers) can expect reviewer feedback in the second half of the month.   The academic calendar requires a few caveats to these general principles, as follows:   1. To accommodate winter break, the last day of fall classes in December is the last day to register a January colloquium, and rationale and booklist submissions after December 1 will be sent out for second review on February 1.   2. For students hoping to participate in the May graduation ceremonies, the rationale and booklist submission must be received before March 1, and the petition to march deadline of April 15 will be the last day to register a spring colloquium.   3. September graduates should submit the rationale and booklist no later than May 1 (the deadline for fall senior project proposals) so that their rationale and booklist submissions may be sent out for second review before faculty leave for the summer.            Scheduling the Colloquium   Selecting Your Committee Members     Your committee will consist of your adviser and two other NYU faculty members. Of the three committee members, one must be a full-time Gallatin faculty member. Please keep in mind that committee members should be appropriate for your colloquium topic. You may also review the Gallatin faculty list to locate a panel member for your committee. If you do not have specific requests for your committee, your Class Adviser will help you find appropriate faculty members.   Graduation Deadlines   Students should note the following deadlines for colloquium completion when making plans with their adviser and committee members. These dates represent the last day to complete the colloquium in time for specific graduation cycles:   September 2014 BA: September 19, 2014   January 2015 BA: January 13, 2015   May 2015 BA: May 15, 2015   September 2015 BA: September 25, 2015   Note that January degree candidates are strongly encouraged to schedule their colloquium before the end of the fall term, and to not plan for a colloquium during the winter recess.     Setting a Date and Time   After you submit the book list and rationale, you can proceed with the scheduling process. It is your responsibility to schedule the date and time of your colloquium with committee members. Since the scheduling process may take a few days or even longer (depending on the availability of your committee members), please start this process as soon as possible and far in advance of the colloquium registration deadline.   You should also be aware that you may encounter some difficulties in finding committee members or arranging a date for a colloquium in January or September because of the limited availability of faculty during the summer months and winter recess.     Submitting the Registration Form   Once you have selected your committee members and have scheduled a date and time, you will need to register for your colloquium . The registration form must be submitted by the deadline specified in the colloquium calendar regardless of any pending approval of the rationale and book list.     Approximately two weeks prior to your colloquium date, Gallatin will email a schedule confirmation to committee members with a room assignment, as well as a copy of your rationale and booklist.   If you have already submitted the registration form to Gallatin and you would like to change a panel member or the date and time of your colloquium, you will need to notify the Office of Advising at least two weeks prior to the date of your colloquium, and you must confirm a new date/time with all committee members.

In a sense, you have already begun getting ready for the colloquium - by taking Gallatin courses and through academic success in areas incorporated in your concentration. By the start of the junior year, you should collaborate with your primary faculty adviser to plan for the timing of your rationale and booklist development, submission for second reader review, and the colloquium.     When should I complete my colloquium?   Students are strongly encourage to complete the colloquium in the penultimate semester before graduation. This timing will allow you to do a Senior Project in your final semester, if you choose. Read through the information in the calendars and scheduling section.       How can I collaborate with my adviser to prepare for the conversation?   Your primary faculty adviser can help you to focus your interests, provide feedback on rationale drafts, recommend texts for your booklist, and discuss texts to help you prepare to orally communicate your ideas. Your adviser must approve the booklist and rationale before they are submitted for second reader review.     What kinds of texts should be included in my booklist?   Students need to devise a booklist that includes a minimum of 20 texts fulfilling four categories: Ancient, Medieval &amp; Renaissance Classics; Modernity - The Humanities; Modernity - The Social &amp; Natural Sciences; and Area of Concentration. The texts should be of high quality - the kinds of texts you encounter in your courses, but they do not have to be part of a recognized canon of great books. Avoid pop fiction, how-to manuals, self-help books, and textbooks unless you plan to engage critically with these forms. Work closely with your primary faculty adviser regarding text decisions.     When should I submit my rationale and booklist for second reader review?   Rationale and booklist submissions will be sent out for second reader review on the first of each month. Students (and their primary advisers) can expect reviewer feedback in the second half of the month. Note that we do not have review cycles in January during winter recess, and June, July, and August during summer recess.     Students are expected to complete the colloquium during the penultimate semester. With this in mind, May graduation candidates should submit the adviser-approved rationale and booklist for the October 1 review cycle.   Note the following caveats regarding rationale and booklist review cycles:   1. To accommodate winter break, rationale and booklist submissions received after December 1 will be reviewed during the February 1 review cycle.     2. For students hoping to participate in the May graduation ceremonies, the rationale and booklist submission must be received before March 1, and the petition to march deadline of April 15 will be the last day to register a spring colloquium.   3. September graduates should submit the rationale and booklist no later than May 1 so that their rationale and booklist submissions are reviewed in the May review cycle before faculty leave for the summer.     How do I submit my rationale and booklist?   Once your primary faculty adviser has approved your final drafts, please use the online rationale and booklist submission form . Upon submission, your adviser will automatically be asked to confirm his/her approval.     Can I change my booklist and rationale once they have been submitted to Gallatin and approved by the second faculty reviewer?   If you find it necessary to change one or two texts on your list, you may do so as long as your revised list still fulfills the minimum number of texts in each required category. Your primary faculty adviser must approve changes to the booklist &amp; rationale. Additionally, you will need to send your committee and the Office of Advising the revised documents. We expect your ideas to expand and change as you prepare for the colloquium. For that reason, we discourage students from making more substantial changes that would necessitate another review process and possibly delay graduation.     Can I invite my committee members?   Yes, you can select your committee members. Be mindful that your committee must fulfill certain characteristics. The committee must include your primary faculty adviser, a full-time member of the Gallatin faculty (this may be your primary faculty adviser), and everyone should have a faculty affiliation with NYU.     How do I schedule the colloquium?   Scheduling the colloquium is a multi-step process. You'll want to ensure that you have a committee meeting the composition requirements (above) available during the general time of year that you would like to hold the colloquium. For example, you can ask faculty if they are available during a given month (ex. November) or able to participate during a certain window (ex. first two weeks of the spring semester). Once everyone has agreed to a general time frame, then work with the group to find a two-hour window open in everyone's schedule. Some students use online schedulers (ex. doodle.com) to streamline the scheduling process. Once you've found a two-hour period when everyone agrees to hold your colloquium, submit a colloquium registration form . Gallatin will confirm the date, time, and location of your colloquium. As well, Gallatin will send the committee your approved rationale and booklist.   Please note that in order to accommodate winter break, the last day of fall classes in December is the last day to register a January colloquium.       Can I change the date and time of my colloquium or a panel member after I have submitted the colloquium registration form to Gallatin?   Yes, but you must notify the Office of Advising of the change at least two weeks prior to the date of the colloquium by resubmitting the colloquium registration form .     What kinds of questions will the committee ask me?   During the colloquium, your committee will ask questions that are usually broad and thematic, and you may be asked to clarify your point by providing specific examples from the texts. Generally, questions come from the content of your rationale. The committee is interested to understand your ideas and how they relate to those found in texts on your list. Work closely with your adviser to prepare for the conversation.       Will the title of colloquium be printed on my diploma or my transcript?   If you entered a colloquium title on your colloquium registration form, then your title will appear on your transcript. After your colloquium is completed, we cannot add a title or change one previously submitted. Your diploma states that you earned a Bachelor of Arts in Individualized Major.     Where will my colloquium be held? Do I need to find a room?   Depending on availability, colloquia are usually held in the colloquium room (427) or your primary faculty adviser\u2019s office. You will be notified as to the location of your colloquium in the colloquium confirmation email sent to you, your adviser, and the rest of the committee by the Office of Advising. You are not responsible for finding a location.       How should I explain the colloquium to a potential committee member?   Each year Gallatin enjoys including faculty from across the university in the colloquium requirement. If you are inviting a member of the faculty who has not participated in a colloquium previously, be prepared to tell them about the colloquium and your specific focus.   You can send a potential committee member the following description of the event and the expectations for his/her participation: &quot;The Gallatin colloquium provides an opportunity to explore ways of integrating a student's academic, professional, and intellectual odyssey through conversation with the adviser and two other members of the NYU community. The discussion will be supported with the ideas and themes from texts that have been significant to the student's undergraduate education. The colloquium should be viewed as a student-driven conversation, not a defense, allowing space to reflect on the student's time at Gallatin.   Committee members should read the student's rationale and booklist, which come attached to the colloquium registration confirmation sent by the Office of Advising in advance of the colloquium, and come prepared with a few questions or points of conversation. Committee members are not required to have read all of the texts on the booklist. Two hours should be set aside for this event.&quot;   If your potential committee member has additional questions, you may put him/her in touch with the Senior Class Adviser.     What happens if I fail the colloquium?   If your colloquium needs to be repeated, you will have one more opportunity to pass the requirement. Your committee will make specific recommendations to help you prepare for the reprisal. The Senior Class Adviser will provide you with information about next steps should this situation arise.     I still have questions regarding the colloquium, what should I do?   After reading the colloquium-related sections of the Gallatin website, speak with your primary faculty adviser. You can also be in touch with the Senior Class Advise r.                      top of page                           Quick Links                 Rationale and Booklist Submission Form Colloquium Registration Form                                                                                      NYU Gallatin Footer              Gallatin School of Individualized Study     1 Washington Place     New York, NY 10003     (212) 998-7370                   A&#8211;Z Index      Directions      Contact Us      Job Opportunities               News      Support Gallatin      Feedback                         Follow us on Facebook      Follow us on Twitter      Follow us on Youtube         Follow us Instagram                 Unless otherwise noted, all content copyright NYU Gallatin.

This is meant to recognize the significant amount of work and time that students and advisers spend preparing for successful colloquia. Registration for \u201cColloquium\u201d (COLLQ-UG, 2 units) is recommended but not required for students admitted prior to summer 2015. For incoming first-year students and transfer students admitted summer 2015 and later, the colloquium credit will be required.   Awarding two units for the colloquium provides the necessary time in a student\u2019s schedule to prepare for the colloquium. Students will have the flexibility to register for \u201cColloquium\u201d (COLLQ-UG, 2 units) on top of a conventional 16-unit course load without going over the 18-unit semester maximum, or they might opt to include the two units in a part-time schedule. All students who enroll in \u201cColloquium\u201d (COLLQ-UG, 2 units) will receive credit for the work of preparing for the colloquium in the semester in which they expect to sit for the colloquium.                                                    Registering for \u201cColloquium\u201d (COLLQ-UG, 2 units)                               Students should register for \u201cColloquium\u201d (COLLQ-UG, 2 units) in the semester when they expect to sit for the colloquium. The \u201cColloquium\u201d (COLLQ-UG, 2 units) will appear on the Course Search in Albert, and students should add this to the Plan of Study form that will be submitted to their adviser for registration approval. Once the Plan of Study is approved by the adviser, students will be issued a permission number for \u201cColloquium\u201d (COLLQ-UG, 2 units) to register on Albert in the same way as they register for courses. \u201cColloquium\u201d (COLLQ-UG, 2 units) will appear on the transcript along with any other registered courses in the semester.   \u201cColloquium\u201d (COLLQ-UG, 2 units) is not repeatable for credit. If a registered student delays the colloquium until a future semester, the student will receive an incomplete grade and should not register a second time for \u201cColloquium\u201d (COLLQ-UG, 2 units). Instead, the student will carry the incomplete grade until he or she takes the colloquium in a future semester, or unless the student withdraws (see Grading below for information about withdrawn students).                                                                Contact Hours Between Adviser and Student                               Registration for the two-unit \u201cColloquium\u201d comes with the expectation that students will work with their primary academic adviser for at least 3.5 hours over the course of the semester in which they plan to sit for the colloquium.                                                              Grading                               The final grades for \u201cColloquium\u201d (COLLQ-UG, 2 units) will be coordinated and submitted by the Office of Advising. The \u201cColloquium\u201d (COLLQ-UG, 2 units) will appear on the transcript and will be graded Pass/Fail (P/F) as follows:     Students who pass the colloquium will receive a grade of P on the transcript for the \u201cColloquium\u201d (COLLQ-UG, 2-units).   A student who does not pass the colloquium, will receive a grade of I (incomplete) on the transcript for the \u201cColloquium\u201d (COLLQ-UG, 2-units), which will remain until the student takes the colloquium a second time. If the student passes on the second attempt, a grade of P will be submitted for the \u201cColloquium\u201d (COLLQ-UG, 2-units). If a student fails the colloquium two times, a grade of F will be submitted for \u201cColloquium\u201d (COLLQ-UG, 2-units), and the student will be dismissed from the School.   If a student withdraws from Gallatin with an incomplete grade (I) for \u201cColloquium\u201d (COLLQ-UG, 2 units), the I will be changed to a final grade of W for \u201cwithdrawn.\u201d Withdrawn students who receive a grade of W for \u201cColloquium\u201d (COLLQ-UG, 2-units) and who are readmitted to Gallatin must re-register in a future semester for \u201cColloquium\u201d (COLLQ-UG, 2-units).   A student who does not take the colloquium in the semester in which he or she registers for \u201cColloquium\u201d (COLLQ-UG, 2 units), will receive a grade of I (incomplete) on the transcript for the \u201cColloquium\u201d (COLLQ-UG, 2-units), which will remain until the student takes the colloquium in a future semester, or unless the student withdraws.                                    top of page                                                                        NYU Gallatin Footer              Gallatin School of Individualized Study     1 Washington Place     New York, NY 10003     (212) 998-7370                   A&#8211;Z Index      Directions      Contact Us      Job Opportunities               News      Support Gallatin      Feedback                         Follow us on Facebook      Follow us on Twitter      Follow us on Youtube         Follow us Instagram                 Unless otherwise noted, all content copyright NYU Gallatin.

With this in mind, May graduates should submit the adviser-approved rationale and booklist by October 1 of their senior year.   For other students, rationale and booklist submissions will be sent out for second reader review on the first of each month. Students (and their primary advisers) can expect reviewer feedback in the second half of the month.   The academic calendar requires a few caveats to these general principles, as follows:   1. To accommodate winter break, the last day of fall classes in December is the last day to register a January colloquium, and rationale and booklist submissions after December 1 will be sent out for second review on February 1.   2. For students hoping to participate in the May graduation ceremonies, the rationale and booklist submission must be received before March 1, and the petition to march deadline of April 15 will be the last day to register a spring colloquium.   3. September graduates should submit the rationale and booklist no later than May 1 (the deadline for fall senior project proposals) so that their rationale and booklist submissions may be sent out for second review before faculty leave for the summer.            Scheduling the Colloquium   Selecting Your Committee Members     Your committee will consist of your adviser and two other NYU faculty members. Of the three committee members, one must be a full-time Gallatin faculty member. Please keep in mind that committee members should be appropriate for your colloquium topic. You may also review the Gallatin faculty list to locate a panel member for your committee. If you do not have specific requests for your committee, your Class Adviser will help you find appropriate faculty members.   Graduation Deadlines   Students should note the following deadlines for colloquium completion when making plans with their adviser and committee members. These dates represent the last day to complete the colloquium in time for specific graduation cycles:   September 2014 BA: September 19, 2014   January 2015 BA: January 13, 2015   May 2015 BA: May 15, 2015   September 2015 BA: September 25, 2015   Note that January degree candidates are strongly encouraged to schedule their colloquium before the end of the fall term, and to not plan for a colloquium during the winter recess.     Setting a Date and Time   After you submit the book list and rationale, you can proceed with the scheduling process. It is your responsibility to schedule the date and time of your colloquium with committee members. Since the scheduling process may take a few days or even longer (depending on the availability of your committee members), please start this process as soon as possible and far in advance of the colloquium registration deadline.   You should also be aware that you may encounter some difficulties in finding committee members or arranging a date for a colloquium in January or September because of the limited availability of faculty during the summer months and winter recess.     Submitting the Registration Form   Once you have selected your committee members and have scheduled a date and time, you will need to register for your colloquium . The registration form must be submitted by the deadline specified in the colloquium calendar regardless of any pending approval of the rationale and book list.     Approximately two weeks prior to your colloquium date, Gallatin will email a schedule confirmation to committee members with a room assignment, as well as a copy of your rationale and booklist.   If you have already submitted the registration form to Gallatin and you would like to change a panel member or the date and time of your colloquium, you will need to notify the Office of Advising at least two weeks prior to the date of your colloquium, and you must confirm a new date/time with all committee members.
