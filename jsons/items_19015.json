However, given the rising significance of black cinema studies within the broader areas of African American and African Diaspora studies in the US, Europe and Africa, the production of knowledge, scholarship contributing and resource materials have lagged behind. Even though the documentary genre has continued to flourish after such breakthrough productions as Blackside\u2019s series: \u201cEyes on the Prize,\u201d by contrast, since the release of Spike Lee\u2019s \u201cBamboozled\u201d (2000), black independent cinema has dwindled to the point of near extinction. Simultaneously, in mainstream commercial cinema, black actors, the likes of Halle Berry, Denzel Washington, Samuel Jackson, Don Cheadle, Chris Tucker, Jamie Fox, Will Smith, and Forrest Whitaker, have achieved unprecedented levels of stardom, breaking through many of Hollywood\u2019s discriminatory barriers. After exploring the historical foundations of African American cinema, the conference would mainly focus on films produced in the last decade which have not been exposed to critical analysis; pay some attention to television productions like \u201cThe Wire;\u201d and theorize on the future of black American cinema, \u201cpost-racial\u201d or otherwise. The contributors will be asked to address: What ever happened to \u201cthe new black film wave\u201d in the 21st Century? How do we define and critically interrogate black American cinema? How does one, now, describe the black audience, the black market, and theorize black spectatorship? In addition to films, directors and actors, other areas of inquiry will include: the discussion of black stardom and its relationship to the dominant star/celebrity industry, the \u201ccrossover\u201d effect, black directors and the relevance of the \u201cmainstream vs. independence,\u201d and the debate on black and mainstream cinemas\u2019 shifting representations of gender and sexuality. Located in one of the world's most culturally diverse cities and itself a major intellectual, cultural and media center, New York University is well positioned to host this conference. The University's Institute of African American Affairs has worked since 1969 to enhance the curriculum and to enrich the intellectual life of the academic and general community. With the establishment in 1993 of the African Studies Program, NYU broke new ground by establishing an interdisciplinary model for Black Studies in the United States, with a focus on Pan-Africanism and the urban experience. Africana Studies at New York University is an interdisciplinary undertaking devoted to scholarship on the histories, political and cultural movements, institutions, economies and identities of Africans and the African diaspora across the globe. Goals : A critical, scholarly description of black American cinema remains an important complex endeavor. A new look at black cinema would be relevant and contribute to interrogating recent trends in independent as well as mainstream films, and also examine the complexities of black American cinema, such as its history, race and representation, class and color, black masculinity, gender and sexuality, the star system and black celebrities, and prospects for an independent black cinema. This is a much-needed comprehensive conference. By reviewing the criticism and contemporary theory, as told by its most influential critics, scholars, teachers and producers we would re-evaluate the history, as well as provide new definitions and contribute to its critical language.
