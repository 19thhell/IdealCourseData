All beginning graduate students are required to register in their first Fall semester for BIOM-DN 2001, \u201cIntroduction to Research\u201d (2 credits), and BIOM-DN 1000, \u201cPrinciples of Biomaterials Science\u201d (3 credits). For Introduction to Research there are two requirements for obtaining a grade of P (Pass) on this course: (1) Satisfactory attendance and participation in the course and (2) Submission of a research protocol (not necessarily the thesis protocol).   Also mentioned above, during the first year, the student must secure a faculty mentor from within the department who has formally agreed to supervise the thesis research or independent project. Upon approval by the Biomaterials and Biomimetics Department Chairman, a Co-mentor from another department in the University may be assigned to advise the student.   Thesis research protocol.&amp;nbsp;The thesis proposal (protocol) for the completion of original research must be: (1) approved by the mentor and the Department Chair, (2) filed with the Director of Graduate Studies and the Laboratory Manager, and (3) presented and approved at a department research meeting. The student must have received a grade of P in the Introduction to Research in Biomaterials course.   The plan of study and the thesis research are formulated in consultation with the faculty mentor(s). The thesis must represent original, independent research in a significant area of biomaterials and biomimetics at a level comparable to research published in recognized journals or as professional monographs. When the thesis is completed and has been approved by the mentor(s) and by a research advisory committee (readers) assigned by the Director of Graduate Studies, the candidate defends the results of the research before a faculty committee. No more than twelve months should lapse between the approved proposal and the thesis defense. Exceptions requiring time extension must be approved by the Chair of the Department of Biomaterials and Biomimetics or program director.   Non-thesis option. The nature of the independent project in Biomaterials must be developed in consultation with a faculty mentor and approved by the director of graduate studies.                                                              Special Program                               Special Program Emphasis may be arranged by the Department Chair or program director for students desiring to participate in a Special Emphasis research study (e.g. concentration in another department of the University, but still related to Biomaterials and Biomimetics (physics, chemistry, biology, etc.). Students working with a Special Program Emphasis may, in consultation with the Director of Graduate Studies, be required to take courses in addition to the 36 points mentioned above.                                                              Departmental Meetings and Seminars                               Mandatory attendance is required of all graduate students to periodic departmental seminars and/or research group meetings and various sessions of Laboratory Safety (see section \u201cRequirements for Participation in Research\u201d). At these seminars and research group meetings, students, faculty and scholars from other institutions discuss their research plans and findings. In addition, the department may co-sponsor special seminars throughout the year for which attendance is also mandatory unless specifically excused by the Director of Graduate Studies.
