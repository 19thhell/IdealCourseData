That tradition continues with the low-residency MFA Writers Workshop in Paris, which offers students the opportunity to develop their craft under the guidance of internationally-acclaimed faculty\u2014including Chris Adrian, Catherine Barnett, Mark Doty, Nathan Englander, John Freeman, Myla Goldberg, Aleksandar Hemon, Katie Kitamura, Meghan O'Rourke, Matthew Rohrer, Helen Schulman, Zadie Smith, Darin Strauss, and Colson Whitehead \u2014while writing and studying in one of the world's most inspiring literary capitals. Recent visiting writers and editors include  Charles   Bock , Olena Kalytiak Davis , Lydia Davis , Geoff Dyer , Percival Everett, Marilyn Hacker, Matthea Harvey ,   Edward Hirsch , Marie Howe , Leslie Jamison , Hari Kunzru , Nick Laird, Ben Lerner, David Lipsky, Dinaw Mengestu, Julie Orringer, Claudia Rankine, Danzy Senna, Brenda Shaughnessy ,     Charles Simic ,  Tracy K. Smith, Craig Morgan Teicher ,  Michael Wiegers, and Rachel Zucker, among many others .      PROGRAM FORMAT     The MFA Writers Workshop in Paris constitutes an intimate creative apprenticeship that extends beyond traditional classroom walls.    Over two years, students and faculty convene regularly in Paris for five intensive ten-day residency periods (held biannually in January and July). While in residency in Paris, students participate in a vibrant community engaged in all aspects of the literary arts, including workshops, craft talks, lectures, individual conferences and manuscript consultations, as well as a diverse series of  readings, special events and professional development panels. The city of Paris itself\u2014with its literary history and rich cultural attractions\u2014provides an ideal opportunity for students to learn the art and craft of writing, immerse themselves in the creative process, and live the writer\u2019s life.    During the intervals between residencies, students pursue focused courses of study, completing reading and writing assignments under the close supervision of individual faculty members. These ongoing dialogues with faculty are tailored to specific student interests and needs; students are mentored by a different professor each term and work closely with four different writers during the two-year program.     Unlike the traditional MFA, the low-residency program offers both freedom and rigor, balancing the intense and stimulating community of each residency and the sustained solitary work completed in the intervals between. Students are expected to complete substantial writing and reading assignments  each term, regularly submitting packets of work in exchange for detailed feedback and critique. Graduating students leave the program with four new literary mentors and a portfolio of letters written by acclaimed writers in response to their work.    DEGREE REQUIREMENTS                          In order to receive the MFA, students must attend five residencies, successfully complete 32 credits of coursework, and submit a creative project of at least 75 pages of fiction or 25 pages of poetry. This project consists of a substantial piece of writing\u2013 a novel, a collection of short stories, or a group of poems\u2013 submitted before the final residency. The project requires the approval of the student's faculty advisor and the program director.

That tradition continues with the low-residency MFA Writers Workshop in Paris, which offers students the opportunity to develop their craft under the guidance of internationally-acclaimed faculty\u2014including Chris Adrian, Catherine Barnett, Mark Doty, Nathan Englander, John Freeman, Myla Goldberg, Aleksandar Hemon, Katie Kitamura, Meghan O'Rourke, Matthew Rohrer, Helen Schulman, Zadie Smith, Darin Strauss, and Colson Whitehead \u2014while writing and studying in one of the world's most inspiring literary capitals. Recent visiting writers and editors include  Charles   Bock , Olena Kalytiak Davis , Lydia Davis , Geoff Dyer , Percival Everett, Marilyn Hacker, Matthea Harvey ,   Edward Hirsch , Marie Howe , Leslie Jamison , Hari Kunzru , Nick Laird, Ben Lerner, David Lipsky, Dinaw Mengestu, Julie Orringer, Claudia Rankine, Danzy Senna, Brenda Shaughnessy ,     Charles Simic ,  Tracy K. Smith, Craig Morgan Teicher ,  Michael Wiegers, and Rachel Zucker, among many others .      PROGRAM FORMAT     The MFA Writers Workshop in Paris constitutes an intimate creative apprenticeship that extends beyond traditional classroom walls.    Over two years, students and faculty convene regularly in Paris for five intensive ten-day residency periods (held biannually in January and July). While in residency in Paris, students participate in a vibrant community engaged in all aspects of the literary arts, including workshops, craft talks, lectures, individual conferences and manuscript consultations, as well as a diverse series of  readings, special events and professional development panels. The city of Paris itself\u2014with its literary history and rich cultural attractions\u2014provides an ideal opportunity for students to learn the art and craft of writing, immerse themselves in the creative process, and live the writer\u2019s life.    During the intervals between residencies, students pursue focused courses of study, completing reading and writing assignments under the close supervision of individual faculty members. These ongoing dialogues with faculty are tailored to specific student interests and needs; students are mentored by a different professor each term and work closely with four different writers during the two-year program.     Unlike the traditional MFA, the low-residency program offers both freedom and rigor, balancing the intense and stimulating community of each residency and the sustained solitary work completed in the intervals between. Students are expected to complete substantial writing and reading assignments  each term, regularly submitting packets of work in exchange for detailed feedback and critique. Graduating students leave the program with four new literary mentors and a portfolio of letters written by acclaimed writers in response to their work.    DEGREE REQUIREMENTS                          In order to receive the MFA, students must attend five residencies, successfully complete 32 credits of coursework, and submit a creative project of at least 75 pages of fiction or 25 pages of poetry. This project consists of a substantial piece of writing\u2013 a novel, a collection of short stories, or a group of poems\u2013 submitted before the final residency. The project requires the approval of the student's faculty advisor and the program director.
