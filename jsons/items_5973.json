Genomics is the study of all genes in the human genome and their interactions with the environment as well as various psychosocial and cultural influences. Genetics and genomics have been recognized as important components of the scientific foundation of health care. This course will focus on developing genetic and genomic competencies from an interdisciplinary perspective. Content will focus on new ways of thinking about health and disease in relation to genetics and genomics, including the associated ethical, social, legal, cultural, political, and professional implications for health care. The impact of genetics and genomics on health promotion, disease prevention, risk reduction, treatment, and nursing responsibilities will be discussed.
