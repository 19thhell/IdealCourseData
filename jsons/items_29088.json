Its drive to push the      boundaries of what it means to be a 21st century research institution,      grounded on the principles of invention, innovation, and      entrepreneurship, has and will continue to lead to new strides. The      addition of the School of Engineering to the robust academic offerings      at NYU will aid in the creation of a more enlightened community that      is literate and technologically savvy at the same time.                                             \u201c We create new knowledge for the future and turn it into       wisdom through experience.
