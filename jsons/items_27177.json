The course of study emphasizes exposure to new work, world music, and contemporary, global, diverse performance forms.  Teaching students the power and value of the ensemble, the young practitioners of music theatre will have their core acting, speech and movement classes together. The New Studio stresses a unified training in all skill areas essential to the performer\u2019s craft. This will equip young artists to meet the fluid demands of a progressive, diverse and global stage.  New Studio focuses on the union of rigorous physical and vocal training always connected to the manifestation of character, the clear playing of a dramatic action, and the illumination of ideas within the text, as these are the fundamentals of the actor\u2019s process. Rather than embracing and espousing a single methodology or approach, classes offer practical application of competencies required for an actor to develop a dynamic versatility that will enable them to fluidly move through a range of performance idioms. Our objective is to provide the actor with the requisite skill set necessary to sustain a lifelong career as a professional actor, at play with global audiences onstage, in the musical theatre, in the new technologies and in whatever lies beyond.

The degree requirements for a BFA in Drama include a minimum of three years of professional training, but many choose to continue beyond that. Professional training is deeply intertwined with a substantial academic curriculum throughout your entire career here at NYU. There are two phases of professional training in the Drama department: a primary training phase and an advanced training phase. The primary training phase occurs in your first two years and gives students a strong foundation in the skills needed to proceed onto an advanced level of training. Upon acceptance into the department, students are placed into one of seven different primary training studios where they begin intensive conservatory training towards a strong foundation in technique. Students remain in their primary training studio for four consecutive semesters to complete a progressive curriculum. Each semester builds upon the last. The advanced training phase begins once primary training is completed. Students may take advantage of a variety of additional professional training options, which include advanced training at their own or other primary studios, more specialized training, study abroad and internships.
