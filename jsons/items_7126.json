His recently completed dissertation, entitled\u00a0 Waiting for Godzilla: Apocalyptic Cinema at the Close of the Millennium, \u00a0examines the confluence of the secular and sacred in mainstream filmmaking as articulated in apocalyptic disaster fictions of the 1990s. He is currently doing research on representations of race, class and gender in contemporary children\u2019s films. Other areas of interest, publication and teaching include science fiction, musicals and documentary, as well as the cinemas of Japan and Scandinavia. He has taught at NYU, in Cinema Studies and Undergraduate Film and Television, since 2001, and in Media Studies at Queens College \u2013 CUNY since 2003. Prior to teaching at NYU, he was a programming executive at HBO from 1993 until 2001.                                     top of page                                     Contact Information     Julian Cornell             Part-time Faculty              julian.cornell@nyu.edu             1 Wash Pl, Room 613             (212) 998-7340      Download as vCard           \u00a0           Office Hours                     Thursday 3-5                                                     Courses                                                   2015             Winter                            This Mediated Life: An Introduction to the Study of Mass Media                  Mon,Tue,Wed,Thu      10:00 AM -      1:30 PM                                                   2015             Spring                            The Cultural Politics of Bad Taste                  Thu      6:20 PM -      9:00 PM                                                   2015             Fall                            This Mediated Life: An Introduction to the Study of Mass Media                  Thu      6:20 PM -      9:00 PM                                                   2014             Spring                            The Cultural Politics of Bad Taste                  Thu      3:30 PM -      6:10 PM                                                   2014             Fall                            This Mediated Life: An Introduction to the Study of Mass Media                  Thu      3:30 PM -      6:10 PM                                       Research and Teaching Interests       science fiction and disaster fictions; documentary and non-fiction film and television; cinemas of Germany, Japan and Scandinavia; musicals, film and politics; film and religion; new media                                                                                                            NYU Gallatin Footer              Gallatin School of Individualized Study     1 Washington Place     New York, NY 10003     (212) 998-7370                   A&#8211;Z Index      Directions      Contact Us      Job Opportunities               News      Support Gallatin      Feedback                         Follow us on Facebook      Follow us on Twitter      Follow us on Youtube         Follow us Instagram                 Unless otherwise noted, all content copyright NYU Gallatin.

His recently completed dissertation, entitled\u00a0 Waiting for Godzilla: Apocalyptic Cinema at the Close of the Millennium, \u00a0examines the confluence of the secular and sacred in mainstream filmmaking as articulated in apocalyptic disaster fictions of the 1990s. He is currently doing research on representations of race, class and gender in contemporary children\u2019s films. Other areas of interest, publication and teaching include science fiction, musicals and documentary, as well as the cinemas of Japan and Scandinavia.

Utilizing wide ranging critical and theoretical methodologies, the course will consider how media alternately reflects and forms our sense of politics, economics, race, gender, sexuality and citizenship. The course will be concerned with questions such as: What function does mass media serve for society? How does a media saturated cultural environment shape our identity? How do mass media forms delineate and naturalize prevailing ideologies and ways of being in the world? Can media provide a means to challenge cultural and political hegemony? Readings will be drawn from Berger\u2019s\u00a0 Media Analysis Techniques \u00a0, Jenkins\u2019\u00a0 Convergence Culture \u00a0, Levinson\u2019s\u00a0 New New Media \u00a0as well as the anthologies\u00a0 The Media Studies Reader \u00a0and\u00a0 Gender, Race and Class in the Media \u00a0and the course will include excerpts from the films\u00a0 The Dark Knight Returns, The Matrix, The Truman Show, \u00a0and\u00a0 Wag the Dog \u00a0, television shows such as\u00a0 60 Minutes, Family Guy, The Simpsons, South Park \u00a0and\u00a0 The X-Files \u00a0, and a selection of other media forms, including blogs, radio shows, podcasts, graphic novels, magazines, music videos, social media sites and videogames.
