EAST-UA 91 East Asian Art II: China , Korea, Japan from 1000 CE to Present (4 credits) Instructor: Michele Matteini Art History sponsored. Same as ARTH-UA 511. An introductory survey of the arts in China, Japan, and Korea from approximately 1000 C.E. Emphasizes an overall understanding of the development of art and culture, as well as mastery of specific works of art. East Asian Art I followed the development of the common cultural heritage of the Northeast Asia region. Part of this commonality is due to the extraordinary influence of an early-developing Chinese civilization on Japan and Korea. However, Japan and Korea also developed their own cultures and arts, developments that accelerated in the last millennia up to the present. Topics include Song landscape paintings, Edo \"floating world\" prints, Koryo celadons, and modern art.         EAST-UA 517 Problems in Contemporary China (4 credits) Instructor: Rebecca Karl Same as HIST-UA 538 This course is designed to examine intensively several major problems in contemporary China (1980s to the present). On the one hand, these problems can be seen as partially representative of China\u2019s social, economic, and intellectual transformation from a Maoist-socialist state to a quasi-capitalist one-party state, transformations that have had and continue to have far-reaching consequences for China and the world in the past three decades; on the other hand, these problems also can be seen as representative of global transformations that chronologically coincided with and helped shape the direction of China\u2019s changes, as China firmly integrated itself into global capitalism and its attendant systems of knowledge production and social formations beginning in the 1980s.      EAST-UA 519 Law &amp; Justice in Chinese Society (4 credits) Instructor: Masato Hasegawa History sponsored. Same as HIST-UA 551. As calls for government openness and transparency increase in China, the notion and application of the rule of law in Chinese society has become the subject of an intense debate both within and beyond China. This seminar aims to situate the contemporary debate over China's rule of law in a broader historical context and examines the historical processes of the production and interpretation of law in China from the pre-modern period to the modern era. Particular emphasis will be placed on assessing the manner in which the notion of justice has been defined and invoked in Chinese historical sources. The general course format combines critical reading of texts and active discussion. Readings will include both contemporary historical scholarship on law and society in China and an array of primary source materials in English or in English translation. Some background knowledge of Chinese history will be helpful, but is not required.      EAST-UA 531 Asia's Revolutions: China/India/Vietnam 1885-1962 (4 credits) Instructor: Moss Roberts Same as HIST-UA 538.                               The aim of this introductory course is to establish a framework    for modern Asian history by a comparative approach to the national    independence movements in China, India, and Vietnam, as well as    the context within which they unfolded, in the period 1885-1962,    that is, from the Sino-French War to the Sino-Indian War. We    begin with the questions: why could there be no Gandhi in China,    no Mao in India? And how does Ho Chi Minh compare to these two    figures? The course will introduce students to some of the figures in    modern Asian history who played a major role in the transition of    India and Vietnam from colonial subordination to independent    nationhood and of China from its semi-colonial status to    liberation. The principal figures whose lives and writings will be    studied and compared are Mohandas Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru, Sun    Yat-sen, Mao Zedong, and Ho Chi Minh. The course will give due    attention to other relevant figures such as M. Jinnah in the case    of India; Chiang Kai-shek in the case of China; Phan Boi Chau in    the case of Vietnam. The main focus of the course is comparing    India and China, which have separate internal dynamics and little    to do with one another until World War Two, and then become    crucially involved in the post World War Two / Cold War world. Since war together with revolution constitutes the determinative    process of this historical period, we will pay attention to the    sequence of wars after 1885: the Sino-Japanese War (1894-95), the    Russo-Japanese War (1904-05), World War One (1914-18), the    Siberian Intervention (1918-23), the invasion of Manchuria (1931),    the Resistance War of China against Japan (1937-45), World War Two    in the Pacific, the Korean War, and the Indochina Wars (up to    1962). We will also compare the internal struggle in India,    between the Hindu and Muslim communities, leading to the formation    of Pakistan in 1947, and in China between the Communists and the    Nationalists, leading to the completion of the revolution in    1949. Consideration is given to the role of Tibet as a site of    conflict between India and China, the main cause of the    Sino-Indian War of 1962.      EAST-UA 552 The Cold War in Asia (4 credits) Instructor: James L Peck History sponsored. Same as HIST-UA 552 This course will focus on U.S. foreign policy in Asia since 1945. The ways U.S. global interests and concerns sought to shape Asian realities (and were shaped in turn by them) will be the touchstone for examining the Cold War in Asia. We will examine the following topics: the occupation of Japan and early US global economic visions; the US and the Chinese revolution before the Korean War; the Korean War and the isolation of China; the Vietnam War and the Kennedy/Johnson years; Nixon\u2019s global geopolitical vision and his policies towards Vietnam, China, and Japan; Carter and the meaning of human rights diplomacy in Asia; Reagan and the Asian issues involved in an intensified Cold War against Russia; George H. W. Bush and Asia\u2019s place in \u201ca New World Order;\u201d and finally, the Clinton and George W. Bush years. Throughout the course, we shall examine key de-classified National Security documents, interpreting their meaning and language, while carefully assessing the arguments used to justify American policy. EAST-UA 610 Korean Modernism (4 credits) Instructor: June Hee Kwon This course explores the key debates and questions about modernity with a   focus on Colonial Korea. The concept of modernity\u2014as a particular   historical moment as well as a new thought system\u2014has emerged from the   rise of nation states, the development of capitalism,   and the growth of bodies of scientific knowledge. It indicates a   radical break from tradition, disenchantment with the religious life,   and strong belief in reason and progress. It also celebrates the newness   emerging from the interaction between the self and   the other, and an openness to the foreign and the world. This course   juxtaposes various interpretations of \u201cmodern\u201d events of colonial Korea   in conversation with theories that explicate modernity and what it means   to be modern. We will explore historiographies,   novels, and films dealing with the following themes: national ideology   and national bodies, economic and political contentions, modern   education and scientific management, class and gender formation,   capitalism and urbanization, colonial migration and cosmopolitanism,   anti-colonialism and socialist/revolutionary thought.\u200b      EAST-UA 613 Japanese Cinema (4 credits) Instructor: TBD Same as DRLIT-UA 613. This course examines Japanese cinema from its prehistory to its contemporary developments. The focus will be on the rise of Japanese subculture/popular culture in the 1980s and onward, and its long-term implications. The course is organized roughly chronologically, tracing major historical developments of Japanese popular culture, literature and film from the early modern (17-19th century) to the modern (20-21st century) period. Topics include Japanese pure film movement, genbun-itchi (unification of written-spoken language), benshi (orators), Ozu, anime (Japanese animation), \u201cthe end of literature\u201d discourse, and Japanese nouvelle-vague. This course includes screenings of film with English subtitles.      EAST-UA 710 Japan &amp; WWII in Asia (4 credits) Instructor: George S Solt History sponsored. Same as HIST-UA 710.     The course examines Japan and World War II in Asia from a variety of critical perspectives. Two themes in particular will be highlighted throughout the course. First, we will consider how imperialism and colonialism of both the Euro-American and Japanese varieties were central to the War\u2019s outbreak, conduct, and resolution. Second, we will explore various local experiences and memories of the war. These will include the experiences and memories of marginalized groups in Japan and its colonies, \u201ccomfort women,\u201d victims of war atrocities, Japanese Americans, African Americans, and Pacific Islanders. Please note that we will discuss the readings in class every week. Therefore, you must keep up with the readings and complete the weekly assignments.      EAST-UA 729 Traditional Drama China &amp; Japan (4 credits) Instructor: Moss Roberts The course will compare a set of Chinese and Japanese pre-modern dramas, mainly as literature but also as performance, by exploring the contrasts and parallels of incident, character, plot design, and theme of the two theatrical traditions. Attention will be given to the historical background of each work and to the social conditions and customs that each reflects. The cultural salience of each work is also considered. Where possible and appropriate scenes or entire plays will be screened for the class or assigned for viewing. EAST-UA 731 20th Century Chinese Literature in Translation (4 credits) Instructor: Max Bohnenkamp Realism has often been regarded as a dominant force in modern Chinese literature, but other styles of representation have also been important to Chinese literary creativity during the 20th century. This course examines the significance of three modes of literary \u201cexcess\u201d that disrupt the expectations of realism- the fantastic, the grotesque and the sublime \u2013 in the history of Chinese literature from the late-Qing dynasty to the late-20th century. While each of these modes possesses links to traditional Chinese culture, they have also provided new expressive resources for reflecting the reconfiguration of social values and human perception in China during the modern era. Focusing on close readings of fiction and some poetry, we will examine how Chinese writers have used the fantastic to transgress the boundaries of the real, employed the grotesque to expose reality\u2019s ugliness, and invoked the sublime to try to invest literature with the potential to change reality.  EAST-UA 736 Issues and Debates in Contemporary Korea (4 credits) Instructor: June Hee Kwon This course aims to understand the principles, logics, and dynamics that   have constituted the contemporary divided Korea\u2014with a particular focus   on South Korea. The postcolonial era in Korea soon led to the Korean   War and then the Cold War, which took the   two Koreas down dramatically different pathways. South Korea achieved   rapid and dramatic economic development, eventually witnessing exemplary   democratization movements emerge from the fight against dictatorial   government, class inequality, and sexual discrimination.   Despite an earlier start on economic development following its   socialist revolution, North Korea has suffered from a poor economy and a   repressive authoritarian regime. Paying attention to Cold War politics   as a major influence in creating and sustaining the   two Koreas, we explore three primary themes in the history of   contemporary Korea: 1) Nationalism, 2) Developmentalism, and 3)   Neoliberalism. The subtopics include: the Korean War and its impact,   anti-communistic nationalism and state violence, developmentalism   and democracy, class differentiation and gender formation,   multiculturalism and cosmopolitanism, urbanization and environmental   issues, youth and precarious labor, North Korea and human rights.        EAST-UA 832 Intro to Buddhism (4 credits) Instructor: Christopher Kelley Religious Studies sponsored. Same as RELST-UA 832 An introduction to this complex religion, emphasizing its history, teachings, and practices. Discusses its doctrinal development in India, then emphasizes certain local practices: Buddhism and the family in China; Buddhism, language, and hierarchy in Japan; the politics of Buddhist Tibet; and Buddhist art. Finally, the course touches on Buddhism in the United States.      EAST-UA 950 Topics in Asian Studies: The Planetary Imagination (4 credits) Instructor: Phil Kaffen The planetary has emerged a contested site across a variety of fields   from comparative literature and area studies to media studies and   philosophy. Partly marking itself off from older universalist claims   (cosmopolitanism, world history, globalization), the planetary   imagination as we will discuss it in this class foregrounds an   ecological dimension and at the same time, shifts the grounds of   human-centered thought and politics. While touching on a wide variety of   issues, including technology, scale, identity, and ethics, the core   problem for the class will be to consider \u201cthe world\u201d from a standpoint   that does not privilege the human as its center or apex. The goal of the   course is neither to immediately endorse nor repudiate a critique of   anthropocentrism, but to examine some of its diverse forms of   expression, underlying assumptions, and possible repercussions. To that   end, this class seeks to explore the planetary imagination from a   broadly (and possibly contradictory) humanities-based perspective, at   the intersection of area studies (East Asia in particular) and   comparative literature\u2014through fiction, philosophy, and contemporary   arts and media.      EAST-UA 952 Topics in Chinese Studies: Modern Chinese Drama (4 credits) Instructor: Max Bohnenkamp   China has always been home to a rich theatrical tradition, visible in such forms as Kun and Beijing operas. Yet beginning in the late-1800s, new knowledge of Western culture inspired major creative attempts to modernize the traditional theater and to introduce foreign styles of performance. While the efforts of such figures as Mei Lanfang led to the transformation of Beijing opera into China\u2019s first form of internationally- known theater, the spoken dramas of modern playwrights like Cao Yu and Tian Han offered realist plays of social critique to advance the reform of Chinese culture. Upon such foundations, drama developed into one of the most important and contested areas of artistic innovation and public engagement through China\u2019s 20th-century history of war, revolution and reform. This course examines the history of modern Chinese drama through close readings of exemplary dramatic texts, film viewings and the study of current scholarship on the topic.

Topics include: descriptive statistics; introduction to probability; sampling; statistical inference concerning means, standard deviations, and proportions; correlation; analysis of variance; linear regression, including multiple regression analysis. Applications to empirical situations are an integral part of the course. Prerequisite: None.                                                                      Advanced High Business Chinese - Cases from Real World \u2013 BUSF-SHU 188 \u2013 4 points                               This is the second part of a two-semester sequence for those who have studied Mandarin to the advanced level, although part 1 is NOT the prerequisite for taking part 2 or vice versa. The course is aimed to enhance students\u2019 Chinese skills in the business context and promote their understanding about the macro and micro business environment and culture in China. An approach placing more emphasis on case study is adopted along with task-based language teaching. The course is based on real-life cases from the business word. One is a multinational company which entered the Chinese market as a pioneer in the late 1970s and developed even closer ties to China in the 1990s by acquiring or partnering with the Chinese companies; five are Chinese companies that have endeavored in different ways to reach larger domestic and global markets. These cases center upon the issues of Business Globalization, M &amp; A (Mergers and Acquisition), OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) and Antidumping etc. Through reading and discussing these cases and performing form-focused and communicative tasks related to these cases, students will learn how to use Chinese as a \u201ccarrier of culture\u201d in a more dynamic way, thus acquiring a better understanding about China in economic and, broadly defined, cultural terms. In addition, the case study will also inspire students to explore the Chinese consumers\u2019 interest and mentality, so that they will occupy a more qualified position to explore a successful road toward \u201cdoing business in/with China.\u201d In addition to the business case analysis, supplementary reading, writing and listening exercises as well as media materials from different sources will also be provided in class or on-line. Highlights of these exercises are: Listening comprehension of business news reports on current issues as well as video recordings of television interviews and talk shows that cast successful international business leaders; analysis of the international financial markets (incl. analysis of origin, functions and conflict of interest of the investment banks); translation of business terminologies and documents, and commercial language and word processing. For students who are interested in pursuing career opportunities in Mainland China and Hong Kong, the course will teach the proper ways to compose a Chinese resume while, at the same time, introducing related job interview skills. By the end of the semester, students are expected to: (1) be equipped with the language skills to function more 2comfortably and confidently in the real business settings such as job interviews that require the Chinese language proficiency; (2) enhance the cultural awareness about the Chinese business world; (3) improve listening comprehension of Chinese business related media materials; (4) improve reading and translation skills of business terminologies/documents; (5) be able to use Chinese language software for certain business purposes.  Class will be conducted in Chinese.

As a result, the world\u2019s natural coastal environments have been substantially modified to suit human needs. This course uses the built and natural environments of coastal cities as laboratories to examine the environmental and ecological implications of urban  development in coastal areas. Using data from multiple coastal cities, student teams use fieldbased studies and Geographic Information System  (GIS) data to examine patterns and processes operating in coastal cities. This course uses the local terrestrial, marine, and built environments as a laboratory to address these issues, and team projects requiring field work form a core  component of the learning experience. As part of the NYU Global Network University initiative this course is being offered simultaneously in several  NYU sites globally and students are collaborating extensively with students from their sister campuses through the duration of this course.

Kang\u2019s concern would dominate intellectual debates over the twentieth century. In this course we will explore social and cultural debates in 20th-century China, focusing on topics such as Confucianism, social reform, nationalism, women empowerment, and art and literature. The questions that will guide this course include: Why did scholars like Kang Youwei and Liang Qiyao advocate reform and constitutional monarchy, while others, like Sun Yat-sen and Qiu Jin, called for revolution and the overthrow of the empire? What led to the Chinese Civil War between the Nationalists and the Communists? What was the May Fourth Movement about? Who are Mr. Science and Mr. Democracy? What did Hu Shi and Chen Duxiu mean when they declared classical language \u2018dead\u2019? What are Lu Xun\u2019s Diary of a Madman and Ding Ling\u2019s Miss Sophia\u2019s Diary really about? What did Mao Zedong mean when he claimed at the Yan\u2019an Forum, in 1942: \u201cThere is in fact no such thing as art for art's sake [\u2026] literature and art are the cogs and wheels in the whole revolutionary machine\u201d? What is meant by the Cultural Fever of 1980s China? What made the \u2018hooligan\u2019 (\u6d41\u6c13) author Wang Shuo a national bestseller in the 1980s? What were the main points of debate between the New Left and the neo-Liberals in the 1990s?                                                                    20th Century East Asia - US Relations - GCHN-SHU 252 - 4 points                                This is a lecture course focusing on the changing relationship between East Asian countries and the United States in the 20th-century.

Working in, outside, and between places like mainland China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, America, and parts of Southeast Asia, Chinese-language writers ask questions about nationalism, tradition, ethno-linguistic politics, and cultural authenticity. They speak from and across multiple cultural margins to probe the nature of modernity, cross-cultural contact, and otherness amid the global flows of labor and ideas. This course invites students to participate in the ongoing discursive and historiographical debates over the study of \u201cmodern Chinese literature\u201d through a fast-emerging transnational and comparative perspective. Reading stories, novels, and essays by both established and marginalized writers, we place the traditional nation-based rubric of Chinese literary studies in critical dialogues with a set of jarring historical contexts: Euro-American imperialism, Chinese emigration and their settler-colonial history, the post-1949 political split, and global decolonization movements, among others. We ask: how do writers represent China on the world stage? Where in their works can we discern stylistic and cultural hybridization? How do they variously cement or deconstruct the conventional East-West divide? What alternative literary geographies and worldviews do they offer? We begin with the satirical modernists of Republican-era China. Next, we turn to Hong Kong and Taiwan for identity debates, colonial legacies, nativism, and postmodern cultures. In light of the global migration history, we also study narratives from Chinese-speaking America, Malaysia, and Singapore to analyze how writers creatively deconstruct the notion of Chineseness. Finally, we discuss the changing terms of exclusion and inclusion of ethnic minorities in present-day Han-Chinese societies, to further expose the internal fractures within the global Sinophone cultures.                              Interactive Media and Technology                                                    Interaction Lab - INTM-SHU 101 - 4 points                               What can computation add to human communication? Creating computer applications, instead of just using them, will give you a deeper understanding of the essential possibilities of computation. Conversely excitement about your project ideas for using computation will best propel your acquisition of skills necessary to realize those ideas. This fourteen week course is divided into two parts. The first portion starts with the expressive capabilities of the human body and how we move through the world. The Physical Computing skills will allow you to go past the limitations of the mouse, keyboard and monitor interface and at locations other than the home or the office. The platform for the class is a microcontroller (Arduino brand), a very small inexpensive single-chip computer that can be embedded anywhere and sense and actuate in the physical world. The core technical concepts include digital, analog and serial input and output. The second portion of the course focuses on fundamentals of computer programming (variables, conditionals, iteration, functions, and objects) as well as more advanced techniques such as data parsing, image processing, networking, computer vision, and 3D graphics. The Java-based 'Processing' programming environment is the primary vehicle. Processing is more oriented towards visual displays on desktops, laptops, tablets or smartphones but can also connect back to the physical sensor and actuators from the first part of the class. The course is designed for computer programming novices but the project-centered pedagogy will allow more experienced programmers the opportunity to play further with their project ideas and potentially make friends by helping the other students.

Social Foundations                                                  Traditional Chinese Wisdom and Its Transformation in Modern Times - CCSF-SHU 122 - 4 points                               This course will give a brief survey of Chinese philosophy from the pre-Qin period to the present in the perspective of world philosophy. To capture the quintessence of traditional Chinese wisdom, we will focus on three most influential schools of thought in ancient China, namely, Confucianism, Taoism and Buddhism. We will delineate the evolution of Confucianism from Confucius to Neo-Confucianism in Song and Ming dynasties, distinguish Taoism as philosophy from Taoism as religion, and examine the process of sinicization of Buddhism, taking Zen Buddhism as a paradigm case. In modern times, against the background of the exchange between the Chinese and the Western cultures, traditional Chinese wisdom, through the creative work of modern Chinese thinkers, obtained a new lease of life. Under the heading of the modernization of traditional Chinese wisdom, we will examine three most prominent schools in the 20thcentury Chinese philosophy, namely, contemporary Neo-Confucianism, Tsinghua school of realism (the Chinese analytic philosophy), and Chinese Marxism. Students are required to read the assigned texts before each class and actively participate in class discussions. Prerequisite: None.                                                                      Contemporary Chinese Political Thought - CCSF-SHU 123 - 4 points                               This course introduces students to perspectives on contemporary Chinese political and social thought as presented in academic publications, media reports, social commentary and postings on the Chinese Internet. It covers selected key topics in the disciplines of political, social, and cultural studies. It examines and compares Chinese and Western views on major developments and current issues. The course also introduces students to a variety of styles of writing and research methods as well as skills of cultural translation relevant to the study of contemporary China and Chinese thought.                                Social Science                                                  Introduction to International Politics - SOCS-SHU 160 - 4 points                               What are the causes of war? Why are some countries able to cooperate over issues like trade or the environment, while others are not? What is the role of international organizations and alliances, such as the UN, NATO, and the EU in the international state system? This course will give students an introduction to thinking analytically and systematically about outcomes in the international system, will teach them the prevailing major theories about these issues, and will equip students to begin to formulate their own answers to these questions. Students will learn a set of formal tools to analyze complex world events, which will prepare them for upper level international relations and other social science courses, as well as to become comfortable applying social science methodologies and theories to better understanding the world around us. The class will use some basic math, including introductory game theory, and some background in inferring statistical results will be helpful, but is not required. Over the course of the semester students will be challenged to apply the models and theories from class to real world situations.

EAST-UA 91 East Asian Art II: China , Korea, Japan from 1000 CE to Present (4 credits) Instructor: Michele Matteini Art History sponsored. Same as ARTH-UA 511. An introductory survey of the arts in China, Japan, and Korea from approximately 1000 C.E. Emphasizes an overall understanding of the development of art and culture, as well as mastery of specific works of art. East Asian Art I followed the development of the common cultural heritage of the Northeast Asia region. Part of this commonality is due to the extraordinary influence of an early-developing Chinese civilization on Japan and Korea. However, Japan and Korea also developed their own cultures and arts, developments that accelerated in the last millennia up to the present. Topics include Song landscape paintings, Edo \"floating world\" prints, Koryo celadons, and modern art.         EAST-UA 517 Problems in Contemporary China (4 credits) Instructor: Rebecca Karl Same as HIST-UA 538 This course is designed to examine intensively several major problems in contemporary China (1980s to the present). On the one hand, these problems can be seen as partially representative of China\u2019s social, economic, and intellectual transformation from a Maoist-socialist state to a quasi-capitalist one-party state, transformations that have had and continue to have far-reaching consequences for China and the world in the past three decades; on the other hand, these problems also can be seen as representative of global transformations that chronologically coincided with and helped shape the direction of China\u2019s changes, as China firmly integrated itself into global capitalism and its attendant systems of knowledge production and social formations beginning in the 1980s.      EAST-UA 519 Law &amp; Justice in Chinese Society (4 credits) Instructor: Masato Hasegawa History sponsored. Same as HIST-UA 551. As calls for government openness and transparency increase in China, the notion and application of the rule of law in Chinese society has become the subject of an intense debate both within and beyond China. This seminar aims to situate the contemporary debate over China's rule of law in a broader historical context and examines the historical processes of the production and interpretation of law in China from the pre-modern period to the modern era. Particular emphasis will be placed on assessing the manner in which the notion of justice has been defined and invoked in Chinese historical sources. The general course format combines critical reading of texts and active discussion. Readings will include both contemporary historical scholarship on law and society in China and an array of primary source materials in English or in English translation. Some background knowledge of Chinese history will be helpful, but is not required.      EAST-UA 531 Asia's Revolutions: China/India/Vietnam 1885-1962 (4 credits) Instructor: Moss Roberts Same as HIST-UA 538.                               The aim of this introductory course is to establish a framework    for modern Asian history by a comparative approach to the national    independence movements in China, India, and Vietnam, as well as    the context within which they unfolded, in the period 1885-1962,    that is, from the Sino-French War to the Sino-Indian War. We    begin with the questions: why could there be no Gandhi in China,    no Mao in India? And how does Ho Chi Minh compare to these two    figures? The course will introduce students to some of the figures in    modern Asian history who played a major role in the transition of    India and Vietnam from colonial subordination to independent    nationhood and of China from its semi-colonial status to    liberation. The principal figures whose lives and writings will be    studied and compared are Mohandas Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru, Sun    Yat-sen, Mao Zedong, and Ho Chi Minh. The course will give due    attention to other relevant figures such as M. Jinnah in the case    of India; Chiang Kai-shek in the case of China; Phan Boi Chau in    the case of Vietnam. The main focus of the course is comparing    India and China, which have separate internal dynamics and little    to do with one another until World War Two, and then become    crucially involved in the post World War Two / Cold War world. Since war together with revolution constitutes the determinative    process of this historical period, we will pay attention to the    sequence of wars after 1885: the Sino-Japanese War (1894-95), the    Russo-Japanese War (1904-05), World War One (1914-18), the    Siberian Intervention (1918-23), the invasion of Manchuria (1931),    the Resistance War of China against Japan (1937-45), World War Two    in the Pacific, the Korean War, and the Indochina Wars (up to    1962). We will also compare the internal struggle in India,    between the Hindu and Muslim communities, leading to the formation    of Pakistan in 1947, and in China between the Communists and the    Nationalists, leading to the completion of the revolution in    1949. Consideration is given to the role of Tibet as a site of    conflict between India and China, the main cause of the    Sino-Indian War of 1962.      EAST-UA 552 The Cold War in Asia (4 credits) Instructor: James L Peck History sponsored. Same as HIST-UA 552 This course will focus on U.S. foreign policy in Asia since 1945. The ways U.S. global interests and concerns sought to shape Asian realities (and were shaped in turn by them) will be the touchstone for examining the Cold War in Asia. We will examine the following topics: the occupation of Japan and early US global economic visions; the US and the Chinese revolution before the Korean War; the Korean War and the isolation of China; the Vietnam War and the Kennedy/Johnson years; Nixon\u2019s global geopolitical vision and his policies towards Vietnam, China, and Japan; Carter and the meaning of human rights diplomacy in Asia; Reagan and the Asian issues involved in an intensified Cold War against Russia; George H. W. Bush and Asia\u2019s place in \u201ca New World Order;\u201d and finally, the Clinton and George W. Bush years. Throughout the course, we shall examine key de-classified National Security documents, interpreting their meaning and language, while carefully assessing the arguments used to justify American policy. EAST-UA 610 Korean Modernism (4 credits) Instructor: June Hee Kwon This course explores the key debates and questions about modernity with a   focus on Colonial Korea. The concept of modernity\u2014as a particular   historical moment as well as a new thought system\u2014has emerged from the   rise of nation states, the development of capitalism,   and the growth of bodies of scientific knowledge. It indicates a   radical break from tradition, disenchantment with the religious life,   and strong belief in reason and progress. It also celebrates the newness   emerging from the interaction between the self and   the other, and an openness to the foreign and the world. This course   juxtaposes various interpretations of \u201cmodern\u201d events of colonial Korea   in conversation with theories that explicate modernity and what it means   to be modern. We will explore historiographies,   novels, and films dealing with the following themes: national ideology   and national bodies, economic and political contentions, modern   education and scientific management, class and gender formation,   capitalism and urbanization, colonial migration and cosmopolitanism,   anti-colonialism and socialist/revolutionary thought.\u200b      EAST-UA 613 Japanese Cinema (4 credits) Instructor: TBD Same as DRLIT-UA 613. This course examines Japanese cinema from its prehistory to its contemporary developments. The focus will be on the rise of Japanese subculture/popular culture in the 1980s and onward, and its long-term implications. The course is organized roughly chronologically, tracing major historical developments of Japanese popular culture, literature and film from the early modern (17-19th century) to the modern (20-21st century) period. Topics include Japanese pure film movement, genbun-itchi (unification of written-spoken language), benshi (orators), Ozu, anime (Japanese animation), \u201cthe end of literature\u201d discourse, and Japanese nouvelle-vague. This course includes screenings of film with English subtitles.      EAST-UA 710 Japan &amp; WWII in Asia (4 credits) Instructor: George S Solt History sponsored. Same as HIST-UA 710.     The course examines Japan and World War II in Asia from a variety of critical perspectives. Two themes in particular will be highlighted throughout the course. First, we will consider how imperialism and colonialism of both the Euro-American and Japanese varieties were central to the War\u2019s outbreak, conduct, and resolution. Second, we will explore various local experiences and memories of the war. These will include the experiences and memories of marginalized groups in Japan and its colonies, \u201ccomfort women,\u201d victims of war atrocities, Japanese Americans, African Americans, and Pacific Islanders. Please note that we will discuss the readings in class every week. Therefore, you must keep up with the readings and complete the weekly assignments.      EAST-UA 729 Traditional Drama China &amp; Japan (4 credits) Instructor: Moss Roberts The course will compare a set of Chinese and Japanese pre-modern dramas, mainly as literature but also as performance, by exploring the contrasts and parallels of incident, character, plot design, and theme of the two theatrical traditions.

EAST-UA 731 20th Century Chinese Literature in Translation (4 credits) Instructor: Max Bohnenkamp Realism has often been regarded as a dominant force in modern Chinese literature, but other styles of representation have also been important to Chinese literary creativity during the 20th century. This course examines the significance of three modes of literary \u201cexcess\u201d that disrupt the expectations of realism- the fantastic, the grotesque and the sublime \u2013 in the history of Chinese literature from the late-Qing dynasty to the late-20th century. While each of these modes possesses links to traditional Chinese culture, they have also provided new expressive resources for reflecting the reconfiguration of social values and human perception in China during the modern era. Focusing on close readings of fiction and some poetry, we will examine how Chinese writers have used the fantastic to transgress the boundaries of the real, employed the grotesque to expose reality\u2019s ugliness, and invoked the sublime to try to invest literature with the potential to change reality.  EAST-UA 736 Issues and Debates in Contemporary Korea (4 credits) Instructor: June Hee Kwon This course aims to understand the principles, logics, and dynamics that   have constituted the contemporary divided Korea\u2014with a particular focus   on South Korea. The postcolonial era in Korea soon led to the Korean   War and then the Cold War, which took the   two Koreas down dramatically different pathways. South Korea achieved   rapid and dramatic economic development, eventually witnessing exemplary   democratization movements emerge from the fight against dictatorial   government, class inequality, and sexual discrimination.   Despite an earlier start on economic development following its   socialist revolution, North Korea has suffered from a poor economy and a   repressive authoritarian regime. Paying attention to Cold War politics   as a major influence in creating and sustaining the   two Koreas, we explore three primary themes in the history of   contemporary Korea: 1) Nationalism, 2) Developmentalism, and 3)   Neoliberalism. The subtopics include: the Korean War and its impact,   anti-communistic nationalism and state violence, developmentalism   and democracy, class differentiation and gender formation,   multiculturalism and cosmopolitanism, urbanization and environmental   issues, youth and precarious labor, North Korea and human rights.        EAST-UA 832 Intro to Buddhism (4 credits) Instructor: Christopher Kelley Religious Studies sponsored. Same as RELST-UA 832 An introduction to this complex religion, emphasizing its history, teachings, and practices. Discusses its doctrinal development in India, then emphasizes certain local practices: Buddhism and the family in China; Buddhism, language, and hierarchy in Japan; the politics of Buddhist Tibet; and Buddhist art. Finally, the course touches on Buddhism in the United States.      EAST-UA 950 Topics in Asian Studies: The Planetary Imagination (4 credits) Instructor: Phil Kaffen The planetary has emerged a contested site across a variety of fields   from comparative literature and area studies to media studies and   philosophy. Partly marking itself off from older universalist claims   (cosmopolitanism, world history, globalization), the planetary   imagination as we will discuss it in this class foregrounds an   ecological dimension and at the same time, shifts the grounds of   human-centered thought and politics. While touching on a wide variety of   issues, including technology, scale, identity, and ethics, the core   problem for the class will be to consider \u201cthe world\u201d from a standpoint   that does not privilege the human as its center or apex. The goal of the   course is neither to immediately endorse nor repudiate a critique of   anthropocentrism, but to examine some of its diverse forms of   expression, underlying assumptions, and possible repercussions. To that   end, this class seeks to explore the planetary imagination from a   broadly (and possibly contradictory) humanities-based perspective, at   the intersection of area studies (East Asia in particular) and   comparative literature\u2014through fiction, philosophy, and contemporary   arts and media.      EAST-UA 952 Topics in Chinese Studies: Modern Chinese Drama (4 credits) Instructor: Max Bohnenkamp   China has always been home to a rich theatrical tradition, visible in such forms as Kun and Beijing operas. Yet beginning in the late-1800s, new knowledge of Western culture inspired major creative attempts to modernize the traditional theater and to introduce foreign styles of performance. While the efforts of such figures as Mei Lanfang led to the transformation of Beijing opera into China\u2019s first form of internationally- known theater, the spoken dramas of modern playwrights like Cao Yu and Tian Han offered realist plays of social critique to advance the reform of Chinese culture. Upon such foundations, drama developed into one of the most important and contested areas of artistic innovation and public engagement through China\u2019s 20th-century history of war, revolution and reform. This course examines the history of modern Chinese drama through close readings of exemplary dramatic texts, film viewings and the study of current scholarship on the topic.

In order to assess these challenges and systems, the course introduces a comparative dimension \u2013 looking at not only the Chinese system, but the American system as well, examining the environmental challenges and governance system of the United States, as well as the broader context within which China and the U.S. together constitute the two primary sources of the world\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions. Is it possible to compare the American and Chinese systems? Can concepts of governance and assessment be translated between the two systems? What can China learn from the U.S.? What can America learn from China? Will the profound differences in our political and economic systems make environmental cooperation impossible, leading inevitably to conflict? Will globalization and technological innovation lead to healthy competition and cooperation to address common problems?

Topics include: descriptive statistics; introduction to probability; sampling; statistical inference concerning means, standard deviations, and proportions; correlation; analysis of variance; linear regression, including multiple regression analysis. Applications to empirical situations are an integral part of the course. Prerequisite: None.                                                                      Advanced High Business Chinese - Cases from Real World \u2013 BUSF-SHU 188 \u2013 4 points                               This is the second part of a two-semester sequence for those who have studied Mandarin to the advanced level, although part 1 is NOT the prerequisite for taking part 2 or vice versa. The course is aimed to enhance students\u2019 Chinese skills in the business context and promote their understanding about the macro and micro business environment and culture in China. An approach placing more emphasis on case study is adopted along with task-based language teaching. The course is based on real-life cases from the business word. One is a multinational company which entered the Chinese market as a pioneer in the late 1970s and developed even closer ties to China in the 1990s by acquiring or partnering with the Chinese companies; five are Chinese companies that have endeavored in different ways to reach larger domestic and global markets. These cases center upon the issues of Business Globalization, M &amp; A (Mergers and Acquisition), OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) and Antidumping etc. Through reading and discussing these cases and performing form-focused and communicative tasks related to these cases, students will learn how to use Chinese as a \u201ccarrier of culture\u201d in a more dynamic way, thus acquiring a better understanding about China in economic and, broadly defined, cultural terms. In addition, the case study will also inspire students to explore the Chinese consumers\u2019 interest and mentality, so that they will occupy a more qualified position to explore a successful road toward \u201cdoing business in/with China.\u201d In addition to the business case analysis, supplementary reading, writing and listening exercises as well as media materials from different sources will also be provided in class or on-line. Highlights of these exercises are: Listening comprehension of business news reports on current issues as well as video recordings of television interviews and talk shows that cast successful international business leaders; analysis of the international financial markets (incl. analysis of origin, functions and conflict of interest of the investment banks); translation of business terminologies and documents, and commercial language and word processing. For students who are interested in pursuing career opportunities in Mainland China and Hong Kong, the course will teach the proper ways to compose a Chinese resume while, at the same time, introducing related job interview skills. By the end of the semester, students are expected to: (1) be equipped with the language skills to function more 2comfortably and confidently in the real business settings such as job interviews that require the Chinese language proficiency; (2) enhance the cultural awareness about the Chinese business world; (3) improve listening comprehension of Chinese business related media materials; (4) improve reading and translation skills of business terminologies/documents; (5) be able to use Chinese language software for certain business purposes.  Class will be conducted in Chinese.

As a result, the world\u2019s natural coastal environments have been substantially modified to suit human needs. This course uses the built and natural environments of coastal cities as laboratories to examine the environmental and ecological implications of urban  development in coastal areas. Using data from multiple coastal cities, student teams use fieldbased studies and Geographic Information System  (GIS) data to examine patterns and processes operating in coastal cities. This course uses the local terrestrial, marine, and built environments as a laboratory to address these issues, and team projects requiring field work form a core  component of the learning experience. As part of the NYU Global Network University initiative this course is being offered simultaneously in several  NYU sites globally and students are collaborating extensively with students from their sister campuses through the duration of this course.                                Global China Studies                                                  Social and Cultural Debates in 20th Century China - GCHN-SHU 231 - 4 points                               \u201cOur present trouble lies in our clinging to old institutions without knowing how to change,\u201d Kang Youwei wrote in a letter to the Emperor in 1898. Kang\u2019s concern would dominate intellectual debates over the twentieth century. In this course we will explore social and cultural debates in 20th-century China, focusing on topics such as Confucianism, social reform, nationalism, women empowerment, and art and literature. The questions that will guide this course include: Why did scholars like Kang Youwei and Liang Qiyao advocate reform and constitutional monarchy, while others, like Sun Yat-sen and Qiu Jin, called for revolution and the overthrow of the empire? What led to the Chinese Civil War between the Nationalists and the Communists? What was the May Fourth Movement about? Who are Mr. Science and Mr. Democracy? What did Hu Shi and Chen Duxiu mean when they declared classical language \u2018dead\u2019? What are Lu Xun\u2019s Diary of a Madman and Ding Ling\u2019s Miss Sophia\u2019s Diary really about? What did Mao Zedong mean when he claimed at the Yan\u2019an Forum, in 1942: \u201cThere is in fact no such thing as art for art's sake [\u2026] literature and art are the cogs and wheels in the whole revolutionary machine\u201d? What is meant by the Cultural Fever of 1980s China? What made the \u2018hooligan\u2019 (\u6d41\u6c13) author Wang Shuo a national bestseller in the 1980s? What were the main points of debate between the New Left and the neo-Liberals in the 1990s?                                                                    20th Century East Asia - US Relations - GCHN-SHU 252 - 4 points                                This is a lecture course focusing on the changing relationship between East Asian countries and the United States in the 20th-century. On the basis of reviewing the early encounters between East Asia and America in the 18th and 19th centuries, this course covers the major political, economic, military, and cultural developments, as well as the dynamics underlying them, that have shaped the confrontation and cooperation between various East Asian countries and the United States in the past 100 years. In particular, this course aims to help students develop a better understanding of how nations with different values, cultural-historical backgrounds, political institutions, and levels of economic development may coexist in today\u2019s world.                                                                      Voices from the Margin: Modern Chinese and Sinophone Writers - GCHN-SHU 263 - 4 points                               The literary scene in the modern and contemporary Chinese-speaking world is diverse, vast, and challenging for the migrant and exilic minds whose creative energies are often driven by their poignant insights to the turbulent events around them. Working in, outside, and between places like mainland China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, America, and parts of Southeast Asia, Chinese-language writers ask questions about nationalism, tradition, ethno-linguistic politics, and cultural authenticity. They speak from and across multiple cultural margins to probe the nature of modernity, cross-cultural contact, and otherness amid the global flows of labor and ideas. This course invites students to participate in the ongoing discursive and historiographical debates over the study of \u201cmodern Chinese literature\u201d through a fast-emerging transnational and comparative perspective. Reading stories, novels, and essays by both established and marginalized writers, we place the traditional nation-based rubric of Chinese literary studies in critical dialogues with a set of jarring historical contexts: Euro-American imperialism, Chinese emigration and their settler-colonial history, the post-1949 political split, and global decolonization movements, among others. We ask: how do writers represent China on the world stage? Where in their works can we discern stylistic and cultural hybridization? How do they variously cement or deconstruct the conventional East-West divide? What alternative literary geographies and worldviews do they offer? We begin with the satirical modernists of Republican-era China. Next, we turn to Hong Kong and Taiwan for identity debates, colonial legacies, nativism, and postmodern cultures. In light of the global migration history, we also study narratives from Chinese-speaking America, Malaysia, and Singapore to analyze how writers creatively deconstruct the notion of Chineseness. Finally, we discuss the changing terms of exclusion and inclusion of ethnic minorities in present-day Han-Chinese societies, to further expose the internal fractures within the global Sinophone cultures.

Creating computer applications, instead of just using them, will give you a deeper understanding of the essential possibilities of computation. Conversely excitement about your project ideas for using computation will best propel your acquisition of skills necessary to realize those ideas. This fourteen week course is divided into two parts. The first portion starts with the expressive capabilities of the human body and how we move through the world. The Physical Computing skills will allow you to go past the limitations of the mouse, keyboard and monitor interface and at locations other than the home or the office. The platform for the class is a microcontroller (Arduino brand), a very small inexpensive single-chip computer that can be embedded anywhere and sense and actuate in the physical world. The core technical concepts include digital, analog and serial input and output. The second portion of the course focuses on fundamentals of computer programming (variables, conditionals, iteration, functions, and objects) as well as more advanced techniques such as data parsing, image processing, networking, computer vision, and 3D graphics. The Java-based 'Processing' programming environment is the primary vehicle. Processing is more oriented towards visual displays on desktops, laptops, tablets or smartphones but can also connect back to the physical sensor and actuators from the first part of the class. The course is designed for computer programming novices but the project-centered pedagogy will allow more experienced programmers the opportunity to play further with their project ideas and potentially make friends by helping the other students.

Social Foundations                                                  Traditional Chinese Wisdom and Its Transformation in Modern Times - CCSF-SHU 122 - 4 points                               This course will give a brief survey of Chinese philosophy from the pre-Qin period to the present in the perspective of world philosophy. To capture the quintessence of traditional Chinese wisdom, we will focus on three most influential schools of thought in ancient China, namely, Confucianism, Taoism and Buddhism. We will delineate the evolution of Confucianism from Confucius to Neo-Confucianism in Song and Ming dynasties, distinguish Taoism as philosophy from Taoism as religion, and examine the process of sinicization of Buddhism, taking Zen Buddhism as a paradigm case. In modern times, against the background of the exchange between the Chinese and the Western cultures, traditional Chinese wisdom, through the creative work of modern Chinese thinkers, obtained a new lease of life. Under the heading of the modernization of traditional Chinese wisdom, we will examine three most prominent schools in the 20thcentury Chinese philosophy, namely, contemporary Neo-Confucianism, Tsinghua school of realism (the Chinese analytic philosophy), and Chinese Marxism. Students are required to read the assigned texts before each class and actively participate in class discussions. Prerequisite: None.                                                                      Contemporary Chinese Political Thought - CCSF-SHU 123 - 4 points                               This course introduces students to perspectives on contemporary Chinese political and social thought as presented in academic publications, media reports, social commentary and postings on the Chinese Internet. It covers selected key topics in the disciplines of political, social, and cultural studies. It examines and compares Chinese and Western views on major developments and current issues. The course also introduces students to a variety of styles of writing and research methods as well as skills of cultural translation relevant to the study of contemporary China and Chinese thought.                                Social Science                                                  Introduction to International Politics - SOCS-SHU 160 - 4 points                               What are the causes of war? Why are some countries able to cooperate over issues like trade or the environment, while others are not? What is the role of international organizations and alliances, such as the UN, NATO, and the EU in the international state system? This course will give students an introduction to thinking analytically and systematically about outcomes in the international system, will teach them the prevailing major theories about these issues, and will equip students to begin to formulate their own answers to these questions. Students will learn a set of formal tools to analyze complex world events, which will prepare them for upper level international relations and other social science courses, as well as to become comfortable applying social science methodologies and theories to better understanding the world around us. The class will use some basic math, including introductory game theory, and some background in inferring statistical results will be helpful, but is not required. Over the course of the semester students will be challenged to apply the models and theories from class to real world situations.
