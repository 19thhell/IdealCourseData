Individual teachers may have more stringent requirements for the sections they teach.           Course goals and parameters           Students will learn to write a variety of essays, with increasingly complex requirements, as they move across the semester and into the next course. The writing courses provide a foundation for work in the university by teaching students to construct essays and arguments that reflect an ability to read critically, question evidence, make relevant connections, develop ideas, and present their own ideas in coherent, compelling essays. In our writing courses, students create essays through a progression of reading, writing, and thinking exercises that lead them to develop their own ideas and their own essays. Progressions give students practice in the skills necessary for writing the particular kind of essay they're being asked to write. Although the activities in a given progression generate writing toward an essay draft, drafting does not mean cutting and pasting these exercises. Instead, the work of drafting an essay involves the thoughtful reworking of these pieces into one coherent text.           Classroom Decorum           The classroom should be a place where the free exchange of ideas can occur in an atmosphere of mutual trust and respect. Teachers and students are encouraged to bring serious breaches of decorum to the attention of the Directors (998-8860). This includes problems such as non-performance of class obligations, disruptive or disrespectful behavior, and prejudice on the basis of gender, race or sexual orientation. According to the University policy on student conduct, &quot;Behavior which...disrupts the educational activities...of the University, is subject to review and possible penalty.&quot; All complaints are kept confidential.           Portfolio/Grades           Students will write three essays. They must always submit drafts of their major papers, not just the final version. Final versions are graded. All students should receive a mid-term grade, indicating how they are progressing in the course. There should be an opportunity for students to revise one of these essays after the grade has been given; however, it is always the student's responsibility to provide substantive revision. It is the teacher's responsibility to guide revisions, but not specifically to direct them. All students should receive information about how grades are determined. Ninety percent of the grade should be based on the final essays. Students must keep all writing done in the course, including drafts, final papers, and informal writing (e.g. journal entries, in-class writing, homework assignments). This writing should be kept together as a portfolio of work (organized in a file folder or three-ring binder). Students must submit the portfolio to their teachers upon request. All final versions of major papers must be typed or printed from a computer. These papers should be double-spaced, with 1&quot; margins. Students are responsible for collecting their portfolios after course grades have been determined. Portfolios are discarded in the middle of the following semester.           Conferences           During the semester students are expected to have at least two conferences with their writing teacher to obtain feedback on a draft. Twenty minutes is the minimum time allowed for conferences.           Attendance and Preparedness           Because much of the learning in writing courses occurs through active discussion and in-class writing rather than through lectures, it is essential that students attend class, come prepared, and participate. Students with absences or habitual lateness will have their grades lowered, even though they may have completed their required assignments. Students should explain the reason for an absence at the time it occurs. Documented medical conditions and the observance of religious holidays are legitimate excuses for absences; however, students are still responsible for what has been missed. Students should understand that absence for whatever reason will have some bearing on the ability to fulfill the requirements for the final essay. Students with four absences of any kind may fail the course.           How to contact us           Directors will be happy to respond to student inquiries, questions, and concerns.

New York University Expository Writing Program           Return to top of page                     Statement on Academic Integrity           Students are expected-often required-to build their work on that of other people, just as professional researchers and writers do. Giving credit to someone whose work has helped you is expected; in fact, not to give such credit is a crime. Plagiarism is the severest form of academic fraud. Plagiarism is theft. More specifically, plagiarism is presenting as your own:                      a phrase, sentence, or passage from another writer's work without using quotation marks;            a paraphrased passage from another writer's work;            facts, ideas, or written text gathered or downloaded from the Internet;            another student's work with your name on it;            a purchased paper or &quot;research&quot; from a term paper mill.                     Other forms of academic fraud include:                      &quot;collaborating&quot; between two or more students who then submit the same paper under their individual names.            submitting the same paper for two or more courses without the knowledge and the expressed permission of all teachers involved.            giving permission to another student to use your work for a class.                     Term paper mills (web sites and businesses set up to sell papers to students) often claim they are merely offering &quot;information&quot; or &quot;research&quot; to students and that this service is acceptable and allowed throughout the university. THIS IS ABSOLUTELY UNTRUE. If you buy and submit &quot;research,&quot; drafts, summaries, abstracts, or final versions of a paper, you are committing plagiarism and are subject to stringent disciplinary action. Since plagiarism is a matter of fact and not intention, it is crucial that you acknowledge every source accurately and completely. If you quote anything from a source, use quotation marks and take down the page number of the quotation to use in your footnote.           Consult The Modern Language Association (MLA) Style Guide for accepted forms of documentation, and the course handbook for information on using electronic sources. When in doubt about whether your acknowledgment is proper and adequate, consult your teacher. Show the teacher your sources and a draft of the paper in which you are using them. The obligation to demonstrate that work is your own rests with you, the student. You are responsible for providing sources, copies of your work, or verification of the date work was completed.           The academic community takes plagiarism very seriously. Teachers in our writing courses must report to the Director of the Expository Writing Program any instance of academic dishonesty in student writing, whether it occurs in an exercise, draft, or final essay. Students will be asked to explain the circumstances of work called into question. When plagiarism is confirmed, whether accidental or deliberate, students must be reported to the Dean of their School, and penalties will follow. This can result in failure of the essay, failure in the course, a hearing with the Dean, and/or expulsion from the university. This has happened to students at New York University.

Through a series of conferences, site visits, and seminars, the course examines four key moments or themes as a means of apprehending the density of French cultural, social, and political life. Starting with French republicanism, past, present, and future, we consider how France, at once the preeminent site of experiments in democratic liberty, is also plagued by institutional entrenchments of class stratification and the dual specters of colonialism and post-colonialism. Turning to Paris, the \u201ccapital of modernity,\u201d we reflect on its 19th century emergence as a locus of phantasmagoria, mystery, and seduction, and the emergent capitalist forces that were shaping the urban landscape. We consider the early 20th century avant-garde, among the most important and radical artistic and political movements of our time, that opened new spaces in which to imagine the very terms of \u201cart\u201d and \u201cpolitics,\u201d to finish with a consideration of France in the contemporary moment, wrestling with global transformations, the crisis of the welfare state, and a tension between the reproduction of elites and a political commitment to equality that increasingly troubles the country\u2019s educational system, politics, and cultural life.     Interdisciplinary and \u201cinter-textual\u201d in scope, the course fuses expert lectures, textual analysis, and out of the classroom experience, to bring together the artistic, the literary, and the social scientific, against the backdrop of global transformation.   Class organization and assignments     This is a required course for all students at NYUParis. Students meet in assigned groups according to their language level; students with an advanced level of French may do their coursework in French. Students are expected to attend all conferences and site visits, to do the assigned readings and to participate in class discussions.

Beginning with the grandeur of Paris during the Belle Epoque and the Exposition Universelle of 1900, and moving to the violence and tragedy of World Wars I and II, this course examines the French modernist art movements of the first part of the 20th century. After identifying the origins of modernism in the late 19th century with Impressionism and Post-Impressionism, we will consider the ways in which Fauvism, Cubism, Expressionism, and Primitivism redefined modernism for the 20th century. Working with Dada and Surrealist art works, we will evaluate the relationship between humor, critique, and cultural and political dissension in artistic production. Finally, we will examine the trans-Atlantic currents of Abstraction, looking at Abstract Expressionism, L\u2019Art Informel, and the Nouveau Realistes. Throughout this exploration, we will interrogate how social history, shaped by politics, gender, and race, informed the construction of an artistic modernism in the 20th century.

London on the Thames takes close runner-up position. But more than mythic, popular-culture stage sets, these two great European capitals operate as spectacular rival models in face of real-life, 21st-century dramas. Our course concentrates on a sequence of case studies targeting the evolving architecture and urban plan of Paris. We focus on current thematic debates crucial to its identity, survival and future\u2014tradition contra innovation, continuity contra rupture, preservation contra demolition, obsolescence contra revitalization. We investigate controversies over the low- and high-density city; legislation on building heights, protection of skyline and riverbanks; the interface between historic and experimental building types; the balance between public and private space, residential and mixed-economy neighbourhoods, inner-city rehabilitation and suburban sprawl; intra- and extra-muros transportation systems (road, rail, river, air). As a foil and finale to our Paris studies, we conclude with a critical comparative analysis of contemporary London to illuminate fundamental differences between these two global cities: the rational French model largely tempered by state control against the exuberant English model predominantly driven by ultra-liberal policies. Will the third millennium ideal city emerge as a polymorphic combination of the two approaches? Conducted in English .

Consideration of the historical influences upon and the historical impact of French thinkers. Through close readings and analysis of selected passages from primary sources (in English translation), and those few seminal non-French works that inspired new directions in French thought, we will explore the intellectual framework and historical references that inform French debates on politics and society to the present day. Philosophers to be considered include St. Thomas Aquinas, Machiavelli, Montaigne, de la Fontaine, Descartes, Montesquieu, Rousseau, Napoleon Bonaparte, Saint-Simon, Prudhon, Marx, Jules Ferry, Zola, Fanon, Camus, and Sartre.

We will discover the playwright Moli\u00e8re (1622-1673) who was also an actor, troupe leader, and the author of numerous plays which remain to this day the most frequently staged plays in France. The recurring themes in his plays will be discussed, particularly in relation to the time period during which the plays were written. We will also touch on the role of farce in the work of this playwright who was nicknamed in the 17th century \u201cthe foremost joker in France.\u201d Dramatic analysis of the plays chosen will require a comparative study of texts in French and in English.   We will read and analyze these texts out loud. Certain excerpts will need to be memorized. We will analyze the ideas expressed as well as the importance of certain words, of the images evoked, and of the punctuation used in order to bring to life the rhythm and musicality of the phrases. The ultimate objective of this course will be to arouse the creativity of each student with regard to the many possibilities for modern interpretation, notably in reimagining d\u00e9cor, costumes, and Moli\u00e8re\u2019s stances.   T he texts studied will be excerpts from the following Moli\u00e8re plays: Tartuffe, The Misanthrope, The Miser, The Bourgeois Gentleman, The Doctor in Spite of Himself, and Don Juan . The students will also be required to read three plays of their choice in their entirety.   Conducted in English.                                                                      Studies in Prose Genres: Post-Colonial Readings of Classic Texts - FREN-UA 9833 or COLIT-UA 9125 - 4 points                               In this course we focus on four contemporary novels in which the world of the character, the narrator, or the author, is read through the lens of a literary classic. In each case, the reading and rewriting of the primary text involves temporal and spatial displacements (from the 18th to the 20th century, from Europe to the Caribbean and to the South Pacific) that generate shifting perspectives and a constant reshuffling of center and periphery. Between a reverential affiliation to the past and a creative misreading and rewriting of it, these intertextual encounters with \u00ab great \u00bb Western literary works insistently raise the questions of identity, originality, and \u201cwriting back\u201d. Exploring these questions will therefore also involve drawing on comparative, translation, and postcolonial studies.

Our course explores the dramatic evolution of French art across 200 tumultuous years, from its classical origins under Louis XIII and Louis XIV's Old Regime, through its transformations across the Enlightenment period, to its radical Neo-Classical revision during the French Revolution, and Romantic reconstruction at the demise of the Napoleonic era and Bourbon Restoration, ending with the 1830 Revolution. Through analysis of the reciprocity between artists and the political-cultural institutions of Paris, we examine the ways by which art \u2015painting, architecture, popular prints, caricatures\u2015operates as a potent discursive programme within French society. Its role as a dense symbolic language of communication and persuasion, and/or as a critique of social and moral values dominates our investigation. It also serves as a model to investigate the role of contemporary electronic and print media and their influence on our perceptions of society and the representation of power in the global world.

Through the study of novels and autobiographies by Breton, Hemingway, Stein, Duras, Modiano, de Beauvoir, and Baldwin, we will ask, what is the role of place in the imagining or invention of the self? How does the experience of a specific city, Paris, influence the formation of identity? How do these authors represent, or subvert, the notion of the \u2018real\u2019? Although the focus of this course is literary, we will also engage with major political, cultural, and artistic movements of the period, exploring the ways in which our writers negotiate history through their writings.

Turn a corner and in the distance you'll see the Arc de Triomphe built to the glory of Napoleon's army or the Eiffel tower erected for the centennial of the fall of the Bastille. Even the metro stops, Concorde, Nation, R\u00e9publique, Austerlitz, I\u00e9na, echo with the memory of the years of the French Revolution and the First Empire.  But what historic reality does all this evoke? What led some French people to overthrow their age old Monarchy, turn their backs on the Church and launch into a new era of Republican government? What caused others to resist such changes with all their might? And why did the experiment end within 10 years, giving way to military dictatorship and an Empire which spread French rule across Europe.

Beginning with the epistemological and metaphysical debates that followed the rediscovery of Ancient philosophy and the Copernican revolution in the sciences, we will consider Montaigne\u2019s skepticism, Descartes\u2019 attempts at securing our knowledge of the soul, God, and the external world, and Condillac\u2019s empiricist critique of Descartes\u2019 theory of knowledge. We will then focus on major developments in French political philosophy in the 18th and 19th centuries, closely intertwined with political events in France at the time, including such figures as Rousseau, Proudhon, and Tocqueville. Finally, we will look at two of the major movements in French philosophy in the first half of the 20th century: Henri Bergson\u2019s attempts to understand the temporal duration conscious beings inhabit, and Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir\u2019s distinctive development of existentialism, a philosophy that grapples with the radical consequences of human freedom.

Students are invited to appropriate Paris through various writing activities, inspired by writers such as Baudelaire, Perec, or Modiano, designed to help students capture the city through its movements, its images, and its different facets. The regular practice of creative writing as well as systematic re-writing of all work will allow students to reinforce grammatical structures while expanding vocabulary. Conducted in French.

Paris of the 19th and early 20th centuries developed into a major urban center, in part because of the promise of liberty that drew people there following the upheavals of the Revolution. The urban renewal that occurred under the Second Empire in the mid-19th century in particular transformed the capital into a modern city of innovation and spectacle. While the official arts reflected the tastes and priorities of successive governments and the emergent bourgeoisie, it was the avant-garde that most marked the city as a site of resistance and daring. In this course we study these different art movements as they relate to the city of Paris, studying the sites, movements, and transformations that helped shape the modern arts. Conducted in French.   Sample Syllabus                                                                    The Birth of Democracy in Europe - FREN-UA 9091 or HIST-UA 9091 or POL-UA 9591 - 4 points                               We begin with a definition of the term &quot;democracy&quot; as developed by the Athenian City-State in the 5th century before Christ, before moving on to discuss its reappraisal by such theoreticians of the 17th century as Locke, or of the Enlightenment, such as Montesquieu and Rousseau. Their versions, indeed, serve as the basis for the French Revolution of 1789. A long and difficult process, democracy needed nearly a century before establishing itself in France. Drawing on numerous examples from 19th and 20th century history, we will try to understand why the great contributions of democracy, such as universal suffrage and the concept of individual liberty, were so difficult to put into operation. We will also consider why these &quot;givens&quot; are still fragile. Conducted in French.

The first half of the course focuses on the political, socio-economic, and cultural history of France in the modern period, from roughly 1870 to the 1980. The second half of the course looks more closely at the contemporary period, focusing on the various \u2018crises\u2019 and transitions that have marked France during the past 20 years. Topics include the challenges of the post-colonial period (immigration, la francophonie, questions of identity), France in and of the European Union, France and globalization, and social issues in current events (the status of women, la banlieue, social exclusion).

The course will offer insights and analyses on the different roles which are played by France and the United States on the issues of youth, women, and Modern Islam in the Arab World and on how their soft power is perceived by the Arab countries and their populations. By addressing the foreign policies that have been articulated in the region, we will also bring into light the dichotomy between the \u201cold\u201d and the \u201cnew\u201d diplomacy.

In particular, we consider the French existentialists\u2019 concern for commitment in political and social affairs, and how this is reflected in \u201ctheatre of the absurd,\u201d in fiction, and in critical work of other contemporary French writers. Covers Ionesco, Beckett, Genet, Robbe-Grillet, and Barthes; precursors of the absurd such as Kafka and C\u00e9line; some consideration may be given in addition to practitioners of the absurd outside of France.

Paris, City of Theater - FREN-UA 9968 - 4 points                               Since the 17th century Paris has been as a city of and for the theatre, from the great sites and  events that have marked theatre history, to the spectacle and fantasy that the city imparts.  In this course, we study the great works of French theatre, from the classics to the very  contemporary, through readings, performances, and visits in and around Paris to the lieux  de m\u00e9moire of the theatre world. Through the study of works by Corneille, Moli\u00e8re, Hugo,  Feydeau, Ionesco, Beckett, Sartre, and others, we consider how Paris has been integral to and  shaped by the world of French theatre. Visits include such prestigious venues as the Com\u00e9die  Fran\u00e7aise, the grands boulevards where Parisians discovered Shakespeare in the age of Sarah  Bernhardt, the remains of the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Marais where Corneille performed his plays, or  Versailles where Moli\u00e8re helped lead the grand spectacle that was life under Louis XIV.

Between Fiction and Reality: New York and Paris - SOC-UA 9461 or SCA-UA 9624 - 4 points                                As major metropolises, Paris and New York are deeply engaged in processes of globalization: each has to stay competitive, to accumulate wealth, to hold on to its inhabitants as well as to attract tourists, business professionals, students, and immigrants. Each dreams of one day becoming a \u201cgreen\u201d city. Danger also exists in both of these cities, amplified by rumor and fantasy. In this course we will study these phenomena through the analysis of novels, films, television series, artwork, and architecture, to ask how various representations of the city have changed and been managed over time, by diverse social actors and observers.

Course offerings and schedules at the University of Paris are confirmed later than the in-house courses at NYUParis. Direct enrollment at the University of Paris is therefore handled after students\u2019 arrival in Paris. Further instructions, course offerings and schedules will be communicated during the orientation period in Paris.    Please read the information about each university\u2019s specialty areas below, keeping in mind that you will only be able to take courses at the university for which you are administratively enrolled (see above). Past course offerings are listed here for reference only. Please keep in mind that finalized course lists and times will not be available until your arrival in Paris.

Prerequisite: Written Contemporary French or permission of the NYU Paris staff.   NYU Paris students with advanced French language skills may attend one to two lecture courses in French at the prestigious Institut d\u2019Etudes Politiques de Paris, more commonly known as Sciences Po. Students wishing to enroll at Sciences Po in Fall 2015 must first submit the following application form to NYU Paris by April 10th, 2015 indicating their year, major, French level (current or most recently completed French language course), and GPA. We will provide deadlines for future semesters at a later date. Students will also be asked to send a short personal statement (1-2 paragraphs) stating their motivations for studying at Sciences Po as part of their application. Upon successful review of their applications, students will be invited to apply to Sciences Po in late April or early May. Application materials for Sciences Po include a transcript, CV, and statement of purpose. Please note that NYU Paris students are not necessarily guaranteed a spot at Sciences Po, so it is in students' best interest to submit a strong application.   Once students are admitted to Sciences Po, they will be able to select their courses over the summer using the Sciences Po online student portal. NYU Paris strongly encourages students admitted to Sciences Po to take only courses in French, and to take no more than 2 courses during the semester (subject to approval). It is expected that most students will take only one course per semester at Sciences Po. In exceptional cases, students may take a course in English upon approval by NYU Paris. A selection of past lecture course offerings is listed below for reference.   Please note: students wishing to attend a course at Sciences Po should enroll administratively at the University of Paris (University of Paris I, III, or VII), but will need to apply separately to Sciences Po in order to take a course at Sciences Po.

Individual teachers may have more stringent requirements for the sections they teach.           Course goals and parameters           Students will learn to write a variety of essays, with increasingly complex requirements, as they move across the semester and into the next course. The writing courses provide a foundation for work in the university by teaching students to construct essays and arguments that reflect an ability to read critically, question evidence, make relevant connections, develop ideas, and present their own ideas in coherent, compelling essays. In our writing courses, students create essays through a progression of reading, writing, and thinking exercises that lead them to develop their own ideas and their own essays. Progressions give students practice in the skills necessary for writing the particular kind of essay they're being asked to write. Although the activities in a given progression generate writing toward an essay draft, drafting does not mean cutting and pasting these exercises. Instead, the work of drafting an essay involves the thoughtful reworking of these pieces into one coherent text.           Classroom Decorum           The classroom should be a place where the free exchange of ideas can occur in an atmosphere of mutual trust and respect. Teachers and students are encouraged to bring serious breaches of decorum to the attention of the Directors (998-8860). This includes problems such as non-performance of class obligations, disruptive or disrespectful behavior, and prejudice on the basis of gender, race or sexual orientation. According to the University policy on student conduct, &quot;Behavior which...disrupts the educational activities...of the University, is subject to review and possible penalty.&quot; All complaints are kept confidential.           Portfolio/Grades           Students will write three essays. They must always submit drafts of their major papers, not just the final version. Final versions are graded. All students should receive a mid-term grade, indicating how they are progressing in the course. There should be an opportunity for students to revise one of these essays after the grade has been given; however, it is always the student's responsibility to provide substantive revision. It is the teacher's responsibility to guide revisions, but not specifically to direct them. All students should receive information about how grades are determined. Ninety percent of the grade should be based on the final essays. Students must keep all writing done in the course, including drafts, final papers, and informal writing (e.g. journal entries, in-class writing, homework assignments). This writing should be kept together as a portfolio of work (organized in a file folder or three-ring binder). Students must submit the portfolio to their teachers upon request. All final versions of major papers must be typed or printed from a computer. These papers should be double-spaced, with 1&quot; margins. Students are responsible for collecting their portfolios after course grades have been determined. Portfolios are discarded in the middle of the following semester.           Conferences           During the semester students are expected to have at least two conferences with their writing teacher to obtain feedback on a draft. Twenty minutes is the minimum time allowed for conferences.           Attendance and Preparedness           Because much of the learning in writing courses occurs through active discussion and in-class writing rather than through lectures, it is essential that students attend class, come prepared, and participate. Students with absences or habitual lateness will have their grades lowered, even though they may have completed their required assignments. Students should explain the reason for an absence at the time it occurs. Documented medical conditions and the observance of religious holidays are legitimate excuses for absences; however, students are still responsible for what has been missed. Students should understand that absence for whatever reason will have some bearing on the ability to fulfill the requirements for the final essay. Students with four absences of any kind may fail the course.           How to contact us           Directors will be happy to respond to student inquiries, questions, and concerns. You can schedule appointments at 411 Lafayette, 4th Floor , telephone 212 998-8860 , or email ewp@nyu.edu for an appointment.           New York University Expository Writing Program           Return to top of page                     Statement on Academic Integrity           Students are expected-often required-to build their work on that of other people, just as professional researchers and writers do. Giving credit to someone whose work has helped you is expected; in fact, not to give such credit is a crime. Plagiarism is the severest form of academic fraud. Plagiarism is theft. More specifically, plagiarism is presenting as your own:                      a phrase, sentence, or passage from another writer's work without using quotation marks;            a paraphrased passage from another writer's work;            facts, ideas, or written text gathered or downloaded from the Internet;            another student's work with your name on it;            a purchased paper or &quot;research&quot; from a term paper mill.                     Other forms of academic fraud include:                      &quot;collaborating&quot; between two or more students who then submit the same paper under their individual names.            submitting the same paper for two or more courses without the knowledge and the expressed permission of all teachers involved.            giving permission to another student to use your work for a class.                     Term paper mills (web sites and businesses set up to sell papers to students) often claim they are merely offering &quot;information&quot; or &quot;research&quot; to students and that this service is acceptable and allowed throughout the university. THIS IS ABSOLUTELY UNTRUE. If you buy and submit &quot;research,&quot; drafts, summaries, abstracts, or final versions of a paper, you are committing plagiarism and are subject to stringent disciplinary action. Since plagiarism is a matter of fact and not intention, it is crucial that you acknowledge every source accurately and completely. If you quote anything from a source, use quotation marks and take down the page number of the quotation to use in your footnote.           Consult The Modern Language Association (MLA) Style Guide for accepted forms of documentation, and the course handbook for information on using electronic sources. When in doubt about whether your acknowledgment is proper and adequate, consult your teacher. Show the teacher your sources and a draft of the paper in which you are using them. The obligation to demonstrate that work is your own rests with you, the student. You are responsible for providing sources, copies of your work, or verification of the date work was completed.           The academic community takes plagiarism very seriously. Teachers in our writing courses must report to the Director of the Expository Writing Program any instance of academic dishonesty in student writing, whether it occurs in an exercise, draft, or final essay. Students will be asked to explain the circumstances of work called into question. When plagiarism is confirmed, whether accidental or deliberate, students must be reported to the Dean of their School, and penalties will follow. This can result in failure of the essay, failure in the course, a hearing with the Dean, and/or expulsion from the university. This has happened to students at New York University.

Through a series of conferences, site visits, and seminars, the course examines four key moments or themes as a means of apprehending the density of French cultural, social, and political life. Starting with French republicanism, past, present, and future, we consider how France, at once the preeminent site of experiments in democratic liberty, is also plagued by institutional entrenchments of class stratification and the dual specters of colonialism and post-colonialism. Turning to Paris, the \u201ccapital of modernity,\u201d we reflect on its 19th century emergence as a locus of phantasmagoria, mystery, and seduction, and the emergent capitalist forces that were shaping the urban landscape. We consider the early 20th century avant-garde, among the most important and radical artistic and political movements of our time, that opened new spaces in which to imagine the very terms of \u201cart\u201d and \u201cpolitics,\u201d to finish with a consideration of France in the contemporary moment, wrestling with global transformations, the crisis of the welfare state, and a tension between the reproduction of elites and a political commitment to equality that increasingly troubles the country\u2019s educational system, politics, and cultural life.     Interdisciplinary and \u201cinter-textual\u201d in scope, the course fuses expert lectures, textual analysis, and out of the classroom experience, to bring together the artistic, the literary, and the social scientific, against the backdrop of global transformation.   Class organization and assignments     This is a required course for all students at NYUParis. Students meet in assigned groups according to their language level; students with an advanced level of French may do their coursework in French. Students are expected to attend all conferences and site visits, to do the assigned readings and to participate in class discussions.

Beginning with the grandeur of Paris during the Belle Epoque and the Exposition Universelle of 1900, and moving to the violence and tragedy of World Wars I and II, this course examines the French modernist art movements of the first part of the 20th century. After identifying the origins of modernism in the late 19th century with Impressionism and Post-Impressionism, we will consider the ways in which Fauvism, Cubism, Expressionism, and Primitivism redefined modernism for the 20th century. Working with Dada and Surrealist art works, we will evaluate the relationship between humor, critique, and cultural and political dissension in artistic production. Finally, we will examine the trans-Atlantic currents of Abstraction, looking at Abstract Expressionism, L\u2019Art Informel, and the Nouveau Realistes. Throughout this exploration, we will interrogate how social history, shaped by politics, gender, and race, informed the construction of an artistic modernism in the 20th century.

London on the Thames takes close runner-up position. But more than mythic, popular-culture stage sets, these two great European capitals operate as spectacular rival models in face of real-life, 21st-century dramas. Our course concentrates on a sequence of case studies targeting the evolving architecture and urban plan of Paris. We focus on current thematic debates crucial to its identity, survival and future\u2014tradition contra innovation, continuity contra rupture, preservation contra demolition, obsolescence contra revitalization. We investigate controversies over the low- and high-density city; legislation on building heights, protection of skyline and riverbanks; the interface between historic and experimental building types; the balance between public and private space, residential and mixed-economy neighbourhoods, inner-city rehabilitation and suburban sprawl; intra- and extra-muros transportation systems (road, rail, river, air). As a foil and finale to our Paris studies, we conclude with a critical comparative analysis of contemporary London to illuminate fundamental differences between these two global cities: the rational French model largely tempered by state control against the exuberant English model predominantly driven by ultra-liberal policies. Will the third millennium ideal city emerge as a polymorphic combination of the two approaches? Conducted in English .

This course aims to understand and appreciate the creativity and dynamism of the Parisian art scene today through an exploration of contemporary art in the capital. The course will focus on the diversity of resources provided by the city, with special attention to new artistic practices and loci of production, as well as the multiple actors involved, from artists themselves to private galleries to art critics and museum curators. Reference to major avant-garde art movements of the past such as dada, geometrical abstraction, surrealism and expressionism will also be made in order to better situate today\u2019s artistic concerns.

Consideration of the historical influences upon and the historical impact of French thinkers. Through close readings and analysis of selected passages from primary sources (in English translation), and those few seminal non-French works that inspired new directions in French thought, we will explore the intellectual framework and historical references that inform French debates on politics and society to the present day. Philosophers to be considered include St. Thomas Aquinas, Machiavelli, Montaigne, de la Fontaine, Descartes, Montesquieu, Rousseau, Napoleon Bonaparte, Saint-Simon, Prudhon, Marx, Jules Ferry, Zola, Fanon, Camus, and Sartre.

We will discover the playwright Moli\u00e8re (1622-1673) who was also an actor, troupe leader, and the author of numerous plays which remain to this day the most frequently staged plays in France. The recurring themes in his plays will be discussed, particularly in relation to the time period during which the plays were written. We will also touch on the role of farce in the work of this playwright who was nicknamed in the 17th century \u201cthe foremost joker in France.\u201d Dramatic analysis of the plays chosen will require a comparative study of texts in French and in English.   We will read and analyze these texts out loud. Certain excerpts will need to be memorized. We will analyze the ideas expressed as well as the importance of certain words, of the images evoked, and of the punctuation used in order to bring to life the rhythm and musicality of the phrases. The ultimate objective of this course will be to arouse the creativity of each student with regard to the many possibilities for modern interpretation, notably in reimagining d\u00e9cor, costumes, and Moli\u00e8re\u2019s stances.   T he texts studied will be excerpts from the following Moli\u00e8re plays: Tartuffe, The Misanthrope, The Miser, The Bourgeois Gentleman, The Doctor in Spite of Himself, and Don Juan . The students will also be required to read three plays of their choice in their entirety.   Conducted in English.                                                                      Studies in Prose Genres: Post-Colonial Readings of Classic Texts - FREN-UA 9833 or COLIT-UA 9125 - 4 points                               In this course we focus on four contemporary novels in which the world of the character, the narrator, or the author, is read through the lens of a literary classic. In each case, the reading and rewriting of the primary text involves temporal and spatial displacements (from the 18th to the 20th century, from Europe to the Caribbean and to the South Pacific) that generate shifting perspectives and a constant reshuffling of center and periphery. Between a reverential affiliation to the past and a creative misreading and rewriting of it, these intertextual encounters with \u00ab great \u00bb Western literary works insistently raise the questions of identity, originality, and \u201cwriting back\u201d. Exploring these questions will therefore also involve drawing on comparative, translation, and postcolonial studies.

Our course explores the dramatic evolution of French art across 200 tumultuous years, from its classical origins under Louis XIII and Louis XIV's Old Regime, through its transformations across the Enlightenment period, to its radical Neo-Classical revision during the French Revolution, and Romantic reconstruction at the demise of the Napoleonic era and Bourbon Restoration, ending with the 1830 Revolution. Through analysis of the reciprocity between artists and the political-cultural institutions of Paris, we examine the ways by which art \u2015painting, architecture, popular prints, caricatures\u2015operates as a potent discursive programme within French society. Its role as a dense symbolic language of communication and persuasion, and/or as a critique of social and moral values dominates our investigation. It also serves as a model to investigate the role of contemporary electronic and print media and their influence on our perceptions of society and the representation of power in the global world.

Through the study of novels and autobiographies by Breton, Hemingway, Stein, Duras, Modiano, de Beauvoir, and Baldwin, we will ask, what is the role of place in the imagining or invention of the self? How does the experience of a specific city, Paris, influence the formation of identity? How do these authors represent, or subvert, the notion of the \u2018real\u2019? Although the focus of this course is literary, we will also engage with major political, cultural, and artistic movements of the period, exploring the ways in which our writers negotiate history through their writings.

Turn a corner and in the distance you'll see the Arc de Triomphe built to the glory of Napoleon's army or the Eiffel tower erected for the centennial of the fall of the Bastille. Even the metro stops, Concorde, Nation, R\u00e9publique, Austerlitz, I\u00e9na, echo with the memory of the years of the French Revolution and the First Empire.  But what historic reality does all this evoke? What led some French people to overthrow their age old Monarchy, turn their backs on the Church and launch into a new era of Republican government? What caused others to resist such changes with all their might? And why did the experiment end within 10 years, giving way to military dictatorship and an Empire which spread French rule across Europe.  This semester we shall explore these issues and others pertaining to the Age of the French Revolution &amp; Napoleon through lectures, readings, discussions and site visits in and around the city of Paris.

Beginning with the epistemological and metaphysical debates that followed the rediscovery of Ancient philosophy and the Copernican revolution in the sciences, we will consider Montaigne\u2019s skepticism, Descartes\u2019 attempts at securing our knowledge of the soul, God, and the external world, and Condillac\u2019s empiricist critique of Descartes\u2019 theory of knowledge. We will then focus on major developments in French political philosophy in the 18th and 19th centuries, closely intertwined with political events in France at the time, including such figures as Rousseau, Proudhon, and Tocqueville. Finally, we will look at two of the major movements in French philosophy in the first half of the 20th century: Henri Bergson\u2019s attempts to understand the temporal duration conscious beings inhabit, and Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir\u2019s distinctive development of existentialism, a philosophy that grapples with the radical consequences of human freedom.

The technological, mediological, and digital worlds constitute a part of a shared material culture with profound implications for human experience.

Paris of the 19th and early 20th centuries developed into a major urban center, in part because of the promise of liberty that drew people there following the upheavals of the Revolution. The urban renewal that occurred under the Second Empire in the mid-19th century in particular transformed the capital into a modern city of innovation and spectacle. While the official arts reflected the tastes and priorities of successive governments and the emergent bourgeoisie, it was the avant-garde that most marked the city as a site of resistance and daring. In this course we study these different art movements as they relate to the city of Paris, studying the sites, movements, and transformations that helped shape the modern arts. Conducted in French.   Sample Syllabus                                                                    The Birth of Democracy in Europe - FREN-UA 9091 or HIST-UA 9091 or POL-UA 9591 - 4 points                               We begin with a definition of the term &quot;democracy&quot; as developed by the Athenian City-State in the 5th century before Christ, before moving on to discuss its reappraisal by such theoreticians of the 17th century as Locke, or of the Enlightenment, such as Montesquieu and Rousseau. Their versions, indeed, serve as the basis for the French Revolution of 1789. A long and difficult process, democracy needed nearly a century before establishing itself in France. Drawing on numerous examples from 19th and 20th century history, we will try to understand why the great contributions of democracy, such as universal suffrage and the concept of individual liberty, were so difficult to put into operation. We will also consider why these &quot;givens&quot; are still fragile. Conducted in French.

The first half of the course focuses on the political, socio-economic, and cultural history of France in the modern period, from roughly 1870 to the 1980. The second half of the course looks more closely at the contemporary period, focusing on the various \u2018crises\u2019 and transitions that have marked France during the past 20 years. Topics include the challenges of the post-colonial period (immigration, la francophonie, questions of identity), France in and of the European Union, France and globalization, and social issues in current events (the status of women, la banlieue, social exclusion).

The course will offer insights and analyses on the different roles which are played by France and the United States on the issues of youth, women, and Modern Islam in the Arab World and on how their soft power is perceived by the Arab countries and their populations. By addressing the foreign policies that have been articulated in the region, we will also bring into light the dichotomy between the \u201cold\u201d and the \u201cnew\u201d diplomacy.

In particular, we consider the French existentialists\u2019 concern for commitment in political and social affairs, and how this is reflected in \u201ctheatre of the absurd,\u201d in fiction, and in critical work of other contemporary French writers. Covers Ionesco, Beckett, Genet, Robbe-Grillet, and Barthes; precursors of the absurd such as Kafka and C\u00e9line; some consideration may be given in addition to practitioners of the absurd outside of France.

Paris, City of Theater - FREN-UA 9968 - 4 points                               Since the 17th century Paris has been as a city of and for the theatre, from the great sites and  events that have marked theatre history, to the spectacle and fantasy that the city imparts.  In this course, we study the great works of French theatre, from the classics to the very  contemporary, through readings, performances, and visits in and around Paris to the lieux  de m\u00e9moire of the theatre world. Through the study of works by Corneille, Moli\u00e8re, Hugo,  Feydeau, Ionesco, Beckett, Sartre, and others, we consider how Paris has been integral to and  shaped by the world of French theatre. Visits include such prestigious venues as the Com\u00e9die  Fran\u00e7aise, the grands boulevards where Parisians discovered Shakespeare in the age of Sarah  Bernhardt, the remains of the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Marais where Corneille performed his plays, or  Versailles where Moli\u00e8re helped lead the grand spectacle that was life under Louis XIV.

Between Fiction and Reality: New York and Paris - SOC-UA 9461 or SCA-UA 9624 - 4 points                                As major metropolises, Paris and New York are deeply engaged in processes of globalization: each has to stay competitive, to accumulate wealth, to hold on to its inhabitants as well as to attract tourists, business professionals, students, and immigrants. Each dreams of one day becoming a \u201cgreen\u201d city. Danger also exists in both of these cities, amplified by rumor and fantasy. In this course we will study these phenomena through the analysis of novels, films, television series, artwork, and architecture, to ask how various representations of the city have changed and been managed over time, by diverse social actors and observers.

Direct Enrollment at French Partner Universities   NYUParis students may enroll in one or more courses offered at the University of Paris schools with which we have partner agreements (University of Paris I, III, VII, X), and at specialized schools (Institut d\u2019E\u0301tudes Politiques, otherwise known as Sciences Po).   Courses available in English are offered within the Departments of Anglo-American Studies and examine various aspects of culture and civilization of the English-speaking world.    Courses offered in French are selected from the following departments: French and Comparative Literature, History, Art History, Sociology, Studio Art, Cinema, Political Science. Students must either have taken or be currently enrolled in Written Contemporary French to take a course in French at the University of Paris. In addition, students complement their coursework in individualized tutorial sessions with a tutor at NYUParis.     Students may only take courses at the University in which they are administratively enrolled (with the exception of Sciences Po - see below). You will be asked to choose which university you prefer when filling out your visa questionnaire from the Office of Global Services.    Course offerings and schedules at the University of Paris are confirmed later than the in-house courses at NYUParis. Direct enrollment at the University of Paris is therefore handled after students\u2019 arrival in Paris. Further instructions, course offerings and schedules will be communicated during the orientation period in Paris.    Please read the information about each university\u2019s specialty areas below, keeping in mind that you will only be able to take courses at the university for which you are administratively enrolled (see above). Past course offerings are listed here for reference only. Please keep in mind that finalized course lists and times will not be available until your arrival in Paris.

Prerequisite: Written Contemporary French or permission of the NYU Paris staff.   NYU Paris students with advanced French language skills may attend one to two lecture courses in French at the prestigious Institut d\u2019Etudes Politiques de Paris, more commonly known as Sciences Po. Students wishing to enroll at Sciences Po in Fall 2015 must first submit the following application form to NYU Paris by April 10th, 2015 indicating their year, major, French level (current or most recently completed French language course), and GPA. We will provide deadlines for future semesters at a later date. Students will also be asked to send a short personal statement (1-2 paragraphs) stating their motivations for studying at Sciences Po as part of their application. Upon successful review of their applications, students will be invited to apply to Sciences Po in late April or early May. Application materials for Sciences Po include a transcript, CV, and statement of purpose. Please note that NYU Paris students are not necessarily guaranteed a spot at Sciences Po, so it is in students' best interest to submit a strong application.   Once students are admitted to Sciences Po, they will be able to select their courses over the summer using the Sciences Po online student portal. NYU Paris strongly encourages students admitted to Sciences Po to take only courses in French, and to take no more than 2 courses during the semester (subject to approval). It is expected that most students will take only one course per semester at Sciences Po. In exceptional cases, students may take a course in English upon approval by NYU Paris. A selection of past lecture course offerings is listed below for reference.   Please note: students wishing to attend a course at Sciences Po should enroll administratively at the University of Paris (University of Paris I, III, or VII), but will need to apply separately to Sciences Po in order to take a course at Sciences Po.

I. A COMMUNITY OF THE MIND      New York University is a community of scholars who value free and open inquiry. Our work  depends on honest assessment of ideas and their sources; and we expect all members of our community to maintain the highest integrity in their academic work. As scholars committed to the critical evaluation of ideas, free of personal prejudice, we also have an obligation to one other to  create an educational atmosphere of mutual trust and respect in which differences of opinion can  be subjected to deliberate and reasonable examination without animus. Because of the central  importance of these values to our intellectual life together, students who fail to maintain them will  be subject to disciplinary sanction, which may include dismissal from the University.        II. SOME GUIDELINES      Academic honesty means that the work you submit \u2014 in whatever form \u2014 is original. Obviously, bringing answers into an examination or copying all or part of a paper straight from a book, the Internet, or a fellow student is a violation of this principle. But there are other forms of cheating or plagiarizing which are just as serious \u2014 for example, presenting an oral report drawn without attribution from other sources (oral or written), writing a paragraph which, despite being in different words, expresses someone else\u2019s idea without a reference to the source of the idea, or submitting essentially the same paper in two different courses (unless both instructors have given their permission in advance). Receiving help on a take-home examination or quiz is also cheating \u2014 and so is giving that help \u2014 unless expressly permitted by the instructor (as in collaborative projects). While all this looks like a lot to remember, all you need to do is to give credit where it is due, take credit only for your original ideas, and ask your instructor or advisor when in doubt.    Disciplinary offenses include but are not limited to:       cheating, plagiarism, falsification of data or sources, forgery of academic documents in attempt to defraud;    destruction, theft, or unauthorized use of laboratory data, library or research materials, computer resources, or university property;    disruption of academic events or interference with access to classrooms, laboratories, or academic offices;    actual or threatened violence against, sexual assault or harassment of a student, instructor, staff member, or administrator.       The following penalties may be imposed by the faculty for disciplinary infractions:       Warning    Disciplinary Probation    Suspension    Dismissal       Complete statements of the policies and procedures for adjudicating disciplinary complaints concerning students in the College are available from the Office of the Associate Dean for Students and on the website of the College of Arts and Science.      III. RULES AND PROCEDURES       General Principles       Student conduct that violates the College of Arts and Science Honor Code, University-wide student conduct policies, and/or student conduct policies established by portal campuses, global academic sites, or administrative offices of the University may be subject to disciplinary action in accordance with established CAS and University procedures.    Student misconduct includes academic misconduct, such as plagiarism, cheating, and possession of or use of any prohibited notes, reference resources, or data processing or other devices in any class or examination, and behavioral misconduct, such as forgery of academic documents in attempt to defraud; destruction, misuse, or theft of University resources; disruption of classes or other academic events, or University administrative operations; acts of violence; and sexual assault and harassment.    In cases of academic misconduct, evaluation of the student\u2019s academic performance is distinguished from disciplinary adjudication of the offense. The question of what grade the student\u2019s work should earn is distinct from that about whether a disciplinary sanction should also be imposed. When a student is found to have engaged in academic misconduct, the instructor may reduce the student\u2019s grade for the assignment or for the course as a whole; however, such a determination is an academic judgment made by the instructor in accord with the expectations of the department or program offering the course and is not a form of disciplinary sanction. The question of whether a disciplinary sanction should also be imposed is separate from this academic determination, as specified in the procedures described herein.         Academic Misconduct\u2014Academic Review       When it is believed that violations of academic integrity may have occurred it is within the discretion of the faculty member to address the matter informally with the student should the infraction be judged insubstantial or should the evidence be inconclusive. In such cases the faculty member may determine that no grade reduction is warranted.    Should the faculty member judge the violation substantial and well supported by the evidence, he or she may, with the assent of the Director of Undergraduate Studies (or, if the Director of Undergraduate Studies is the instructor, with the chair or another academic director in the department or program, or if the department or program should be too small, in an ad hoc consultation with a chair or academic director of another department or program from the same academic division) reduce the student\u2019s grade or assign the student a failing grade for the assignment in question or for the course as a whole. This grade reduction only reflects the student\u2019s failure creditably to complete the academic requirements in question and is not a disciplinary sanction. The grade reduction should be proportional to the size and weight of the incident of academic misconduct among all requirements for the course and appropriate to the level at which the course is offered.    In order to better educate the student about the CAS standards for academic integrity, the faculty member and/or the Director of Undergraduate Studies should meet with the student to discuss the nature of the offense and the action taken. This responsibility of the faculty should not be delegated to recitation or laboratory instructors or other course assistants.    For incidents of academic misconduct, the student\u2019s appeal of the grade reduction is limited to departmental review conducted by the Director of Undergraduate Studies and/or the Department Chair, as specified in the CAS policy for grade appeals. The review will be limited to the question of whether the reduction in grade was made fairly and in keeping with the expectations of the department or program.    The decision of the department or program on the student\u2019s appeal is final.         Academic Misconduct\u2014Reporting and Disciplinary Referral       In all instances in which there has been a finding that a CAS student committed a substantial violation of academic integrity standards of CAS or of any of its departments or programs, the Director of Undergraduate Studies will inform the student within seven (7) calendar days in writing and/or via email of any action taken and send copies of this letter to the CAS Associate Dean for Students, the faculty member, and the Department Chair or Program Director. The letter will include the nature of the violation, any resulting reduction in grade, and notice of the student\u2019s right to appeal. A copy of the correspondence and the evidence of the violation shall be kept in a confidential file maintained by the Director of Undergraduate Studies.    The Director of Undergraduate Studies will also within seven (7) calendar days inform the CAS Associate Dean for Students in writing and/or via email of the student\u2019s violation, forward to the dean the evidence of the violation, and send a copy of the correspondence to the faculty member and to the Department Chair or Program Director.    If this is the student\u2019s first incident of academic misconduct, the Associate Dean for Students will send the student a warning letter indicating that a suspension or a more severe penalty may result from a second academic integrity offense of any kind.    If this is the student\u2019s second or further incident of academic misconduct, the Associate Dean for Students will meet with the student, discuss the evidence of academic misconduct, and provide the student an opportunity to respond. The student will be informed of his or her right to accept or reject a resolution by the Associate Dean. After considering all relevant information, the Associate Dean may offer the student terms upon which CAS is willing to resolve the matter, which may include imposition of a disciplinary sanction. Where the student and the Associate Dean agree to terms in writing, a binding consensual resolution will exist between the student and CAS. Where the Associate Dean is unable to resolve the complaint by consensual resolution, the matter will be referred to the Committee on Student Discipline.    In all instances in which there has been a finding that a non-CAS student committed a substantial violation of academic integrity standards of CAS or of any of its departments or programs, the Director of Undergraduate Studies will proceed in accord with the procedures under (a) and (b), except that notice will be made instead to the Dean of Students of the student\u2019s school.         Behavioral Misconduct       Complaints of student behavioral misconduct should be made in writing to the CAS Associate Dean for Students. When such a complaint is received, the Associate Dean will notify the student of the complaint and investigate the matter. In cases of students who have transferred internally among divisions of the University, the dean will query the student\u2019s prior school(s) concerning their disciplinary records for the student, if any.    The Associate Dean of Students will meet with the student against whom the complaint has been filed, describe the complaint, and offer the student an opportunity to respond. The student will be informed of his or her right to accept or reject a resolution by the Associate Dean. After considering all relevant information, the Associate Dean may offer the student terms upon which CAS is willing to resolve the matter, which may include imposition of a disciplinary sanction. Where the student and the Associate Dean agree to terms in writing, a binding consensual resolution will exist between the student and CAS. Where the Associate Dean is unable to resolve the complaint by consensual resolution, the matter will be referred to the Committee on Student Discipline.    Ordinarily, if the misconduct is a student\u2019s first offense at the University and does not warrant further disciplinary sanction, the student will be offered the opportunity to continue in CAS under written warning that a one-semester suspension or a more severe penalty may result from a second disciplinary offense of any kind.
