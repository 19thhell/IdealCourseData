In what ways has &quot;politics&quot; (as a noun) been used to name a distinctive practice (call it citizenship) located in a specific space in the social world, and in what senses has &quot;political&quot; been used as an adjective to depict certain dimensions of every human practice? How is practice and conceptualization related in different places and moments? Are there distinctive challenges (and gifts) entwined with politics and with the political dimensions of our lives? Are new dilemmas (and possibilities) emerging now, as globalization unsettles the nation-state form? We explore these questions by closely reading several canonical texts in political theory and using them to think about contrasting ways that human beings have practiced politics and invested it with meaning. In turn, working through several profound -and profoundly different- visions of politics will help us learn to \u201cthink politically\u201d about collective circumstances, choices, and actions.

The family remains one of the critical social institutions in the Arab world, and yet it is highly under-theorized. Most particularly, there is a relative under-theorization of the relationship between family and state \u2013 the two leading, competitive, and co-constitutive central social institutions of the Arab region. This lecture addresses how culturally situated notions of &quot;self,&quot; &quot;rights,&quot; and &quot;citizenship&quot; play out in the context of different political regimes and in the context of the pressures and processes of globalization. The lecture also provides an overview of the empirical work conducted by the Arab Families Working Group and a recent state of the art critical review of family studies scholarship in the Arab region.
