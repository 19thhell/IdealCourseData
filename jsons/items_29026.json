English      Synopsis: 'Dionysus in 69' is the first performance of The Performance Group that emerged in 1968 from a workshop led by Richard Schechner      in November 1967 shortly after he arrived from Tulane University to teach at NYU. 'D69' was the first environmental theater      production shown at the Performing Garage, the long-time home of TPG and later, the Wooster Group that emerged in 1980 from      TPG. A free-wheeling adaptation and distortion of Euripides' 'The Bacchae', 'D69' is notable for the combination of a number      of 'firsts' for the New York theater, including audience participation, man-to-man kissing, and full-frontal nudity of both      women and men. The Performing Garage was filled with platforms and towers, the floor covered with carpets. There were no seats      which meant that performers and spectators shared the space, sitting on the floor or perched on scaffolds. 'D69' was created      during a long period of workshops and rehearsals. The production - like all of Schechner's work that followed - was never finished. Before each performance, Schechner gave      extensive notes and made many revisions. Over the 14-month run, the roles were rotated among the cast, including a woman playing      the god Dionysus (Joan MacIntosh). The Performance Group used their performances as a means of confronting the psychic, physical,      social, and political work of the performer and the spectator. The film was made by De Palma and his colleagues from footage      shot during two in June and July, 1968. The film uses two screen images shown simultaneously to give some feel of the totally      inclusive environmental theater technique pioneered by Schechner. Richard Schechner is a theater director, performance theorist      and university professor known for being one of the founders of the academic discipline of Performance Studies at Tisch School      of the Arts, New York University. Schechner combines his work in anthropology with innovative approaches to performance of all kinds including ritual, drama,      environmental theater, political rallies, dance, music, etc. in order to consider how performance can be understood not just      as an object of study, but also as an active intellectual-artistic practice. He is the editor of 'TDR: The Journal of Performance      Studies.' His books include 'Environmental Theater,' 'The Future of Ritual,' 'Performance Theory,' 'Between Theater and Anthropology'      and 'Performance Studies: An Introduction.' As of 2007, his books have been translated into 14 languages.

His first book, Culture in Camouflage: War, Empire and Modern British Literature (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2009), explores the emergence of modern war culture in the first half of the 20th century. He argues that the British state and war machine actively cannibalized culture as it reinvented itself in times of crisis and focus, and him on the struggle of writers and intellectuals to find their own perspectives on total war. His next book, Deep England: Forging British Culture After Empire , focuses on the second half of the twentieth century and explores tropes of violence, consumption, secrecy, dissent and nostalgia in a national literature and culture that he argues has actively resisted decline and decolonization between 1945 and the present. He is also currently working on a book project on contemporary US and British war culture, whose working title is Surge and Silence: Understanding America\u2019s Cultures of War . I have published essays on film adaptation, Anti-Americanism, W.H. Auden\u2019s poetry, and transatlantic modernism, and have guest edited special issues of Social Text on The Ends of War (ST 91, Summer 2007) and Punk and Its Afterlives (ST 113, forthcoming Summer 2013).

English      Synopsis: 'Dionysus in 69' is the first performance of The Performance Group that emerged in 1968 from a workshop led by Richard Schechner      in November 1967 shortly after he arrived from Tulane University to teach at NYU. 'D69' was the first environmental theater      production shown at the Performing Garage, the long-time home of TPG and later, the Wooster Group that emerged in 1980 from      TPG. A free-wheeling adaptation and distortion of Euripides' 'The Bacchae', 'D69' is notable for the combination of a number      of 'firsts' for the New York theater, including audience participation, man-to-man kissing, and full-frontal nudity of both      women and men. The Performing Garage was filled with platforms and towers, the floor covered with carpets. There were no seats      which meant that performers and spectators shared the space, sitting on the floor or perched on scaffolds. 'D69' was created      during a long period of workshops and rehearsals. The production - like all of Schechner's work that followed - was never finished. Before each performance, Schechner gave      extensive notes and made many revisions. Over the 14-month run, the roles were rotated among the cast, including a woman playing      the god Dionysus (Joan MacIntosh). The Performance Group used their performances as a means of confronting the psychic, physical,      social, and political work of the performer and the spectator. The film was made by De Palma and his colleagues from footage      shot during two in June and July, 1968. The film uses two screen images shown simultaneously to give some feel of the totally      inclusive environmental theater technique pioneered by Schechner. Richard Schechner is a theater director, performance theorist      and university professor known for being one of the founders of the academic discipline of Performance Studies at Tisch School      of the Arts, New York University. Schechner combines his work in anthropology with innovative approaches to performance of all kinds including ritual, drama,      environmental theater, political rallies, dance, music, etc. in order to consider how performance can be understood not just      as an object of study, but also as an active intellectual-artistic practice. He is the editor of 'TDR: The Journal of Performance      Studies.' His books include 'Environmental Theater,' 'The Future of Ritual,' 'Performance Theory,' 'Between Theater and Anthropology'      and 'Performance Studies: An Introduction.' As of 2007, his books have been translated into 14 languages.

His first book, Culture in Camouflage: War, Empire and Modern British Literature (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2009), explores the emergence of modern war culture in the first half of the 20th century. He argues that the British state and war machine actively cannibalized culture as it reinvented itself in times of crisis and focus, and him on the struggle of writers and intellectuals to find their own perspectives on total war. His next book, Deep England: Forging British Culture After Empire , focuses on the second half of the twentieth century and explores tropes of violence, consumption, secrecy, dissent and nostalgia in a national literature and culture that he argues has actively resisted decline and decolonization between 1945 and the present. He is also currently working on a book project on contemporary US and British war culture, whose working title is Surge and Silence: Understanding America\u2019s Cultures of War .

Description       In this course students will learn methods for making imaginative and engaging performances from a variety of literary sources. Through a journey of text analysis we will create performances inspired by a variety of sources including short stories, poems, newspaper articles, interviews, and essays. This course will introduce students to the basic tools of literary and performance analysis, adaptation, and devised theater techniques. Readings may include texts by Italo Calvino, Jorge Luis Borges, Philip K. Dick, T.S. Eliot, Madeline L\u2019Engle, George Orwell, as well as excerpts from newspaper articles or scientific journals. Techniques for the creation of solo performance as well as small and large group collaboration will also be introduced. Students with an interest in a variety of arts practices (theater, dance, music, visual arts, media arts, etc.) are encouraged to participate; no previous experience necessary.
