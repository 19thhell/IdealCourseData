Description       In this class we will combine academic study with an experiential approach to the topic of games and, more generally, participatory entertainment in early China. Thus in addition to thinking about the meaning of play as a universal human activity and contextualizing examples of popular games from the Chinese tradition with background reading on related philosophical and cosmological beliefs, we will learn the fundamentals of the ancient Chinese game of\u00a0 weiqi \u00a0(go), a favorite pastime of scholars since at least the Han dynasty. Students will be introduced to on-line resources that allow them to play the game in real time with opponents from around the world, and they will also visit local New York City go clubs. Through diligent study, students will be expected to achieve a reasonable level of competence in the game and asked to demonstrate that for a portion of their final grade. By demanding real immersion in an absorbing and characteristically Chinese activity that has remained essentially unchanged over at least two millennia, it is hoped that students will begin to recognize the fundamental humanity they share with the former peoples of early China.
