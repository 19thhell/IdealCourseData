Research is central in our graduate training. Students are exposed to a broad range of knowledge in cognition and perception and they are trained to think creatively and to develop independent research careers.                   Our program spans cognition and perception, examining mental processes such as perception, attention, memory, categorization, language, emotion, development, motor control, and cognitive neuroscience. How do we identify the letter &quot;a&quot;? How do we perceive depth and shape? What representational resources are innate? How do human cultures, and individual children, go beyond innate representational capacities? How do toddlers make decisions about their world? How are explicit and implicit memories coded in the brain? How do we inhibit inappropriate responses? How are sentences understood? How are new concepts acquired? How does attention affect perception?                   Students and faculty work closely with researchers in other departments ( Neural Science , Computer Science , Linguistics , and Philosophy ). Every week there are journal club discussions and talks by leading researchers that take place within the Psychology Department, in other NYU departments, and at other nearby schools in New York City (see Events ). Ready access to researchers at several great universities and to incredible cultural resources makes New York City a great place to study perception and cognition.                  Our graduate students begin research immediately. Students benefit from interaction with their faculty advisers and the lively exchange of research ideas among students, postdocs, and faculty at weekly Cognition and Perception colloquia and brown bag talks , research seminars, journal clubs ( cognitive neuroscience , development , ... see Events ) and our annual miniconvention. As a result of this focus on research, our students publish regularly in high-impact journals and go on to become researchers at the best research universities and industrial laboratories.                               Curriculum             What follows is a brief version of our curriculum. Full details may be found in our Graduate Student Guide . Our curriculum is designed to help students master the skills required to accomplish high quality research. Within the first two years, most students have completed the bulk of our primary course requirements. We require all students to take at least four courses in core, content-based areas of the discipline such as Memory, Perception, Attention, Cognitive Development, Psycholinguistics and Cognitive Neuroscience. In addition, we require all students to take at least two courses in quantitative methods, which can be the two-semester departmental statistics sequence, or other courses in probability theory, simulation, advanced statistical methods, etc. In addition, there are advanced seminars in areas related to the research areas of the faculty and students. The course catalog and schedule are online.                  A key aspect of our program is its strength in cognitive neuroscience, which students can select as their &quot;concentration&quot;. One aspect of this is the new, on-site, research-dedicated Center for Brain Imaging that includes a 3T MRI scanner and EEG facility, and will soon include a TMS facility as well. The center is designed to allow students the training and opportunity to become experts in cognitive neuroscience. Through a combination of course work and hands-on experience, students who select this concentration will receive training in the techniques of cognitive neuroscience and will apply these techniques to their chosen research questions.                   Students join a laboratory and begin to design and carry out a research project in their first semester. They are required to write a paper based on research they have performed as well as give a talk in our annual miniconvention at the end of their first and second years. The 2nd-year paper and completion of our basic course requirements generally result in the awarding of an MA degree. We encourage students to collaborate with more than one faculty member, including doing a full laboratory rotation or two. Students may work with primary Cognition &amp; Perception faculty or with affiliates from other programs (e.g., Social Psychology) or departments (e.g., the Center for Neural Science). (See faculty listed alphabetically with a sentence about their research interests, or by area .) In their third and fourth years, PhD students are focused primarily on research.                  We consider the best experience that students can have to become productive researchers is to carry out, write up, and present their research projects. The 1st- and 2nd-year research requirements emphasize this goal. The content and methods courses are designed to provide students with the context and tools they need to produce world-class research on their own. After graduating, most of our students have gone on to research careers. (See Recent PhDs .)                                                 Support             All students accepted into our graduate program are fully funded through the Henry M. MacCracken Program. MacCracken funding is provided through a combination of teaching assistantship, research assistantship, and fellowship, in proportions to be determined. The award package typically includes a full tuition scholarship, comprehensive health insurance and a stipend. Funding is typically guaranteed for five years, although students with substantial graduate credits or a Master's degree may only be guaranteed four years of support. For current information on the Psychology Department's aid package, please see our doctoral financial aid page .                         There is a very limited supply of subsidized housing available for graduate students which is generally used for a subset of each entering class to provide them the opportunity to get settled in New York City during their first year of residence.                               Admissions             To apply for admission to the Graduate Program in Cognition &amp; Perception, you'll need the application form , which is available from the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences. Apply for admission to the Department of Psychology. In the forms there is a place where you specify the particular program in which you are interested (e.g. Cognition &amp; Perception), as well as whether you are also interested in the Developmental Concentration.                 In the application, it is requested that you supply a personal statement. You are free to include any information in that statement that you feel will help us in our admissions decision. However, as we are a research-based program, it is especially useful if you include a review of any research experience you have had (explain what was interesting about it) as well as your current research interests.                  Together with your application, the Graduate School of Arts and Science will require you to upload official transcripts of grades from other schools you have attended, both undergraduate and graduate. In addition, it is required that you take the Graduate Record Exam ( GRE ). Some of our students also submit scores from the Advanced Psychology GRE test. We place very little weight on that score, and do not encourage you to take it.      Please do NOT mail any documents (transcripts etc) to the department. Everything needs to be uploaded and submitted through the online application.             International applicants must take the TOEFL exams if English is not their first language unless they earned a Bachelor's or Master's degree at an English speaking university. Additional information of concern to international applicants is available online from the Office of Global Services .                 We recommend that you submit your application so as to arrive by December 12th.

This course is also appropriate for students in the psychology master\u2019s degree program. Topics include: neurophysiology and neuroanatomy; psychophysics; neuroimaging; linear systems theory; signal detection theory; light and the eye; physiology and anatomy of the retina; color vision; pattern and texture perception; perception of depth; visual motion perception; attention and awareness.            INDUSTRIAL AND ORGANIZATIONAL PSYCHOLOGY (PSYCH-UA 62)    Prerequisite: PSYCH-UA 1 and 10 and 30 or 32 or 34 or 36.    The focus will be on psychology as applied to work, as well as human behavior from the perspective of employees and employers. The course will explore three levels: - the individual, the team, and the organization as a whole. Topics covered will include: employee engagement, satisfaction, identify, esteem, and career interests; hiring and firing; and. motivating and rewarding staff to increase performance and productivity.     Managing human capital from the firm\u2019s perspective involves work-environment culture and climate, and productivity improvement to develop the healthiest organization. Special topics will include the rise in conflict and employee violence, as well as the growing difficulty with work-life balance, diversity, technology and social media opportunities and challenges. We will look at individual differences involved in psychological assessment and testing for recruiting, transfer, promotion and termination. The objective in I/O Psychology is to achieve a balance between employees\u2019 wants and needs, and the firm\u2019s business imperatives.     This class is best suited to those with an interest in and appreciation for business, economics, and quantitative analysis (e.g. Statistics) for informed business decision-making. Those considering careers in Human Resources or advanced graduate study in Psychology and Business will find relevance.                MOTIVATION AND VOLITION (PSYCH-UA 74)    Offered Every Fall. Prerequisites: PSYCH-UA 29 and 32    The course provides an overview of the major theories and findings in research on motivation and volition. More specifically, we will address the history of research on motivation and volition, classic phenomena of being motivated versus lacking motivation and willpower, the psychology of goals (goal setting, goal implementation, effortful goal pursuits, disengagement, content and structure of goals, the mental representation of goals), disorders of self-regulation, and cognitive-neuropsychological research as well as the perspective of economics on motivation and volition. We will focus on understanding the interrelations and contradictions between the different approaches, and on designing research that promotes these different lines of thinking.            CLOSE RELATIONSHIPS (PSYCH-UA 300)    Prerequisite: PSYCH-UA 32    Close relationships are at the core of the human experience. You already have extensive experience with relationships of many sorts \u2013 family bonds, friendships, and probably romantic partnerships as well. The objective of this course is to introduce you to the scientific perspective of close relationships. You will learn how research psychologists apply the scientific method of data collection and analysis to investigate how people experience and think about relationships in general, and romantic relationships specifically. What makes someone attractive? Do we each have one true love out there or is the person you end up with determined by who happens to be around? Is it better to see your romantic partner for who they really are or to see them through rose-colored glasses? How do relationships influence the way you see yourself? This course will address these and related questions from a social psychological perspective.            COGNITIVE DEVELOPMENT (PSYCH-UA 300)    Prerequisites: PSYCH-UA 34    This course will examine how children's thinking develops from infancy through childhood. We will discuss how children develop knowledge and reasoning skills across various domains (e.g., how children learn and think about objects, people, the natural world, and society) and we will examine the major theories and explanations of cognitive growth. This course will include consideration of both classic and contemporary research on cognitive development.            COGNEURO: PRINCIPLES OF FRONTAL LOBE FUNCTIONS (PSYCH-UA 300)    Prerequisites: PSYCH-UA 22 and 25 or 29.    The frontal cortex is thought to be a key cortical area important for the integration of sensory and motor information. Many cognitive and emotional facets of our behavior that make us unique as humans are thought to depend on the frontal cortex, which accounts for almost 1/3 of the cortical surface of the entire brain. In this course we will delve into the issues that have led many clinicians and scientists throughout the years to suspect that the key to understanding what makes us uniquely human depends on understanding the frontal cortex. We will cover important neuropsychological patient studies and theories as well as human and animal empirical studies into the structure and physiology of the frontal lobes as they relate to higher cognitive functions.     Two \u2018mock\u2019 endeavors are emphasized in the class and form the majority of basis for evaluation, the oral communication of research results and the written proposal of a research grant.            DATA LITERACY (PSYCH-UA 300)    Prerequisites: PSYCH-UA 1 and 10    We now live in a world where data is ubiquitous and increasingly influential on decision making at all levels of society. However, most people are not able to meaningfully partake in this new world because they are not data-literate. Thus, the goal of this course is to develop data literacy - the ability to obtain, manage, analyze and understand data. Acquiring this critical skill-set unlocks a wide range of career opportunities and provides the foundation of an educated citizenry in the modern world, preparing you for a successful life in a data-based society. To attain this goal, this course provides a gentle introduction to data-related topics, with a particular emphasis on providing a conceptual understanding, actionable knowledge and long-term retention.            EXPERIMENTS IN BEAUTY (PSYCH-UA 300)    Prerequisite: PSYCH-UA 1    Beauty is famously hard to study scientifically, but students in this hands-on laboratory course will each week formulate beauty-related questions and design and implement experiments to answer them. We also read and discuss one article/chapter each week from authors including Kant, Woolf, Berlin, Donoghue, Kuhn, Quine, and Wittgenstein.            HUMAN SEXUALITY (PSYCH-UA 300)    Prerequisites: PSYCH-UA 1    Sexuality is an essential aspect of everyone\u2019s life. It leads to our most important relationships \u2013 with lovers, spouses, and children. It drives much of our social-networking and status seeking behavior. It evokes our strongest passions - lust, love, jealousy, heartbreak, despair, and hope. And depending on a variety of factors, it can be a highly pleasurable experience that enriches our lives, or a destructive force causing physical, mental, and interpersonal suffering. Basic sexual potentials and tendencies have been built into the human species by evolutionary forces. At the same time, processes of socialization and learning play a crucial role in how these basic potentials are developed, experienced, and manifested in each of us.     Sexual science encompasses a large and multi-disciplinary field of theory and research. This course will examine human sexuality primarily from a psychological perspective, drawing on empirical and theoretical work from the fields of personality, developmental, social, clinical, evolutionary, and cognitive psychology, and less often also from ethology, anthropology, sociology, history, neurobiology, and public policy. It will cover various aspects of human sexual psychology (sexual capacities, desires, attraction, orientation, attitudes, identities, experiences, and relationships) and how they are shaped by biological, environmental, and socio-cultural factors over the course of the human lifespan, from conception to old age. We will also examine theories and methods of sex research, atypical sexualities, sexual dysfunctions, sexual coercion, and the qualities and benefits of good sex.            FROM ILLUSIONS TO INFERENCE: ADVENTURES IN HUMAN PERCEPTION (PSYCH-UA 300)    Prerequisites: NONE    Our sensory perception easily falls prey to illusions and biases. It is tempting to think of these as failures of our brain, but they might not be! In fact, they reveal the difficult challenges that our brain faces when interpreting the world, and the clever (and sometimes not so clever) solutions that it comes up with.      In this course, we will use a wide variety of well-known and lesser-known illusions (visual, auditory, tactile, vestibular, and multisensory) to work towards the central concept of inference: the notion that the brain constantly forms hypotheses about the outside world and computes probabilities over those hypotheses.   We will draw parallels with fun examples from online shopping to medical diagnosis to spam filtering to election forecasting to searching for submarines. There will be a guest lecture about neurological disorders of perception.   We welcome not only students in psychology and neuroscience, but also from other fields (including biology, physics, computer science, economics, marketing, mathematics, and engineering).            LANGUAGE ACQUISITION AND COGNITIVE DEVELOPMENT (PSYCH-UA 300)    Prerequisite: PSYCH-UA 1 or Instructor Permission    In the first three years of life, children go from helpless creatures, fresh out of the womb, to toddlers with a basic grasp of language and the people and objects in the world around them. How do they do that? This seminar will discuss current issues in language acquisition and cognitive development, exploring nature, nurture, and their interaction.            NEUROECONOMICS AND DECISION MAKING (PSYCH-UA 300)    Prerequisites: PSYCH-UA 10 and 25 or 29.    This course explores how humans and animals make decisions, drawing broadly on many perspectives including particularly the nexus of psychological, neuroscientific, and economic considerations, but also ethological and computational ones. The course is organized around modules considering decision making in several sorts of tasks; for instance, by foraging animals or by humans in competitive multiplayer interactions.            PREJUDICE AND STEREOTYPING (PSYCH-UA 300)    This course will cover historical and contemporary scientific approaches to understanding prejudice, specifically prejudice that exists between social groups (for example, ethnic prejudice, religious prejudice, etc.) across different cultures. Readings will draw from multiple social scientific perspectives, and will cover topics including the origins of prejudice, the justification of prejudice, the different forms of prejudicial expression, the identification of prejudice in individuals and institutions, the consequences of being a victim of prejudice, and the value (or not) of different prejudice reduction strategies.            PSYCHOLOGY OF ACTION (PSYCH-UA 300)    In the last decade, there has been a surge of research on the mechanisms of human action. This seminar covers most of the basic questions regarding human action: What are the mechanisms by which action plans are acquired (learned), mentally represented, activated, selected, and expressed? The seminar addresses research on motor control, behavioral and cognitive neuroscience, psycholinguistics, biology, as well as cognitive, developmental, social, and motivational psychology. The seminar thus adheres to a multidisciplinary perspective on the analysis of human action.            PSYCHOLOGY OF ADDICTION (PSYCH-UA 300)    Prerequisite: PSYCH-UA 1    This course will provide: (1) an overview of the major substances of abuse; (2) a review of the various psychological approaches to understanding substance use, abuse, and addiction as informed by the cognitive-behavioral, psychodynamic, and behavioral traditions; (3) an in-depth exploration of the major forms of addiction treatment; and (4) an application of this knowledge to the non-substance or behavioral addictions such as pathological gambling and addictive sexuality.            SCIENTIFIC PROGRAMMING FOR THE BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES (PSYCH-UA 300)    Prerequisites: PSYCH-UA 1 and 10    This course is aimed at undergraduates who are planning to attend graduate school in psychology or one of the other behavioral sciences. There are few commercially available solutions that are versatile enough to fulfill the diverse needs of researchers in the behavioral sciences. Thus, it is increasingly critical that aspiring research practitioners are capable of doing their own scientific programming and computing. This class is designed to impart these capabilities to aspiring researchers in the behavioral sciences - specifically Psychology - who have no background in programming, computer science or any prior exposure to any programming language. To achieve this goal, we will cover the computational and programming needs across the entire research cascade in the behavioral sciences, from data collection to making publication quality figures. This is a hands-on class with a focus on developing practical skills in scientific computing and programming, helping you to pursue your future research goals. Language of instruction is Matlab and some Python.            SELF AND SOCIAL JUDGMENT (PSYCH-UA 300)    Prerequisites: PSYCH-UA 10 and 32    How is the self-concept formed and how do we come to know other people? Students will discuss the role of motivations, cognitive errors and biases, culture, and situational and dispositional influences on how we think about ourselves and other people.            SEMINAR IN THINKING (PSYCH-UA 300)    Prerequisites: PSYCH-UA 10 and 29    This seminar focuses in depth on a single aspect of thinking: decision making. Decision making is a critical part of every person\u2019s life, as we make decisions about major life events such as what college to go to (if any), whether to get married, or what career to follow, down to trivial decisions about which bagel to order or where to sit in a class. We will examine formal theories of how people /should/ make decisions, as well as many studies on whether people are good or even rational decision makers. The class is a seminar, and active discussion and class participation are expected.            SOCIAL ATTITUDES (PSYCH-UA 300)    Prerequisites: PSYCH-UA 32    This course will provide an overview of the major theoretical debates and empirical developments in the area of attitudes and evaluation. Students in this class will be directly exposed to many of the core ideas in attitude research by reading many of the classic articles in this literature. The readings will provide an in-depth exploration of key empirical and theoretical breakthroughs. For example, we will explore implicit and explicit attitude-measurement, persuasion, prejudice, and how attitudes shape our thoughts and actions. Students in the course will also discover the relevance of the attitude-theory to situations of everyday life.            SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE (PSYCH-UA 300)    Prerequisites: PSYCH-UA 22 and 25 and 30 or 32. PSYCH-UA 29 recommended.    This course provides an overview of topics in the emerging field of Social Neuroscience. We will focus on how theories and methods of neuroscience may be used to address classic questions of social psychology from new and informative angles. The goal of this course is to give you a broad background in social neuroscience so that you may (a) be a critical consumer of this literature, (b) broaden the way you think about connections between the mind, brain, and behavior in the context of the social world, and (c) most importantly, apply these ideas to inform your own ideas and future research in psychology.            SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY OF DECISION MAKING (PSYCH-UA 300)    Prerequisites: PSYCH-UA 29 or 32    This course will review theory and research on cognitive and motivational processes underlying judgments and decision making regarding social objects and events. The course will examine how people seek, interpret, and integrate information in making social judgments and decisions. The seminar will discuss models of rational judgment and how cognitive limitations, social stereotypes, emotions, desires, and impulses produce judgmental error and biases. The course will examine how these judgmental phenomena are expressed in everyday life situations.            SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY OF VISUAL PERCEPTION (PSYCH-UA 300)    Prerequisites: PSYCH-UA 1 and 10.    People tacitly assume that they see the world exactly how it is. New research, however, calls this assumption into question and instead suggests our vantage is clouded at best. In this seminar, we discuss research that suggests that visual perception is influenced by the perceiver's cognitions, emotions, goals, motivations, culture, surroundings, and other variables that have been traditionally considered exclusive to social, personality, and cognitive psychology. Students taking this course will read and evaluate the original literature related to these topics. Weekly response papers will inform class discussion of papers. A final paper will be required.            SYSTEMS OF PSYCHOTHERAPY (PSYCH-UA 300)    Prerequisites: PSYCH-UA 30 or 51.    This course will introduce students to the nature of psychotherapy. It will consider the major theories and techniques of psychotherapy, with particular emphasis on psychodynamic and cognitive-behavioral approaches. A significant portion of the course will be devoted to viewing and discussing videos illustrating different methods of psychotherapy. .           SOCIAL VISION (PSYCH-UA 300)    Prerequisites: PSYCH-UA 10 and 32    We tacitly assume perceptions are veridical representations of reality, that the way we see the world reflects the way it really is. In this class, we discuss research that calls this supposition into question. We will investigate the ways in which and reasons why higher-order, top-down influences constrain perception at multiple stages of perceptual processing including eye movements, directing visual attention, filtration, ambiguity resolution, and interpretation. Moreover, we discuss the implications of social vision for consequential behavior and judgment in domains including jury decision making, policing, relationships, health and fitness, politics, and others.            RESEARCH EXPERIENCES AND METHODS (PSYCH-UA 999)    Offered Every Semester. Prerequisites: Permission of Department and PSYCH-UA 10 as well as two (2) other psychology core courses and a GPA of at least 3.0. This course may be repeatable for credit.   Undergraduate students are paired with faculty, advanced graduate students, or other researchers on a one-to-one basis to pursue common research goals in psychology. Undergraduates serve as apprentices on survey, laboratory, clinical, and field research projects and in return receive guidance in reading and developing research skills. Biweekly meetings deal with research methods and design and allow students an opportunity to speak on their research projects. Written assignments include several brief homeworks and a final journal-style research report.               HONORS COURSES    Open only to students who have been admitted to the Psychology Honors Program. Either PSYCH-UA 200 or PSYCH-UA 201 (but not both) may be counted as an advanced elective in the fulfillment of the requirements of the major.            HONORS SEMINAR I (PSYCH-UA 200)    Offered Every Fall. Prerequisite: Admission to the psychology honors program.    Students read and discuss recent studies and classical papers related to current controversies in psychology. A portion of class time is set aside for discussion of theoretical and technical aspects of each student's thesis project.            HONORS SEMINAR II (PSYCH-UA 201)    Offered Every Spring. Prerequisite: PSYCH-UA 200.    A continuation of PSYCH-UA 200. Students are also expected to present preliminary results of their thesis projects and interpret their findings.               GRADUATE COURSES OPEN TO UNDERGRADUATES    Certain graduate courses are open to advanced undergraduates who satisfy the following prerequisites: Junior or Senior major in Psychology, permission of the student's undergraduate psychology advisor, permission of the Department of Psychology (graduate division), and additional specific prerequisites listed for each course.

Research is central in our graduate training. Students are exposed to a broad range of knowledge in cognition and perception and they are trained to think creatively and to develop independent research careers.                   Our program spans cognition and perception, examining mental processes such as perception, attention, memory, categorization, language, emotion, development, motor control, and cognitive neuroscience. How do we identify the letter &quot;a&quot;? How do we perceive depth and shape? What representational resources are innate? How do human cultures, and individual children, go beyond innate representational capacities? How do toddlers make decisions about their world? How are explicit and implicit memories coded in the brain? How do we inhibit inappropriate responses? How are sentences understood? How are new concepts acquired? How does attention affect perception?                   Students and faculty work closely with researchers in other departments ( Neural Science , Computer Science , Linguistics , and Philosophy ). Every week there are journal club discussions and talks by leading researchers that take place within the Psychology Department, in other NYU departments, and at other nearby schools in New York City (see Events ). Ready access to researchers at several great universities and to incredible cultural resources makes New York City a great place to study perception and cognition.                  Our graduate students begin research immediately. Students benefit from interaction with their faculty advisers and the lively exchange of research ideas among students, postdocs, and faculty at weekly Cognition and Perception colloquia and brown bag talks , research seminars, journal clubs ( cognitive neuroscience , development , ... see Events ) and our annual miniconvention. As a result of this focus on research, our students publish regularly in high-impact journals and go on to become researchers at the best research universities and industrial laboratories.                               Curriculum             What follows is a brief version of our curriculum. Full details may be found in our Graduate Student Guide . Our curriculum is designed to help students master the skills required to accomplish high quality research. Within the first two years, most students have completed the bulk of our primary course requirements. We require all students to take at least four courses in core, content-based areas of the discipline such as Memory, Perception, Attention, Cognitive Development, Psycholinguistics and Cognitive Neuroscience. In addition, we require all students to take at least two courses in quantitative methods, which can be the two-semester departmental statistics sequence, or other courses in probability theory, simulation, advanced statistical methods, etc. In addition, there are advanced seminars in areas related to the research areas of the faculty and students. The course catalog and schedule are online.                  A key aspect of our program is its strength in cognitive neuroscience, which students can select as their &quot;concentration&quot;. One aspect of this is the new, on-site, research-dedicated Center for Brain Imaging that includes a 3T MRI scanner and EEG facility, and will soon include a TMS facility as well. The center is designed to allow students the training and opportunity to become experts in cognitive neuroscience. Through a combination of course work and hands-on experience, students who select this concentration will receive training in the techniques of cognitive neuroscience and will apply these techniques to their chosen research questions.                   Students join a laboratory and begin to design and carry out a research project in their first semester. They are required to write a paper based on research they have performed as well as give a talk in our annual miniconvention at the end of their first and second years. The 2nd-year paper and completion of our basic course requirements generally result in the awarding of an MA degree. We encourage students to collaborate with more than one faculty member, including doing a full laboratory rotation or two. Students may work with primary Cognition &amp; Perception faculty or with affiliates from other programs (e.g., Social Psychology) or departments (e.g., the Center for Neural Science). (See faculty listed alphabetically with a sentence about their research interests, or by area .) In their third and fourth years, PhD students are focused primarily on research.                  We consider the best experience that students can have to become productive researchers is to carry out, write up, and present their research projects. The 1st- and 2nd-year research requirements emphasize this goal. The content and methods courses are designed to provide students with the context and tools they need to produce world-class research on their own. After graduating, most of our students have gone on to research careers. (See Recent PhDs .)                                                 Support             All students accepted into our graduate program are fully funded through the Henry M. MacCracken Program. MacCracken funding is provided through a combination of teaching assistantship, research assistantship, and fellowship, in proportions to be determined. The award package typically includes a full tuition scholarship, comprehensive health insurance and a stipend. Funding is typically guaranteed for five years, although students with substantial graduate credits or a Master's degree may only be guaranteed four years of support. For current information on the Psychology Department's aid package, please see our doctoral financial aid page .                         There is a very limited supply of subsidized housing available for graduate students which is generally used for a subset of each entering class to provide them the opportunity to get settled in New York City during their first year of residence.                               Admissions             To apply for admission to the Graduate Program in Cognition &amp; Perception, you'll need the application form , which is available from the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences. Apply for admission to the Department of Psychology. In the forms there is a place where you specify the particular program in which you are interested (e.g. Cognition &amp; Perception), as well as whether you are also interested in the Developmental Concentration.                 In the application, it is requested that you supply a personal statement. You are free to include any information in that statement that you feel will help us in our admissions decision. However, as we are a research-based program, it is especially useful if you include a review of any research experience you have had (explain what was interesting about it) as well as your current research interests.                  Together with your application, the Graduate School of Arts and Science will require you to upload official transcripts of grades from other schools you have attended, both undergraduate and graduate. In addition, it is required that you take the Graduate Record Exam ( GRE ). Some of our students also submit scores from the Advanced Psychology GRE test. We place very little weight on that score, and do not encourage you to take it.      Please do NOT mail any documents (transcripts etc) to the department. Everything needs to be uploaded and submitted through the online application.             International applicants must take the TOEFL exams if English is not their first language unless they earned a Bachelor's or Master's degree at an English speaking university. Additional information of concern to international applicants is available online from the Office of Global Services .                 We recommend that you submit your application so as to arrive by December 12th.

Special Topics courses are offered every semester in a variety of areas. The Special Topics courses listed below represent a sampling of recently offered courses.            TEACHING IN PSYCHOLOGY (PSYCH-UA 2)    Prerequisites: Admittance by application only            SEMINAR IN MEMORY (PSYCH-UA 23)    Prerequisite: PSYCH-UA 29    Examination of the conceptual problems involved in understanding the retention of information. Reviews research findings addressed to those problems, involving studies with humans and sub-humans and with environmental, psychological, and biochemical variables.            LANGUAGE AND MIND (PSYCH-UA 27/LING-UA 28)    Prerequisite: PSYCH-UA 29.    Introduces students to the field of cognitive science through an examination of language behavior, one of the major domains of inquiry in the discipline. Begins with interactive discussions of how best to characterize and study the mind. These principles are then illustrated through an examination of research and theories related to language representation and use. The course draws from research in both formal linguistics and psycholinguistics.            ABNORMAL PSYCHOLOGY (PSYCH-UA 51)    Prerequisites: PSYCH-UA 30 or 32 or 34.    The kinds, dynamics, causes, and treatment of psychopathology. Topics include early concepts of abnormal behavior; affective disorders, anxiety disorders, psychosis, and personality disorders; the nature and effectiveness of traditional and modern methods of psychotherapy; and viewpoints of major psychologists past and present.            PSYCHOLINGUISTICS (PSYCH-UA 56)    Prerequisite: PSYCH-UA 1 or LING-UA 1    Examines theories and research concerning the cognitive processes and linguistic representations that enable language comprehension and production. Topics include speech perception, visual processes during reading, word recognition, syntactic processing, and semantic/discourse processing.            ADVANCED SEMINAR IN PERCEPTION (PSYCH-UA 61)    Prerequisites: PSYCH-UA 1 and 22 or NEURL-UA 100 and 220.    The objective of this course is to master select topics in perceptual psychology and sensory neuroscience, focusing on visual perception, visual neuroscience and computational neuroscience. This is an interdisciplinary field of science, crossing the boundaries between psychology, biology, physics and engineering. This course is intended for neural science majors and psychology majors that are on track for careers in science and medicine. This course is also appropriate for students in the psychology master\u2019s degree program. Topics include: neurophysiology and neuroanatomy; psychophysics; neuroimaging; linear systems theory; signal detection theory; light and the eye; physiology and anatomy of the retina; color vision; pattern and texture perception; perception of depth; visual motion perception; attention and awareness.            INDUSTRIAL AND ORGANIZATIONAL PSYCHOLOGY (PSYCH-UA 62)    Prerequisite: PSYCH-UA 1 and 10 and 30 or 32 or 34 or 36.    The focus will be on psychology as applied to work, as well as human behavior from the perspective of employees and employers. The course will explore three levels: - the individual, the team, and the organization as a whole. Topics covered will include: employee engagement, satisfaction, identify, esteem, and career interests; hiring and firing; and. motivating and rewarding staff to increase performance and productivity.     Managing human capital from the firm\u2019s perspective involves work-environment culture and climate, and productivity improvement to develop the healthiest organization. Special topics will include the rise in conflict and employee violence, as well as the growing difficulty with work-life balance, diversity, technology and social media opportunities and challenges. We will look at individual differences involved in psychological assessment and testing for recruiting, transfer, promotion and termination. The objective in I/O Psychology is to achieve a balance between employees\u2019 wants and needs, and the firm\u2019s business imperatives.     This class is best suited to those with an interest in and appreciation for business, economics, and quantitative analysis (e.g. Statistics) for informed business decision-making. Those considering careers in Human Resources or advanced graduate study in Psychology and Business will find relevance.                MOTIVATION AND VOLITION (PSYCH-UA 74)    Offered Every Fall. Prerequisites: PSYCH-UA 29 and 32    The course provides an overview of the major theories and findings in research on motivation and volition. More specifically, we will address the history of research on motivation and volition, classic phenomena of being motivated versus lacking motivation and willpower, the psychology of goals (goal setting, goal implementation, effortful goal pursuits, disengagement, content and structure of goals, the mental representation of goals), disorders of self-regulation, and cognitive-neuropsychological research as well as the perspective of economics on motivation and volition. We will focus on understanding the interrelations and contradictions between the different approaches, and on designing research that promotes these different lines of thinking.            CLOSE RELATIONSHIPS (PSYCH-UA 300)    Prerequisite: PSYCH-UA 32    Close relationships are at the core of the human experience. You already have extensive experience with relationships of many sorts \u2013 family bonds, friendships, and probably romantic partnerships as well. The objective of this course is to introduce you to the scientific perspective of close relationships. You will learn how research psychologists apply the scientific method of data collection and analysis to investigate how people experience and think about relationships in general, and romantic relationships specifically. What makes someone attractive? Do we each have one true love out there or is the person you end up with determined by who happens to be around? Is it better to see your romantic partner for who they really are or to see them through rose-colored glasses? How do relationships influence the way you see yourself? This course will address these and related questions from a social psychological perspective.            COGNITIVE DEVELOPMENT (PSYCH-UA 300)    Prerequisites: PSYCH-UA 34    This course will examine how children's thinking develops from infancy through childhood. We will discuss how children develop knowledge and reasoning skills across various domains (e.g., how children learn and think about objects, people, the natural world, and society) and we will examine the major theories and explanations of cognitive growth. This course will include consideration of both classic and contemporary research on cognitive development.            COGNEURO: PRINCIPLES OF FRONTAL LOBE FUNCTIONS (PSYCH-UA 300)    Prerequisites: PSYCH-UA 22 and 25 or 29.    The frontal cortex is thought to be a key cortical area important for the integration of sensory and motor information. Many cognitive and emotional facets of our behavior that make us unique as humans are thought to depend on the frontal cortex, which accounts for almost 1/3 of the cortical surface of the entire brain. In this course we will delve into the issues that have led many clinicians and scientists throughout the years to suspect that the key to understanding what makes us uniquely human depends on understanding the frontal cortex. We will cover important neuropsychological patient studies and theories as well as human and animal empirical studies into the structure and physiology of the frontal lobes as they relate to higher cognitive functions.     Two \u2018mock\u2019 endeavors are emphasized in the class and form the majority of basis for evaluation, the oral communication of research results and the written proposal of a research grant.            DATA LITERACY (PSYCH-UA 300)    Prerequisites: PSYCH-UA 1 and 10    We now live in a world where data is ubiquitous and increasingly influential on decision making at all levels of society. However, most people are not able to meaningfully partake in this new world because they are not data-literate. Thus, the goal of this course is to develop data literacy - the ability to obtain, manage, analyze and understand data. Acquiring this critical skill-set unlocks a wide range of career opportunities and provides the foundation of an educated citizenry in the modern world, preparing you for a successful life in a data-based society. To attain this goal, this course provides a gentle introduction to data-related topics, with a particular emphasis on providing a conceptual understanding, actionable knowledge and long-term retention.            EXPERIMENTS IN BEAUTY (PSYCH-UA 300)    Prerequisite: PSYCH-UA 1    Beauty is famously hard to study scientifically, but students in this hands-on laboratory course will each week formulate beauty-related questions and design and implement experiments to answer them. We also read and discuss one article/chapter each week from authors including Kant, Woolf, Berlin, Donoghue, Kuhn, Quine, and Wittgenstein.            HUMAN SEXUALITY (PSYCH-UA 300)    Prerequisites: PSYCH-UA 1    Sexuality is an essential aspect of everyone\u2019s life. It leads to our most important relationships \u2013 with lovers, spouses, and children. It drives much of our social-networking and status seeking behavior. It evokes our strongest passions - lust, love, jealousy, heartbreak, despair, and hope. And depending on a variety of factors, it can be a highly pleasurable experience that enriches our lives, or a destructive force causing physical, mental, and interpersonal suffering. Basic sexual potentials and tendencies have been built into the human species by evolutionary forces. At the same time, processes of socialization and learning play a crucial role in how these basic potentials are developed, experienced, and manifested in each of us.     Sexual science encompasses a large and multi-disciplinary field of theory and research. This course will examine human sexuality primarily from a psychological perspective, drawing on empirical and theoretical work from the fields of personality, developmental, social, clinical, evolutionary, and cognitive psychology, and less often also from ethology, anthropology, sociology, history, neurobiology, and public policy. It will cover various aspects of human sexual psychology (sexual capacities, desires, attraction, orientation, attitudes, identities, experiences, and relationships) and how they are shaped by biological, environmental, and socio-cultural factors over the course of the human lifespan, from conception to old age. We will also examine theories and methods of sex research, atypical sexualities, sexual dysfunctions, sexual coercion, and the qualities and benefits of good sex.            FROM ILLUSIONS TO INFERENCE: ADVENTURES IN HUMAN PERCEPTION (PSYCH-UA 300)    Prerequisites: NONE    Our sensory perception easily falls prey to illusions and biases. It is tempting to think of these as failures of our brain, but they might not be! In fact, they reveal the difficult challenges that our brain faces when interpreting the world, and the clever (and sometimes not so clever) solutions that it comes up with.      In this course, we will use a wide variety of well-known and lesser-known illusions (visual, auditory, tactile, vestibular, and multisensory) to work towards the central concept of inference: the notion that the brain constantly forms hypotheses about the outside world and computes probabilities over those hypotheses.   We will draw parallels with fun examples from online shopping to medical diagnosis to spam filtering to election forecasting to searching for submarines. There will be a guest lecture about neurological disorders of perception.   We welcome not only students in psychology and neuroscience, but also from other fields (including biology, physics, computer science, economics, marketing, mathematics, and engineering).            LANGUAGE ACQUISITION AND COGNITIVE DEVELOPMENT (PSYCH-UA 300)    Prerequisite: PSYCH-UA 1 or Instructor Permission    In the first three years of life, children go from helpless creatures, fresh out of the womb, to toddlers with a basic grasp of language and the people and objects in the world around them. How do they do that? This seminar will discuss current issues in language acquisition and cognitive development, exploring nature, nurture, and their interaction.            NEUROECONOMICS AND DECISION MAKING (PSYCH-UA 300)    Prerequisites: PSYCH-UA 10 and 25 or 29.    This course explores how humans and animals make decisions, drawing broadly on many perspectives including particularly the nexus of psychological, neuroscientific, and economic considerations, but also ethological and computational ones. The course is organized around modules considering decision making in several sorts of tasks; for instance, by foraging animals or by humans in competitive multiplayer interactions.            PREJUDICE AND STEREOTYPING (PSYCH-UA 300)    This course will cover historical and contemporary scientific approaches to understanding prejudice, specifically prejudice that exists between social groups (for example, ethnic prejudice, religious prejudice, etc.) across different cultures. Readings will draw from multiple social scientific perspectives, and will cover topics including the origins of prejudice, the justification of prejudice, the different forms of prejudicial expression, the identification of prejudice in individuals and institutions, the consequences of being a victim of prejudice, and the value (or not) of different prejudice reduction strategies.            PSYCHOLOGY OF ACTION (PSYCH-UA 300)    In the last decade, there has been a surge of research on the mechanisms of human action. This seminar covers most of the basic questions regarding human action: What are the mechanisms by which action plans are acquired (learned), mentally represented, activated, selected, and expressed? The seminar addresses research on motor control, behavioral and cognitive neuroscience, psycholinguistics, biology, as well as cognitive, developmental, social, and motivational psychology. The seminar thus adheres to a multidisciplinary perspective on the analysis of human action.            PSYCHOLOGY OF ADDICTION (PSYCH-UA 300)    Prerequisite: PSYCH-UA 1    This course will provide: (1) an overview of the major substances of abuse; (2) a review of the various psychological approaches to understanding substance use, abuse, and addiction as informed by the cognitive-behavioral, psychodynamic, and behavioral traditions; (3) an in-depth exploration of the major forms of addiction treatment; and (4) an application of this knowledge to the non-substance or behavioral addictions such as pathological gambling and addictive sexuality.            SCIENTIFIC PROGRAMMING FOR THE BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES (PSYCH-UA 300)    Prerequisites: PSYCH-UA 1 and 10    This course is aimed at undergraduates who are planning to attend graduate school in psychology or one of the other behavioral sciences. There are few commercially available solutions that are versatile enough to fulfill the diverse needs of researchers in the behavioral sciences. Thus, it is increasingly critical that aspiring research practitioners are capable of doing their own scientific programming and computing. This class is designed to impart these capabilities to aspiring researchers in the behavioral sciences - specifically Psychology - who have no background in programming, computer science or any prior exposure to any programming language. To achieve this goal, we will cover the computational and programming needs across the entire research cascade in the behavioral sciences, from data collection to making publication quality figures. This is a hands-on class with a focus on developing practical skills in scientific computing and programming, helping you to pursue your future research goals. Language of instruction is Matlab and some Python.            SELF AND SOCIAL JUDGMENT (PSYCH-UA 300)    Prerequisites: PSYCH-UA 10 and 32    How is the self-concept formed and how do we come to know other people? Students will discuss the role of motivations, cognitive errors and biases, culture, and situational and dispositional influences on how we think about ourselves and other people.            SEMINAR IN THINKING (PSYCH-UA 300)    Prerequisites: PSYCH-UA 10 and 29    This seminar focuses in depth on a single aspect of thinking: decision making. Decision making is a critical part of every person\u2019s life, as we make decisions about major life events such as what college to go to (if any), whether to get married, or what career to follow, down to trivial decisions about which bagel to order or where to sit in a class. We will examine formal theories of how people /should/ make decisions, as well as many studies on whether people are good or even rational decision makers. The class is a seminar, and active discussion and class participation are expected.            SOCIAL ATTITUDES (PSYCH-UA 300)    Prerequisites: PSYCH-UA 32    This course will provide an overview of the major theoretical debates and empirical developments in the area of attitudes and evaluation. Students in this class will be directly exposed to many of the core ideas in attitude research by reading many of the classic articles in this literature. The readings will provide an in-depth exploration of key empirical and theoretical breakthroughs. For example, we will explore implicit and explicit attitude-measurement, persuasion, prejudice, and how attitudes shape our thoughts and actions. Students in the course will also discover the relevance of the attitude-theory to situations of everyday life.            SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE (PSYCH-UA 300)    Prerequisites: PSYCH-UA 22 and 25 and 30 or 32. PSYCH-UA 29 recommended.    This course provides an overview of topics in the emerging field of Social Neuroscience. We will focus on how theories and methods of neuroscience may be used to address classic questions of social psychology from new and informative angles. The goal of this course is to give you a broad background in social neuroscience so that you may (a) be a critical consumer of this literature, (b) broaden the way you think about connections between the mind, brain, and behavior in the context of the social world, and (c) most importantly, apply these ideas to inform your own ideas and future research in psychology.            SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY OF DECISION MAKING (PSYCH-UA 300)    Prerequisites: PSYCH-UA 29 or 32    This course will review theory and research on cognitive and motivational processes underlying judgments and decision making regarding social objects and events. The course will examine how people seek, interpret, and integrate information in making social judgments and decisions. The seminar will discuss models of rational judgment and how cognitive limitations, social stereotypes, emotions, desires, and impulses produce judgmental error and biases. The course will examine how these judgmental phenomena are expressed in everyday life situations.            SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY OF VISUAL PERCEPTION (PSYCH-UA 300)    Prerequisites: PSYCH-UA 1 and 10.    People tacitly assume that they see the world exactly how it is. New research, however, calls this assumption into question and instead suggests our vantage is clouded at best. In this seminar, we discuss research that suggests that visual perception is influenced by the perceiver's cognitions, emotions, goals, motivations, culture, surroundings, and other variables that have been traditionally considered exclusive to social, personality, and cognitive psychology. Students taking this course will read and evaluate the original literature related to these topics. Weekly response papers will inform class discussion of papers. A final paper will be required.            SYSTEMS OF PSYCHOTHERAPY (PSYCH-UA 300)    Prerequisites: PSYCH-UA 30 or 51.    This course will introduce students to the nature of psychotherapy. It will consider the major theories and techniques of psychotherapy, with particular emphasis on psychodynamic and cognitive-behavioral approaches. A significant portion of the course will be devoted to viewing and discussing videos illustrating different methods of psychotherapy. .           SOCIAL VISION (PSYCH-UA 300)    Prerequisites: PSYCH-UA 10 and 32    We tacitly assume perceptions are veridical representations of reality, that the way we see the world reflects the way it really is. In this class, we discuss research that calls this supposition into question. We will investigate the ways in which and reasons why higher-order, top-down influences constrain perception at multiple stages of perceptual processing including eye movements, directing visual attention, filtration, ambiguity resolution, and interpretation. Moreover, we discuss the implications of social vision for consequential behavior and judgment in domains including jury decision making, policing, relationships, health and fitness, politics, and others.            RESEARCH EXPERIENCES AND METHODS (PSYCH-UA 999)    Offered Every Semester. Prerequisites: Permission of Department and PSYCH-UA 10 as well as two (2) other psychology core courses and a GPA of at least 3.0. This course may be repeatable for credit.   Undergraduate students are paired with faculty, advanced graduate students, or other researchers on a one-to-one basis to pursue common research goals in psychology. Undergraduates serve as apprentices on survey, laboratory, clinical, and field research projects and in return receive guidance in reading and developing research skills. Biweekly meetings deal with research methods and design and allow students an opportunity to speak on their research projects. Written assignments include several brief homeworks and a final journal-style research report.               HONORS COURSES    Open only to students who have been admitted to the Psychology Honors Program. Either PSYCH-UA 200 or PSYCH-UA 201 (but not both) may be counted as an advanced elective in the fulfillment of the requirements of the major.            HONORS SEMINAR I (PSYCH-UA 200)    Offered Every Fall. Prerequisite: Admission to the psychology honors program.    Students read and discuss recent studies and classical papers related to current controversies in psychology. A portion of class time is set aside for discussion of theoretical and technical aspects of each student's thesis project.            HONORS SEMINAR II (PSYCH-UA 201)    Offered Every Spring. Prerequisite: PSYCH-UA 200.    A continuation of PSYCH-UA 200. Students are also expected to present preliminary results of their thesis projects and interpret their findings.               GRADUATE COURSES OPEN TO UNDERGRADUATES    Certain graduate courses are open to advanced undergraduates who satisfy the following prerequisites: Junior or Senior major in Psychology, permission of the student's undergraduate psychology advisor, permission of the Department of Psychology (graduate division), and additional specific prerequisites listed for each course.

Research is central in our graduate training. Students are exposed to a broad range of knowledge in cognition and perception and they are trained to think creatively and to develop independent research careers.                   Our program spans cognition and perception, examining mental processes such as perception, attention, memory, categorization, language, emotion, development, motor control, and cognitive neuroscience. How do we identify the letter &quot;a&quot;? How do we perceive depth and shape? What representational resources are innate? How do human cultures, and individual children, go beyond innate representational capacities? How do toddlers make decisions about their world? How are explicit and implicit memories coded in the brain? How do we inhibit inappropriate responses? How are sentences understood? How are new concepts acquired? How does attention affect perception?                   Students and faculty work closely with researchers in other departments ( Neural Science , Computer Science , Linguistics , and Philosophy ). Every week there are journal club discussions and talks by leading researchers that take place within the Psychology Department, in other NYU departments, and at other nearby schools in New York City (see Events ). Ready access to researchers at several great universities and to incredible cultural resources makes New York City a great place to study perception and cognition.                  Our graduate students begin research immediately. Students benefit from interaction with their faculty advisers and the lively exchange of research ideas among students, postdocs, and faculty at weekly Cognition and Perception colloquia and brown bag talks , research seminars, journal clubs ( cognitive neuroscience , development , ... see Events ) and our annual miniconvention. As a result of this focus on research, our students publish regularly in high-impact journals and go on to become researchers at the best research universities and industrial laboratories.                               Curriculum             What follows is a brief version of our curriculum. Full details may be found in our Graduate Student Guide . Our curriculum is designed to help students master the skills required to accomplish high quality research. Within the first two years, most students have completed the bulk of our primary course requirements. We require all students to take at least four courses in core, content-based areas of the discipline such as Memory, Perception, Attention, Cognitive Development, Psycholinguistics and Cognitive Neuroscience. In addition, we require all students to take at least two courses in quantitative methods, which can be the two-semester departmental statistics sequence, or other courses in probability theory, simulation, advanced statistical methods, etc. In addition, there are advanced seminars in areas related to the research areas of the faculty and students. The course catalog and schedule are online.                  A key aspect of our program is its strength in cognitive neuroscience, which students can select as their &quot;concentration&quot;. One aspect of this is the new, on-site, research-dedicated Center for Brain Imaging that includes a 3T MRI scanner and EEG facility, and will soon include a TMS facility as well. The center is designed to allow students the training and opportunity to become experts in cognitive neuroscience. Through a combination of course work and hands-on experience, students who select this concentration will receive training in the techniques of cognitive neuroscience and will apply these techniques to their chosen research questions.                   Students join a laboratory and begin to design and carry out a research project in their first semester. They are required to write a paper based on research they have performed as well as give a talk in our annual miniconvention at the end of their first and second years. The 2nd-year paper and completion of our basic course requirements generally result in the awarding of an MA degree. We encourage students to collaborate with more than one faculty member, including doing a full laboratory rotation or two. Students may work with primary Cognition &amp; Perception faculty or with affiliates from other programs (e.g., Social Psychology) or departments (e.g., the Center for Neural Science). (See faculty listed alphabetically with a sentence about their research interests, or by area .) In their third and fourth years, PhD students are focused primarily on research.                  We consider the best experience that students can have to become productive researchers is to carry out, write up, and present their research projects. The 1st- and 2nd-year research requirements emphasize this goal. The content and methods courses are designed to provide students with the context and tools they need to produce world-class research on their own. After graduating, most of our students have gone on to research careers. (See Recent PhDs .)                                                 Support             All students accepted into our graduate program are fully funded through the Henry M. MacCracken Program. MacCracken funding is provided through a combination of teaching assistantship, research assistantship, and fellowship, in proportions to be determined. The award package typically includes a full tuition scholarship, comprehensive health insurance and a stipend. Funding is typically guaranteed for five years, although students with substantial graduate credits or a Master's degree may only be guaranteed four years of support. For current information on the Psychology Department's aid package, please see our doctoral financial aid page .                         There is a very limited supply of subsidized housing available for graduate students which is generally used for a subset of each entering class to provide them the opportunity to get settled in New York City during their first year of residence.                               Admissions             To apply for admission to the Graduate Program in Cognition &amp; Perception, you'll need the application form , which is available from the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences. Apply for admission to the Department of Psychology. In the forms there is a place where you specify the particular program in which you are interested (e.g. Cognition &amp; Perception), as well as whether you are also interested in the Developmental Concentration.                 In the application, it is requested that you supply a personal statement. You are free to include any information in that statement that you feel will help us in our admissions decision. However, as we are a research-based program, it is especially useful if you include a review of any research experience you have had (explain what was interesting about it) as well as your current research interests.                  Together with your application, the Graduate School of Arts and Science will require you to upload official transcripts of grades from other schools you have attended, both undergraduate and graduate. In addition, it is required that you take the Graduate Record Exam ( GRE ). Some of our students also submit scores from the Advanced Psychology GRE test. We place very little weight on that score, and do not encourage you to take it.      Please do NOT mail any documents (transcripts etc) to the department. Everything needs to be uploaded and submitted through the online application.             International applicants must take the TOEFL exams if English is not their first language unless they earned a Bachelor's or Master's degree at an English speaking university. Additional information of concern to international applicants is available online from the Office of Global Services .                 We recommend that you submit your application so as to arrive by December 12th.

ADVANCED SEMINAR IN PERCEPTION (PSYCH-UA 61)    Prerequisites: PSYCH-UA 1 and 22 or NEURL-UA 100 and 220.    The objective of this course is to master select topics in perceptual psychology and sensory neuroscience, focusing on visual perception, visual neuroscience and computational neuroscience. This is an interdisciplinary field of science, crossing the boundaries between psychology, biology, physics and engineering. This course is intended for neural science majors and psychology majors that are on track for careers in science and medicine. This course is also appropriate for students in the psychology master\u2019s degree program. Topics include: neurophysiology and neuroanatomy; psychophysics; neuroimaging; linear systems theory; signal detection theory; light and the eye; physiology and anatomy of the retina; color vision; pattern and texture perception; perception of depth; visual motion perception; attention and awareness.            INDUSTRIAL AND ORGANIZATIONAL PSYCHOLOGY (PSYCH-UA 62)    Prerequisite: PSYCH-UA 1 and 10 and 30 or 32 or 34 or 36.    The focus will be on psychology as applied to work, as well as human behavior from the perspective of employees and employers. The course will explore three levels: - the individual, the team, and the organization as a whole. Topics covered will include: employee engagement, satisfaction, identify, esteem, and career interests; hiring and firing; and. motivating and rewarding staff to increase performance and productivity.     Managing human capital from the firm\u2019s perspective involves work-environment culture and climate, and productivity improvement to develop the healthiest organization. Special topics will include the rise in conflict and employee violence, as well as the growing difficulty with work-life balance, diversity, technology and social media opportunities and challenges. We will look at individual differences involved in psychological assessment and testing for recruiting, transfer, promotion and termination. The objective in I/O Psychology is to achieve a balance between employees\u2019 wants and needs, and the firm\u2019s business imperatives.     This class is best suited to those with an interest in and appreciation for business, economics, and quantitative analysis (e.g. Statistics) for informed business decision-making. Those considering careers in Human Resources or advanced graduate study in Psychology and Business will find relevance.                MOTIVATION AND VOLITION (PSYCH-UA 74)    Offered Every Fall. Prerequisites: PSYCH-UA 29 and 32    The course provides an overview of the major theories and findings in research on motivation and volition. More specifically, we will address the history of research on motivation and volition, classic phenomena of being motivated versus lacking motivation and willpower, the psychology of goals (goal setting, goal implementation, effortful goal pursuits, disengagement, content and structure of goals, the mental representation of goals), disorders of self-regulation, and cognitive-neuropsychological research as well as the perspective of economics on motivation and volition. We will focus on understanding the interrelations and contradictions between the different approaches, and on designing research that promotes these different lines of thinking.            CLOSE RELATIONSHIPS (PSYCH-UA 300)    Prerequisite: PSYCH-UA 32    Close relationships are at the core of the human experience. You already have extensive experience with relationships of many sorts \u2013 family bonds, friendships, and probably romantic partnerships as well. The objective of this course is to introduce you to the scientific perspective of close relationships. You will learn how research psychologists apply the scientific method of data collection and analysis to investigate how people experience and think about relationships in general, and romantic relationships specifically. What makes someone attractive? Do we each have one true love out there or is the person you end up with determined by who happens to be around? Is it better to see your romantic partner for who they really are or to see them through rose-colored glasses? How do relationships influence the way you see yourself? This course will address these and related questions from a social psychological perspective.            COGNITIVE DEVELOPMENT (PSYCH-UA 300)    Prerequisites: PSYCH-UA 34    This course will examine how children's thinking develops from infancy through childhood. We will discuss how children develop knowledge and reasoning skills across various domains (e.g., how children learn and think about objects, people, the natural world, and society) and we will examine the major theories and explanations of cognitive growth. This course will include consideration of both classic and contemporary research on cognitive development.            COGNEURO: PRINCIPLES OF FRONTAL LOBE FUNCTIONS (PSYCH-UA 300)    Prerequisites: PSYCH-UA 22 and 25 or 29.    The frontal cortex is thought to be a key cortical area important for the integration of sensory and motor information. Many cognitive and emotional facets of our behavior that make us unique as humans are thought to depend on the frontal cortex, which accounts for almost 1/3 of the cortical surface of the entire brain. In this course we will delve into the issues that have led many clinicians and scientists throughout the years to suspect that the key to understanding what makes us uniquely human depends on understanding the frontal cortex. We will cover important neuropsychological patient studies and theories as well as human and animal empirical studies into the structure and physiology of the frontal lobes as they relate to higher cognitive functions.     Two \u2018mock\u2019 endeavors are emphasized in the class and form the majority of basis for evaluation, the oral communication of research results and the written proposal of a research grant.            DATA LITERACY (PSYCH-UA 300)    Prerequisites: PSYCH-UA 1 and 10    We now live in a world where data is ubiquitous and increasingly influential on decision making at all levels of society. However, most people are not able to meaningfully partake in this new world because they are not data-literate. Thus, the goal of this course is to develop data literacy - the ability to obtain, manage, analyze and understand data. Acquiring this critical skill-set unlocks a wide range of career opportunities and provides the foundation of an educated citizenry in the modern world, preparing you for a successful life in a data-based society. To attain this goal, this course provides a gentle introduction to data-related topics, with a particular emphasis on providing a conceptual understanding, actionable knowledge and long-term retention.            EXPERIMENTS IN BEAUTY (PSYCH-UA 300)    Prerequisite: PSYCH-UA 1    Beauty is famously hard to study scientifically, but students in this hands-on laboratory course will each week formulate beauty-related questions and design and implement experiments to answer them. We also read and discuss one article/chapter each week from authors including Kant, Woolf, Berlin, Donoghue, Kuhn, Quine, and Wittgenstein.            HUMAN SEXUALITY (PSYCH-UA 300)    Prerequisites: PSYCH-UA 1    Sexuality is an essential aspect of everyone\u2019s life. It leads to our most important relationships \u2013 with lovers, spouses, and children. It drives much of our social-networking and status seeking behavior. It evokes our strongest passions - lust, love, jealousy, heartbreak, despair, and hope. And depending on a variety of factors, it can be a highly pleasurable experience that enriches our lives, or a destructive force causing physical, mental, and interpersonal suffering. Basic sexual potentials and tendencies have been built into the human species by evolutionary forces. At the same time, processes of socialization and learning play a crucial role in how these basic potentials are developed, experienced, and manifested in each of us.     Sexual science encompasses a large and multi-disciplinary field of theory and research. This course will examine human sexuality primarily from a psychological perspective, drawing on empirical and theoretical work from the fields of personality, developmental, social, clinical, evolutionary, and cognitive psychology, and less often also from ethology, anthropology, sociology, history, neurobiology, and public policy. It will cover various aspects of human sexual psychology (sexual capacities, desires, attraction, orientation, attitudes, identities, experiences, and relationships) and how they are shaped by biological, environmental, and socio-cultural factors over the course of the human lifespan, from conception to old age. We will also examine theories and methods of sex research, atypical sexualities, sexual dysfunctions, sexual coercion, and the qualities and benefits of good sex.            FROM ILLUSIONS TO INFERENCE: ADVENTURES IN HUMAN PERCEPTION (PSYCH-UA 300)    Prerequisites: NONE    Our sensory perception easily falls prey to illusions and biases. It is tempting to think of these as failures of our brain, but they might not be! In fact, they reveal the difficult challenges that our brain faces when interpreting the world, and the clever (and sometimes not so clever) solutions that it comes up with.      In this course, we will use a wide variety of well-known and lesser-known illusions (visual, auditory, tactile, vestibular, and multisensory) to work towards the central concept of inference: the notion that the brain constantly forms hypotheses about the outside world and computes probabilities over those hypotheses.   We will draw parallels with fun examples from online shopping to medical diagnosis to spam filtering to election forecasting to searching for submarines. There will be a guest lecture about neurological disorders of perception.   We welcome not only students in psychology and neuroscience, but also from other fields (including biology, physics, computer science, economics, marketing, mathematics, and engineering).            LANGUAGE ACQUISITION AND COGNITIVE DEVELOPMENT (PSYCH-UA 300)    Prerequisite: PSYCH-UA 1 or Instructor Permission    In the first three years of life, children go from helpless creatures, fresh out of the womb, to toddlers with a basic grasp of language and the people and objects in the world around them. How do they do that? This seminar will discuss current issues in language acquisition and cognitive development, exploring nature, nurture, and their interaction.            NEUROECONOMICS AND DECISION MAKING (PSYCH-UA 300)    Prerequisites: PSYCH-UA 10 and 25 or 29.    This course explores how humans and animals make decisions, drawing broadly on many perspectives including particularly the nexus of psychological, neuroscientific, and economic considerations, but also ethological and computational ones. The course is organized around modules considering decision making in several sorts of tasks; for instance, by foraging animals or by humans in competitive multiplayer interactions.            PREJUDICE AND STEREOTYPING (PSYCH-UA 300)    This course will cover historical and contemporary scientific approaches to understanding prejudice, specifically prejudice that exists between social groups (for example, ethnic prejudice, religious prejudice, etc.) across different cultures. Readings will draw from multiple social scientific perspectives, and will cover topics including the origins of prejudice, the justification of prejudice, the different forms of prejudicial expression, the identification of prejudice in individuals and institutions, the consequences of being a victim of prejudice, and the value (or not) of different prejudice reduction strategies.            PSYCHOLOGY OF ACTION (PSYCH-UA 300)    In the last decade, there has been a surge of research on the mechanisms of human action. This seminar covers most of the basic questions regarding human action: What are the mechanisms by which action plans are acquired (learned), mentally represented, activated, selected, and expressed? The seminar addresses research on motor control, behavioral and cognitive neuroscience, psycholinguistics, biology, as well as cognitive, developmental, social, and motivational psychology. The seminar thus adheres to a multidisciplinary perspective on the analysis of human action.            PSYCHOLOGY OF ADDICTION (PSYCH-UA 300)    Prerequisite: PSYCH-UA 1    This course will provide: (1) an overview of the major substances of abuse; (2) a review of the various psychological approaches to understanding substance use, abuse, and addiction as informed by the cognitive-behavioral, psychodynamic, and behavioral traditions; (3) an in-depth exploration of the major forms of addiction treatment; and (4) an application of this knowledge to the non-substance or behavioral addictions such as pathological gambling and addictive sexuality.            SCIENTIFIC PROGRAMMING FOR THE BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES (PSYCH-UA 300)    Prerequisites: PSYCH-UA 1 and 10    This course is aimed at undergraduates who are planning to attend graduate school in psychology or one of the other behavioral sciences. There are few commercially available solutions that are versatile enough to fulfill the diverse needs of researchers in the behavioral sciences. Thus, it is increasingly critical that aspiring research practitioners are capable of doing their own scientific programming and computing. This class is designed to impart these capabilities to aspiring researchers in the behavioral sciences - specifically Psychology - who have no background in programming, computer science or any prior exposure to any programming language. To achieve this goal, we will cover the computational and programming needs across the entire research cascade in the behavioral sciences, from data collection to making publication quality figures. This is a hands-on class with a focus on developing practical skills in scientific computing and programming, helping you to pursue your future research goals. Language of instruction is Matlab and some Python.            SELF AND SOCIAL JUDGMENT (PSYCH-UA 300)    Prerequisites: PSYCH-UA 10 and 32    How is the self-concept formed and how do we come to know other people? Students will discuss the role of motivations, cognitive errors and biases, culture, and situational and dispositional influences on how we think about ourselves and other people.            SEMINAR IN THINKING (PSYCH-UA 300)    Prerequisites: PSYCH-UA 10 and 29    This seminar focuses in depth on a single aspect of thinking: decision making. Decision making is a critical part of every person\u2019s life, as we make decisions about major life events such as what college to go to (if any), whether to get married, or what career to follow, down to trivial decisions about which bagel to order or where to sit in a class. We will examine formal theories of how people /should/ make decisions, as well as many studies on whether people are good or even rational decision makers. The class is a seminar, and active discussion and class participation are expected.            SOCIAL ATTITUDES (PSYCH-UA 300)    Prerequisites: PSYCH-UA 32    This course will provide an overview of the major theoretical debates and empirical developments in the area of attitudes and evaluation. Students in this class will be directly exposed to many of the core ideas in attitude research by reading many of the classic articles in this literature. The readings will provide an in-depth exploration of key empirical and theoretical breakthroughs. For example, we will explore implicit and explicit attitude-measurement, persuasion, prejudice, and how attitudes shape our thoughts and actions. Students in the course will also discover the relevance of the attitude-theory to situations of everyday life.            SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE (PSYCH-UA 300)    Prerequisites: PSYCH-UA 22 and 25 and 30 or 32. PSYCH-UA 29 recommended.    This course provides an overview of topics in the emerging field of Social Neuroscience. We will focus on how theories and methods of neuroscience may be used to address classic questions of social psychology from new and informative angles. The goal of this course is to give you a broad background in social neuroscience so that you may (a) be a critical consumer of this literature, (b) broaden the way you think about connections between the mind, brain, and behavior in the context of the social world, and (c) most importantly, apply these ideas to inform your own ideas and future research in psychology.            SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY OF DECISION MAKING (PSYCH-UA 300)    Prerequisites: PSYCH-UA 29 or 32    This course will review theory and research on cognitive and motivational processes underlying judgments and decision making regarding social objects and events. The course will examine how people seek, interpret, and integrate information in making social judgments and decisions. The seminar will discuss models of rational judgment and how cognitive limitations, social stereotypes, emotions, desires, and impulses produce judgmental error and biases. The course will examine how these judgmental phenomena are expressed in everyday life situations.            SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY OF VISUAL PERCEPTION (PSYCH-UA 300)    Prerequisites: PSYCH-UA 1 and 10.    People tacitly assume that they see the world exactly how it is. New research, however, calls this assumption into question and instead suggests our vantage is clouded at best. In this seminar, we discuss research that suggests that visual perception is influenced by the perceiver's cognitions, emotions, goals, motivations, culture, surroundings, and other variables that have been traditionally considered exclusive to social, personality, and cognitive psychology. Students taking this course will read and evaluate the original literature related to these topics. Weekly response papers will inform class discussion of papers. A final paper will be required.            SYSTEMS OF PSYCHOTHERAPY (PSYCH-UA 300)    Prerequisites: PSYCH-UA 30 or 51.    This course will introduce students to the nature of psychotherapy. It will consider the major theories and techniques of psychotherapy, with particular emphasis on psychodynamic and cognitive-behavioral approaches. A significant portion of the course will be devoted to viewing and discussing videos illustrating different methods of psychotherapy. .           SOCIAL VISION (PSYCH-UA 300)    Prerequisites: PSYCH-UA 10 and 32    We tacitly assume perceptions are veridical representations of reality, that the way we see the world reflects the way it really is. In this class, we discuss research that calls this supposition into question. We will investigate the ways in which and reasons why higher-order, top-down influences constrain perception at multiple stages of perceptual processing including eye movements, directing visual attention, filtration, ambiguity resolution, and interpretation. Moreover, we discuss the implications of social vision for consequential behavior and judgment in domains including jury decision making, policing, relationships, health and fitness, politics, and others.            RESEARCH EXPERIENCES AND METHODS (PSYCH-UA 999)    Offered Every Semester. Prerequisites: Permission of Department and PSYCH-UA 10 as well as two (2) other psychology core courses and a GPA of at least 3.0. This course may be repeatable for credit.   Undergraduate students are paired with faculty, advanced graduate students, or other researchers on a one-to-one basis to pursue common research goals in psychology. Undergraduates serve as apprentices on survey, laboratory, clinical, and field research projects and in return receive guidance in reading and developing research skills. Biweekly meetings deal with research methods and design and allow students an opportunity to speak on their research projects. Written assignments include several brief homeworks and a final journal-style research report.               HONORS COURSES    Open only to students who have been admitted to the Psychology Honors Program. Either PSYCH-UA 200 or PSYCH-UA 201 (but not both) may be counted as an advanced elective in the fulfillment of the requirements of the major.            HONORS SEMINAR I (PSYCH-UA 200)    Offered Every Fall. Prerequisite: Admission to the psychology honors program.    Students read and discuss recent studies and classical papers related to current controversies in psychology. A portion of class time is set aside for discussion of theoretical and technical aspects of each student's thesis project.            HONORS SEMINAR II (PSYCH-UA 201)    Offered Every Spring. Prerequisite: PSYCH-UA 200.    A continuation of PSYCH-UA 200. Students are also expected to present preliminary results of their thesis projects and interpret their findings.               GRADUATE COURSES OPEN TO UNDERGRADUATES    Certain graduate courses are open to advanced undergraduates who satisfy the following prerequisites: Junior or Senior major in Psychology, permission of the student's undergraduate psychology advisor, permission of the Department of Psychology (graduate division), and additional specific prerequisites listed for each course.

In conceptual development, my work focuses on categorization: How do children categorize different kinds of objects? Does category structure vary by domain? How do children use categories to guide their inferences and behavior? How does information about within-category variability influence individuals\u2019 concepts?    In the development of social cognition, my work examines how children categorize people, as well as the implications of social categories for children\u2019s behavior, social inferences, and moral cognition.                                          Lisa Chalik      Email: lisa dot chalik at nyu dot edu      CV: click here            I am a PhD student here in the lab. My research focuses on how young children use social categories to make inferences about other people's attitudes and behaviors. One primary question that my research asks is: How do young children incorporate social categories into their moral evaluations? By the preschool years, children expect that people hold special moral obligations toward their fellow social category members--I am currently investigating the developmental processes that might give rise to these beliefs. When I'm not in the lab, I can usually be found baking, taking pictures, or traveling.                                        Emily Foster Hanson          Email: emily dot fosterhanson at nyu dot edu     I am a PhD student in the lab. I am interested in how environmental input, such as certain types of language children hear or the culture they grow up in, shapes conceptual development and categorization. When I have time, I also enjoy doing edible science like fermenting sauerkraut.                                    Tara Mandalaywala           Email: tmandalaywala at nyu dot edu      CV: click here           I am currently a postdoctoral fellow in the CDSC. My research takes a comparative approach to investigating the effects of experience on the development of social cognition and behavior in human and non-human primates. After studying lemurs and monkeys in college and graduate school, my work in the CDSC will examine whether racial identity mediates acute stress responses to social categories in human children. In my free time, I love to travel and explore new places.                                                Kathryn Yee  I manage the general functioning of the lab and am involved in various projects here at the CDSC. I received my degree in Psychology from NYU and have experience in the mental health field working with at-risk youth. I am interested in examining the implications of conceptual development on identity later in life. I hope to pursue a career in clinical psychology so I'm excited to explore my research interests during my time here. I also enjoy working with children, traveling and experiencing new things.                                                        Nicole Graziano  I am a recent graduate from NYU, majoring in Psychology and minoring in Child and Adolescent Mental Health Studies and Spanish. I currently manage projects for the lab. I enjoy working with children, and I am interested in how children develop both intellectually and socially. I hope to ultimately pursue a career in pediatric clinical psychology. In my free time, I like to cook, bake, work on DIY projects, and explore NYC.                                                                                                                                  Mia Lee          I am a senior majoring in Psychology with a minor in Child and Adolescent Mental Health Science at NYU. I'm from Middletown, NJ, where I spend time at the beach when I'm not in the big apple. I enjoy music, dance, and animals. I'm also a major foodie and spend lots of time exploring the variety of tastes that NYC has to offer. I'm interested in exploring how early experiences shape children's development. I am thankful to be working with such a great team, exploring a subject I love!                                                                                 Elysia Choi          I am currently an undergraduate at NYU majoring in Psychology with a minor in Business. I have always loved working with children and am fascinated by the way they interact with each other and also learn new ideas. I hope to keep studying the development of children to the point where one day I could teach it. I love listening to music, doing yoga, and exploring new restaurants in NYC.                                             Anna Zhen          I am a senior at NYU majoring in psychology and double minoring in child adolescent mental health studies and sociology. I have worked with children in a school environment for years and I am very interested on how a child's family, school and surrounding social spheres can affect their development. In addition I am very interested in neuroscience and seek to learn more about the science behind the mechanisms of the brain. In my free time I enjoy playing tennis, biking and drinking a good cup of tea while chatting with friends and family.                                    Talena Lydia Smith          I'm currently a senior majoring in Psychology at NYU and have been working at the lab since Summer 2014. I've always loved kids (ever since I was a kid myself) and I have a great interest in child development. My particular fascinations regard the impact of animal-human relationships on the development of children and the treatment of post-traumatic stress. In an ideal world, I would be able to found an organization/farm that worked on fostering childrens' knowledge and relationships with animals, particularly at-risk populations or those who had survived trauma. When I'm not working at the lab, I'm bottle feeding orphaned animals, taking selfies, rooting for the LA Kings, and reading dystopian young adult novels.                                 Elyana Feldman          I am currently an undergrad studying Psychology and Italian. I love engaging with children in both a formal and informal setting, be it as a preschool teacher or just a camp counselor. Seeing how children react to their surroundings and interact with other children has always interested me. I hope to be an adolescent psychologist for children with genetic and developmental disorders. My hobbies include skiing, cooking, travelling, camping, and listening to music!                                         Jennifer Kwong          I am currently an undergraduate at NYU majoring in Biology. I recently transferred from Boston University but have lived in New York all my life. I love working with kids and seeing how I can make a difference in their lives. I\u2019m planning on minoring in child developmental psychology and am particularly interested in how children form ideas about the world solely based on the environment around them; it\u2019s fascinating how babies are able to pick up so much around them. In my free time, I love playing the piano, swimming, skiing, and making new friends.                                        Michael Sabarese          I am a sophomore at NYU majoring in Biochemistry pursuing minors in Child and Adolescent Mental Health Studies and Genetics. I am from Bay Shore, NY, and I love to read, spend time at the beach, and watching sports. I find ways to relax through track and field, basketball, and baseball. I am interested in studying the many incredible social functions of the brain, and how our brains develop into the powerful biological machines they are. I am thankful to be working with such a great team on some really interesting research here in the lab.                              Gabrielle Ranger-Murdock          I am currently an undergraduate student at NYU studying Psychology. I am double minoring in Child and Adolescent Mental Health Studies and Poverty Studies. Through my years of working with children in multiple settings, I have developed a vast interest in their development. I am very interested in how children\u2019s social development varies depending on their cultural differences and social experiences. In addition, I want to know why these experiences impact children differently later in life. I hope to pursue my Ph.D. in pediatric clinical psychology. I enjoy baking, dancing, and spending time with my family.                                   Amelia Lee          I am an undergraduate student at New York University majoring in psychology and minoring in child and adolescence mental health studies. I am currently a research assistant in the lab, and I am interested in the development of children and how their minds work when they learn, form social relationships, and interact with the world around them. I enjoy working with children and in my free time I love to horse-back ride, travel, and spend time with my family and friends.                                    Nekita Singh          I am currently a senior at CUNY Queens College. Through my research involvement at CUNY Queens, I have developed an interest in social work and public health. I am currently an interdisciplinary major working with the departments of Urban Studies and Women Studies while also earning my minor in psychology. My course work, has provided me with knowledge of gender related health theory and practice in urban areas. Through my involvement with CDSC I endeavor to gain a better understanding of psychology and its application to improving quality of life. With this knowledge, I aspire to understand and determine methods of resolving medical issues that are faced due to cultural norms and practices in underdeveloped countries. My ultimate goal is to further my studies by pursuing a dual degree master\u2019s program in Social Work and Public Health (MSW/MPH). I would like to concentrate on childhood, adolescent, and displaced family populations that are under-served and overlooked, inorder to examine the legal, policy, and human rights dimensions of health.                                       Daniel Brady Cole          I am currently a sophomore at Gallatin with a concentration in Psychology, Ethnic Studies, and their Intersection. I am fascinated by the different speeds and manner in which children develop, specifically in early childhood. I hope to possibly one day have my own practice as a psychotherapist in either New York or San Francisco, seeing both adults and children. In my free time one can usually find me playing basketball, skateboarding, or just hanging out with friends.
