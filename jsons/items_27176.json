We ask that you submit recorded materials that will be reviewed by the faculty. Once that review has been completed we will contact those candidates from whom we require further information. For detailed information on how to submit your recorded materials please go to:    Applicants for the Master of Music    http://steinhardt.nyu.edu/graduate_admissions/guide/muvp/mm/mtp    Applicants for the Advanced Certificate/Dual Degree    http://steinhardt.nyu.edu/graduate_admissions/guide/mvpr/mm/mtp    Undergraduate Applicants - First Year and Transfers    Auditioning is all too often the most difficult aspect of pursuing a career as a professional singer and actor. As a prospective student, try to think of your audition as a unique opportunity for you to introduce yourself to people who are your advocates and who very much want you to be good at what you do. This \"mind set\" will serve you well in any audition situation.    Always remember to take your time and to breathe.    Your task is to share your talents - not to impress the auditors!        Professor Brian Gill with audition advice.    Undergraduate Procedures and Requirements          How do I audition for the program?          What do I prepare for my Undergraduate Audition?          What do I prepare for my Undergraduate Transfer Audition?          What do I bring to my audition?          What do I wear to my audition?          What should I expect at my audition?          How do I audition for the program?    Part I: Submit application to NYU Steinhardt. All prospective students &ndash; except those attending the November 15 Open House auditions &ndash; must first submit an application for admission to the Steinhardt School at New York University. You can find information on the application process through the appropriate admissions office.    Office of Undergraduate Admissions \u2028 212-998-4500    Office of Graduate Admissions \u2028 212-998-5030    Part II: Upload Pre-screening Materials: All prospective students &ndash; except those attending the November 15 Open House auditions - are required to submit a video pre-screening submission prior to being invited to a live audition. In this process, you will make short videos and upload them to GetAcceptd, a company created for this purpose. You may begin this process at:        All pre-screening submissions must be uploaded by the dates below. Materials submitted after these dates may not be accepted.    Early Decision I: November 1 Early Decision II: December 1 Regular Decision: December 15 Transfer Applicants: March 1    Rather than a single long video, we would like three separate clips: the introduction, the first song, and the second song. It&rsquo;s easier for us to review and easier for you to shoot. We will not be influenced by the professional quality of the video. Please do not worry about any elaborate lighting or studio conditions. Below are the requirements and suggestions for your material.       Introduction: Please say your name clearly, the city you are from, and the pieces that you are going to do. Include the Specialization for which you are auditioning (music theatre) and the degree level you would be entering (freshman, transfer).       Two songs: Your two selections should be complete and contrasting songs. Each selection should be no longer than four minutes. Choose material from music theatre repertoire &ndash; but please avoid rock, pop, country, and jazz. Piano must accompany you (no a capella singing). Please make sure your voice can be heard above the accompaniment &ndash; try different distances from the sound source until you find the right &ldquo;balance&rdquo; between piano and voice.       Upload a resum&eacute;.       Upload a headshot or photograph.    After uploading the pre-screening submission, you will immediately be notified that we have received your materials. After those materials have been reviewed, you will be sent an email inviting you to an audition in person, or an email notice that no additional audition is required. This review process can take anywhere from 2-4 weeks. If you are invited to an audition, you must prepare materials according to the guidelines below. If you cannot travel to New York you will have the option of submitting a video audition.    Invited Audition Dates for Undergraduates and Transfers Only: \u2028    Saturday, November 22, 2014 ( last day for Early Decision I candidates to audition )\u2028 Saturday, January 31, 2015\u2028 ( last day for Early Decision II candidates to audition )\u2028 Sunday, February 8, 2015 Sunday, February 22, 2015 Saturday, February 28, 2015 (last day for freshman auditions) \u2028 Saturday, April 4, 2015 ( transfer applicants only )    *The last audition date for undergraduate freshman applicants is February 28. This is also the last date for all talent awards for undergraduate applicants.    What do I prepare for my Undergraduate Audition?    Three (3) Contrasting Songs : You must prepare three contrasting songs that you are able to sing from memory . Select one of the songs to sing first. After your first song the committee will make requests from your list. You will probably not be asked to sing all three songs.    Each selection should be no longer than four minutes, but you are free to sing a short section of a longer song or aria. Pick material from either classical or traditional music theatre repertoire. Avoid rock music, pop music, country music, and jazz.    Note: While some movement may be naturally incorporated into your songs, do not choreograph or over-stage your selections. The first criterion for acceptance into this program is vocal ability and vocal potential. We need to determine how you sing, not how you perform.    One (1) Monologue Performed from Memory : Select a monologue (no more than two minutes in length) that allows you to make strong acting choices. A monologue should take you and your audience on a \"journey.\" Your character should be somehow different at the end than he/she was at the beginning. Pick age-appropriate material, and do not do your monologue with any kind of accent or dialect. We need to hear standard speech with good English diction.    Sight-Reading: Testing your ability to sight-sing music helps us determine your basic musicianship skills. You will be provided with a piece of music and will be expected to sing the melodic line. Sight-singing is a skill that singers develop through a process of ear-training. You can, and should, practice this before your audition. Music theory, music history, and keyboard performance are essential elements in any music curriculum. Study and preparation in these areas will also be a great advantage to you.    What do I prepare for my Undergraduate Transfer Audition?    Four (4) Contrasting Songs : You must prepare four contrasting songs that you are able to sing from memory . Three must be from the music theatre repertoire, and the fourth must be a classical piece. Select which of the songs you wish to sing first. Your classical song must follow that selection. The committee may then make other requests from your list. You will probably not be asked to sing all four songs.    Each selection should be no longer than four minutes, but you are free to sing a short section of a longer song or aria. Pick material from either classical or traditional music theatre repertoire. Avoid rock music, pop music, country music, and jazz.    Note: While some movement may be naturally incorporated into your songs, do not choreograph or over-stage your selections.

Music theory, music history, and keyboard performance are essential elements in any music curriculum. Study and preparation in these areas will also be a great advantage to you.    Note: If you are accepted as a transfer student there are two factors that determine how long it will take you to complete your degree at NYU. These factors are 1) the number of completed credits that NYU will accept and apply to your curriculum requirements and 2) the number of semesters of private voice the faculty adjudicators decide you must take in order to complete your NYU degree. Completed semesters of private voice at another institution will not necessarily count toward your degree requirements at NYU. Be aware that while the voice study requirement can be provided to you immediately upon your acceptance, it often takes longer for the University and the Program to process and apply your transfer credits.    Note for Prospective Transfer Students: Though NYU's deadline for Spring transfer admission is November 1 and our deadline for Summer/Fall transfer admission is April 1, we suggest that you submit your Common Application one month in advance. Submitting your Common Application early will leave you more time to schedule an audition by our deadlines above.    What do I bring to my audition?    Picture and Resum&eacute; &ndash; a recent photograph along with a resum&eacute; of your educational and performing experience.    Audition Music for the Accompanist &ndash; legible copies in the key in which you will sing with all cuts clearly marked. We do not accept &ldquo;charts&rdquo; or lead sheets.    Recital Program (Graduate Auditions Only) &ndash; a copy of the program from your undergraduate voice recital (or equivalent solo recital). Our graduate curriculum is designed for students who have an undergraduate degree in music. If accepted in the program you must take placement tests in music theory and music history. Your results on these tests will determine if any remedial courses will be required in order for you to complete your graduate degree.    What do I wear to my audition?    Professional performers are often expected to dress with a sense of &ldquo;the occasion&rdquo; and an audition is a crucial part of both your education and the professional career you are beginning to pursue. Wear clothing that makes you comfortable, but make certain that you look your best and are dressed in a manner that shows you take both yourself and the audition seriously.    What should I expect at my audition?    An accompanist : We will provide a pianist who will play the music you bring. Copies of your songs must be provided in a legible form and in the key you will sing them with all cuts clearly marked. We will not accept charts or lead sheets.    Note: You must audition with the accompanist, or you may bring your own accompanist if you choose. Singing a cappella or performing to pre-recorded music is not allowed!!    Questions : The auditors may decide to ask you questions about your training, your experience, and your goals. This is done in an attempt to get to know you a bit better.  Coaching &amp; Direction : Once you have performed your selections various members of the panel may ask you to make some adjustments or to repeat part of your song. This is done in order to determine how readily and receptively you work with instruction and direction.

Students study with renowned faculty through private lessons, studio/workshop classes, lecture classes, master classes, and seminars. They perform in fully-staged productions of the highest caliber under the guidance of directors, choreographers, conductors, and designers from Broadway and major regional theatre communities. Course Work Course work includes classes in music theatre history and repertoire as well as training in voice with leading vocalists from New York&#39;s professional community. Acting and dance classes are conducted by working professionals in the industry, and classes are offered in diction, speech, audition and business skills, and stagecraft. Every semester a sequence of music theatre workshops focuses on song analysis, character analysis, music theatre styles, and vocal production. Music Theatre majors have the opportunity to cross traditional lines and benefit from classical voice training and the opportunity to participate in opera workshops as well as fully-staged opera productions. Core Requirements and Electives Core music requirements include music theory, aural comprehension, keyboard skills, and music history. The degree requires a total of 131 credits - 44 in liberal arts and 87 in music - and all graduates perform a senior recital. Our department&#39;s programs in Music Technology, Music Business, and Music Education provide students with elective courses that further prepare them for employment opportunities in the world of professional music performance. A new dual degree (B Mus / MA Music Education) is designed for undergraduate performance and composition majors interested in adding a music education component to the four-year degree. Students apply at the end of their sophomore year. Once accepted into the dual degree by the music education faculty, students complete their degree with the added concentration in music education beginning in their junior year. Upon graduation, students may continue to a one-year Masters degree in music education, where they complete their supervised student teaching internship to earn initial and professional teaching certification. Please see your current program director before contacting the Music Education program. More information here including how and when to apply.

We ask that you submit recorded materials that will be reviewed by the faculty. Once that review has been completed we will contact those candidates from whom we require further information. For detailed information on how to submit your recorded materials please go to:    Applicants for the Master of Music    http://steinhardt.nyu.edu/graduate_admissions/guide/muvp/mm/mtp    Applicants for the Advanced Certificate/Dual Degree    http://steinhardt.nyu.edu/graduate_admissions/guide/mvpr/mm/mtp    Undergraduate Applicants - First Year and Transfers    Auditioning is all too often the most difficult aspect of pursuing a career as a professional singer and actor. As a prospective student, try to think of your audition as a unique opportunity for you to introduce yourself to people who are your advocates and who very much want you to be good at what you do. This \"mind set\" will serve you well in any audition situation.    Always remember to take your time and to breathe.    Your task is to share your talents - not to impress the auditors!        Professor Brian Gill with audition advice.    Undergraduate Procedures and Requirements          How do I audition for the program?          What do I prepare for my Undergraduate Audition?          What do I prepare for my Undergraduate Transfer Audition?          What do I bring to my audition?          What do I wear to my audition?          What should I expect at my audition?          How do I audition for the program?    Part I: Submit application to NYU Steinhardt. All prospective students &ndash; except those attending the November 15 Open House auditions &ndash; must first submit an application for admission to the Steinhardt School at New York University. You can find information on the application process through the appropriate admissions office.    Office of Undergraduate Admissions \u2028 212-998-4500    Office of Graduate Admissions \u2028 212-998-5030    Part II: Upload Pre-screening Materials: All prospective students &ndash; except those attending the November 15 Open House auditions - are required to submit a video pre-screening submission prior to being invited to a live audition. In this process, you will make short videos and upload them to GetAcceptd, a company created for this purpose. You may begin this process at:        All pre-screening submissions must be uploaded by the dates below. Materials submitted after these dates may not be accepted.    Early Decision I: November 1 Early Decision II: December 1 Regular Decision: December 15 Transfer Applicants: March 1    Rather than a single long video, we would like three separate clips: the introduction, the first song, and the second song. It&rsquo;s easier for us to review and easier for you to shoot. We will not be influenced by the professional quality of the video. Please do not worry about any elaborate lighting or studio conditions. Below are the requirements and suggestions for your material.       Introduction: Please say your name clearly, the city you are from, and the pieces that you are going to do. Include the Specialization for which you are auditioning (music theatre) and the degree level you would be entering (freshman, transfer).       Two songs: Your two selections should be complete and contrasting songs. Each selection should be no longer than four minutes. Choose material from music theatre repertoire &ndash; but please avoid rock, pop, country, and jazz. Piano must accompany you (no a capella singing). Please make sure your voice can be heard above the accompaniment &ndash; try different distances from the sound source until you find the right &ldquo;balance&rdquo; between piano and voice.       Upload a resum&eacute;.       Upload a headshot or photograph.    After uploading the pre-screening submission, you will immediately be notified that we have received your materials. After those materials have been reviewed, you will be sent an email inviting you to an audition in person, or an email notice that no additional audition is required. This review process can take anywhere from 2-4 weeks. If you are invited to an audition, you must prepare materials according to the guidelines below. If you cannot travel to New York you will have the option of submitting a video audition.    Invited Audition Dates for Undergraduates and Transfers Only: \u2028    Saturday, November 22, 2014 ( last day for Early Decision I candidates to audition )\u2028 Saturday, January 31, 2015\u2028 ( last day for Early Decision II candidates to audition )\u2028 Sunday, February 8, 2015 Sunday, February 22, 2015 Saturday, February 28, 2015 (last day for freshman auditions) \u2028 Saturday, April 4, 2015 ( transfer applicants only )    *The last audition date for undergraduate freshman applicants is February 28. This is also the last date for all talent awards for undergraduate applicants.    What do I prepare for my Undergraduate Audition?    Three (3) Contrasting Songs : You must prepare three contrasting songs that you are able to sing from memory . Select one of the songs to sing first. After your first song the committee will make requests from your list. You will probably not be asked to sing all three songs.    Each selection should be no longer than four minutes, but you are free to sing a short section of a longer song or aria. Pick material from either classical or traditional music theatre repertoire. Avoid rock music, pop music, country music, and jazz.    Note: While some movement may be naturally incorporated into your songs, do not choreograph or over-stage your selections. The first criterion for acceptance into this program is vocal ability and vocal potential. We need to determine how you sing, not how you perform.    One (1) Monologue Performed from Memory : Select a monologue (no more than two minutes in length) that allows you to make strong acting choices. A monologue should take you and your audience on a \"journey.\" Your character should be somehow different at the end than he/she was at the beginning. Pick age-appropriate material, and do not do your monologue with any kind of accent or dialect. We need to hear standard speech with good English diction.    Sight-Reading: Testing your ability to sight-sing music helps us determine your basic musicianship skills. You will be provided with a piece of music and will be expected to sing the melodic line. Sight-singing is a skill that singers develop through a process of ear-training. You can, and should, practice this before your audition. Music theory, music history, and keyboard performance are essential elements in any music curriculum. Study and preparation in these areas will also be a great advantage to you.    What do I prepare for my Undergraduate Transfer Audition?    Four (4) Contrasting Songs : You must prepare four contrasting songs that you are able to sing from memory . Three must be from the music theatre repertoire, and the fourth must be a classical piece. Select which of the songs you wish to sing first. Your classical song must follow that selection. The committee may then make other requests from your list. You will probably not be asked to sing all four songs.    Each selection should be no longer than four minutes, but you are free to sing a short section of a longer song or aria. Pick material from either classical or traditional music theatre repertoire. Avoid rock music, pop music, country music, and jazz.    Note: While some movement may be naturally incorporated into your songs, do not choreograph or over-stage your selections. The first criterion for acceptance into this program is vocal ability and vocal potential. We need to determine how you sing, not how you perform.

Music theory, music history, and keyboard performance are essential elements in any music curriculum. Study and preparation in these areas will also be a great advantage to you.    Note: If you are accepted as a transfer student there are two factors that determine how long it will take you to complete your degree at NYU. These factors are 1) the number of completed credits that NYU will accept and apply to your curriculum requirements and 2) the number of semesters of private voice the faculty adjudicators decide you must take in order to complete your NYU degree. Completed semesters of private voice at another institution will not necessarily count toward your degree requirements at NYU. Be aware that while the voice study requirement can be provided to you immediately upon your acceptance, it often takes longer for the University and the Program to process and apply your transfer credits.    Note for Prospective Transfer Students: Though NYU's deadline for Spring transfer admission is November 1 and our deadline for Summer/Fall transfer admission is April 1, we suggest that you submit your Common Application one month in advance. Submitting your Common Application early will leave you more time to schedule an audition by our deadlines above.    What do I bring to my audition?    Picture and Resum&eacute; &ndash; a recent photograph along with a resum&eacute; of your educational and performing experience.    Audition Music for the Accompanist &ndash; legible copies in the key in which you will sing with all cuts clearly marked. We do not accept &ldquo;charts&rdquo; or lead sheets.    Recital Program (Graduate Auditions Only) &ndash; a copy of the program from your undergraduate voice recital (or equivalent solo recital). Our graduate curriculum is designed for students who have an undergraduate degree in music. If accepted in the program you must take placement tests in music theory and music history. Your results on these tests will determine if any remedial courses will be required in order for you to complete your graduate degree.    What do I wear to my audition?    Professional performers are often expected to dress with a sense of &ldquo;the occasion&rdquo; and an audition is a crucial part of both your education and the professional career you are beginning to pursue. Wear clothing that makes you comfortable, but make certain that you look your best and are dressed in a manner that shows you take both yourself and the audition seriously.    What should I expect at my audition?    An accompanist : We will provide a pianist who will play the music you bring. Copies of your songs must be provided in a legible form and in the key you will sing them with all cuts clearly marked. We will not accept charts or lead sheets.    Note: You must audition with the accompanist, or you may bring your own accompanist if you choose. Singing a cappella or performing to pre-recorded music is not allowed!!    Questions : The auditors may decide to ask you questions about your training, your experience, and your goals. This is done in an attempt to get to know you a bit better.  Coaching &amp; Direction : Once you have performed your selections various members of the panel may ask you to make some adjustments or to repeat part of your song. This is done in order to determine how readily and receptively you work with instruction and direction.

Our curriculum is designed for the serious young musician who is seeking a program that fully integrates the study of voice with the study of acting. We are committed to the traditions of classically-based vocal training while at the same time allowing students to explore the demanding repertoire that is expected of professional singers in today's ever-expanding world of music theatre performance.    In addition to voice, acting and dance, as well as courses in music theatre repertoire and history, the core of our program's music theatre specialization training takes place through an intensive series of music theatre workshops. These workshops explore such critical areas as movement, speech, diction, song study, scene study, audition skills, and business skills - the essential \"tools of the trade\" that a young artist needs in order to pursue a professional career.    In addition to the work in classrooms and studios, the program offers performance opportunities in fully-staged productions under the guidance of professional directors, choreographers, conductors, musical directors, and designers. Our guest artists and faculty are drawn from New York's vibrant community of professional artists who count Broadway, off-Broadway, regional theatre and national tours among their credits.    Students specializing in Music Theatre make their New York \"debut\" in their final semester as they are presented to New York's agents, casting directors, directors, and producers in their graduation showcase - a revue designed to feature the work of each student and help them make their first professional contacts in the industry.    The Department's acclaimed programs of study in Music Business (B.M., M.A.), Music Technology (B.M., M.M., Ph.D.), Jazz (B.M., M.M., Ph.D.), Music Composition (B.M., M.M., Ph.D.), and Music Education (B.M., M.A., Ph.D.) provide a rich and valuable array of elective courses for music performance majors that prepare them for an ever-changing music industry and musical climate. Undergraduate and graduate students also benefit from the extraordinary opportunities available through the diverse offerings of a major university in the cultural capital of the world, New York City.
