Mission The Fine Arts Society is a College of Arts and Science  club with the goal of creating a community of students interested in  art history. The society extends membership to all NYU students.  Through visits to New York City museums and galleries, as well as  walking tours, lectures, symposia, and film screenings, the Fine Arts  Society brings art history majors and non-majors together, with lively  discussions. In addition, the group publishes a newsletter at the  beginning of every month during the school year, with information on  mostly free arts-related events in New York City happening that month.   Their two annual events include a Study Party, held every December on  Reading Day before final examinations, and a Career Symposium, held  every spring. The Fine Arts Society encourages students to  participate in events and public programs hosted by NYU, especially  those at the Grey Art Gallery in NYU, as well as programs presented by  the Fine Arts Society.
