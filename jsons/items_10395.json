Didier Anzieu famously explored the multitude of psychic significations and functions of skin in his seminal book &ldquo;The Skin Ego.&rdquo; Almodovar&rsquo;s film provides an exquisite opportunity to experience and meditate on those meanings through his own artistic vision. Skin - the body&rsquo;s frontier - serves as the psychological battleground.        More info here.
