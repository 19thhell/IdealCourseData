The NYU Paris academic center is located within proximity of Paris' most renowned cultural, artistic, and academic institutions. The resident director, administrative staff, and faculty advise students during their stay in Paris. During the summer session, all undergraduates are housed in student residences in lively and historic neighborhoods. Experience the City of Light with its cultural richness, history, and vibrant daily life through this intellectually and aesthetically stimulating study abroad program.          ACADEMICS   The undergraduate program in Paris provides a rich introduction to historic and present-day France through classroom studies and diverse extracurricular activities. Intensive French language classes, offered at all levels, are taught by instructors with native proficiency. Faculty who teach French civilization courses (offered in English or in French), provide exceptional academic instruction. Courses include field trips to culturally significant sites in the city.           HOUSING &amp; MEALS       All students must stay in NYU provided housing. Participants in the summer undergraduate program are housed in a residence hall in a lively neighborhood close to the historic neighborhoods of the Marais and the Bastille, and within easy commuting distance to the NYU academic center.   All classes are held at the centrally located NYU Paris Center, comprised of classrooms, a student lounge, a lecture hall, and computer terminals for student use. Students are also strongly recommended to bring their own laptop computers. The NYU Paris staff helps students make the most of their summer in Paris. Full-time staff includes the Resident Director of NYU Paris, Academic and Student Life Staff, and an on-site Counselor.           EXCURSIONS      To enhance students' academic experience, NYU Paris hosts several lectures throughout the summer session that bring together French and Francophone artists, scholars, and activists. Cultural activities such as neighborhood walking tours, visits to world famous museums such as the Louvre and the Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay, and attendance at numerous ballet, concert, and theatre performances are scheduled to complement the academic program. Excursions further complete the cultural calendar: activities planned for 2015 may include day trips to Chartres, Giverny, and the D-Day beaches in Normandy.

We will consider how photography has enlarged and affected our vision and knowledge of the world, and how photography has influenced and been influenced by other modes of artistic expression (theatre, film, literature, the fine arts). In addition, we will consider photography as it is defined through a variety of means, from political documentary to fashion photography to advertising. Visits to photography exhibits in and outside of Paris will form an integral part of this course. Sample syllabus .

Field trips include visits to the Orsay Museum with its superb reconstruction of 19th-century aesthetic life, the 17th-century private palace that now houses the Picasso collection, and the incomparable Louvre, among others.

CONTENT COURSES CONDUCTED IN ENGLISH                                                    FREN-UA 9881 French Culture and French Cinema: French Society Through French Films -- Staff 4 points                                Conducted in English   This course traces the development of French cinema through an investigation into major works of French film art and the social and historical contexts in which they were produced. Starting with the classics of French cinema and moving forward to the present day, students examine how these films reflect the social and cultural trends of their time. Through a focus on questions of representation and point of view, students consider how recent French history is transmitted through film. Classes are organized around film screenings in and outside of class and assigned readings.

This course explores photography from the 1830s to the present day, emphasizing style and subject matter (rather than technical processes) in the work of the major photographers. We will consider how photography has enlarged and affected our vision and knowledge of the world, and how photography has influenced and been influenced by other modes of artistic expression (theatre, film, literature, the fine arts). In addition, we will consider photography as it is defined through a variety of means, from political documentary to fashion photography to advertising. Visits to photography exhibits in and outside of Paris will form an integral part of this course. Sample syllabus .

Using the resources of Paris and its surrounding neighborhoods, this course examines a wealth of art movements (realism, the Barbizon School, impressionism, neoimpressionism, postimpressionism, the Nabis, and cubism) as they were formed in the 19th and 20th centuries. The second half of the course focuses on changes in the art world during the first half of the 20th century, with particular attention on the dada movement, surrealism, abstract expressionism, and other movements that influenced and changed major art capitals of the world. Field trips include visits to the Orsay Museum with its superb reconstruction of 19th-century aesthetic life, the 17th-century private palace that now houses the Picasso collection, and the incomparable Louvre, among others.
