The non-credit certificate is designed for students not wishing   to pursue a degree in the field, but those looking to gain experience   while taking courses at a discounted rate. The courses pertaining to the   certificate are taken for non-credit and are non-transferable. A certificate is awarded to students who successfully complete the four required courses within one year or two successive summers.   Although these courses are taken for non-credit, students must earn a C   or better grade point average. Students are expected to have met all prerequisites for each course prior to enrollment.    Complete the dramatic writing certificates in our regularly scheduled summer sessions.
