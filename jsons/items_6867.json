You may reserve up to six hours at a workstation at a time. Slots reserved beyond the six-hour maximum will be removed by AMS staff. If you are more than 15 minutes late for your reservation, your reservation will be canceled and made available to other clients. The AMS reserves the right to cancel reservations as needed for the purpose of hardware and software troubleshooting, or for severe weather events requiring facility closing.     How to Reserve a Workstation   In a separate browser tab or window, log into your NYU Email account powered by Google, to expedite the connection to the AMS Google Reservation Calendar. ( Note: Do not use a personal Gmail account as it may not properly sync with NYU's Google Calendar system.) Select the link of the self-service workstation you would like to reserve from the list below. In the reservation calendar that opens, you will see the time slots that are available for reservation. Reservation slots are configured in 30-minute sections. Select the desired 30-minute slot(s) to complete your reservation for that station (up to six hours). A confirmation window will appear. Once you have confirmed the time and the workstation, click Save .   Reservations for the 3D D PC Mojo Print workstation are configured as single day slots. Clients can expect to complete a 2\"x 2\"x 2\" model build within a 24-hour period. Larger models (up to the 5\"x 5\"x 5\" maximum) will require two slots, or up to 48 hours, to complete printing.     3D A Mac/PC    3D B Mac    3D C Mac    3D D PC Mojo Print    Mac Print 4900 A    Mac Print 4900 B    Mac Print 4900 C    Mac Print 4900 D    Flextight A    Flextight B      Please note: The AMS Reservation Calendar hours are subject to adjustment on a semester-by-semester basis.
