and physical properties are affected by their structures, and how they unite or assemble to form the kinds of matter that make up the physical world. Knowledge of chemistry is fundamental to an in-depth understanding of the structural properties and biochemical reactions that define all living systems. In fact, chemistry interfaces with the life sciences and with physics and mathematics. The range of applications of modern chemistry is broad, spanning many aspects of human activities such as the improvement of agriculture, the discovery of new drugs, and the creation of new materials by learning from nature how molecules are assembled and how they recognize one another. Chemistry drives the exciting field of nanotechnology that generates new materials for devising ever smaller electronic devices with enhanced computing or information storage characteristics; that invents novel materials for innovative applications in industry and everyday life; and that constructs novel photosensitive materials for solar energy conversion to electricity, to cite just a few examples    The Chemistry major builds on the Foundations of Science program and offers students the opportunity to pursue their interests in more specialized fields of chemistry such as biochemistry, organic and physical/biological chemistry, and materials sciences. The major offers elective courses that exploit the interdisciplinary areas of biochemistry, materials science, and biological and biophysical chemistry. The major in Chemistry prepares students for graduate work and rewarding careers in all phases of scientific life, from basic research to commercial product development.

In contrast to classical mechanics, which describes the interaction of energy and matter on large bodies, quantum mechanics focuses on the interactions of energy and matter at the atomic and subatomic level. Hence, this course provides detailed insight into modern approaches that explain the structure and spectra of atoms and molecules. After completion of this course, students are able to understand the origins and meanings of key chemical concepts, including wave functions, atomic and molecular orbitals, energy levels, hybridization, atomic and molecular spectra, and electron spin. They are also able to interpret various spectra&mdash; electronic, rotational, infrared, and nuclear magnetic resonance&mdash;and to correlate these to the structures of atoms and molecules.

The course introduces the principles and practices of &ldquo;classical&rdquo; physicochemical methods in chemical thermodynamics and kinetics, and continues with modern experimental and computational methods that are widely used in contemporary analytical, organic, physical, and biological chemistry laboratories. The experiments include thermochemical techniques such as calorimetry to determine the heat exchange during chemical reactions or physical processes, construction and interpretation of phase diagrams of binary and ternary mixtures, measurement and prediction of kinetic rates of chemical reactions, determination of rate constants, characterization of colloids, and measuring the electrochemical properties of matter. The experiments will be supported by computer simulations, and are highly focused on the processes of experimentation, data recording, correct analysis, and meaningful interpretation of the observations. After completion of this course, the students will be able to approach a chemical problem, set up a hypothesis, perform accurate measurement, interpret the results, verify the hypothesis, draw conclusions, and communicate effectively the results orally and in writing.    * 2 credits    *Pre or co-requisites are CHEM-AD 103                                                                       Fall 2013 ;             14 Weeks                                                                                                   Mazin Magzoub , Wael M.

Indeed, the very principles of chemistry, biology, physics, and math converge in the field of biochemistry, and biochemical concepts provide a focal point for many disciplines, including biology, healthcare, the pharmaceutical industry, environmental studies and ecology, and our understanding of evolution. This course opens the study of metabolic pathways by which cells catabolize and metabolize carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins. We will examine the mechanisms of the different reactions that constitute these pathways and the regulatory mechanisms that control their efflux in living systems. Review of scientific literature will broaden our understanding of metabolism in the human body with special focus on human diseases as a result of defects in metabolic pathways.

Through the exposure to NYUAD faculty research students identify potential areas of interest for their own capstone research, and over the course of the semester develop and put into writing an in-depth chemistry capstone proposal. The final capstone proposal is due at the end of the seminar series so that students can begin the Capstone Project in the fall semester of their senior year.

Applications to other disciplines are emphasized. Since the derivative measures the instantaneous rate of change of a function and the definite integral measures the total accumulation of a function over an interval, these two ideas form the basis for nearly all mathematical formulas in science, engineering, economics, and other fields. This course also provides instruction in how to model situations in order to solve problems. Applications include graphing, and maximizing and minimizing functions. In addition to two weekly lectures, students attend a weekly recitation focused on applications. Placement into Calculus with Applications is decided by discussion with mentors and the results of a mathematics placement examination.    May not be taken if MATH-AD 110 Calculus is completed    This is a required course for Economics majors until the class of 2017. This course can be substituted with MATH-AD 110 Calculus.                                   This course has a discussion section .

Integration and differentiation of functions of several variables require new concepts and techniques. The course has applications to science and engineering as well as economics. Specific topics include vectors in the plane and space; partial derivatives with applications; double and triple integrals; spherical and cylindrical coordinates; surface and line integrals; and divergence, gradient, and curl. In addition, the theorems of Gauss and Stokes are rigorously introduced.

Following an introduction to the physical sciences, the course focuses on velocity, acceleration, forces, and energy, while simultaneously introducing students to atoms and molecules. Chemical reactions are examined, and the energy changes associated with them are investigated via a thorough analysis of the three laws of thermodynamics. Laboratory exercises focus on the guiding principles of the scientific method and an introduction to experimental design, and scientific presentation, including technical writing. Weekly discussion sections are designed to hone proficiency at solving problems in a collaborative, team environment.

Concurrently, atomic theory, the theory of molecular bonding, and atomic and molecular structures and shapes, in which forces and energy play a role, are investigated. Students apply these concepts to understanding molecules related to the life sciences. Laboratory exercises focus on acquisition of data and analysis with a continued emphasis on technical presentation. Weekly discussion sections are designed to hone proficiency at solving problems in a collaborative, team environment.

Capacitors, current, and basic circuits are explored with an eye toward understanding their applications to chemical reactions and the behavior of living cells. The rates and directions of chemical reactions are explored as chemical kinetics and chemical equilibrium are investigated with a special focus on acid-base chemistry. These fundamental physical and chemical principles are used to describe basic cellular monomers and polymers including DNA, RNA, and protein, and the sequence of events that leads to information flow and its regulation in the cell nucleus. They are also applied to macroscopic systems found in the biosphere. Laboratory exercises focus on fundamental protocols and tools needed to sharpen basic laboratory skills. Weekly discussion sections are designed to hone proficiency at solving problems in a collaborative, team environment.

This leads to another question: If a specific function is desired, can a form or shape be engineered or modified to execute or improve that function? The course examines the form/function concept in magnetic and electrical fields, the behavior and design of small molecules, and the activity of proteins as the workhorse in biological systems. Laboratory exercises require students to design experiments related to crystals and crystallography, and to examine chemical forms at the macroscopic and microscopic levels. Weekly discussion sections are designed to hone proficiency at solving problems in a collaborative, team environment.

In physics, disturbances generate waves that are associated with the transmission of light and sound. These same waves generate responses in living organisms as sensory systems detect them, including nerves in some species. Electromagnetic waves, interactions among light, matter, and living systems are examined. Change during the growth of cells is explored at the molecular level as well. Laboratory exercises fuse physics, chemistry, and biology as students engage in projects related to recombinant DNA technology, gene cloning, and protein synthesis and characterization.

This is embodied in physics and chemistry in quantum theory and the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. But living systems provide countless examples of oscillatory events that possess inherent uncertainty when scientists try to predict outcomes. Indeed, this final chapter in Foundations of Science challenges students to consider the very nature of studying complex problems and systems and assessing the uncertainty associated with the scientific method. The laboratory exercises involve collaborative projects in which teams of students must apply their acquired knowledge and skills to design experiments focused on answering a question or solving a problem, keeping uncertainty in mind as they report their results and discuss additional data that would be need to provide a better answer or solution.

The focus of the Biochemistry program is similar to that of the Chemistry program, but with an emphasis on the chemistry of living systems. In fact, biochemistry also studies the world of molecules, how they are created from atoms, how their chemical and physical properties are affected by their structures, and how they unite or assemble to form the kinds of matter that make up the living world. A basic knowledge of chemistry, which is provided in the Foundations of Science curriculum, is fundamental to an in-depth understanding of the structural properties and biochemical reactions that define all living systems.   Outstanding and highly motivated students are offered special opportunities for research, independent study, summer laboratory research, internships, and other enhancements at the NYU campuses in New York and Abu Dhabi, with strong interactive ties with laboratories at the two sites. Additional studies in mathematics, especially linear algebra and multivariable calculus, are highly recommended for students planning on graduate work in chemistry or biochemistry. The specialization in Biochemistry requires three courses. Instead of Chemical Experimental Methods, students take Experimental Biochemistry, and as the two Chemistry electives, students take Biochemistry 1 and 2.
