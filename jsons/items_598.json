To declare the Cinema Studies major/minor or be cleared for registration, CAS students should meet with the Tisch Cinema Studies Department in the following time periods: For Spring Registration: October 1 to November 1 For Fall Registration: March 15 to April 15    For further information, please review the Cinema Studies webpage , contact Melanie Daly (Department of Cinema Studies, 212-998-1600), or see your academic adviser in the College Advising Center.
