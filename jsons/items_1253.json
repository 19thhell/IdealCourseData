The epics, from the ancient world to the Renaissance, frequently reflect and define this debate. This course examines how the epics of Homer, Vergil, Dante and Milton not only mirror the philosophical and theological perceptions of the period, but sometimes forecast future debates on the issue. Readings may include the Epic of Gilgamesh, Iliad or Odyssey , Aeneid , and Divine Comedy , as well as selections from Plato's Protagoras or Aristotle's Ethics , Cicero's De Fato , Boethius's Consolation of Philosophy , and Fromm's Escape From Freedom .

In recent years, the archaeological record of excavated Early Chinese manuscripts has revealed that texts known as rishu \u65e5\u66f8 (\u201cdaybooks\u201d) circulated widely in the Chinese cultural sphere during the late Warring States, Qin, and Western Han periods ( ca . 3 rd \u2013 1 st centuries BCE).\u00a0 While primarily concerned with practical methods of selecting auspicious times and places for a variety of activities in daily life \u2013 activities such as travel, marriage, planting crops, seeking an audience, or burying the dead \u2013 the manuscripts also tended to incorporate a range of other miscellaneous contents with the result that no two daybooks are precisely alike.\u00a0 In this talk, I will introduce select passages from daybook manuscripts with an emphasis on the links and divisions they imply between different forms of knowledge circulating in the formative years of the Chinese Empire. There will be a reception folowing the event. This is a public event.
