Presentations    9:00 AM &ndash; 12:30PM Friday, December 12th, 2014    New Food Enterprises 9:00-9:45AM     Amanda Feldman Growing Food Culture: A Business Proposal    Growing Food Culture is a business proposal for a consulting company that specializes in launching and expanding food programs in the workplace, with a goal of using food to expand the company&rsquo;s culture. Currently, people are spending more time than ever before at their offices. Well-known technology companies such as Google and Airbnb now offer delicious, free food programs for their employees. This is not the cafeteria of yesteryear with a lunch lady serving mystery meat but rather delectable organic, local fare prepared by classically trained executive chefs. As more companies from both the tech and non-tech industries decide they want to offer food programs, there is a growing need for food program experts to help build these new programs. This business will offer three main tiers of program involvement ranging from Basic to Intermediate to Advanced, all of which can be customized based on the company&rsquo;s needs. Offering food programs are a growing corporate trend with many potential growth opportunities, which makes it the perfect time to launch a food consulting service like Growing Food Culture.    Nahir P&eacute;rez Soto Marketing Soursop Juice to the Health Conscious Consumer    The health and wellness sector gets bigger everyday. With a growing consumer base companies are constantly looking for new products to market to this sector. This project explores the viability of marketing the juice from soursop, a tropical fruit, to the health conscious consumer. In order to determine if this exotic tropical fruit has what it takes to position itself in the health and wellness market, it is important to consider how the market is set up and what consumers expect from these types of products. After this analysis was done, the product's nutritional criterion was evaluated. The juice from the soursop fruit has an array of nutritional benefits ranging from the many medicinal uses of the fruit and plant in tropical countries, to the actual nutritional content of the fruit. Linking this information of the nutritional content of the fruit to the benefits they have for the human body provides a basis for companies to rely upon when marketing the juice to the health conscious consumer. It is this nutrient content that will allow the fruit to insert itself and be competitive in a market where products like coconut water dominate sales.    Erika Wright A Business Plan: Little Barn Food Truck    In 2012, the National Restaurant Association reported that food truck sales had reached $650 million; by 2017 sales are estimated to reach $2.7 billion. With this significant projected growth Little Barn Food Truck, based in Cold Spring, NY will be a mobile food concept that will seek to capture that booming industry with a European influenced seasonal farm-to-table menu. Targeting a growing demographic that is health conscious and recognizes the importance of supporting the local economy; Little Barn will source and promote Hudson Valley&rsquo;s finest food and beverage purveyors.    Adriana Fernandes Halloran Semente: Sustainably produced, fairly traded and wholesome drinks!    Semente connects smallholder farmers in the Brazilian Amazon to the dynamic market of functional beverages by manufacturing and commercializing naturally functional beverages (no additives or artificial enhancements), from delicious and nutrient-rich superfruits and nuts native to the Brazilian Amazon. Our social mission is to create well-nourished and economically productive rural communities by rewarding agroecological farmers. Smallholder farmers are vital to the world&rsquo;s agriculture and rural economy, and we understand that their livelihoods are intrinsically connected to the health and sustainability of the world&rsquo;s forests. Thus, our functional drinks are the result of a three-fold, market-driven conservation model that seeks to: 1) build a vertically integrated and inclusive value-chain for fruits and nuts in the Amazon; 2) provide tangible, economic rewards to smallholder farmers for sustainable harvesting practices, improving their social and economic well-being while conserving the forest; 3) market fair trade, organic, tasty and nutritious, ready to drink beverages for the increasingly health-conscious costumers in Brazil and the US.    The Politics of Food and Farming 9:45-10:30AM    Leah Kabran Eden The Politics of a Cross-Movement Coalition: A Case Study of the Lunch 4 Learning Coalition    To make system-level changes, food advocates have begun to get directly involved in the political arena and yet, there is great disagreement about the food movement&rsquo;s political relevance. Within the &ldquo;food movement,&rdquo; there is a diverse set of interests at play including sustainable agriculture, anti-hunger and poverty, public health, economic justice, worker rights, school lunch, environmental concerns and more. As food advocates become more savvy political stakeholders, there will inevitably be efforts for cross-movement organizations to work together to advance a common political agenda through coalition development. Coalition building is a key indicator of success for political action, yet successful coalitions can be very challenging to build and maintain. Based on a case study of the Lunch 4 Learning (L4L) coalition, I explore the internal dynamics of a successful cross-movement coalition among the anti-hunger and poverty movement, the education movement, and the public health movement in New York City. While the groups shared the common goal of wanting NYC public schools to offer free lunch to all children regardless of income levels, they all joined the Lunch 4 Learning coalition for different reasons. By analyzing the policy objectives, leadership structure and internal relationships that made this coalition successful, this research serves as a model for how future cross-movement coalitions can successfully work together to promote political change.    Patty Intrator Title: Shifting Priorities for Farmland Preservation in the Hudson Valley    Until recently, land preservation in the Hudson Valley has primarily stemmed from environmental concerns, not agricultural ones. Local land trusts have been preserving limited amounts of farmland primarily for the purpose of protecting open space, natural features, or the New York City watershed. Meanwhile, farmland has been rapidly disappearing due to the demand for development. Organizations associated with the local food movement have been recognizing that the loss of farmland jeopardizes the growing local economic sector and the supply chain from the Hudson Valley region. As a result, these organizations are pressing land trusts to adopt new tactics that will not only protect farmland but will help maintain agriculture as a viable way of life. This research paper examines the shifting priorities of land preservation groups and their shift from an environmental lens toward an emphasis on local agriculture in the Hudson Valley region.    Siobhan Wallace TheFarmBill.com    The Agricultural Act of 2014 aka the US Farm Bill is a complex, overwhelming piece of legislation with far-reaching implications throughout our food and agricultural systems, and beyond. During the 2012 and 2013 Congressional debates, few websites were focused on educating the general public about the bill's policies and programs. Even policy experts tend to skew any Farm Bill discussion to either the nutritional or subsidy aspects, dismissing the other programs as too small to be of interest. To fill this niche, I have created TheFarmBill.com, a website aggregating information from the bill itself, government reports and websites, and Beltway organizations working from both sides of the aisle. Now anyone can learn about the Farm Bill, its history and the basics of over 80 programs included in the bill in a new visual and accessible manner. The site's ultimate goal is to not only inform more citizens on the Act, but to get them involved before the 2018 version makes it to the Congressional floor. I hope to show everyone that the Farm Bill is so much more than SNAP and subsidies.    Cait Keller The Food System and Environmental Art    &ldquo;The way we eat represents our most profound engagement with the natural world,&rdquo; writes Michael Pollan. &ldquo;Daily, our eating turns nature into culture, transforming the body of the world into our bodies and minds.&rdquo; We have become so alienated from the production of our food and so distanced from the environment from which it comes that our industrialized food system is putting not only our food supply but our very own existence in jeopardy. The food system effects the environment along every stage of the food chain from production to consumption. As climate change proceeds, it is crucial to rethink and restructure the current state of our food system. But, how do we engage the public in discussion around these issues? I propose that environmental art is a way of engaging the public in and educating them about environmental issues associated with the food system. Through various mediums, processes and themes, art has the ability to shed light on environmental issues related to our food system and make such knowledge accessible to all, whether in a gallery or on a city sidewalk. By illustrating our society&rsquo;s exploitations of the environment, art can even offer solutions for redesigning and redefining the future of food.    New Perspectives on Ethnic Food 10:30-11:00AM    Ila Hess Hispanics/Latinos in food media: Where are they?    In the current food TV landscape, there is only one Hispanic/Latino show host presenting Mexican dishes, while other shows feature Latin recipes delivered by non-Hispanic/Latino hosts. This thesis project gauges viewership interest in food segments showcasing Latin cuisine and Hispanic/Latino food show hosts on mainstream, English-language television (TV) channels. Specifically, I 1) assessed whether the market would positively react to an increase in Latin food programming; and 2) explored what types of TV programs with Hispanic/Latino hosts showcasing Latin food as well as other cuisines would garner/boost viewership on mainstream TV channels. To do so, I conducted a 20-question pilot survey with 12 show pitches to 50 New York City residents in five boroughs. The findings indicate that respondents were interested in six of the 12 suggested pitches, which were further developed into six full show proposals featuring Hispanic/Latino hosts and/or Latin cuisine.    Mahira Sheikh Crescent: A Book Proposal    Crescent will be among the new generation of cookbooks that merges personal and historical storytelling with family recipes and vivid photography. This cookbook will introduce or expose my readers to Pakistani cuisine through a series of my mother&rsquo;s carefully crafted, but accessible home recipes along with a historical framework describing the various factors that led to each dish&rsquo;s creation. These factors include Pakistan&rsquo;s geography and natural landscape, its religious history, and its role in the Mughal Empire. Until now, Pakistani cuisine has been discussed mostly within Indian cookbooks or in more general South Asian cookbooks. While South Asian culinary traditions do share many of the same techniques, preparations, and ingredients, my goal is to distinguish and define Pakistani cuisine via its unique history. While the subcontinent shares a common history, there are also distinctions that make Pakistani cuisine unique. It is my hope that readers will have a newfound appreciation for culinary traditions in Pakistan, and its often overlooked global influence.. This book is dedicated to my mother who has inspired me with the stories in this book, and with her life&rsquo;s worth of recipes.    Seon mi Jin Curriculum Proposal: International Cuisine- Korean Cuisine and Culture    The curriculum aims to introduce Korean cuisine and its food culture by studying various topics in the humanities and sociology. Through readings, discussions, lectures and hands-on kitchen demonstrations, students will achieve fundamental understanding of what cuisine means and how it is intertwined with culture and history. Discovering the specificity of Korean cuisine, students can appreciate the value of cultural diversity and embrace different cultures with respect. To achieve these goals, this curriculum contains several units that are composed of both kitchen and lecture classes. Adopting Royer's cognitive theory, kitchen classes will give students prior information of the cuisine by demonstrating Korean food habits and cooking techniques. This provides a \"background experience\" to enhance the understanding of unfamiliar subjects in lectures. Not only its academic depth of lecture classes but also the cultural and experiential use of kitchen classes would make this curriculum original and add value to college-level education for professionals.    Transitions Toward Sustainable Food Industries 11:15-12:00PM    Selina Pino Ethical Consumerism and Farm Worker Wages: Do Consumers Care?    Farm workers are an important part of the agricultural system that are often overlooked, mistreated, and underpaid. Due to their exclusion from the Fair Labor and Standards Act of 1938 (FLSA), farm workers are exempt from minimum wage requirements and overtime regulations. Since the FLSA has not changed throughout the past century, farm workers have organized to fight for better wages from suppliers, corporations and grocery stores. The Coalition of Immokalee Workers (CIW) in Florida have successfully garnered one penny more per pound of tomatoes harvested, almost doubling their pay. In order to spread word of their cause and gain consumer support, the CIW and similar organizations are starting initiatives to label produce from companies that pay higher wages for farm workers. As labels are being rolled out, their effect depends on with whether consumers support this issue, and if they do, how much. This project has focused on ethical consumerism and the willingness of consumers to purchase these items. Although consumers claim support for farm workers, many are not willing to inconvenience their lives to demand produce supportive of them.    Rebecca Taylor-Roseman From Sanchez to Hispaniola: A Case Study of Upgrading the Dominican Cocoa Sector    Today, the Dominican Republic (DR) is the leading global exporter of high-quality organic cacao. Just ten years ago, the DR was a producer of mostly low-quality unfermented Sanchez cacao penalized in the international market. In contrast, the DR is now a leading exporter of premium quality cacao. Proper fermentation and drying are critical to produce quality cacao for manufacture into premium chocolate products, and the successful establishment of post-harvest processing via centralized fermentation and drying was the key to upgrading the Dominican cocoa industry. Experiments with fermentation and drying started taking place in the DR beginning in the 1980s via a series of international development projects; however, it was not until the farmer cooperative Confederaci&oacute;n Nacional de Los Cacaocultores Dominicanos (Conacado) adopted centralized post-harvest processing in 2000 that the critical threshold was reached that ultimately led to sector-wide upgrading. An analysis of the upgrading trajectory of the Dominican cocoa sector by examining the roles of Conacado, traditional Dominican exporting companies, international NGOs, and the Dominican government offers a compelling case study of how one cocoa-producing country moved up the value chain.    Brittany Fleiss A Lesson That Might Bug You, But Won't Bite You!    I have created an educational lesson on the introduction to edible insects for middle-school and high-school students. In my lesson I address why we view insects with disgust and also highlight the many beneficial reasons for consuming insects such as the environmental, nutrition, humane and taste reasons. With global population on the rise and a food system that poses many environmental and health concerns, alternative food sources must be considered. Insects are widely consumed by millions of people across the world but, remain taboo in the United States. The potential of insects as food source has received much hype in recent months in the United States and insect food based startup companies are seeking their niche. However, in order for Americans to consider insects as anything other than a nuisance and &ldquo;icky&rdquo; creatures, the disgust factor associated with these invertebrates needs to be addressed. The American population needs to be reeducated about the importance of insects in order to shed light on, and place value upon them, to help reverse the population&rsquo;s aversion to them.    Alexandre P. Wolf Analysis of Responsible Sourcing Policies in American Fast Food: A Feasibility Study    Today an increasing number of consumers are looking to make food choices that are aligned with their social values. However, as a consumer, it is a challenge to access and/or interpret meaningful information about the sustainability efforts of companies, let alone to compare information across an industry. Although there have been considerable efforts to develop a singular metric to evaluate and compare sustainable practices, none have taken hold in the American quick-service restaurant (QSR) sector. My project examines the feasibility of applying Oxfam&rsquo;s Behind the Brands Scorecard metrics (developed for the food and beverage industry) to evaluate QSR sustainability policies. My ultimate goal for this tool is two-fold: 1) to provide consumers with a clear and concise indicator to compare the sustainability of QSR companies; 2) to incentivize companies to reevaluate their sourcing practices and adopt responsible sourcing.    Understanding Food Culture Through History 12:00-12:45pm    Margherita Pilato Personal Pizza: the Role of the U.S. Home Cook in the Sudden Rise of Pizza    English muffins, mayonnaise and self-rising flour are not often included in the most favored pizza recipes. However, ingredients like these, and the creative cooks who used them, had a hand in turning an innocuous, Neapolitan snack into a staple of the American diet. Pizza&rsquo;s initial introduction to the United States can be traced back as early as 1903, but it remained relatively obscure to the general American public for decades. Suddenly, after World War II, its popularity threatened Americans&rsquo; beloved hot dog and hamburger. A number of historians attribute this major shift to changes in technology and restaurant culture, to the return of American troops, or to the general mood of postwar culture. However, the U.S. postwar home cook&rsquo;s contribution to making pizza an American food has not been well explored. This research aims to fill gaps in the literature through investigating this cultural process within the domestic realm. More broadly, this study considers how culturally conservative eating habits can also be readily permeable and open to rapid change.    Sarah Goldstein Eat Your Veggies: How New Theories of Diet Impacted Fruit and Vegetable Consumption in Eighteenth-Century England    Do expert recommendations to eat more fruits and vegetables make a difference? This paper explores the influence of dietary theory on fruit and vegetable consumption in eighteenth-century England. From nearly the start of the Common Era until the early 1700s, prevailing dietary theory had held that many fruits and vegetables were actually harmful, especially if eaten raw. Cookbooks restated this idea, echoing the philosophy that such foods could throw the body&rsquo;s humors out of balance and produce &ldquo;bad juices.&rdquo; In the eighteenth century, however, several physicians and other authorities challenged this notion, suggesting that a proper diet was more a function of moderate eating than a highly individualized program meant to maintain bodily harmony. These theorists encouraged consumption of fruits and vegetables, and some of them even promoted vegetarianism. By the middle of the eighteenth century, cookbooks began to reflect new ideas about consuming these foods, and even repeated some of the new theories verbatim. An analysis of these cookery books suggests that experts&rsquo; dietary recommendations affected how people prepared and thought about fruits and vegetables, and offers insight into the current relationship between dietary theory and practice.    Marissa Sertich Velie Mother Sauce: Women Who Changed the Culinary Profession    Mother Sauce is a book that strives to enrich the accepted history of professional cooking through the stories of women who significantly contributed to the cuisine, practices and educational systems of western professional food culture. While famous male chefs rule conversations about classic cuisine and have undoubtedly changed the way we cook and eat, the gender bias of historical studies has skewed our perceptions of reality. The male-dominated restaurant industry has always shared space with women. While the tensions in the kitchen surrounding gender might seem like a purely contemporary issue, women have been throwing elbows, fabricated chickens, and knives in the professional setting for a very long time. Chapters of the book focus on several women&rsquo;s accomplishments and contributions during multiple time-periods, including, for example, the influence of Les Meres de Lyon and Eugenie Brazier on classic haute cuisine.    Katie Robertson Memories of Gumbo: An Intergenerational Exploration of Meaning in a Traditional Southern Dish    This book proposal is the exploration of one of my treasured family recipes. By investigating the history of seafood gumbo in my family, I unearthed much more than a recipe. I discovered how the search for \"authenticity\" in a recipe distracts us from the true significance of our strong emotional and sensory attachments to a beloved dish. Through a series of interviews with great aunts, cousins, my grandmother and mother, I learned how the meaning of food traditions is communicated and enlivened through acts like recreating my great grandmother&rsquo;s gumbo as it has been passed down for generations rather than by simply following a recipe. It became evident that what my family feared most wasn&rsquo;t losing an authentic recipe, but losing my great grandmother&rsquo;s memory, the memory of her gumbo, and the lasting gift she gave to her family in teaching them how to make food into love. This book proposal is a collection and a critique of memories. It makes a case for valuing the importance of oral tradition and performing memories as a more valuable tool than written recipes for preserving the integrity of gumbo as a dish.

Presentations    9:00 AM &ndash; 12:30PM Friday, December 12th, 2014    New Food Enterprises 9:00-9:45AM     Amanda Feldman Growing Food Culture: A Business Proposal    Growing Food Culture is a business proposal for a consulting company that specializes in launching and expanding food programs in the workplace, with a goal of using food to expand the company&rsquo;s culture. Currently, people are spending more time than ever before at their offices. Well-known technology companies such as Google and Airbnb now offer delicious, free food programs for their employees. This is not the cafeteria of yesteryear with a lunch lady serving mystery meat but rather delectable organic, local fare prepared by classically trained executive chefs. As more companies from both the tech and non-tech industries decide they want to offer food programs, there is a growing need for food program experts to help build these new programs. This business will offer three main tiers of program involvement ranging from Basic to Intermediate to Advanced, all of which can be customized based on the company&rsquo;s needs. Offering food programs are a growing corporate trend with many potential growth opportunities, which makes it the perfect time to launch a food consulting service like Growing Food Culture.    Nahir P&eacute;rez Soto Marketing Soursop Juice to the Health Conscious Consumer    The health and wellness sector gets bigger everyday. With a growing consumer base companies are constantly looking for new products to market to this sector. This project explores the viability of marketing the juice from soursop, a tropical fruit, to the health conscious consumer. In order to determine if this exotic tropical fruit has what it takes to position itself in the health and wellness market, it is important to consider how the market is set up and what consumers expect from these types of products. After this analysis was done, the product's nutritional criterion was evaluated. The juice from the soursop fruit has an array of nutritional benefits ranging from the many medicinal uses of the fruit and plant in tropical countries, to the actual nutritional content of the fruit. Linking this information of the nutritional content of the fruit to the benefits they have for the human body provides a basis for companies to rely upon when marketing the juice to the health conscious consumer. It is this nutrient content that will allow the fruit to insert itself and be competitive in a market where products like coconut water dominate sales.    Erika Wright A Business Plan: Little Barn Food Truck    In 2012, the National Restaurant Association reported that food truck sales had reached $650 million; by 2017 sales are estimated to reach $2.7 billion. With this significant projected growth Little Barn Food Truck, based in Cold Spring, NY will be a mobile food concept that will seek to capture that booming industry with a European influenced seasonal farm-to-table menu. Targeting a growing demographic that is health conscious and recognizes the importance of supporting the local economy; Little Barn will source and promote Hudson Valley&rsquo;s finest food and beverage purveyors.    Adriana Fernandes Halloran Semente: Sustainably produced, fairly traded and wholesome drinks!    Semente connects smallholder farmers in the Brazilian Amazon to the dynamic market of functional beverages by manufacturing and commercializing naturally functional beverages (no additives or artificial enhancements), from delicious and nutrient-rich superfruits and nuts native to the Brazilian Amazon. Our social mission is to create well-nourished and economically productive rural communities by rewarding agroecological farmers. Smallholder farmers are vital to the world&rsquo;s agriculture and rural economy, and we understand that their livelihoods are intrinsically connected to the health and sustainability of the world&rsquo;s forests. Thus, our functional drinks are the result of a three-fold, market-driven conservation model that seeks to: 1) build a vertically integrated and inclusive value-chain for fruits and nuts in the Amazon; 2) provide tangible, economic rewards to smallholder farmers for sustainable harvesting practices, improving their social and economic well-being while conserving the forest; 3) market fair trade, organic, tasty and nutritious, ready to drink beverages for the increasingly health-conscious costumers in Brazil and the US.    The Politics of Food and Farming 9:45-10:30AM    Leah Kabran Eden The Politics of a Cross-Movement Coalition: A Case Study of the Lunch 4 Learning Coalition    To make system-level changes, food advocates have begun to get directly involved in the political arena and yet, there is great disagreement about the food movement&rsquo;s political relevance. Within the &ldquo;food movement,&rdquo; there is a diverse set of interests at play including sustainable agriculture, anti-hunger and poverty, public health, economic justice, worker rights, school lunch, environmental concerns and more. As food advocates become more savvy political stakeholders, there will inevitably be efforts for cross-movement organizations to work together to advance a common political agenda through coalition development. Coalition building is a key indicator of success for political action, yet successful coalitions can be very challenging to build and maintain. Based on a case study of the Lunch 4 Learning (L4L) coalition, I explore the internal dynamics of a successful cross-movement coalition among the anti-hunger and poverty movement, the education movement, and the public health movement in New York City. While the groups shared the common goal of wanting NYC public schools to offer free lunch to all children regardless of income levels, they all joined the Lunch 4 Learning coalition for different reasons. By analyzing the policy objectives, leadership structure and internal relationships that made this coalition successful, this research serves as a model for how future cross-movement coalitions can successfully work together to promote political change.    Patty Intrator Title: Shifting Priorities for Farmland Preservation in the Hudson Valley    Until recently, land preservation in the Hudson Valley has primarily stemmed from environmental concerns, not agricultural ones. Local land trusts have been preserving limited amounts of farmland primarily for the purpose of protecting open space, natural features, or the New York City watershed. Meanwhile, farmland has been rapidly disappearing due to the demand for development. Organizations associated with the local food movement have been recognizing that the loss of farmland jeopardizes the growing local economic sector and the supply chain from the Hudson Valley region. As a result, these organizations are pressing land trusts to adopt new tactics that will not only protect farmland but will help maintain agriculture as a viable way of life. This research paper examines the shifting priorities of land preservation groups and their shift from an environmental lens toward an emphasis on local agriculture in the Hudson Valley region.    Siobhan Wallace TheFarmBill.com    The Agricultural Act of 2014 aka the US Farm Bill is a complex, overwhelming piece of legislation with far-reaching implications throughout our food and agricultural systems, and beyond. During the 2012 and 2013 Congressional debates, few websites were focused on educating the general public about the bill's policies and programs. Even policy experts tend to skew any Farm Bill discussion to either the nutritional or subsidy aspects, dismissing the other programs as too small to be of interest. To fill this niche, I have created TheFarmBill.com, a website aggregating information from the bill itself, government reports and websites, and Beltway organizations working from both sides of the aisle. Now anyone can learn about the Farm Bill, its history and the basics of over 80 programs included in the bill in a new visual and accessible manner. The site's ultimate goal is to not only inform more citizens on the Act, but to get them involved before the 2018 version makes it to the Congressional floor. I hope to show everyone that the Farm Bill is so much more than SNAP and subsidies.    Cait Keller The Food System and Environmental Art    &ldquo;The way we eat represents our most profound engagement with the natural world,&rdquo; writes Michael Pollan. &ldquo;Daily, our eating turns nature into culture, transforming the body of the world into our bodies and minds.&rdquo; We have become so alienated from the production of our food and so distanced from the environment from which it comes that our industrialized food system is putting not only our food supply but our very own existence in jeopardy. The food system effects the environment along every stage of the food chain from production to consumption. As climate change proceeds, it is crucial to rethink and restructure the current state of our food system. But, how do we engage the public in discussion around these issues? I propose that environmental art is a way of engaging the public in and educating them about environmental issues associated with the food system. Through various mediums, processes and themes, art has the ability to shed light on environmental issues related to our food system and make such knowledge accessible to all, whether in a gallery or on a city sidewalk. By illustrating our society&rsquo;s exploitations of the environment, art can even offer solutions for redesigning and redefining the future of food.    New Perspectives on Ethnic Food 10:30-11:00AM    Ila Hess Hispanics/Latinos in food media: Where are they?    In the current food TV landscape, there is only one Hispanic/Latino show host presenting Mexican dishes, while other shows feature Latin recipes delivered by non-Hispanic/Latino hosts. This thesis project gauges viewership interest in food segments showcasing Latin cuisine and Hispanic/Latino food show hosts on mainstream, English-language television (TV) channels. Specifically, I 1) assessed whether the market would positively react to an increase in Latin food programming; and 2) explored what types of TV programs with Hispanic/Latino hosts showcasing Latin food as well as other cuisines would garner/boost viewership on mainstream TV channels. To do so, I conducted a 20-question pilot survey with 12 show pitches to 50 New York City residents in five boroughs. The findings indicate that respondents were interested in six of the 12 suggested pitches, which were further developed into six full show proposals featuring Hispanic/Latino hosts and/or Latin cuisine.    Mahira Sheikh Crescent: A Book Proposal    Crescent will be among the new generation of cookbooks that merges personal and historical storytelling with family recipes and vivid photography. This cookbook will introduce or expose my readers to Pakistani cuisine through a series of my mother&rsquo;s carefully crafted, but accessible home recipes along with a historical framework describing the various factors that led to each dish&rsquo;s creation. These factors include Pakistan&rsquo;s geography and natural landscape, its religious history, and its role in the Mughal Empire. Until now, Pakistani cuisine has been discussed mostly within Indian cookbooks or in more general South Asian cookbooks. While South Asian culinary traditions do share many of the same techniques, preparations, and ingredients, my goal is to distinguish and define Pakistani cuisine via its unique history. While the subcontinent shares a common history, there are also distinctions that make Pakistani cuisine unique. It is my hope that readers will have a newfound appreciation for culinary traditions in Pakistan, and its often overlooked global influence.. This book is dedicated to my mother who has inspired me with the stories in this book, and with her life&rsquo;s worth of recipes.    Seon mi Jin Curriculum Proposal: International Cuisine- Korean Cuisine and Culture    The curriculum aims to introduce Korean cuisine and its food culture by studying various topics in the humanities and sociology. Through readings, discussions, lectures and hands-on kitchen demonstrations, students will achieve fundamental understanding of what cuisine means and how it is intertwined with culture and history. Discovering the specificity of Korean cuisine, students can appreciate the value of cultural diversity and embrace different cultures with respect. To achieve these goals, this curriculum contains several units that are composed of both kitchen and lecture classes. Adopting Royer's cognitive theory, kitchen classes will give students prior information of the cuisine by demonstrating Korean food habits and cooking techniques. This provides a \"background experience\" to enhance the understanding of unfamiliar subjects in lectures. Not only its academic depth of lecture classes but also the cultural and experiential use of kitchen classes would make this curriculum original and add value to college-level education for professionals.    Transitions Toward Sustainable Food Industries 11:15-12:00PM    Selina Pino Ethical Consumerism and Farm Worker Wages: Do Consumers Care?    Farm workers are an important part of the agricultural system that are often overlooked, mistreated, and underpaid. Due to their exclusion from the Fair Labor and Standards Act of 1938 (FLSA), farm workers are exempt from minimum wage requirements and overtime regulations. Since the FLSA has not changed throughout the past century, farm workers have organized to fight for better wages from suppliers, corporations and grocery stores. The Coalition of Immokalee Workers (CIW) in Florida have successfully garnered one penny more per pound of tomatoes harvested, almost doubling their pay. In order to spread word of their cause and gain consumer support, the CIW and similar organizations are starting initiatives to label produce from companies that pay higher wages for farm workers. As labels are being rolled out, their effect depends on with whether consumers support this issue, and if they do, how much. This project has focused on ethical consumerism and the willingness of consumers to purchase these items. Although consumers claim support for farm workers, many are not willing to inconvenience their lives to demand produce supportive of them.    Rebecca Taylor-Roseman From Sanchez to Hispaniola: A Case Study of Upgrading the Dominican Cocoa Sector    Today, the Dominican Republic (DR) is the leading global exporter of high-quality organic cacao. Just ten years ago, the DR was a producer of mostly low-quality unfermented Sanchez cacao penalized in the international market. In contrast, the DR is now a leading exporter of premium quality cacao. Proper fermentation and drying are critical to produce quality cacao for manufacture into premium chocolate products, and the successful establishment of post-harvest processing via centralized fermentation and drying was the key to upgrading the Dominican cocoa industry. Experiments with fermentation and drying started taking place in the DR beginning in the 1980s via a series of international development projects; however, it was not until the farmer cooperative Confederaci&oacute;n Nacional de Los Cacaocultores Dominicanos (Conacado) adopted centralized post-harvest processing in 2000 that the critical threshold was reached that ultimately led to sector-wide upgrading. An analysis of the upgrading trajectory of the Dominican cocoa sector by examining the roles of Conacado, traditional Dominican exporting companies, international NGOs, and the Dominican government offers a compelling case study of how one cocoa-producing country moved up the value chain.    Brittany Fleiss A Lesson That Might Bug You, But Won't Bite You!    I have created an educational lesson on the introduction to edible insects for middle-school and high-school students. In my lesson I address why we view insects with disgust and also highlight the many beneficial reasons for consuming insects such as the environmental, nutrition, humane and taste reasons. With global population on the rise and a food system that poses many environmental and health concerns, alternative food sources must be considered. Insects are widely consumed by millions of people across the world but, remain taboo in the United States. The potential of insects as food source has received much hype in recent months in the United States and insect food based startup companies are seeking their niche. However, in order for Americans to consider insects as anything other than a nuisance and &ldquo;icky&rdquo; creatures, the disgust factor associated with these invertebrates needs to be addressed. The American population needs to be reeducated about the importance of insects in order to shed light on, and place value upon them, to help reverse the population&rsquo;s aversion to them.    Alexandre P. Wolf Analysis of Responsible Sourcing Policies in American Fast Food: A Feasibility Study    Today an increasing number of consumers are looking to make food choices that are aligned with their social values. However, as a consumer, it is a challenge to access and/or interpret meaningful information about the sustainability efforts of companies, let alone to compare information across an industry. Although there have been considerable efforts to develop a singular metric to evaluate and compare sustainable practices, none have taken hold in the American quick-service restaurant (QSR) sector. My project examines the feasibility of applying Oxfam&rsquo;s Behind the Brands Scorecard metrics (developed for the food and beverage industry) to evaluate QSR sustainability policies. My ultimate goal for this tool is two-fold: 1) to provide consumers with a clear and concise indicator to compare the sustainability of QSR companies; 2) to incentivize companies to reevaluate their sourcing practices and adopt responsible sourcing.    Understanding Food Culture Through History 12:00-12:45pm    Margherita Pilato Personal Pizza: the Role of the U.S. Home Cook in the Sudden Rise of Pizza    English muffins, mayonnaise and self-rising flour are not often included in the most favored pizza recipes. However, ingredients like these, and the creative cooks who used them, had a hand in turning an innocuous, Neapolitan snack into a staple of the American diet. Pizza&rsquo;s initial introduction to the United States can be traced back as early as 1903, but it remained relatively obscure to the general American public for decades. Suddenly, after World War II, its popularity threatened Americans&rsquo; beloved hot dog and hamburger. A number of historians attribute this major shift to changes in technology and restaurant culture, to the return of American troops, or to the general mood of postwar culture. However, the U.S. postwar home cook&rsquo;s contribution to making pizza an American food has not been well explored. This research aims to fill gaps in the literature through investigating this cultural process within the domestic realm. More broadly, this study considers how culturally conservative eating habits can also be readily permeable and open to rapid change.    Sarah Goldstein Eat Your Veggies: How New Theories of Diet Impacted Fruit and Vegetable Consumption in Eighteenth-Century England    Do expert recommendations to eat more fruits and vegetables make a difference? This paper explores the influence of dietary theory on fruit and vegetable consumption in eighteenth-century England. From nearly the start of the Common Era until the early 1700s, prevailing dietary theory had held that many fruits and vegetables were actually harmful, especially if eaten raw. Cookbooks restated this idea, echoing the philosophy that such foods could throw the body&rsquo;s humors out of balance and produce &ldquo;bad juices.&rdquo; In the eighteenth century, however, several physicians and other authorities challenged this notion, suggesting that a proper diet was more a function of moderate eating than a highly individualized program meant to maintain bodily harmony. These theorists encouraged consumption of fruits and vegetables, and some of them even promoted vegetarianism. By the middle of the eighteenth century, cookbooks began to reflect new ideas about consuming these foods, and even repeated some of the new theories verbatim. An analysis of these cookery books suggests that experts&rsquo; dietary recommendations affected how people prepared and thought about fruits and vegetables, and offers insight into the current relationship between dietary theory and practice.    Marissa Sertich Velie Mother Sauce: Women Who Changed the Culinary Profession    Mother Sauce is a book that strives to enrich the accepted history of professional cooking through the stories of women who significantly contributed to the cuisine, practices and educational systems of western professional food culture. While famous male chefs rule conversations about classic cuisine and have undoubtedly changed the way we cook and eat, the gender bias of historical studies has skewed our perceptions of reality. The male-dominated restaurant industry has always shared space with women. While the tensions in the kitchen surrounding gender might seem like a purely contemporary issue, women have been throwing elbows, fabricated chickens, and knives in the professional setting for a very long time. Chapters of the book focus on several women&rsquo;s accomplishments and contributions during multiple time-periods, including, for example, the influence of Les Meres de Lyon and Eugenie Brazier on classic haute cuisine.    Katie Robertson Memories of Gumbo: An Intergenerational Exploration of Meaning in a Traditional Southern Dish    This book proposal is the exploration of one of my treasured family recipes. By investigating the history of seafood gumbo in my family, I unearthed much more than a recipe. I discovered how the search for \"authenticity\" in a recipe distracts us from the true significance of our strong emotional and sensory attachments to a beloved dish. Through a series of interviews with great aunts, cousins, my grandmother and mother, I learned how the meaning of food traditions is communicated and enlivened through acts like recreating my great grandmother&rsquo;s gumbo as it has been passed down for generations rather than by simply following a recipe. It became evident that what my family feared most wasn&rsquo;t losing an authentic recipe, but losing my great grandmother&rsquo;s memory, the memory of her gumbo, and the lasting gift she gave to her family in teaching them how to make food into love. This book proposal is a collection and a critique of memories.

The Semester Scholar-in-Residence program allows Network faculty who are either on leave or sabbatical from their home institution to come to New York University to engage in research, develop curricula, and/or produce manuscripts for publication during the Fall or Spring semester. The program allows Scholars to explore new dimensions in their disciplines, to engage in intellectual exchange and investigate resources not available to them at their home institutions, to broaden their own pedagogical expertise, to enrich existing courses or create new ones, and to expand professional contacts. Participation in the SIR program not only enhances the faculty members knowledge and skills, but also significantly contributes to the intellectual environment of their home institutions as they share what they learn with their colleagues and students.     Research Consultants Throughout their residency at the University, Scholars confer periodically with New York University faculty who serve as Research Consultants and who are both aware of the Scholars project and knowledgeable in their field. Each Research Consultant is able to offer collegial discussion, professional and constructive criticism, and information on New York City and NYU resources. The Network identifies each Research Consultant and provides the contact information of the Consultant during the orientation meeting. The ties that develop between Research Consultants and Network Scholars often become the basis of on-going professional relationships that last well beyond the period of direct participation in the Scholar-in-Residence program.        Library Access Network Scholars have reading and borrowing privileges at the Elmer Holmes Bobst Library, one of the largest open-stack research libraries in the world. Pamphlets explaining the librarys hours of operation and various research tools are included in this welcome packet. To use the library, Scholars must present their NYU Identification Card to the attendant at the center turnstile in the front lobby. Aside from the volumes of books, periodicals and documents available at Bobst and other NYU libraries, there are electronic and printed sources in Bobst that can link you to other libraries and collections in New York City. These sources include the catalogs in book form of the Research Libraries and of the Branch Library System of the New York Public Library (NYPL), the National Union Catalog, and the Union List of Serials/New Series Titles. The Research Libraries Information Network (RLIN), a computer catalog available at Bobst Library Reference Centers or from locations outside the library by personal account, contains information from the computerized catalogs from over 100 member libraries, including the books and periodicals catalogued at the NYPL Research Libraries and by the Columbia University Libraries in the last 15 or so years. NYU has cooperative borrowing arrangements with numerous New York City and university libraries. Please consult the NYU catalog or the Elmer Holmes Bobst Library web-site for a complete listing of libraries in the City and for those that hold cooperative reading and borrowing agreements with the University.
