ReMu could not be more excited   about the amazing courses, workshops and faculty additions we have beginning during the 2013-2014 Academic Year. We look forward to the future   of our program and the continued growth of our curriculum. This year we have developed and expanding the scope of our songwriting curriculum to fit the needs of our diverse student body.                           For our core course course Writing the Hit Song , we have separated students into three handpicked sections. One section focusing on trending pop, R&amp;B, and Hip Hop, one focusing on an eclectic blend of rock, folk, and experimental music, and the third an intro class for those who have never written songs.                           We welcome back ReMu alum Eren Cannata who will be teaching the intro level section this fall. He will also continue his work with our Summer High School songwriting workshops, Future Music Moguls songwriting workshops, and will help to develop the undergraduate songwriting curriculum to appropriately meet the evolving needs of our students. We would also like to introduce our two new adjunct songwriting instructors this year, Mike Errico and Amund Bjorklund , who will teach the two remaining advanced sections of Writing the Hit Song.        Eren   Cannata is an established producer/songwriter/musician/artist, is also   the co-owner of Cove City Sound Studios, one of greater NY\u2019s premier   recording spaces.

Some of his accomplishments include working with   Timbaland and his prot\u00e9g\u00e9s Amar and Jim Beanz (both featured on   Timbaland\u2019s album \u201cShock Value\u201d), and also played guitar for Demi   Lovato's recent album \"Unbroken.\" Eren also wrote a number of charted   songs for Vicci Martinez from NBC's \"The Voice.
