The program allows you to learn highly marketable skills in the current data science revolution and to use those skills to address important social issues.    Who is this program for?    This MS program is a good choice if you like to work with numbers and solve problems and want to learn valuable data-analysis and analytical skills. Advanced statistical methods can be used to answer pivotal research questions across many science and social science disciplines as well as to inform policy and do work that is socially important and significant. The program is designed to help you develop the ability to perform and understand complex quantitative research in the social, behavioral, and health sciences. Students admitted to our program have a variety of interests that fit well with our program, including education policy, child development, poverty, labor markets, evaluation, social policy, psychology, and public health.    What will I learn?    The A3SR curriculum provides you with a firm foundation in statistical modeling tools commonly used in the social, behavioral, and health science research. You will become proficient in use of methods such as:       linear models    multilevel modeling    multivariate analysis    measurement models    generalized linear models    causal inference    approaches to missing data       If you are entering the program with more advanced mathematical or statistical training, you will have the option of pursuing more advanced coursework which will provide opportunities to develop and evaluate the properties of statistical models.    Coursework and data analysis projects help you gain confidence in your skills to undertake data-analytic projects and research grounded in proven methodology and make strong data-based decisions and assessments. You will have opportunities to apply your skills to address critical policy issues and social problems through an internship and the consulting research seminar. The curriculum will prepare you for jobs in fields such as :       Psychology    Education    Political Science    Applied Economics    Public policy    Health and healthcare    Media research       By the time you graduate you will know how to :       Manipulate simple and complex data structures    Determine appropriate analyses needed to answer critical questions    Apply a wide range of statistical methods and understand the results at a sophisticated level    Evaluate the appropriateness and efficacy of statistical procedures    Communicate the role of and results from statistical analyses to colleagues or employers    Alter or extend existing techniques or develop new methods to address complicated data analysis problems for which routine statistical procedures are insufficient (exclusively open to students who enter with additional training)       What can I do with this degree?    The curriculum prepares you for a career as an applied statistician and data scientist in the private or public sector, as well as for further academic study in a variety of academic disciplines that require quantitative analysis.    Who will I study with?    This is an exciting time to study applied statistics and data science at NYU. The MS program is an initiative of the NYU Steinhardt Center for the Promotion of Research Involving Innovative Statistical Methodology (PRIISM) and is an integrated part of the larger university-wide initiative in Data Science and Statistics , which offers several new master&rsquo;s degrees, including this MS program.    A3SR faculty have particular strengths in:       causal inference    high-dimensional data    measurement    missing data    model selection    multivariate analysis    multilevel modeling    surveys and sampling       All the faculty are deeply committed to using data analysis methods and strategies for the social good. They have worked and consulted for a range of advocacy and policy organizations. They are applying these strategies to important questions in public health, politics, psychology and psychometrics, demography, sociology, labor markets, and education . This program seeks like-minded students who are eager to apply these tools to do good in the world.    Some of the important application-area questions they are exploring include:       What is the role of media in forming public opinions?    What is the effect of gifted and talented programs on student achievement?    What is the relationship between diet and certain forms of cancer?    Do student curricular pathways matter for degree attainment and subsequent labor market outcomes?    What are effective strategies for rehabilitation of stroke patients?       On the methodological front our faculty are working in diverse areas across statistics . Examples include research to:       Assess when observational studies can act as reasonable substitutes for randomized experiments    Develop better strategies to handle missing data    Develop variable selection methods for high dimensional data    Model the dependencies in categorical sequences of events       We encourage you and all our students to work closely with our faculty on research that ranges from applied statistical analysis to the development of customized statistical models.    What other options do I have to study statistics at NYU?    There are many graduate programs in the Steinhardt School and at NYU that you may wish to further explore. We encourage you to explore these options further to find the program that best matches your personal interests and career goals.

                                     Designing and evaluating policy depends on social science theory and research. The program in Social Research and Public Policy (SRPP) offers rigorous training in both, with courses in economics, political science, sociology, and anthropology, as well as courses in quantitative and qualitative research methods, which will enable students to critically evaluate research findings and produce original research. Social Research and Public Policy is attractive to students who are concerned with the major social problems of our times such as international migration, unequal economic development, poverty, racism and sexism, inequality, ethnic conflict, as well as health inequality and population dynamics.   The program aims at inspiring students\u2019 critical theoretical imagination and will help them to make better sense of the world around themselves. SRPP majors will be regarded as excellent candidates for law school, and for graduate programs in the social sciences, in public policy, business school, public health, education, urban planning, and social work. Graduates will have a good chance to land in jobs working for NGO's, in public service, urban planning and community action.   Its breadth and its emphasis on critical thinking and hands-on empirical research, especially research linked to policy questions, distinguish the major in Social Research and Public Policy. SRPP majors will produce a piece of original research to meet the capstone requirement. Student may collect their own data, conduct simulations, or reanalyze available data to make a contribution to the research in the field of their choice. Students will work with a faculty mentor to develop and implement the research design. Students who wish to do fieldwork abroad should develop the project in the spring of junior year and obtain approval from the faculty mentor to collect data during the summer before senior year. NYUAD\u2019s Institutional Review Board must approve all projects that involve human subjects before data collection begins. Seniors will attend a bi-weekly colloquium, which is moderated by a faculty member and serves as a forum for peer review and feedback on progress with the senior thesis.

Woven across four themed sections \u2014 The Behavior &amp; Institutions, Health &amp; Demography, Migration &amp; Globalization, and The UAE \u2014 the students' research highlighted the interdisciplinary nature of the Social Science division through varied fields linked to one of these core themes.   The extensive student-faculty collaboration for these Capstone projects also saw a high engagement level with the community within and beyond NYUAD, creating an unmistakable sense of camaraderie for everyone present.
