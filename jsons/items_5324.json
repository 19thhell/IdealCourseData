Application Requirements   All applicants with a baccalaureate degree in another field must submit the Second Bachelors Degree Application . Applicants must send supplemental application materials (application fee, letters of       recommendation, and official college transcripts) to New York University's Office of Undergraduate Admissions, 665 Broadway, 11th Floor, New York, NY 10012-2339, 212-998-4500.     Second Degree Application for Admission to Undergraduate Study Note: Second Degree applicants cannot use the Common Application.   Non-returnable application fee of $70.00.   One full-length essay. College graduates should upload their essay (250 words minimum) in the 'Personal Essay' area. Please write about why you're interested in pursuing a second bachelor's degree in nursing at New York University College of Nursing.   1 - 2 professional or academic letters of recommendation are recommended, but not required. Your letter of recommendation should comment on your maturity, intellectual potentional, and motivation to pursue a career in nursing. Special letter of recommendation forms are not required.   Official college transcript(s) in a sealed envelope from each college or university attended.   Standardized test scores are NOT required for admission into the 15-Month Accelerated BS Program and will not be used as a factor when determining your admission decision.   If English is not your first language, please send your TOEFL or IELTS scores. You can read more about the standardized testing policy for international students here .     Applications will not be considered for admission until all required documents (including letters of recommendation and official college transcripts) are submitted to the Office of Undergraduate Admissions,       665 Broadway, 11th Floor, New York, NY 10012-2339. Please do not send application materials to the College of Nursing Office of Student Affairs and Admissions.   Do you have a baccalaureate degree in another field, but have not completed all prerequisite requirements for admission into the 15 Month Accelerated BS Program?   Students with a baccalaureate degree in another field who have not completed prerequisite courses in nutrition, chemistry with lab, statistics, anatomy and physiology, microbiology, and developmental psychology can also enter the College of Nursing's BS Program with advanced standing credit. College graduates are admitted with 44 liberal arts credits, but must complete all of the prerequisite courses before starting the 15 month curriculum. The average length of full-time study for students that have not completed the prerequisite courses prior to matriculation is two years or 5 terms (full time).   Please note that students with a baccalaureate degree in another field who have not met all prerequisite requirements (and do not plan to meet all prerequisite requirements before matriculating) should not apply for admission directly into the 15 Month Accelerated BS Program. They should still apply as a second degree student, but should select the non-accelerated option as they will need a term or two to complete prerequisite requirements before beginning the 15 month curriculum. These applicants can follow the application instructions above, but should select non-accelerated as their program.
