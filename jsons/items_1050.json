Core course required for all MA candidates; offered Fall semesters.    This course introduces graduate students to the inter- and trans-disciplinary nature of contemporary Irish Studies practice, focusing on issues of historiographic and representational controversy in the interpretation of Irish history and culture. Ireland House faculty and guest lecturers explore current sites of contest and research, including the application in the Irish case of theoretical and critical issues in Humanities and Social Science scholarship. Topics studied on the course include imperialism, colonialism and post-colonialism, modernization, globalization, tourism studies, gender studies, and the cultural construction of memory and identity in Ireland and in Irish communities worldwide.       The Irish Studies Seminar II - An Teanga Bheo: Irish (Gaelic) Language Linguistic Acquisition &amp; Historical/Cultural Context    IRISH-GA 1002. 4 points. Core course required for all MA candidates; offered Spring semesters.    This course is intended to give graduate students for the MA degree in Irish Studies with no prior experience of the language a basic conversational proficiency. It will examine in detail the major historical and cultural subjects surrounding the language, with emphasis on the historical reasons for decline of the language in the modern period since 1500, the nineteenth century and twentieth century attempts at revival, and the contemporary position of the language within Ireland and abroad. This exploration of the language and its historical and cultural context is designed to complement related graduate courses in Irish Studies, specifically those which explore modern literature, modern history and contemporary politics.       Modern Gaelic Literature in English Translation    IRISH-GA 1080. 4 points.    A survey of the impact of translations of Irish language writing on the development of modern Irish literature in English. The course considers selected writers of the first Celtic revival at the end of the 19th century, but concentrates on the language revival movement of the late 19th century, the production of scholarly and popular works in translation (from the scholarly editions of the Early Irish Texts Society to the popular re-tellings of Irish myths by Lady Gregory and WB Yeats), and contemporary translations and adaptations of Irish language writing.  Literature of Modern Ireland I    IRISH-GA 1083. 4 points.    This course conducts a comprehensive survey of the traditions of writing in Ireland from the plantations of the late sixteenth century to the famine of 1846-50. By tracing the shadow of Irish language literary traditions in and alongside the emerging Irish literary traditions in English, we will consider the interplay of literature and national identity, and the role of literature and other forms of print culture in a variety of social processes, including politicization, the language shift, and textual representations of violence, domestic life, cultural memory, national and international economy, and forms of agency. Major authors including Jonathan Swift, Bishop Berkeley, Edmund Burke, Maria Edgeworth, Sydney Owenson, Thomas Moore, Samuel Ferguson, and James Clarence Mangan are considered, as well as the development of Irish forms of poetry, drama, and prose in English. It is the aim of the course to give students a detailed grasp of Irish literary history before the cataclysmic social changes wrought by the Irish famine, and to introduce students to the concepts and terminology employed in contemporary Irish literary scholarship.       Literature of Modern Ireland II    IRISH-GA 1084. 4 points.    This course surveys Irish writing from the late nineteenth through the late twentieth centuries\u2014a period of both dramatic political and cultural change, and unparalleled literary production and innovation. The semester will be punctuated by (1) major cultural/political developments and controversies: the founding of the Abbey Theatre; the decline of the Anglo-Irish Ascendancy; the 1916 Rising; the Troubles in the North (2) dominant literary figures: Yeats, Joyce, Beckett (3) ubiquitous themes: the idea of blood sacrifice as a liberation narrative; the fraught place of the Irish language; the persistent mythic, cultural, and literary trope of woman-as-nation\u2014an image bound up with Ireland\u2019s colonial history. In additions to plays, novels, poems, short stories, and essays, we will read manifestos, pamphlets, reviews, debates in newspapers, and contemporary critical interventions, and we will think about texts in the context of the nation's turbulent history of colonial trauma, the complex path to independence, and the challenges of globalization. Course readings will also include essays that investigate such issues as nationalism, gender, myth, sexuality, religion, and postcolonialism.    Topics in Irish Literature    IRISH-GA 1085. 4 points.    The emphasis of this course varies by semester and is designed to allow flexibility in course offerings from visiting scholars and specialists in particular fields. Past examinations have included contemporary Irish fiction and poetry, Irish women writers, and Northern Irish poetry.    Irish Poetry After Yeats    IRISH-GA 1087. 4 points.    This course will read in depth the most challenging poetry written by Irish poets since the ascendancy of W.B. Yeats. We will seek to address the most pressing questions facing poetry criticism in the Irish Studies field: the struggle with Yeats\u2019s commanding example; the relation of poetry to national partition and the civil crisis in Northern Ireland; the confining and liberating aspects of tradition; the use of translation as a means of finding voice; the agency of poetry in forcing change within a conservative cultural climate; the challenge of postmodernism to national literatures, and the arrival of prosperity in Ireland and the consequent need to revise our conceptions of Irish culture. The poets we will read include Austin Clarke, Louis MacNeice, Denis Devlin, John Hewitt, Patrick Kavanagh, Thomas Kinsella, John Montague, Seamus Heaney, Michael Longley, Eavan Boland, Derek Mahon, Eilean Ni Chuilleanain, Paul Muldoon, Nuala Ni Dhomhnaill, Ciaran Carson, Vona Groarke and Medbh McGuckian.       Music and Cultural Identity in Ireland    IRISH-GA 1315. 4 points.    This course conducts a rigorous survey of the history of music in Ireland and examines critically the role of various musical cultures in the production of national and other forms of identity in Ireland. The course offers student the opportunity to develop a critical vocabulary for discussing music as an agent of social change and social continuity, addressing key concepts in musicological analysis as these are present in the Irish context, including musical modes, regional and national styles, music as an ideological force and its role in politicization, and the absorption and elaboration of musical technologies in their specific social settings.       Irish Music in America 1750 to the Present    IRISH-GA 1319. 4 points.    This course surveys the musical culture of Irish emigrants to North America from 1750 to the present. It seeks to set musical styles in Ireland and America in an informed historical dialogue, thereby opening up explanatory paradigms for Irish diasporic experience and for the role of Irish musics in North American social, cultural, and political life. Students will gain a detailed groundwork for subsequent historical research in folk and popular culture. The course will also be of use to students of comparative music history, the history and theory of popular culture, and the study of memory and folklore.       History of Modern Ireland I: The Making of Modern Ireland, Ireland to c.1800    IRISH-GA 1416. 4 points. Early-modern Irish history is an epic tale of conflict, subjugation, and the struggle for national identity. In the roughly two and a half centuries covered by this course, Ireland was transformed from a mysterious and remote island on the periphery of Europe to a quasi-autonomous state fully caught up in the sweeping economic, political, and social transformations that defined the late eighteenth century. Among the topics covered in History I are the Tudor conquest and colonization; Gaelic pushback; Ireland under the Stuarts; the Williamite War and formation of the Protestant Ascendancy; the emergence of Irish nationalism; Ireland and the Enlightenment; 18th-century political, economic, and societal transformations; and Ireland in the Age of Revolutions. The struggles and frustrations of this period define the agenda for Ireland\u2019s tumultuous passage through the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.    History of Modern Ireland II: Irish History since 1800    IRISH-GA 1417. 4 points.    This two-part survey course seeks to analyze modern Irish history before and after the Act of Union of 1800. The first semester seeks to understand the conditions of possibility for the Union itself: conquest and colonization, resistance and rebellion; the formation of the Protestant Ascendancy and the imperial context of the British state; the discursive development of Irish nationalism; the demographic and societal shifts occasioned by economic development, agricultural change, and emigration; and the Irish contexts of the Enlightenment and the Atlantic revolutions. The second semester examines the impact of the Union and the stages of its dissolution on Irish life, considering the role of Ireland in the British empire; the nature of civil society in Ireland, and the cultural and political dimensions of nationalism and unionism before and after independence; the role of the Irish diaspora on developments in Ireland; and the particular nature of the Irish experience of urbanization, modernization, and globalization.       Debates in Modern Irish History    IRISH-GA 1421. 4 points.    This course seeks to analyze a selection of the intense debates in Ireland itself and abroad, especially in Britain and the USA, that characterize modern Irish history, concentrating on topics that transcend the specific Irish experience to raise issues of wider human import. It is equally a study of events and of their interpretation from various contested perspectives, and thus requires intense engagement with the historiography, and with the study of history as a mode of thought. The topics to be explored include the issues of Conquest, Collaboration, Assimilation and Resistance, viewed through the prism of Ireland and the British Empire, as reflected in a number of major topics, including: The Act of Union; The Great Irish Famine; Irish Diaspora; Issues of Irish Identity (as seen through Irish and British eyes via historical movements and events); the ethno-religious conflict in Northern Ireland since 1968; Ireland and Globalization.       Ireland in the Atlantic World, 1600-1800    IRISH-GA 1425. 4 points.    The field of early-modern Atlantic Studies is among the most creative lines of inquiry in present-day historical scholarship. And Ireland was a conspicuous presence in the Atlantic World of the 17th and 18th centuries. Irish men and women figured in nearly every aspect of the cultural, economic, political, and religious interplay that shaped this complex transnational society. In a wide-ranging and multi-disciplined approach to the subject, this seminar will explore the significance of Irish involvements in the larger Atlantic World (maritime Europe, West Africa, and the Americas), as well as ways in which Ireland responded to\u2014and was shaped by\u2014such encounters. Students in Ireland in the Atlantic World will have access to archival materials (printed documents and manuscripts) that situate Ireland and Irish people in the mainstream of this dynamic environment.    History and Historiography of the Irish in America IRISH-GA 1427. 4 points. The Irish are one of the most significant ethnic groups to ever migrate from Europe to the United States. Their impact has been disproportional to their numbers but this only partially explains our contemporary understanding of \u201cIrish America.\u201d This seminar will explore how the history of Irish immigrants and their descendants in the United States has been written over the past century and a half. Students will evaluate books and documentary films that have been influential in constructing the narrative of the Irish in America, in addition to article literature. The goal is to learn how to separate historical content from historiography and to see how both can influence popular perceptions of an ethnic people.    The Great Famine and the Irish Diaspora    IRISH-GA 1431. 4 points.    This course explores the causes and consequences of the Great Irish Famine of .1845-51 in which about one million people are estimated to have died, and from whose consequences another two million people fled the country between 1845 and 1855. It then analyses the impact of this Diaspora, and of the continuing emigration after 1855, on the receiving countries, particularly the USA, as well as on Ireland itself. This course adopts a consciously and systematically comparative approach towards the history of the Famine and of the Diaspora. A critique of the strengths and weaknesses of comparative methodology in historical studies forms an integral part of the course.  Culture, Empire, and Power: The Irish and Indian Cases in the British Empire IRISH-GA 1435. 4 points. Examines the relative roles of culture and power in imperialism with particular reference to the Irish and Indian cases in the British Empire.       Topics in Irish and Irish-American Studies    IRISH-GA 1441. 4 points.

Fall 2015: Aurality and the Irish Imagination. Instructor: Ivan Goff This course will examine aurality \u2013 the phenomenal and discursive figurations of sound \u2013 in the Irish imagination of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. The functions and implications of sound and listeningin literature, film, radio, sound art, and various musical and audio-visual modalities will be considered along with the role of sound technologies in emergent listening practices and compositional paradigms.        Sociology of Change in Ireland    IRISH-GA 1467. 4 points.    The aim of this course is to introduce students on the Irish and Irish American Studies MA to the basic concepts used in sociology to understand and analyze contemporary Irish society. It examines social change and continuity in modern Ireland. The course concentrates on how industrialization and economic development impacted on Irish society in general. By the end of the course, students will acquire a basic understanding of sociological theories of modernization, dependency and class structure, and will be able to apply these theories to the contemporary Irish situation. Students will be expected to attend all lectures and to participate in the weekly discussion section.       Britain and Ireland since 1750    IRISH-GA 2427. 4 points.    Introduces the interpretive and primary literature in modern English history, with emphasis on recent scholarship and methodology in English social and cultural history.

Core course required for all MA candidates; offered Fall semesters.    This course introduces graduate students to the inter- and trans-disciplinary nature of contemporary Irish Studies practice, focusing on issues of historiographic and representational controversy in the interpretation of Irish history and culture. Ireland House faculty and guest lecturers explore current sites of contest and research, including the application in the Irish case of theoretical and critical issues in Humanities and Social Science scholarship. Topics studied on the course include imperialism, colonialism and post-colonialism, modernization, globalization, tourism studies, gender studies, and the cultural construction of memory and identity in Ireland and in Irish communities worldwide.       The Irish Studies Seminar II - An Teanga Bheo: Irish (Gaelic) Language Linguistic Acquisition &amp; Historical/Cultural Context    IRISH-GA 1002. 4 points. Core course required for all MA candidates; offered Spring semesters.    This course is intended to give graduate students for the MA degree in Irish Studies with no prior experience of the language a basic conversational proficiency. It will examine in detail the major historical and cultural subjects surrounding the language, with emphasis on the historical reasons for decline of the language in the modern period since 1500, the nineteenth century and twentieth century attempts at revival, and the contemporary position of the language within Ireland and abroad. This exploration of the language and its historical and cultural context is designed to complement related graduate courses in Irish Studies, specifically those which explore modern literature, modern history and contemporary politics.       Modern Gaelic Literature in English Translation    IRISH-GA 1080. 4 points.    A survey of the impact of translations of Irish language writing on the development of modern Irish literature in English. The course considers selected writers of the first Celtic revival at the end of the 19th century, but concentrates on the language revival movement of the late 19th century, the production of scholarly and popular works in translation (from the scholarly editions of the Early Irish Texts Society to the popular re-tellings of Irish myths by Lady Gregory and WB Yeats), and contemporary translations and adaptations of Irish language writing.  Literature of Modern Ireland I    IRISH-GA 1083. 4 points.    This course conducts a comprehensive survey of the traditions of writing in Ireland from the plantations of the late sixteenth century to the famine of 1846-50. By tracing the shadow of Irish language literary traditions in and alongside the emerging Irish literary traditions in English, we will consider the interplay of literature and national identity, and the role of literature and other forms of print culture in a variety of social processes, including politicization, the language shift, and textual representations of violence, domestic life, cultural memory, national and international economy, and forms of agency. Major authors including Jonathan Swift, Bishop Berkeley, Edmund Burke, Maria Edgeworth, Sydney Owenson, Thomas Moore, Samuel Ferguson, and James Clarence Mangan are considered, as well as the development of Irish forms of poetry, drama, and prose in English. It is the aim of the course to give students a detailed grasp of Irish literary history before the cataclysmic social changes wrought by the Irish famine, and to introduce students to the concepts and terminology employed in contemporary Irish literary scholarship.       Literature of Modern Ireland II    IRISH-GA 1084. 4 points.    This course surveys Irish writing from the late nineteenth through the late twentieth centuries\u2014a period of both dramatic political and cultural change, and unparalleled literary production and innovation. The semester will be punctuated by (1) major cultural/political developments and controversies: the founding of the Abbey Theatre; the decline of the Anglo-Irish Ascendancy; the 1916 Rising; the Troubles in the North (2) dominant literary figures: Yeats, Joyce, Beckett (3) ubiquitous themes: the idea of blood sacrifice as a liberation narrative; the fraught place of the Irish language; the persistent mythic, cultural, and literary trope of woman-as-nation\u2014an image bound up with Ireland\u2019s colonial history. In additions to plays, novels, poems, short stories, and essays, we will read manifestos, pamphlets, reviews, debates in newspapers, and contemporary critical interventions, and we will think about texts in the context of the nation's turbulent history of colonial trauma, the complex path to independence, and the challenges of globalization. Course readings will also include essays that investigate such issues as nationalism, gender, myth, sexuality, religion, and postcolonialism.    Topics in Irish Literature    IRISH-GA 1085. 4 points.    The emphasis of this course varies by semester and is designed to allow flexibility in course offerings from visiting scholars and specialists in particular fields. Past examinations have included contemporary Irish fiction and poetry, Irish women writers, and Northern Irish poetry.    Irish Poetry After Yeats    IRISH-GA 1087. 4 points.    This course will read in depth the most challenging poetry written by Irish poets since the ascendancy of W.B. Yeats. We will seek to address the most pressing questions facing poetry criticism in the Irish Studies field: the struggle with Yeats\u2019s commanding example; the relation of poetry to national partition and the civil crisis in Northern Ireland; the confining and liberating aspects of tradition; the use of translation as a means of finding voice; the agency of poetry in forcing change within a conservative cultural climate; the challenge of postmodernism to national literatures, and the arrival of prosperity in Ireland and the consequent need to revise our conceptions of Irish culture. The poets we will read include Austin Clarke, Louis MacNeice, Denis Devlin, John Hewitt, Patrick Kavanagh, Thomas Kinsella, John Montague, Seamus Heaney, Michael Longley, Eavan Boland, Derek Mahon, Eilean Ni Chuilleanain, Paul Muldoon, Nuala Ni Dhomhnaill, Ciaran Carson, Vona Groarke and Medbh McGuckian.       Music and Cultural Identity in Ireland    IRISH-GA 1315. 4 points.    This course conducts a rigorous survey of the history of music in Ireland and examines critically the role of various musical cultures in the production of national and other forms of identity in Ireland. The course offers student the opportunity to develop a critical vocabulary for discussing music as an agent of social change and social continuity, addressing key concepts in musicological analysis as these are present in the Irish context, including musical modes, regional and national styles, music as an ideological force and its role in politicization, and the absorption and elaboration of musical technologies in their specific social settings.       Irish Music in America 1750 to the Present    IRISH-GA 1319. 4 points.    This course surveys the musical culture of Irish emigrants to North America from 1750 to the present. It seeks to set musical styles in Ireland and America in an informed historical dialogue, thereby opening up explanatory paradigms for Irish diasporic experience and for the role of Irish musics in North American social, cultural, and political life. Students will gain a detailed groundwork for subsequent historical research in folk and popular culture. The course will also be of use to students of comparative music history, the history and theory of popular culture, and the study of memory and folklore.       History of Modern Ireland I: The Making of Modern Ireland, Ireland to c.1800    IRISH-GA 1416. 4 points. Early-modern Irish history is an epic tale of conflict, subjugation, and the struggle for national identity. In the roughly two and a half centuries covered by this course, Ireland was transformed from a mysterious and remote island on the periphery of Europe to a quasi-autonomous state fully caught up in the sweeping economic, political, and social transformations that defined the late eighteenth century. Among the topics covered in History I are the Tudor conquest and colonization; Gaelic pushback; Ireland under the Stuarts; the Williamite War and formation of the Protestant Ascendancy; the emergence of Irish nationalism; Ireland and the Enlightenment; 18th-century political, economic, and societal transformations; and Ireland in the Age of Revolutions. The struggles and frustrations of this period define the agenda for Ireland\u2019s tumultuous passage through the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.    History of Modern Ireland II: Irish History since 1800    IRISH-GA 1417. 4 points.    This two-part survey course seeks to analyze modern Irish history before and after the Act of Union of 1800. The first semester seeks to understand the conditions of possibility for the Union itself: conquest and colonization, resistance and rebellion; the formation of the Protestant Ascendancy and the imperial context of the British state; the discursive development of Irish nationalism; the demographic and societal shifts occasioned by economic development, agricultural change, and emigration; and the Irish contexts of the Enlightenment and the Atlantic revolutions. The second semester examines the impact of the Union and the stages of its dissolution on Irish life, considering the role of Ireland in the British empire; the nature of civil society in Ireland, and the cultural and political dimensions of nationalism and unionism before and after independence; the role of the Irish diaspora on developments in Ireland; and the particular nature of the Irish experience of urbanization, modernization, and globalization.       Debates in Modern Irish History    IRISH-GA 1421. 4 points.    This course seeks to analyze a selection of the intense debates in Ireland itself and abroad, especially in Britain and the USA, that characterize modern Irish history, concentrating on topics that transcend the specific Irish experience to raise issues of wider human import. It is equally a study of events and of their interpretation from various contested perspectives, and thus requires intense engagement with the historiography, and with the study of history as a mode of thought. The topics to be explored include the issues of Conquest, Collaboration, Assimilation and Resistance, viewed through the prism of Ireland and the British Empire, as reflected in a number of major topics, including: The Act of Union; The Great Irish Famine; Irish Diaspora; Issues of Irish Identity (as seen through Irish and British eyes via historical movements and events); the ethno-religious conflict in Northern Ireland since 1968; Ireland and Globalization.       Ireland in the Atlantic World, 1600-1800    IRISH-GA 1425. 4 points.    The field of early-modern Atlantic Studies is among the most creative lines of inquiry in present-day historical scholarship. And Ireland was a conspicuous presence in the Atlantic World of the 17th and 18th centuries. Irish men and women figured in nearly every aspect of the cultural, economic, political, and religious interplay that shaped this complex transnational society. In a wide-ranging and multi-disciplined approach to the subject, this seminar will explore the significance of Irish involvements in the larger Atlantic World (maritime Europe, West Africa, and the Americas), as well as ways in which Ireland responded to\u2014and was shaped by\u2014such encounters. Students in Ireland in the Atlantic World will have access to archival materials (printed documents and manuscripts) that situate Ireland and Irish people in the mainstream of this dynamic environment.    History and Historiography of the Irish in America IRISH-GA 1427. 4 points. The Irish are one of the most significant ethnic groups to ever migrate from Europe to the United States. Their impact has been disproportional to their numbers but this only partially explains our contemporary understanding of \u201cIrish America.\u201d This seminar will explore how the history of Irish immigrants and their descendants in the United States has been written over the past century and a half. Students will evaluate books and documentary films that have been influential in constructing the narrative of the Irish in America, in addition to article literature. The goal is to learn how to separate historical content from historiography and to see how both can influence popular perceptions of an ethnic people.    The Great Famine and the Irish Diaspora    IRISH-GA 1431. 4 points.    This course explores the causes and consequences of the Great Irish Famine of .1845-51 in which about one million people are estimated to have died, and from whose consequences another two million people fled the country between 1845 and 1855. It then analyses the impact of this Diaspora, and of the continuing emigration after 1855, on the receiving countries, particularly the USA, as well as on Ireland itself. This course adopts a consciously and systematically comparative approach towards the history of the Famine and of the Diaspora. A critique of the strengths and weaknesses of comparative methodology in historical studies forms an integral part of the course.  Culture, Empire, and Power: The Irish and Indian Cases in the British Empire IRISH-GA 1435. 4 points. Examines the relative roles of culture and power in imperialism with particular reference to the Irish and Indian cases in the British Empire.       Topics in Irish and Irish-American Studies    IRISH-GA 1441. 4 points.    The emphasis of this course varies by semester and is designed to allow flexibility in course offerings by Ireland House faculty and by visiting scholars.    Fall 2015: Aurality and the Irish Imagination. Instructor: Ivan Goff This course will examine aurality \u2013 the phenomenal and discursive figurations of sound \u2013 in the Irish imagination of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. The functions and implications of sound and listeningin literature, film, radio, sound art, and various musical and audio-visual modalities will be considered along with the role of sound technologies in emergent listening practices and compositional paradigms.        Sociology of Change in Ireland    IRISH-GA 1467. 4 points.    The aim of this course is to introduce students on the Irish and Irish American Studies MA to the basic concepts used in sociology to understand and analyze contemporary Irish society. It examines social change and continuity in modern Ireland. The course concentrates on how industrialization and economic development impacted on Irish society in general. By the end of the course, students will acquire a basic understanding of sociological theories of modernization, dependency and class structure, and will be able to apply these theories to the contemporary Irish situation. Students will be expected to attend all lectures and to participate in the weekly discussion section.       Britain and Ireland since 1750    IRISH-GA 2427. 4 points.    Introduces the interpretive and primary literature in modern English history, with emphasis on recent scholarship and methodology in English social and cultural history. Readings and discussions of social class structure, the Victorian city and village, labor unions, public education and literacy, criminality, prostitution, and health.       Guided Research    IRISH-GA 1099. 4 points.    The option of pursuing a 4-point Guided Research course is provided to allow students on the MA in Irish and Irish American Studies to prepare their MA thesis in close supervision with their faculty supervisor.
