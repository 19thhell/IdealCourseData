Engineering Connection:   The modern highway and car are independent but interacting entities. Engineers are working to develop technologies for better communication between cars and highways. In a smart highway, embedded technology helps highways to become more sustainable and more interactive. Examples of such technologies include porous pavement, signs that communicate with cars, road trains, glow in the dark road markings, temperature responsive paint, interactive lights, wind lights, and induction priority lanes. This lesson will also discuss the technologies and concepts of a smart vehicle.     Pre-Requisite Knowledge:   Students should be familiar with the elements that make up a highway and the various technologies available in today\u2019s vehicles.     Learning Objectives:   After this lesson, students will be able to:     Understand the engineering and manufacturing processes involved in the building and distribution of vehicles   Identify the technologies in a Smart Car   Identify the technologies in a Smart Highway   Explain the relationship between the Smart Car and Smart Highway       Introduction/Motivation:   Engineering a Car   When designing a car, engineers have a huge number of factors to consider:     Aerodynamics. At 70 mph, 90% of the energy in gas is used to overcome wind resistance.   \u00a0Fuel Economy/Efficiency. How many miles can I drive per gallon of gas?   Safety. Will I survive an accident?   Convenience. Is the car easy to operate? Does it have push-to-start? Does it have remote unlock?   Interactivity. How does the car interact with the user? How does it interact with the environment? How does it interact with other cars?       Cars of the Future   Spend more time talking with students about the current technologies in their family\u2019s car or in today\u2019s car and categorize them into technologies that 1) interact with the driver, 2) interact with other cars, 3) interact with the transportation infrastructure.     To make a car smart and allow it to interact with the environment, other cars and the driver, it must be designed with intelligent vehicle technologies. Some examples of intelligent vehicle technologies are autonomous driverless technology, internal and external sensors, and vehicle-to-vehicle Bluetooth communication. Interior and exterior sensors could detect a distracted driver or external dangers. If a driver\u2019s eyes wander off of the road, the car could issue a warning. If road debris comes hurling towards the car, the car might be able to take control of the wheel momentarily and steer the car away from the debris\u2019 trajectory.     Vehicle to vehicle communication and driverless technologies would allow formation of road trains. Vehicles heading to the same direction can drive closer to each other in a train formation on the highway. This decreases congestion and increases the vehicle\u2019s fuel efficiency due to decreased wind resistance as compared to vehicles moving individually. Road trains require vehicles to have a driverless function because driving in such a close proximity requires automated accuracy.     Manufacturing Process   The first step in making a car is for the stylists to come up with a design that corresponds to the taste of the public. The design is first drawn on paper, and then rendered into 3-D computer graphics. Simulator programs gauge the proposed aerodynamics and the performance of the vehicle in crash tests. If the designs are approved, the tools to create the components are manufactured. To minimize the cost, automobile manufacturers tend to use components from an existing brand.   The assembly starts from the bottom of the car, with the chassis rolled into the assembly line first. The drive shaft, suspension, steering box, gas tank, wheel drums and brake assembly are installed and the heavy work is performed with articulating robotic equipment in a sequential manner. The worker will place the radiator on the frame while another one secures it. The robotic equipment and workers use pneumatic tools to bolt every component in place. The worker and robot will be assigned to specific stations for their tasks. The body of the car comes in unpainted pieces that are welded by a robot to complete the unit. Finally, fenders, doors, trunk lid, hood and bumpers are added. The body is dipped into a solution to clear contaminants before being painted by robots.   At this point the final inspection is carried out. Inspectors pay attention to the interior where the seats, door panels, dash panels, wiring harness and interior lights are installed, as well as the glass, radio, speakers and headliners. The last parts to be installed are the steering column and windshield, and then the chassis and body are mated before adding the tires, anti-freeze, battery and final trim.     Highway Engineering   Highway and pavement engineering are two sub-disciplines of civil engineering vital to the mobility and transportation of people and goods in a smart city. A highway consists of various elements such as pavement, pavement markings, directional signs, interchanges (exits/entrances), road lights, crash cushions, and jersey barriers. These elements are essential to the design and function of a highway.     Pavement Engineering is a branch of civil engineering concerned with the design of road pavements. Pavement engineers determine 1) the materials used, 2) the amount of materials used, and 3) the methods in which they are produced and applied to construct the road. Pavement design is determined by the expected number of vehicles to use the road in the future. Highways are designed not to meet current needs of the community, but on the future demand. The climate the highway is located in and the proximity to residential neighborhoods are other factors that must be taken into account.     There are three main layers in a highway\u2019s pavement. The surface course is usually made of asphalt or concrete. This layer is also known as the wearing course, where most of the wear and maintenance of the surface takes place. The base course is the load-transferring layer, usually made of well-graded gravel (different sizes of rocks). The subbase course is the bottom layer of compacted soil. This soil can be native soil or borrowed soil (soil from somewhere else). When the native soil is soft or clayey, a layer of concrete is usually applied between the subbase and the base course.        Photo source: http://www.pavementinteractive.org/article/hma-pavement/       When deciding which material to use for the surface course, engineers have a choice between concrete or asphalt, the two most common pavement materials. Concrete is strong in compression and weak in tension, meaning that it has a low tendency to deform under the pressure of a heavy load, but tends to break when bent. Because of its low tensile strength, concrete often must be used with reinforcing steel bars (rebars) to prevent premature failure of the concrete. Concrete is preferred over sections of highways that are elevated. Concrete is more durable than asphalt, and is a more rigid material. Cars consume 20% less fuel on concrete roads, because less energy is lost to deforming the pavement due to its rigidity. Concrete is made from limestone, which is plentiful, while asphalt is made from petroleum. Finally, concrete is more resistant to oil leaks and extreme heat.     Asphalt has advantages over concrete, as well. If concrete breaks, the entire slab needs to be replaced, while on an asphalt road small sections can be replaced at a time. Asphalt is safer for drivers, providing better traction and skid resistance. It is recyclable: asphalt can be melted and reused, which is important if owners need to comply with sustainability requirements. Asphalt roads are quicker and cheaper to build than concrete roads, but must be replaced more frequently.

Other Technologies for Smart Highways     A smart car and a smart highway enhance safety, navigation support and communication with technology that interacts with the driver, other cars and the infrastructure. A smart highway shares the same goals as today\u2019s highways, but puts an increased emphasis in interaction between the car and the highway. Major components of a highway are pavement markings, crash cushions, highway signs and road lights, all designed to facilitate the flow and safety of traffic. These components are being re-engineered to develop smarter highways.     LED Signs in a smart highway could take advantage of real-time traffic data: Instead of making one lane \u201cExit Only\u201d for the entire life of the highway, it could change the lane markings to help relieve congestion. For example: If there is a lot of congestion going into Las Cruces, it could take one of the \u201cthru Traffic\u201d lanes and make it \u201cexit only for Las Cruces\u201d     Smart road lights called Turbine Lights take the wind from passing cars and from the environment to power the lights.

Road Train   Smart Cars that utilizes wireless communication to organize itself behind other cars going to the same destination; this reduces the drag force that causes a car to consume more fuel.             Safety Issues   None     Procedure:   Students will work in groups to calculate the costs of using concrete or asphalt to build and maintain a highway, and discuss which they would choose if they were pavement engineers.     Tell the students that they are pavement engineers and you (the teacher) are a representative from the Department of Transportation. You want to hire the engineers to determine whether you should use concrete or asphalt in a new section of highway you want to build. Give students the following information to perform their calculations:     The Department of Transportation wants to build a 100 mile 3 lane highway that lasts 60 years. Should we use asphalt or concrete? Which one costs less? Prove it to me!     *Assume I will set aside all the money to pay for it today; we are not considering the time value of money (inflation, interest paid etc.)   *Assume it takes one year to build the highway and while the highway is being built there are no repair costs paid.     Concrete costs     $500,000 per lane per mile   $2000 to repair per lane per mile per year   Needs to be replaced every 30 years     Asphalt costs:     $295000 per lane per mile   $4000 to repair per lane per mile per year   Needs to be replaced every 20 years       Encourage students to write their equations with as much detail as possible, and to be sure that units are used appropriately.     Source:   Ulerio, Jose.\u00a0 \u201cEconomic Analysis.\u201d PowerPoint presentation. NYU Poly CE3343,\u2028Brooklyn, NY. March 17, 2013.     Solution:   Cost of Concrete:   = Cost to construct highway + cost to repair highway + cost to replace highway   = [\u00a0* 3 lanes * 100 miles] + [*3 lanes*100 miles*58 years] + [\u00a0* 3 lanes * 100 miles]   = $334,800,000     Explanation:     Since concrete lasts 30 years and I want a 60 year highway I need to replace it once within the 60 year period, this explains why I added the third term.   Repair costs are only multiplied by 58 years because it takes one year to build the highway and while its being built, it is not being repaired, therefore it is 58 as opposed to 60.       Cost of Asphalt:   = Cost to construct highway + cost to repair highway + cost to replace highway   = [\u00a0* 3 lanes * 100 miles] + [*3 lanes*100 miles*58 years] + [2*\u00a0* 3 lanes * 100 miles]   = $333,900,000     Asphalt is cheaper, but the costs are very close. Ask students what other factors they might need to take into account when making a final decision.     For example, the DOT might consider whether asphalt or concrete is easier to get and deliver to the construction site. Availability of the material, Time it takes to complete the job, maintenance requirements, governmental regulations etc.     Investigating Questions       What technologies are found in your family\u2019s car today? Do these technologies interact with the driver, other cars, or the transportation infrastructure?   What are some factors that engineers need to take into consideration when choosing materials to build a road?   What do you think that cars and highways of the future should look like? What kinds of engineers do you think will be involved in building them?

Smart Grids                            1 Reply                                The 3rd week of SoSC was all about transportation. It was very interesting because I really like cars and talking about them. But we really didn&#8217;t talk about cars we talked about how to make a new generation of cars and trucks,highways, and even the subway. We came up with some new ideas like elevated highways, and underground MagLevs. We learned how to program using an ARDUINO and make a robot that uses SONAR , follows a line on a paper. It was a very fun week and I&#8217;m looking forward to the 4th and last week &#8220;Wireless Communication&#8221;.

Traffic Engineering: An Idea                            Leave a reply                             Today in class we had a lecture on traffic engineering. During our activity we brainstormed ideas for traffic engineering in a smart city. One of my ideas was W.T.T.I. (Wireless Telecommunication Transportation Infrastructure.) In simple terms all devices of traffic infrastructure will have a built in microchip, upon construction. Therefore, transportation infrastructure can interact in a way to make local travel in a more safe and efficient manner. For example; on a two way street, the first side is congested, (with a light flashed red),and the other side of the street has no cars coming. The side of the street with no cars coming has the lights flashed &#8220;green.&#8221; The &#8220;intelligent&#8221; street lights will pick up on the fact there are no cars coming, (and none to come anytime soon.) It will send a message to the red light where the L.O.S (Level of Service) is terrible. That light, recognizing the problem at end, will turn green expediting local travel, and letting people get from point A to point B in the safest way possible making many people satisfied and happy. This idea can revolutionize our urban infrastructure making local travel in New York City a whole lot better.

Engineering Connection:   The modern highway and car are independent but interacting entities. Engineers are working to develop technologies for better communication between cars and highways. In a smart highway, embedded technology helps highways to become more sustainable and more interactive. Examples of such technologies include porous pavement, signs that communicate with cars, road trains, glow in the dark road markings, temperature responsive paint, interactive lights, wind lights, and induction priority lanes. This lesson will also discuss the technologies and concepts of a smart vehicle.     Pre-Requisite Knowledge:   Students should be familiar with the elements that make up a highway and the various technologies available in today\u2019s vehicles.     Learning Objectives:   After this lesson, students will be able to:     Understand the engineering and manufacturing processes involved in the building and distribution of vehicles   Identify the technologies in a Smart Car   Identify the technologies in a Smart Highway   Explain the relationship between the Smart Car and Smart Highway       Introduction/Motivation:   Engineering a Car   When designing a car, engineers have a huge number of factors to consider:     Aerodynamics. At 70 mph, 90% of the energy in gas is used to overcome wind resistance.   \u00a0Fuel Economy/Efficiency. How many miles can I drive per gallon of gas?   Safety. Will I survive an accident?   Convenience. Is the car easy to operate? Does it have push-to-start? Does it have remote unlock?   Interactivity. How does the car interact with the user? How does it interact with the environment? How does it interact with other cars?       Cars of the Future   Spend more time talking with students about the current technologies in their family\u2019s car or in today\u2019s car and categorize them into technologies that 1) interact with the driver, 2) interact with other cars, 3) interact with the transportation infrastructure.     To make a car smart and allow it to interact with the environment, other cars and the driver, it must be designed with intelligent vehicle technologies. Some examples of intelligent vehicle technologies are autonomous driverless technology, internal and external sensors, and vehicle-to-vehicle Bluetooth communication. Interior and exterior sensors could detect a distracted driver or external dangers. If a driver\u2019s eyes wander off of the road, the car could issue a warning. If road debris comes hurling towards the car, the car might be able to take control of the wheel momentarily and steer the car away from the debris\u2019 trajectory.     Vehicle to vehicle communication and driverless technologies would allow formation of road trains. Vehicles heading to the same direction can drive closer to each other in a train formation on the highway. This decreases congestion and increases the vehicle\u2019s fuel efficiency due to decreased wind resistance as compared to vehicles moving individually. Road trains require vehicles to have a driverless function because driving in such a close proximity requires automated accuracy.     Manufacturing Process   The first step in making a car is for the stylists to come up with a design that corresponds to the taste of the public. The design is first drawn on paper, and then rendered into 3-D computer graphics. Simulator programs gauge the proposed aerodynamics and the performance of the vehicle in crash tests. If the designs are approved, the tools to create the components are manufactured. To minimize the cost, automobile manufacturers tend to use components from an existing brand.   The assembly starts from the bottom of the car, with the chassis rolled into the assembly line first. The drive shaft, suspension, steering box, gas tank, wheel drums and brake assembly are installed and the heavy work is performed with articulating robotic equipment in a sequential manner. The worker will place the radiator on the frame while another one secures it. The robotic equipment and workers use pneumatic tools to bolt every component in place. The worker and robot will be assigned to specific stations for their tasks. The body of the car comes in unpainted pieces that are welded by a robot to complete the unit. Finally, fenders, doors, trunk lid, hood and bumpers are added. The body is dipped into a solution to clear contaminants before being painted by robots.   At this point the final inspection is carried out. Inspectors pay attention to the interior where the seats, door panels, dash panels, wiring harness and interior lights are installed, as well as the glass, radio, speakers and headliners. The last parts to be installed are the steering column and windshield, and then the chassis and body are mated before adding the tires, anti-freeze, battery and final trim.     Highway Engineering   Highway and pavement engineering are two sub-disciplines of civil engineering vital to the mobility and transportation of people and goods in a smart city. A highway consists of various elements such as pavement, pavement markings, directional signs, interchanges (exits/entrances), road lights, crash cushions, and jersey barriers. These elements are essential to the design and function of a highway.     Pavement Engineering is a branch of civil engineering concerned with the design of road pavements. Pavement engineers determine 1) the materials used, 2) the amount of materials used, and 3) the methods in which they are produced and applied to construct the road. Pavement design is determined by the expected number of vehicles to use the road in the future. Highways are designed not to meet current needs of the community, but on the future demand. The climate the highway is located in and the proximity to residential neighborhoods are other factors that must be taken into account.     There are three main layers in a highway\u2019s pavement. The surface course is usually made of asphalt or concrete. This layer is also known as the wearing course, where most of the wear and maintenance of the surface takes place. The base course is the load-transferring layer, usually made of well-graded gravel (different sizes of rocks). The subbase course is the bottom layer of compacted soil. This soil can be native soil or borrowed soil (soil from somewhere else). When the native soil is soft or clayey, a layer of concrete is usually applied between the subbase and the base course.        Photo source: http://www.pavementinteractive.org/article/hma-pavement/       When deciding which material to use for the surface course, engineers have a choice between concrete or asphalt, the two most common pavement materials. Concrete is strong in compression and weak in tension, meaning that it has a low tendency to deform under the pressure of a heavy load, but tends to break when bent. Because of its low tensile strength, concrete often must be used with reinforcing steel bars (rebars) to prevent premature failure of the concrete. Concrete is preferred over sections of highways that are elevated. Concrete is more durable than asphalt, and is a more rigid material. Cars consume 20% less fuel on concrete roads, because less energy is lost to deforming the pavement due to its rigidity. Concrete is made from limestone, which is plentiful, while asphalt is made from petroleum. Finally, concrete is more resistant to oil leaks and extreme heat.     Asphalt has advantages over concrete, as well. If concrete breaks, the entire slab needs to be replaced, while on an asphalt road small sections can be replaced at a time. Asphalt is safer for drivers, providing better traction and skid resistance. It is recyclable: asphalt can be melted and reused, which is important if owners need to comply with sustainability requirements. Asphalt roads are quicker and cheaper to build than concrete roads, but must be replaced more frequently.

Other Technologies for Smart Highways     A smart car and a smart highway enhance safety, navigation support and communication with technology that interacts with the driver, other cars and the infrastructure. A smart highway shares the same goals as today\u2019s highways, but puts an increased emphasis in interaction between the car and the highway. Major components of a highway are pavement markings, crash cushions, highway signs and road lights, all designed to facilitate the flow and safety of traffic. These components are being re-engineered to develop smarter highways.     LED Signs in a smart highway could take advantage of real-time traffic data: Instead of making one lane \u201cExit Only\u201d for the entire life of the highway, it could change the lane markings to help relieve congestion. For example: If there is a lot of congestion going into Las Cruces, it could take one of the \u201cthru Traffic\u201d lanes and make it \u201cexit only for Las Cruces\u201d     Smart road lights called Turbine Lights take the wind from passing cars and from the environment to power the lights.

Road Train   Smart Cars that utilizes wireless communication to organize itself behind other cars going to the same destination; this reduces the drag force that causes a car to consume more fuel.             Safety Issues   None     Procedure:   Students will work in groups to calculate the costs of using concrete or asphalt to build and maintain a highway, and discuss which they would choose if they were pavement engineers.     Tell the students that they are pavement engineers and you (the teacher) are a representative from the Department of Transportation. You want to hire the engineers to determine whether you should use concrete or asphalt in a new section of highway you want to build. Give students the following information to perform their calculations:     The Department of Transportation wants to build a 100 mile 3 lane highway that lasts 60 years. Should we use asphalt or concrete? Which one costs less? Prove it to me!     *Assume I will set aside all the money to pay for it today; we are not considering the time value of money (inflation, interest paid etc.)   *Assume it takes one year to build the highway and while the highway is being built there are no repair costs paid.     Concrete costs     $500,000 per lane per mile   $2000 to repair per lane per mile per year   Needs to be replaced every 30 years     Asphalt costs:     $295000 per lane per mile   $4000 to repair per lane per mile per year   Needs to be replaced every 20 years       Encourage students to write their equations with as much detail as possible, and to be sure that units are used appropriately.     Source:   Ulerio, Jose.\u00a0 \u201cEconomic Analysis.\u201d PowerPoint presentation. NYU Poly CE3343,\u2028Brooklyn, NY. March 17, 2013.     Solution:   Cost of Concrete:   = Cost to construct highway + cost to repair highway + cost to replace highway   = [\u00a0* 3 lanes * 100 miles] + [*3 lanes*100 miles*58 years] + [\u00a0* 3 lanes * 100 miles]   = $334,800,000     Explanation:     Since concrete lasts 30 years and I want a 60 year highway I need to replace it once within the 60 year period, this explains why I added the third term.   Repair costs are only multiplied by 58 years because it takes one year to build the highway and while its being built, it is not being repaired, therefore it is 58 as opposed to 60.       Cost of Asphalt:   = Cost to construct highway + cost to repair highway + cost to replace highway   = [\u00a0* 3 lanes * 100 miles] + [*3 lanes*100 miles*58 years] + [2*\u00a0* 3 lanes * 100 miles]   = $333,900,000     Asphalt is cheaper, but the costs are very close. Ask students what other factors they might need to take into account when making a final decision.     For example, the DOT might consider whether asphalt or concrete is easier to get and deliver to the construction site. Availability of the material, Time it takes to complete the job, maintenance requirements, governmental regulations etc.     Investigating Questions       What technologies are found in your family\u2019s car today? Do these technologies interact with the driver, other cars, or the transportation infrastructure?   What are some factors that engineers need to take into consideration when choosing materials to build a road?   What do you think that cars and highways of the future should look like? What kinds of engineers do you think will be involved in building them?

The SMT rail involves a single rail with a car attached. when payment is given the car arrives at the stop/location you wish to be at then lets you off. Similarly, the Straddling bus, is a double layer bus that allows cars to pass through underneath to reduce congestion caused by large vehicles. I also learned about Smart Highways and Cars. I learned that by making cars aerodynamic,convenient, safer, and with higher fuel economy, cars become more efficient. Towards the end of the day, i found out that depending on the material used as pavement, either cement or asphalt, can change the durability and smoothness of the road. While cement is more durable, asphalt is smoother and in the long run, more expensive.

Smart Grids                            1 Reply                                The 3rd week of SoSC was all about transportation. It was very interesting because I really like cars and talking about them. But we really didn&#8217;t talk about cars we talked about how to make a new generation of cars and trucks,highways, and even the subway. We came up with some new ideas like elevated highways, and underground MagLevs. We learned how to program using an ARDUINO and make a robot that uses SONAR , follows a line on a paper. It was a very fun week and I&#8217;m looking forward to the 4th and last week &#8220;Wireless Communication&#8221;.

Traffic Engineering: An Idea                            Leave a reply                             Today in class we had a lecture on traffic engineering. During our activity we brainstormed ideas for traffic engineering in a smart city. One of my ideas was W.T.T.I. (Wireless Telecommunication Transportation Infrastructure.) In simple terms all devices of traffic infrastructure will have a built in microchip, upon construction. Therefore, transportation infrastructure can interact in a way to make local travel in a more safe and efficient manner. For example; on a two way street, the first side is congested, (with a light flashed red),and the other side of the street has no cars coming. The side of the street with no cars coming has the lights flashed &#8220;green.&#8221; The &#8220;intelligent&#8221; street lights will pick up on the fact there are no cars coming, (and none to come anytime soon.) It will send a message to the red light where the L.O.S (Level of Service) is terrible. That light, recognizing the problem at end, will turn green expediting local travel, and letting people get from point A to point B in the safest way possible making many people satisfied and happy. This idea can revolutionize our urban infrastructure making local travel in New York City a whole lot better.
