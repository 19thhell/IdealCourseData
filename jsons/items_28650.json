Turning data into insight.   Our networked world is generating a deluge of data that no human, or group of humans, can process fast enough. This data deluge has the potential to transform the way business, government, science and healthcare are carried out. The emerging discipline of data science holds the key to unlocking that potential. It uses automated methods to analyze massive amounts of data and extract knowledge from them. Data science combines aspects of computer science, applied mathematics and statistics.

Information visualization, graphic design and human computer interaction all come into play.                                                                                                                                        Where will the data revolution take us?   Data science has already started to revolutionize most areas of intellectual endeavor found at NYU and in the world. We believe this revolution is just beginning. Data science can help us answer not only the great questions and challenges of our time, but also centuries-old questions. Through data science we may improve our understanding of how the brain works, for example. With that understanding we can build intelligent machines capable of advancing life-saving medical research. Data science can help us realize the promises of the digital age.        33% of all data will be stored, or will have passed through the cloud by 2015.     \u201c\u2026Now we really do have essentially free and ubiquitous data. So the complimentary scarce factor is the ability to understand that data and extract value from it.\u201d \u2014Hal Varian, Chief Economist for Google                                                                                                    Unlocking Big Data&#8217;s Potential   From government, social networks and ecommerce sites to sensors, smart meters and mobile networks, data is being collected at an unprecedented speed and scale.

They also advance the field by developing new automated tools and methodologies.       Analyze &amp; Refine   With an explorer\u2019s desire to uncover what others might not see, data scientists analyze data. Their insights are used in sectors ranging from biology to finance to government.       Interaction   Data scientists excel in presenting complicated findings for experts and non-experts alike. Information visualization, graphic design and human computer interaction all come into play.                                                                                                                                        Where will the data revolution take us?   Data science has already started to revolutionize most areas of intellectual endeavor found at NYU and in the world. We believe this revolution is just beginning. Data science can help us answer not only the great questions and challenges of our time, but also centuries-old questions. Through data science we may improve our understanding of how the brain works, for example. With that understanding we can build intelligent machines capable of advancing life-saving medical research. Data science can help us realize the promises of the digital age.        33% of all data will be stored, or will have passed through the cloud by 2015.     \u201c\u2026Now we really do have essentially free and ubiquitous data. So the complimentary scarce factor is the ability to understand that data and extract value from it.\u201d \u2014Hal Varian, Chief Economist for Google                                                                                                    Unlocking Big Data&#8217;s Potential   From government, social networks and ecommerce sites to sensors, smart meters and mobile networks, data is being collected at an unprecedented speed and scale.

It was launched to help meet the world\u2019s demand for researchers and professionals skilled in developing and utilizing automated methods of analyzing data. The initiative is especially focused on harnessing the potential power of big data to transform areas ranging from healthcare to business to government. Data science overlaps traditionally strong disciplines at NYU such as mathematics, statistics and computer science. It also stands to impact disciplines in which NYU\u2019s schools and departments are actively engaged, such as economics, law and sociology.

To have impact on the city and commercial partners, and to give students real world experience, CUSP\u2019s research program contains projects with goals and deliverables that develop or integrate technologies to specific ends (for example, understand and improve congestion and emergency response). CUSP also has core activities that foster the expertise required to execute projects, and that inform its educational curriculum.   CUSP research is centered on an organizational structure based on disciplines, domains, and projects.     The Role of Social Sciences   The social sciences are an important enabler for CUSP activities \u2014 people are the customers and operators of urban systems, and understanding them and their behavior is essential to the CUSP mission. Conversely, CUSP\u2019s large, multi-modal data sets will revolutionize the social sciences. Close interaction between the urban engineering and social science disciplines will be a CUSP hallmark, particularly among NYU and CUSP partner universities.   Additionally, at the fertile intersection of the social sciences and \u201cbig data,\u201d a principal challenge is to formulate the correct questions. A scenario you can expect at CUSP: social scientists bring us a question, CUSP researchers figure out how to acquire relevant data, then together with social scientists analyze and interpret that data.     Anchored in Downtown Brooklyn   CUSP supported personnel anchor their research activities in CUSP&#8217;s offices. There are many drivers that influenced CUSP\u2019s decision to co-locate its activities \u2014 the multidisciplinary nature of CUSP education and research, the power of serendipitous &#8220;water cooler&#8221; interactions, the goal to be a presence in Downtown Brooklyn, and the energy derived from collocating teams. Moreover, the inherent multidisciplinary complexity of many urban science challenges necessitates having a resident critical mass of research capabilities.        Disciplines and Domains   CUSP research and academic activities have a domain/discipline structure that is very different from the usual department construct, and to important effect.   Disciplines\u00a0 are core informatics capabilities. CUSP is focused on the study of urban informatics \u2014 the collection, integration, and analysis to improve the efficiency of urban systems. The disciplines are organized as cross\u2010cutting areas. Research topics include &#8220;big data&#8221; fields of databases, visualization, systems, machine learning and data mining, as well as applied statistics, operations research, decision models and optimization, geographical information systems, and sensing (including the development of novel physical sensors).   Domains\u00a0 are the fields of expertise directly relevant to urban systems (mass transit, law enforcement, buildings, land use, public health, etc.). The domains correspond to relevant NYC partner agencies.   Organizing around the &#8220;what&#8221; of a problem (e.g., acquire transport data, model building energy efficiency, measure noise temporally and spatially) instills a pragmatic ethos while encouraging interactions among faculty pursuing diverse &#8220;how&#8221; approaches to a problem.   The choice and granularity of CUSP\u2019s initial set of disciplines and domains are under development.     Envisioned Projects   CUSP&#8217;s vision is for an instrumented city that will yield data for researchers and students to collect, analyze, and interpret in order to improve the everyday lives of New Yorkers and the long-term health and efficiency of  New York City.   Sensors and cameras placed on traffic choke points, for example, would inform road design and signaling methods that speed commutes.   An infrared picture of the Manhattan skyline also holds many points of inquiry. Is the dense red an indication of an overheated building, or poor insulation allowing heat to escape? What can be done to mitigate the overheating/heat loss, and what would be the cumulative effect to energy usage if smartly applied across NYC?   CUSP will tackle such issues under the framework of \u201cprojects,\u201d in collaboration with city agencies and industry partners. The projects will be major and minor in scope, resources, and duration.   In many cases, data sources already exist for such projects, awaiting CUSP researchers to unlock their potential to make the city run more efficiently and effectively. There are also opportunities for CUSP to devise data collection methods through existing or novel instruments, such as sensors for both in situ and remote measurement.   The totality of CUSP projects, built on its disciplinary and domain strengths, will over time, create an unprecedented \u201csystems view\u201d of NYC operations.   CUSP projects will possess important economic implications as well \u2014 from the jobs created to implement CUSP-proposed development, to the new ventures that could spin off from CUSP technologies.     Data Ethics and Privacy   CUSP will lead a new class of personal data users: non-profit research and academic institutions that will primarily use these data for educational and research purposes. In addition, CUSP will be tapping into novel data streams that have not traditionally been subject to privacy or security concerns.   We will establish internal policies and principles to ensure proper protection of individual privacy without keeping our researchers and students from \u201cdoing science.\u201d These policies will lead the research community in establishing industry-wide ethical standards and principles. We need to always keep in mind the ethical, legal, and societal implications of our research.   Research Infrastructure   CUSP\u2019s scope is urban informatics \u2014 the collection, integration, and analysis of data to improve the operation of urban systems and enhance the quality of life. To achieve this, CUSP will observe and analyze existing operations; utilize existing and newly emerging data streams; and explore and deploy novel urban sensors in order to model New York City as a system of living networks. Such activities require data curation and integration capabilities, an urban GIS capability, urban modeling and simulation capabilities. These tools, adapted to NYC, will be the institutional foundations that enable CUSP research and education. They must be capable, reliable, useable, interoperable, and universally available to CUSP researchers and students.     Short-Term Projects Under Consideration     Noise   Noise is clearly a huge quality-of-life issue in urban settings. It directly impacts the health of a city\u2019s population, correlates with urban problems ranging from crime to compromised educational settings, and affects real estate values. While a number of interesting studies have focused on specific contexts and effects of urban noise, no comprehensive city-wide study has been undertaken that can provide a validated model for studying urban noise in order to develop long-lasting interventions at the operational or policy level. New York City, with its population, its agency infrastructure, and its ever-changing urban soundscape provides an ideal venue for a comprehensive study and attack on problems of urban noise.     Buildings   The growing volume of data on buildings and their occupants presents the opportunity to expand our fundamental understanding of the urban built environment and the flows of energy, water, and waste within it. Coupled with the ability to use synoptic remote sensing, the acquisition, integration, and analysis of large-scale data can shift investment behavior and support data-driven decisions to improve building energy efficiency. For cities, targeted policies to maximize energy efficiency can be a cost-effective way to reduce total consumption and peak demand, lower carbon emissions, stimulate new investment, and create \u201cgood\u201d jobs.     Transportation   The ability to manage demand and optimize across transportation systems is key to improving operational efficiency and more effectively meeting customer expectations. Transportation service providers are confronted with rising costs, aging infrastructure, and environmental requirements, while continuing to meet the needs of a growing urban population. There are major challenges in understanding, monitoring, assessing, and making operational decisions necessary in complex multi-modal transportation systems. To make effective data driven decisions we must decrease the time required to collect, analyze, and provide actionable information to system operators and users. For example:     Meeting customer expectations for dependability, travel time, accessibility, transparency, and quality of service through the use of existing data, novel sensor systems, and improved visualization and human-computer interfaces to enable real time management of customer demand.   Providing the analysis necessary to support a more sustainable relationship between transportation systems and the environment.       Emergency Response and Hardened Infrastructure   The effects of Hurricane Sandy on NYC and surrounding regions highlighted the combined danger of extreme weather events and the reality of global climate change. Although federal, state, and local governments responded effectively to the demands of the catastrophic storm, there will be several \u201clessons learned\u201d that will demand a more in-depth examination of effects and responses. The result will point the way to developing cost effective risk management and emergency management practices that address preparedness, mitigation, response and recovery for both natural and man-made disasters to assure safety and security. Also, the work will enable the assessment of needs to harden the key components of urban infrastructure in order to adapt to climate change impacts such as anticipated sea level rise.                              CUSP is a unique public-private research center that uses New York City as its laboratory and classroom to help cities around the world become more productive, livable, equitable, and resilient. CUSP observes, analyzes, and models cities to optimize outcomes, prototype new solutions, formalize new tools and processes, and develop new expertise/experts. These activities will make CUSP the world\u2019s leading authority in the emerging field of \u201cUrban Informatics.\u201d  Contact Us Center for Urban   Science + Progress   1 MetroTech Center, 19th Floor   Brooklyn, NY 11201      (646) 997-0500 (office)   (646) 997-0560 (main fax) Admissions Fax: (646) 997-0550   Admissions Information: cusp.admissions@nyu.edu   General Inquiries: cusp-information@nyu.edu  Quick Links  Home   About   Events   MS in Applied Urban Science and Informatics   People   Partners   Contact   MyCusp Login    MS in Applied Urban Science and Informatics           Overview     Curriculum     Projects     Admissions Requirements     Financial Aid and Tuition                                     \u00a9 2015 NYU CUSP.
