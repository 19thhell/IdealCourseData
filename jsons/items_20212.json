Pigott holds a Ph.D. in Anthropology from the University of Pennsylvania and, as an archaeologist, is focused on the prehistory and archaeometallurgy of Mainland Southeast Asia with strong interests in the origins, transmission and societal impact of metallurgy across Eurasia. Recent research suggests connections linking the spread of tin-bronze metallurgy across Eurasia and through China with its development in prehistoric Southeast Asia. It is in this context that he continues to expand his interests in the reciprocal interactions of technology and culture. His research and fieldwork focused initially on metallurgical developments in Southwest Asia, esp. Iran, an area in which he maintains an active interest. In 1984 his focus shifted eastwards to Thailand where he co-directed for the University of Pennsylvania Museum a decade of excavation by the Thailand Archaeometallurgy Project (TAP). Fieldwork concentrated on a prehistoric copper mine in the northeast and on three sites in a valley in central Thailand identified as major, regional, copper production center. Excavations concluded in 1994, but TAP research and publication continues. After retiring from the Penn Museum\u2019s Applied Science Center for Archaeology (MASCA) in 2000, he spent a decade as an Honorary Professor at University College London\u2019s Institute of Archaeology, affiliated with its Archaeological Materials and Technology Group. Now based near Denver, Colorado, he maintains his affiliation as a Visiting Scholar in NYU\u2019s Dept. of Anthropology and its Center for the Study of Human Origins (CSHO), as well as that as a Research Associate at NYU\u2019s Institute for the Study of the Ancient World (ISAW). He is also a Consulting Scholar in the Asian Section of the Museum in Philadelphia. Dr. Pigott is a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries, London and a Corresponding Member of the International Association of Mediterreanean and Oriental Studies, Rome. He has published numerous articles and reports and has edited The Archaeometallurgy of the Asian Old World (1999), and co-edited Social Aspects of an Industrial Past with A. Bernard Knapp and Eugenia W. Herbert (1998) and Uncovering Southeast Asia\u2019s Past with Elisabeth A. Bacus and Ian C. Glover (2006).

Pigott holds a Ph.D. in Anthropology from the University of Pennsylvania and, as an archaeologist, is focused on the prehistory and archaeometallurgy of Mainland Southeast Asia with strong interests in the origins, transmission and societal impact of metallurgy across Eurasia. Recent research suggests connections linking the spread of tin-bronze metallurgy across Eurasia and through China with its development in prehistoric Southeast Asia. It is in this context that he continues to expand his interests in the reciprocal interactions of technology and culture. His research and fieldwork focused initially on metallurgical developments in Southwest Asia, esp. Iran, an area in which he maintains an active interest. In 1984 his focus shifted eastwards to Thailand where he co-directed for the University of Pennsylvania Museum a decade of excavation by the Thailand Archaeometallurgy Project (TAP). Fieldwork concentrated on a prehistoric copper mine in the northeast and on three sites in a valley in central Thailand identified as major, regional, copper production center. Excavations concluded in 1994, but TAP research and publication continues. After retiring from the Penn Museum\u2019s Applied Science Center for Archaeology (MASCA) in 2000, he spent a decade as an Honorary Professor at University College London\u2019s Institute of Archaeology, affiliated with its Archaeological Materials and Technology Group. Now based near Denver, Colorado, he maintains his affiliation as a Visiting Scholar in NYU\u2019s Dept. of Anthropology and its Center for the Study of Human Origins (CSHO), as well as that as a Research Associate at NYU\u2019s Institute for the Study of the Ancient World (ISAW). He is also a Consulting Scholar in the Asian Section of the Museum in Philadelphia. Dr. Pigott is a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries, London and a Corresponding Member of the International Association of Mediterreanean and Oriental Studies, Rome. He has published numerous articles and reports and has edited The Archaeometallurgy of the Asian Old World (1999), and co-edited Social Aspects of an Industrial Past with A. Bernard Knapp and Eugenia W. Herbert (1998) and Uncovering Southeast Asia\u2019s Past with Elisabeth A. Bacus and Ian C. Glover (2006).
