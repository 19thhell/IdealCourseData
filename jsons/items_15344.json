The curriculum at NYU Paris focuses on the language, arts, history, literature, and politics of France and its relationships with the wider world. A world-class faculty provides context and support for students\u2019 academic work. Students with a limited background in French enroll in Program I, where all courses except for language are taught in English. Students proficient in French participate in Program II, which features a variety of courses taught in French. All students take a French language course appropriate to their level.
