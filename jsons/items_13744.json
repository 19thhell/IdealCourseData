Following evaluation by the Office of Budget and Planning and senior leadership of the University, the school and department is notified of its approved budget. The budget is loaded into the University's finance system, and becomes the Original Budget on September 1.   After the Original Budget is created, NYU allows certain adjustments to the budget to accommodate new developments throughout the fiscal year. These adjustments are known as budget modifications. After modification, the original budget becomes the school or unit's Revised Budget.        Budget Control Rules   The Budget Control rules governing the verification process are determined by Fund and expense type, which means the system will evaluate spending differently depending on the Fund and expense account. The Budget Control rules ensure that a school or department has sufficient budget resources to pay salaries and purchase goods and services.            Budget Development Calendar   The Budget Office annually prepares a list of key dates and deadlines for the budget development cycle of the upcoming fiscal year. The Budget Development Calendar provides a chronological view of important milestones throughout the fiscal 2016 budget development cycle.

BudMods can be used to reallocate budget to allow a failed transaction to pass.        BudMod Approvals   Budget Modifications should be approved within 2-3 business days. The approval of modifications may take longer if there are outstanding issues that prevent normal approval - this might include:     Unbalanced Bud Mods   Insufficient Funds   or New Chart-fields           Automatic Approval Rules for BudMods   BudMods which meet the following criteria bypass the Office of Budget and Planning and post directly to FAME:      Bud Mods must be balanced   Total Increase/Decrease is for less than $5,000   Accounts used are within the same budget category groupings           Once approved, budget modifications should post to FAME within one hour. If rejected, the original requestor is notified by email.            Guidelines for Budget Modifications   The Budget Office reviews Budget Modifications differently based on Fund Group.   Below is a list of criteria that your Bud Mods should meet depending on the Fund Group it is associated with. Note: It is not possible to submit a Bud Mod across multiple funds.                                                    Operating Funds (Funds 10-16)                               All Bud Mods should be balanced. In some cases it may be necessary to submit multiple Bud Mods to achieve this balance. If for any reason a Bud Mod is submitted and is unbalanced, it should be accompanied by either an attachment or email to explain the purpose of this increase or decrease.   Bud Mods must not adjust any of the following:      Tuition Categories including Balance of Trade   Undergraduate Financial Aid      College Work Study (51118)   Global Subvention, Subvention, Plant, Admin Overhead   Reserve Target Requirement      Debt Service     Adjustments to any of these budget categories require advance approval from either the Budget Office or the Admissions Office (in the case of Financial Aid and CWS)   Any adjustments to Salaries should have a corresponding Fringe adjustment (unless change is within the same Org)   Other things that may require backup info before approving:      Shifts between Personnel and OTPS and vice versa   Shifts between Personnel or OTPS and Transfers   Changes to Turnover (Vacancy Accrual) Savings   Increases or Decreases to Uncontrollable OTPS (e.g. Utilities)                                                                Designated Funds (Funds 20-22)                               BudMods can be unbalanced if there is sufficient Fund Balance to cover the difference. A Fund Balance report should be run to determine the current balance and compared to the requested increase in expense budget.   Note: For faster approval it is suggested a copy of this Fund Balance report be attached with the BudMod when it is submitted.                                                                Sponsored Programs (Funds 24-35)                                     Sponsored Programs (Funds 24-25)                        All Bud Mods for Funds 24 or 25 should be forwarded to the appropriate analyst in SPA. See the SPA contact list for further info.

Following evaluation by the Office of Budget and Planning and senior leadership of the University, the school and department is notified of its approved budget. The budget is loaded into the University's finance system, and becomes the Original Budget on September 1.   After the Original Budget is created, NYU allows certain adjustments to the budget to accommodate new developments throughout the fiscal year. These adjustments are known as budget modifications. After modification, the original budget becomes the school or unit's Revised Budget.        Budget Control Rules   The Budget Control rules governing the verification process are determined by Fund and expense type, which means the system will evaluate spending differently depending on the Fund and expense account. The Budget Control rules ensure that a school or department has sufficient budget resources to pay salaries and purchase goods and services.            Budget Development Calendar   The Budget Office annually prepares a list of key dates and deadlines for the budget development cycle of the upcoming fiscal year. The Budget Development Calendar provides a chronological view of important milestones throughout the fiscal 2016 budget development cycle.

BudMods can be used to reallocate budget to allow a failed transaction to pass.        BudMod Approvals   Budget Modifications should be approved within 2-3 business days. The approval of modifications may take longer if there are outstanding issues that prevent normal approval - this might include:     Unbalanced Bud Mods   Insufficient Funds   or New Chart-fields           Automatic Approval Rules for BudMods   BudMods which meet the following criteria bypass the Office of Budget and Planning and post directly to FAME:      Bud Mods must be balanced   Total Increase/Decrease is for less than $5,000   Accounts used are within the same budget category groupings           Once approved, budget modifications should post to FAME within one hour. If rejected, the original requestor is notified by email.            Guidelines for Budget Modifications   The Budget Office reviews Budget Modifications differently based on Fund Group.   Below is a list of criteria that your Bud Mods should meet depending on the Fund Group it is associated with. Note: It is not possible to submit a Bud Mod across multiple funds.                                                    Operating Funds (Funds 10-16)                               All Bud Mods should be balanced. In some cases it may be necessary to submit multiple Bud Mods to achieve this balance. If for any reason a Bud Mod is submitted and is unbalanced, it should be accompanied by either an attachment or email to explain the purpose of this increase or decrease.   Bud Mods must not adjust any of the following:      Tuition Categories including Balance of Trade   Undergraduate Financial Aid      College Work Study (51118)   Global Subvention, Subvention, Plant, Admin Overhead   Reserve Target Requirement      Debt Service     Adjustments to any of these budget categories require advance approval from either the Budget Office or the Admissions Office (in the case of Financial Aid and CWS)   Any adjustments to Salaries should have a corresponding Fringe adjustment (unless change is within the same Org)   Other things that may require backup info before approving:      Shifts between Personnel and OTPS and vice versa   Shifts between Personnel or OTPS and Transfers   Changes to Turnover (Vacancy Accrual) Savings   Increases or Decreases to Uncontrollable OTPS (e.g. Utilities)                                                                Designated Funds (Funds 20-22)                               BudMods can be unbalanced if there is sufficient Fund Balance to cover the difference. A Fund Balance report should be run to determine the current balance and compared to the requested increase in expense budget.   Note: For faster approval it is suggested a copy of this Fund Balance report be attached with the BudMod when it is submitted.                                                                Sponsored Programs (Funds 24-35)                                     Sponsored Programs (Funds 24-25)                        All Bud Mods for Funds 24 or 25 should be forwarded to the appropriate analyst in SPA.
