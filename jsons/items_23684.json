Throughout its history, NYU has prided itself on being &quot;in and of the city,&quot; and this deep integration with its host city \u2014 and region \u2014 is central to the long-term vision of NYU Abu Dhabi.     NYUAD seeks to contribute to and advance Abu Dhabi's transformation into one of the next great idea capitals, a magnetic center of ideas, education, and talent. NYUAD's curriculum, research, and public programs illuminate aspects of Abu Dhabi's policy agenda and connect deeply to the possibilities and interests of the country and the region.     NYUAD involves students in community service and internships; collaborates with national universities and local institutions; encourages public participation in the many programs sponsored by the NYUAD Institute, a major forum for research dissemination and public discourse; offers courses to advance professional development; builds partnerships with Abu Dhabi organizations and businesses; and provides educational programs for local secondary and university students.                                                                    Off-campus Internships                                                    The Career Development Center encourages NYUAD students to engage in internships and work-experience opportunities throughout the year to improve and strengthen their skills and competitiveness for future employment.                                                              Competitive Sports                                                    From inter-class challenges to events across the region, our men's football team continues to represent NYUAD, while the women's team is growing in size and reputation as it competes throughout the UAE.                                                              Community Outreach                                                    NYUAD's Office of Community Outreach provides information to students seeking both short- and long-term volunteer opportunities, as well as guidance on how to select those opportunities that interest them, and for which their skill sets are most needed.                                                                                                                                        Maramis is a traditional Emirati word that literally translates to &quot;a place where people gather to talk and converse.&quot; The name of this newsletter represents NYUAD's desire to bridge old and new, and to connect and collaborate with members of the UAE community. We hope that Maramis will help us both continue our conversations and spark new dialogues with our friends and partners in the community.

Throughout its history, NYU has prided itself on being &quot;in and of the city,&quot; and this deep integration with its host city \u2014 and region \u2014 is central to the long-term vision of NYU Abu Dhabi.     NYUAD seeks to contribute to and advance Abu Dhabi's transformation into one of the next great idea capitals, a magnetic center of ideas, education, and talent. NYUAD's curriculum, research, and public programs illuminate aspects of Abu Dhabi's policy agenda and connect deeply to the possibilities and interests of the country and the region.     NYUAD involves students in community service and internships; collaborates with national universities and local institutions; encourages public participation in the many programs sponsored by the NYUAD Institute, a major forum for research dissemination and public discourse; offers courses to advance professional development; builds partnerships with Abu Dhabi organizations and businesses; and provides educational programs for local secondary and university students.                                                                    Off-campus Internships                                                    The Career Development Center encourages NYUAD students to engage in internships and work-experience opportunities throughout the year to improve and strengthen their skills and competitiveness for future employment.                                                              Competitive Sports                                                    From inter-class challenges to events across the region, our men's football team continues to represent NYUAD, while the women's team is growing in size and reputation as it competes throughout the UAE.                                                              Community Outreach                                                    NYUAD's Office of Community Outreach provides information to students seeking both short- and long-term volunteer opportunities, as well as guidance on how to select those opportunities that interest them, and for which their skill sets are most needed.                                                                                                                                        Maramis is a traditional Emirati word that literally translates to &quot;a place where people gather to talk and converse.&quot; The name of this newsletter represents NYUAD's desire to bridge old and new, and to connect and collaborate with members of the UAE community. We hope that Maramis will help us both continue our conversations and spark new dialogues with our friends and partners in the community.

Commonly referred to as community service, volunteerism, or public service, civic engagement at NYU refers to both individual and collective initiatives designed to identify and address community needs and public concerns. Civic engagement takes many forms at NYU, from one-day and episodic service projects to year-long opportunities working alongside community partners locally, nationally, and globally.   In addition, civic engagement has other dimensions:     It provides an opportunity for students to gain knowledge, develop critical thinking skills, and understand public issues as they relate to their academic work and school curricula.   It enriches student experience and scholarship through formal and informal community-based learning opportunities.   It engages the NYU community to work together to make a difference in the civic life of our communities.     As a private university in the public service, engagement and community knowledge are essential hallmarks of an NYU education and to an engaged citizenry.            Components of Civic Engagement at NYU            Student Service Programs   The NYU Office of Civic Engagement provides opportunities for students to develop deeper and richer partnerships with local non-profit organizations, public schools, city government, and civic organizations through several employment and service programs. The Office of Civic Engagement is home to:     NYU America Reads/America Counts , the nation's largest tutoring program in which over 800 undergraduate and graduate students work as tutors in over 80 NYC public schools annually.     NYU Jumpstart , an AmeriCorps program in which seventy NYU students work in small teams to help ensure academic success among pre-K children at local early education nonprofit organizations.   NYU Public Service Corps , which provides student internship opportunities in over 30 New York City government offices.     The Office of Civic Engagment also works in close partnership with the Center for Student Activities, Leadership and Service to support their vast array of comprehensive volunteer programming for students.        Supporting Nonprofit Partners   In addition, the Office of Civic Engagement coordinates the NYU Combined Campaign in which full-time employees donate funding to the United Way of NYC and dozens of local nonprofit organizations (as distributed through the NYU Community Fund). Since its inception in 1982, the campaign has raised over $2.4 million to support nonprofit organizations near NYU campuses.   Students may also take part semester specific internships to gain valuable nonprofit work experience through the Community Fund Internship Program .        Service Grant Programs     The Office of Civic Engagement coordinates two grant programs to encourage civic participation and volunteerism:     Community Service Project Grants are offered on a semi-annual basis to students, staff and faculty wishing to create or enhance community service initiatives on the Lower East Side and Greenwich Village and in neighborhoods adjacent to the many NYU schools and divisions.   Service Learning Course Development Grants are available to support the development or enhancement of undergraduate or graduate courses that include a practicum of a volunteer experience either organized by the instructor or developed by students as an integral part of the course.

Throughout its history, NYU has prided itself on being &quot;in and of the city,&quot; and this deep integration with its host city \u2014 and region \u2014 is central to the long-term vision of NYU Abu Dhabi.     NYUAD seeks to contribute to and advance Abu Dhabi's transformation into one of the next great idea capitals, a magnetic center of ideas, education, and talent. NYUAD's curriculum, research, and public programs illuminate aspects of Abu Dhabi's policy agenda and connect deeply to the possibilities and interests of the country and the region.     NYUAD involves students in community service and internships; collaborates with national universities and local institutions; encourages public participation in the many programs sponsored by the NYUAD Institute, a major forum for research dissemination and public discourse; offers courses to advance professional development; builds partnerships with Abu Dhabi organizations and businesses; and provides educational programs for local secondary and university students.                                                                    Off-campus Internships                                                    The Career Development Center encourages NYUAD students to engage in internships and work-experience opportunities throughout the year to improve and strengthen their skills and competitiveness for future employment.                                                              Competitive Sports                                                    From inter-class challenges to events across the region, our men's football team continues to represent NYUAD, while the women's team is growing in size and reputation as it competes throughout the UAE.                                                              Community Outreach                                                    NYUAD's Office of Community Outreach provides information to students seeking both short- and long-term volunteer opportunities, as well as guidance on how to select those opportunities that interest them, and for which their skill sets are most needed.                                                                                                                                        Maramis is a traditional Emirati word that literally translates to &quot;a place where people gather to talk and converse.&quot; The name of this newsletter represents NYUAD's desire to bridge old and new, and to connect and collaborate with members of the UAE community. We hope that Maramis will help us both continue our conversations and spark new dialogues with our friends and partners in the community.

Commonly referred to as community service, volunteerism, or public service, civic engagement at NYU refers to both individual and collective initiatives designed to identify and address community needs and public concerns. Civic engagement takes many forms at NYU, from one-day and episodic service projects to year-long opportunities working alongside community partners locally, nationally, and globally.   In addition, civic engagement has other dimensions:     It provides an opportunity for students to gain knowledge, develop critical thinking skills, and understand public issues as they relate to their academic work and school curricula.   It enriches student experience and scholarship through formal and informal community-based learning opportunities.   It engages the NYU community to work together to make a difference in the civic life of our communities.     As a private university in the public service, engagement and community knowledge are essential hallmarks of an NYU education and to an engaged citizenry.            Components of Civic Engagement at NYU            Student Service Programs   The NYU Office of Civic Engagement provides opportunities for students to develop deeper and richer partnerships with local non-profit organizations, public schools, city government, and civic organizations through several employment and service programs. The Office of Civic Engagement is home to:     NYU America Reads/America Counts , the nation's largest tutoring program in which over 800 undergraduate and graduate students work as tutors in over 80 NYC public schools annually.     NYU Jumpstart , an AmeriCorps program in which seventy NYU students work in small teams to help ensure academic success among pre-K children at local early education nonprofit organizations.   NYU Public Service Corps , which provides student internship opportunities in over 30 New York City government offices.     The Office of Civic Engagment also works in close partnership with the Center for Student Activities, Leadership and Service to support their vast array of comprehensive volunteer programming for students.        Supporting Nonprofit Partners   In addition, the Office of Civic Engagement coordinates the NYU Combined Campaign in which full-time employees donate funding to the United Way of NYC and dozens of local nonprofit organizations (as distributed through the NYU Community Fund). Since its inception in 1982, the campaign has raised over $2.4 million to support nonprofit organizations near NYU campuses.   Students may also take part semester specific internships to gain valuable nonprofit work experience through the Community Fund Internship Program .        Service Grant Programs     The Office of Civic Engagement coordinates two grant programs to encourage civic participation and volunteerism:     Community Service Project Grants are offered on a semi-annual basis to students, staff and faculty wishing to create or enhance community service initiatives on the Lower East Side and Greenwich Village and in neighborhoods adjacent to the many NYU schools and divisions.   Service Learning Course Development Grants are available to support the development or enhancement of undergraduate or graduate courses that include a practicum of a volunteer experience either organized by the instructor or developed by students as an integral part of the course.

Commonly referred to as community service, volunteerism, or public service, civic engagement at NYU refers to both individual and collective initiatives designed to identify and address community needs and public concerns. Civic engagement takes many forms at NYU, from one-day and episodic service projects to year-long opportunities working alongside community partners locally, nationally, and globally.   In addition, civic engagement has other dimensions:     It provides an opportunity for students to gain knowledge, develop critical thinking skills, and understand public issues as they relate to their academic work and school curricula.   It enriches student experience and scholarship through formal and informal community-based learning opportunities.   It engages the NYU community to work together to make a difference in the civic life of our communities.     As a private university in the public service, engagement and community knowledge are essential hallmarks of an NYU education and to an engaged citizenry.            Components of Civic Engagement at NYU            Student Service Programs   The NYU Office of Civic Engagement provides opportunities for students to develop deeper and richer partnerships with local non-profit organizations, public schools, city government, and civic organizations through several employment and service programs. The Office of Civic Engagement is home to:     NYU America Reads/America Counts , the nation's largest tutoring program in which over 800 undergraduate and graduate students work as tutors in over 80 NYC public schools annually.     NYU Jumpstart , an AmeriCorps program in which seventy NYU students work in small teams to help ensure academic success among pre-K children at local early education nonprofit organizations.   NYU Public Service Corps , which provides student internship opportunities in over 30 New York City government offices.     The Office of Civic Engagment also works in close partnership with the Center for Student Activities, Leadership and Service to support their vast array of comprehensive volunteer programming for students.        Supporting Nonprofit Partners   In addition, the Office of Civic Engagement coordinates the NYU Combined Campaign in which full-time employees donate funding to the United Way of NYC and dozens of local nonprofit organizations (as distributed through the NYU Community Fund). Since its inception in 1982, the campaign has raised over $2.4 million to support nonprofit organizations near NYU campuses.   Students may also take part semester specific internships to gain valuable nonprofit work experience through the Community Fund Internship Program .        Service Grant Programs     The Office of Civic Engagement coordinates two grant programs to encourage civic participation and volunteerism:     Community Service Project Grants are offered on a semi-annual basis to students, staff and faculty wishing to create or enhance community service initiatives on the Lower East Side and Greenwich Village and in neighborhoods adjacent to the many NYU schools and divisions.   Service Learning Course Development Grants are available to support the development or enhancement of undergraduate or graduate courses that include a practicum of a volunteer experience either organized by the instructor or developed by students as an integral part of the course.

Commonly referred to as community service, volunteerism, or public service, civic engagement at NYU refers to both individual and collective initiatives designed to identify and address community needs and public concerns. Civic engagement takes many forms at NYU, from one-day and episodic service projects to year-long opportunities working alongside community partners locally, nationally, and globally.   In addition, civic engagement has other dimensions:     It provides an opportunity for students to gain knowledge, develop critical thinking skills, and understand public issues as they relate to their academic work and school curricula.   It enriches student experience and scholarship through formal and informal community-based learning opportunities.   It engages the NYU community to work together to make a difference in the civic life of our communities.     As a private university in the public service, engagement and community knowledge are essential hallmarks of an NYU education and to an engaged citizenry.            Components of Civic Engagement at NYU            Student Service Programs   The NYU Office of Civic Engagement provides opportunities for students to develop deeper and richer partnerships with local non-profit organizations, public schools, city government, and civic organizations through several employment and service programs. The Office of Civic Engagement is home to:     NYU America Reads/America Counts , the nation's largest tutoring program in which over 800 undergraduate and graduate students work as tutors in over 80 NYC public schools annually.     NYU Jumpstart , an AmeriCorps program in which seventy NYU students work in small teams to help ensure academic success among pre-K children at local early education nonprofit organizations.   NYU Public Service Corps , which provides student internship opportunities in over 30 New York City government offices.     The Office of Civic Engagment also works in close partnership with the Center for Student Activities, Leadership and Service to support their vast array of comprehensive volunteer programming for students.        Supporting Nonprofit Partners   In addition, the Office of Civic Engagement coordinates the NYU Combined Campaign in which full-time employees donate funding to the United Way of NYC and dozens of local nonprofit organizations (as distributed through the NYU Community Fund). Since its inception in 1982, the campaign has raised over $2.4 million to support nonprofit organizations near NYU campuses.   Students may also take part semester specific internships to gain valuable nonprofit work experience through the Community Fund Internship Program .        Service Grant Programs     The Office of Civic Engagement coordinates two grant programs to encourage civic participation and volunteerism:     Community Service Project Grants are offered on a semi-annual basis to students, staff and faculty wishing to create or enhance community service initiatives on the Lower East Side and Greenwich Village and in neighborhoods adjacent to the many NYU schools and divisions.   Service Learning Course Development Grants are available to support the development or enhancement of undergraduate or graduate courses that include a practicum of a volunteer experience either organized by the instructor or developed by students as an integral part of the course.

Throughout its history, NYU has prided itself on being &quot;in and of the city,&quot; and this deep integration with its host city \u2014 and region \u2014 is central to the long-term vision of NYU Abu Dhabi.     NYUAD seeks to contribute to and advance Abu Dhabi's transformation into one of the next great idea capitals, a magnetic center of ideas, education, and talent. NYUAD's curriculum, research, and public programs illuminate aspects of Abu Dhabi's policy agenda and connect deeply to the possibilities and interests of the country and the region.     NYUAD involves students in community service and internships; collaborates with national universities and local institutions; encourages public participation in the many programs sponsored by the NYUAD Institute, a major forum for research dissemination and public discourse; offers courses to advance professional development; builds partnerships with Abu Dhabi organizations and businesses; and provides educational programs for local secondary and university students.                                                                    Off-campus Internships                                                    The Career Development Center encourages NYUAD students to engage in internships and work-experience opportunities throughout the year to improve and strengthen their skills and competitiveness for future employment.                                                              Competitive Sports                                                    From inter-class challenges to events across the region, our men's football team continues to represent NYUAD, while the women's team is growing in size and reputation as it competes throughout the UAE.                                                              Community Outreach                                                    NYUAD's Office of Community Outreach provides information to students seeking both short- and long-term volunteer opportunities, as well as guidance on how to select those opportunities that interest them, and for which their skill sets are most needed.                                                                                                                                        Maramis is a traditional Emirati word that literally translates to &quot;a place where people gather to talk and converse.&quot; The name of this newsletter represents NYUAD's desire to bridge old and new, and to connect and collaborate with members of the UAE community. We hope that Maramis will help us both continue our conversations and spark new dialogues with our friends and partners in the community.
