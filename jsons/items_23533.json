Among the issues you will want to consider are your child's age and temperament, the available care options, the schedule you are seeking, whether you prefer care to be close to home or work, and how much you can afford.   Child and Adult Care Information and Referral     Carebridge Life Resources , NYU's Employee Assistance Program, is your primary source for child care information and referral.

Types of Child Care     There are three primary forms of child care services for children newborn through five years of age. They are: center-based, family child care, and in-home care. Center-based and family child care are both regulated by the City of New York. Because of the short supply of center-based care for infants and toddlers, and two-year olds the majority of families seeking care for this age group tend to rely on family child care or in-home care.   Start Your Search Early     It is important to start your search for child care early. Beginning early will provide you with an opportunity to have a sense of the available care options, give you the time you need to determine your preference in the type of care available, and alleviate the potential stress of making this decision when you need to return to work.   Help Finding Child Care     In NYC, as elsewhere across the country, center-based care or preschool aged children (2.5-4 years) is readily available. On the other hand, services for infants (newborn-12 months) and toddlers (18-24 months) are scarce. In the Chelsea, Greenwich Village, and lower Manhattan neighborhoods waitlists for children in this age group average 12-18 months.   Therefore, if you are seeking care for your young child, a very compelling reason to look for care early is that you will want to place your name on a waitlist. Full-time child care centers programs are accustomed to accepting applications from expectant and adopting parents. The majority of programs do not require a deposit however some program do have a practice of requiring non-refundable deposits to secure your place.

Family Child Care Homes     A regulated family child care provider takes care of three to six children in their own home or apartment. In \u201cgroup family child care,\u201d the provider, working with an assistant, cares for seven to twelve children in his or her home or apartment.

Just by being a parent and a student, you have already proven that nothing is unreachable, and that you have great strength and determination. Below you will find a number of resources that may be helpful to you as you balance both these roles.   NYU Family Care   NYU Family Care is working to support NYU's working parents with children aged newborn through school-age. Many of the initiatives are also available to student parents. These include access to the NYU Babysitting Registry , Nursing Mother and Lactation Rooms , Parenting Education Programs, NYU Parents Network , and school and child care options.
