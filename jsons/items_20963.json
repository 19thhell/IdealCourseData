As part of the core curriculum of the NYU Wagner Masters program, Capstone teams spend an academic year addressing challenges and identifying opportunities for a client organization or conducting research on a pressing social question. Wagner's Capstone program provides students with a centerpiece of their graduate experience whereby they are able to experience first-hand turning the theory of their studies into practice under the guidance of an experienced faculty member. Projects require students to get up-to-speed quickly on a specific content or issue area; enhance key process skills including project management and teamwork; and develop competency in gathering, analyzing, and reporting out on data. Capstone requires students to interweave their learning in all these areas, and to do so in real time, in an unpredictable, complex, real-world environment.

This seven week program includes: college\u00a0 level workshops and seminars, a high\u00a0 level research experience in one of several NYU-Poly faculty labs , and mentoring in that placement by a graduate or postdoctoral student. \u00a0In the seminars and workshops, students will be introduced to engineering concepts and principles, the scientific method and ethics, research practices and lab safety.   With their mentors, ARISE participants will spend the latter four weeks of the program in these placements where they will make practical contributions to their lab\u2019s research objectives. \u00a0These objectives are in\u00a0areas such as mechanical and civil engineering; information systems and cyber security; materials science and robotics; chemical, biological and protein engineering; as well as biology and molecular design.   Students will also receive training in presentation and public speaking skills, in collaboration with ARISE&#8217;s partners at Irondale Ensemble Project , and give\u00a0their research findings at the program&#8217;s concluding colloquium to NYU faculty and graduate students, their peer ARISE participants, other academic experts, family members and friends.   Through a grant from the Pinkerton Foundation , ARISE is intended to provide an advanced STEM research opportunity to New York City students with little or no access to high quality STEM education experiences.\u00a0 Students from demographic groups underrepresented in STEM disciplines and careers, including women, students of color and those from low income backgrounds, are strongly encouraged to apply.   We are looking for:       New York City residents who are completing 10th or 11th grade in June 2015.   Academically prepared, highly motivated students.   Applicants with a passion for science, technology, engineering and math.

The MA curriculum exposes students to research on the role of emotion, cognition, perception, and intrapersonal as well as interpersonal dynamics in engendering change at various levels, particularly in the community context. Particular focus is on action research programs and prevention intervention research projects.    Working under the supervision of the Program Director and a faculty mentor, students apply the skills acquired in their core courses as well as specialized areas of knowledge to an independent research problem. This work culminates in a final integrative project, such as a publishable quality research thesis, program development proposal, or prevention intervention study. Recent student research topics have included: Civic Engagement in South African Youth; Socio-Dramatic Play in Young Children; Music Therapy Outcomes with Autistic Youth; Low-Income Housing Status and Literacy Outcomes; and Parent and Teacher Satisfaction with Intervention Programming.
