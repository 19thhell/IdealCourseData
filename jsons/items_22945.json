Corequisite: EX-UY 1   Humanities/Social Science Electives (16 Credits)   Free Electives with Adviser&#39;s Approval (26 Credits)   These can be courses offered by any department, provided they do not duplicate material studied in other courses and that you meet the prerequisites for the courses.   Minor Specialties (18 Credits)   These consist of at least 9 credits in a single area of study other than mathematics and beyond the required courses found below. The sequence must be well integrated and consistent to insure you gain knowledge in an area other than mathematics. When selecting electives, you should consult with the adviser of the department that interests you. This work is in addition to the courses you take under other categories of the programs. For instance, required courses in physics do not count toward a minor in physics.    The following are possible minor concentrations:     Chemical Engineering   Chemistry   Computer Engineering   Computer Science   Electrical Engineering   Management   Mechanical Engineering   Physics   Transportation     Minor in Mathematics   You may obtain a minor in mathematics by taking 15 credits of mathematics courses, 8 credits of which are in addition to the major department&rsquo;s requirement in mathematics and must include 2 courses in Real Analysis. You must take at least 6 of those 8 credits while enrolled at the School of Engineering.   Dual Major in Mathematics and Physics   You may also pursue a dual major in mathematics and physics. Advisers from both the mathematics and physics programs must approve specific course requirements for this 128-credit degree.
