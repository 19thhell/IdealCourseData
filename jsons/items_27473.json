This colloquium is designed to address issues related to the preparation of Intermediate level production classes including Intermediate Narrative Production Workshop, Documentary Workshop, Experimental Workshop, and Intermediate Television. In the presentation of pre-production issues, it is the design of the class to make the screen writing process all the more focused on the real production parameters of each class. Topics to be covered include: screenplay format, script breakdowns, casting, crewing, rehearsals, scouting, paperwork and funding. As with all colloquiums, this class is also an opportunity for students to network and learn about departmental events as a group.

This colloquium will introduce students to the concerns of the editor, with an emphasis on how pre-production and production influence the post-production process. Students will learn how to approach the complex interface between analog and digital in a cost-effective, practical, and creative way. Editing techniques and the uses of coverage will be deconstructed through film clips and discussion, while guest speakers from the industry will delve into negative matching, laboratory procedures, optical effects, sound design and film scoring. Students from previous semesters will reveal lessons learned in the editing room. There will be a series of handouts including production to post-production flow charts, camera and sound reports, sample lined scripts, continuity reports, and mix and ADR cue sheets, which students will be required to bind and keep for future reference.
