The mission of ACS is to help revitalize and transform contemporary legal debate from law school classrooms to federal courtrooms. The goal is to counter the dominant vision of American law today, a narrow conservative vision that lacks appropriate regard for the ways in which the law affects people\u2019s lives.   We seek to restore the fundamental principles of respect for human dignity, protection of individual rights and liberties, genuine equality, and access to justice to their traditionally central place in American law. ACS is a non-partisan educational organization that does not lobby, litigate, or take positions on specific issues, but does encourage its members to express their views and make their voices heard.   The NYU School of Law chapter of ACS formed in the Fall of 2002. In our first year, we hosted speakers such as Nancy Chang from the Center for Constitutional Rights speaking on the US Patriot Act\u2019s impact on civil liberties and Ralph Nader speaking on corporate crimes and governance. We also hosted regular lunchtime discussions with professors and lawyers discussing their areas of interest and expertise.   We hope you\u2019ll join ACS as we strive to return the US Constitution to its position as the protector of individual rights and liberties.
