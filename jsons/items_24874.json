More information about our most current work will be available soon.   The BELLE Project is a team of doctors, researchers, and child development experts (led by our Primary Investigator, Dr. Alan Mendelsohn) who are dedicated to providing families with resources to help ensure that their children enter school ready to learn and succeed.   The Video Interaction Project (VIP) is our evidence-based parenting program that uses videotaping and developmentally-appropriate toys, books and resources to help parents utilize pretend play, shared reading, and daily routines as opportunities for strengthening early development and literacy in their children. VIP sessions take place in pediatric clinics on days of routine well-child visits, and at each session families meet individually with an interventionist for approximately 30 minutes.   Thanks to the support of Children of Bellevue and our sponsors (including the Tiger Foundation, the Marks Family Foundation, and the New York City Council's Early Literacy Initiative: City's First Readers), we are now offering VIP as part of routine pediatric care at Woodhull Medical Center in Brooklyn, NY! All families with children ages 0-12 months are encouraged to participate.   To contact us:   If you are a parent of a young infant who is receiving general pediatric care at Woodhull Medical Center and have questions or would like more information about VIP, please contact Jennifer Ledesma or Ivonne Monje at 718-963-8184, or email our Project Director (Dr. Adriana Weisleder).

The Bellevue Project for Early Language, Literacy, and Education Success (BELLE) is a multi-disciplinary behavioral research laboratory, under the leadership of Alan Mendelsohn, MD, whose primary goal is to adapt, develop and assess pediatric primary health care strategies for working with low-income families of very young children (age birth-5 years). These pediatric primary health care strategies are designed to promote parent-child interactions that will serve to enhance school readiness and long-term educational achievement; thus lessening poverty-related disparities in these domains.   Why Pediatric Primary Care?  Pediatric primary care is a unique platform for reaching at-risk, poor children population-wide prior to school entry for the following reasons:   All children must have immunizations and screening to enter school   There are 15 routine visits to the pediatrician from birth-5 years   Parents want help with developmental issues when they come for well- child visits, and   Interventions in primary care are very low cost when compared to other intervention strategies (such as home visitation).   Why Do We Work With Families of Very Young Children?  Intervening during the first five years before school entry is critical:   Children\u2019s brains develop rapidly during the first five years   Early high quality experiences foster this brain development; early low quality experiences (e.g., television) can prevent optimal brain development   Waiting for school entry is too late!   A Snapshot of Our Work:   The Video Interaction Project   Since 1999, we have been implementing and testing the effectiveness of a pediatric primary care parenting intervention called The Video Interaction Project (VIP)   \u00a0VIP is a relationship-based parenting intervention which builds on Reach out and Read , pushing the model of utilizing the pediatric primary care platform to promote school readiness in at-risk children.   In VIP, a child development specialist works with parents at every well-child visit to encourage critical interactions between parents and children through playing or reading together.   Core components of VIP: parent and infant/child videotaped together while playing or reading; parent then watches with child development specialist who identifies and reinforces strengths in the interaction; also includes the provision of books and toys as well as parenting pamphlets.   Building Blocks   Developed by Harris S. Huberman, MD, MPH   BB takes place from birth to 3 years. BB, like VIP, delivers a curriculum focused on supporting verbal interactions in the context of pretend play, shared reading and daily routines.   The BB curriculum is delivered through written pamphlets and learning materials that are mailed monthly to the family.   Core components of BB: newsletters focusing on positive parenting; learning materials (toys and/or books) provided; parent-completed Ages and Stages Questionnaires are provided to help parents become active observers of their child\u2019s development.

(Vea abajo para espa\u00f1ol)   \u00a0   We are currently in a period of exciting growth and development. Please be patient and check in regularly as we continue to update this website. More information about our most current work will be available soon.   The BELLE Project is a team of doctors, researchers, and child development experts (led by our Primary Investigator, Dr. Alan Mendelsohn) who are dedicated to providing families with resources to help ensure that their children enter school ready to learn and succeed.   The Video Interaction Project (VIP) is our evidence-based parenting program that uses videotaping and developmentally-appropriate toys, books and resources to help parents utilize pretend play, shared reading, and daily routines as opportunities for strengthening early development and literacy in their children. VIP sessions take place in pediatric clinics on days of routine well-child visits, and at each session families meet individually with an interventionist for approximately 30 minutes.   Thanks to the support of Children of Bellevue and our sponsors (including the Tiger Foundation, the Marks Family Foundation, and the New York City Council's Early Literacy Initiative: City's First Readers), we are now offering VIP as part of routine pediatric care at Woodhull Medical Center in Brooklyn, NY! All families with children ages 0-12 months are encouraged to participate.   To contact us:   If you are a parent of a young infant who is receiving general pediatric care at Woodhull Medical Center and have questions or would like more information about VIP, please contact Jennifer Ledesma or Ivonne Monje at 718-963-8184, or email our Project Director (Dr. Adriana Weisleder).

The Bellevue Project for Early Language, Literacy, and Education Success (BELLE) is a multi-disciplinary behavioral research laboratory, under the leadership of Alan Mendelsohn, MD, whose primary goal is to adapt, develop and assess pediatric primary health care strategies for working with low-income families of very young children (age birth-5 years). These pediatric primary health care strategies are designed to promote parent-child interactions that will serve to enhance school readiness and long-term educational achievement; thus lessening poverty-related disparities in these domains.   Why Pediatric Primary Care?  Pediatric primary care is a unique platform for reaching at-risk, poor children population-wide prior to school entry for the following reasons:   All children must have immunizations and screening to enter school   There are 15 routine visits to the pediatrician from birth-5 years   Parents want help with developmental issues when they come for well- child visits, and   Interventions in primary care are very low cost when compared to other intervention strategies (such as home visitation).   Why Do We Work With Families of Very Young Children?  Intervening during the first five years before school entry is critical:   Children\u2019s brains develop rapidly during the first five years   Early high quality experiences foster this brain development; early low quality experiences (e.g., television) can prevent optimal brain development   Waiting for school entry is too late!   A Snapshot of Our Work:   The Video Interaction Project   Since 1999, we have been implementing and testing the effectiveness of a pediatric primary care parenting intervention called The Video Interaction Project (VIP)   \u00a0VIP is a relationship-based parenting intervention which builds on Reach out and Read , pushing the model of utilizing the pediatric primary care platform to promote school readiness in at-risk children.   In VIP, a child development specialist works with parents at every well-child visit to encourage critical interactions between parents and children through playing or reading together.   Core components of VIP: parent and infant/child videotaped together while playing or reading; parent then watches with child development specialist who identifies and reinforces strengths in the interaction; also includes the provision of books and toys as well as parenting pamphlets.   Building Blocks   Developed by Harris S. Huberman, MD, MPH   BB takes place from birth to 3 years. BB, like VIP, delivers a curriculum focused on supporting verbal interactions in the context of pretend play, shared reading and daily routines.   The BB curriculum is delivered through written pamphlets and learning materials that are mailed monthly to the family.   Core components of BB: newsletters focusing on positive parenting; learning materials (toys and/or books) provided; parent-completed Ages and Stages Questionnaires are provided to help parents become active observers of their child\u2019s development.   Reach Out and Read   Our prior work documented impacts of Reach Out and Read, including:   Enhanced child vocabulary - Collaborative study with Mount Sinai School of Medicine   Enhanced reading aloud in multicenter collaborative study   Media exposure in young children   BELLE media research led by Dr. Alan Mendelsohn and Dr. Suzy Tomopoulos   Data collected in the context of the BELLE project regarding longitudinal media exposure and its relationship to child development outcomes has yielded many findings related to: (1) impacts of infant media exposure on toddler development, (2) trajectories of media exposure in early childhood; and (3) relationship between parent-child interactions and impacts of media exposure.
