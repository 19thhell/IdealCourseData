Students will gain an understanding of how agricultural production shifted from a Jeffersonian ideal to an industrial and political practicality. Topics include the agrarian ideal of the yeoman farmer, the ascendancy of markets and agricultural commodification, the politicization of agriculture and the farm bill, and sustainable agricultural systems.    Food Policy FOOD-GE 2015 30 hours: 3 points Analysis of the political, economic and social causes and consequences of food production, marketing and product development    Food and Culture FOOD-GE 2191 30 hours: 3 points.

Food Markets: Concepts and Cases FOOD-GE 2016 30 hours: 3 points Explores the conceptual underpinnings of the distributive networks through which food travels from farm to table. Examines the relationships between markets, states, and society in their historical and contemporary forms. Employs case studies of how commodities travel through the food system at the local, national and international levels. Topics include: mass markets and niche markets; the culture of markets; reciprocity, exchange and redistribution; conventional and alternative supply chains.

This course also draws upon the historical underpinnings of the systems used to manage water and waste, but also the underlying issues of purity and contamination that these systems are also designed to address. Issues include water and waste in relation to changing landscapes and demographics, enmeshment in urban policymaking, and competing notions of environmentalism.
