Statement of Purpose / Personal Statement   A typewritten, double-spaced, well-organized, one- to two-page statement explaining why you wish to pursue graduate study in your particular program at our particular school. This is your opportunity to introduce yourself and to inform the department about your goals, interests, and career plans as they relate to your intended academic pursuits. Please make sure to include your name (as it appears on your application), program and date. This document will be uploaded to your online application and need not be mailed.   R&eacute;sum&eacute;   A copy of your most recent r&eacute;sum&eacute; or curriculum vitae must be uploaded to the online application and need not be mailed.       Official Transcripts   Official transcripts are required and must be received before a decision is released. To complete your application, official transcripts are required from all previously-attended post-secondary institutions, even if you were not a matriculated student and/or did not complete an academic program. Failure to submit all transcripts will delay the processing of your application, and failure to report all schools attended may result in admission recission.   Any transcript you upload to the online application will be considered unofficial; please contact your previously-attended institutions to arrange for official transcripts to be mailed directly to our processing center.   Note these specific transcript guidelines:      Transcripts from Indian institutions:          Official mark sheets or attested copies of mark sheets must be received by us in a sealed envelope from the institution.      If sending attested copies of your mark sheets, the attestation must be made by (and only by) the Controller of Examinations or Registrar and received by us in a sealed envelope from the institution.      Note that transcripts that are not in English are subject to the guidelines below (&ldquo;Transcripts not in English from any country&rdquo;).           Transcripts from Chinese institutions:          Transcripts sent from Project 211 institutions (institutions on this list ) must be received by us in a sealed envelope from the institution.      Transcripts from institutions that are not Project 211 institutions must be verified and sent to us directly by (and only by) the China Academic Degrees and Graduate Education Development Center (CDGDC) . Request that your institution send a transcript to CDGDC for verification and forwarding to NYU Engineering. Transcripts sent directly from non-Project 211 institutions will not be considered official.      Note that transcripts that are not in English are subject to the guidelines below (&ldquo;Transcripts not in English from any country&rdquo;) regardless of whether they have received CDGDC verification or not.           Transcripts not in English from any country:          For any transcript that is not issued in English by the institution, an English-language translation is required. (Dual-language transcripts issued by the institution are acceptable and do not require translation.)      All translations must be:             Complete and literal (word-for-word), replicating the original as precisely as possible with no attempts at interpretation or evaluation        Prepared in the same format as the original document        Typed on organization or school letterhead/stationery        Signed or stamped by an approved translator (see below)                 Official translations may be provided by one of the following:             The institution issuing the transcript        A consulate or embassy of the United States or of the institution&rsquo;s country        A professional, certified and/or accredited translation agency                 Translations will not be accepted from:             The applicant or members of his/her family        Individuals not affiliated with any of the organizations listed above.                      Transcripts in English from any other country:          Official transcripts must be received by us in a sealed envelope from the institution.           A note on credential evaluations:          We do accept official, course-by-course evaluations from NACES-member evaluation services (such as the World Education Service, also known as WES ) in lieu of transcripts. However, the Graduate Enrollment Management &amp; Admissions office conducts an independent evaluation of credentials that may differ from the service&rsquo;s evaluation on issues such as three-year degree equivalence.            Testing Information    Click here or read below to find out if your program requires the GRE or GMAT. Your official test scores must be on file before your application will be reviewed.      GRE scores are valid for 5 years. The GRE must be taken again if your GRE scores are older than 5 years.    Applicants who are applying for full-time enrollment must submit official GRE scores (the NYU Polytechnic School of Engineering ETS institution code is 2668 ). The MS in Integrated Digital Media is the only exception and does not require GRE scores for full-time applicants.    Applicants who are applying for part-time enrollment in the following programs must also submit official GRE scores for admission: Biomedical Engineering, Computer Engineering, Computer Science, Cybersecurity, Electrical Engineering, Financial Engineering, and Systems Engineering    GMAT scores may be substituted for the GRE only for applicants to the Management and Management of Technology programs. GMAT scores are valid for 5 years; the GMAT must be taken again if your GMAT scores are older than 5 years.    If the GRE is required for your application, an official GRE score report must be sent electronically to NYU Polytechnic School of Engineering via the ETS institution code 2668 ; a departmental code is not required. Visit the ETS website for more information about the exam.      English Language Proficiency Testing   All applicants to the NYU Polytechnic School of Engineering for graduate study must demonstrate excellent English language skills in reading, writing, speaking, and comprehension. Proficiency will be determined by the TOEFL (Test of English as a Foreign Language)* , IELTS (International English Language Testing System) , CAE (Cambridge English: Advanced) , or Pearson PTE Academic exams. The Office of Graduate Enrollment Management and Admissions reserves the right to request proof of English competency from any applicant. At least one of these exams is required for:      All International applicants (those who have or will request a visa)    Applicants (including US citizens and US Permanent Residents) whose first language is not English and/or who have not completed a bachelor&rsquo;s degree in the United States.     *The NYU Polytechnic School of Engineering TOEFL institution code is 2668 .   Applicants may request a waiver of English Language Proficiency Testing by submitting this form prior to the posted application deadline. The request will be reviewed only after transcripts have been received.   In certain cases, international graduate students may be required to take an ESL (English as a Second Language) placement exam and, if necessary, attend an intensive English program at NYU&rsquo;s American Language Institute (ALI) upon enrollment. Students may be required to attend this program while taking a reduced load of graduate academic courses. See here for more information on conditional admission for such students.   Letters of Recommendation   You are required to send two Letters of Recommendation. Recommendations should be provided by professors, employers, supervisors, or others who are able to comment on your academic achievements, research potential and your professional goals (no friends or relatives please). We ask that you register your recommenders or third-party recommendation service in our online application system. Once registered, your recommenders will be prompted to submit their letters electronically. This method allows you to efficiently monitor and follow up with your recommenders.   Financial Documentation   International students who will require a J-1 or F-1 visa to study at NYU will need to apply for a new I-20 or transfer by submitting financial documentation after admission . Do not submit financial documents (including bank statements and affidavits of support) with your application. Instructions for applying for a new I-20 or transfer will follow your letter of admission (if applicable).   Special Notes from the Office of Graduate Admissions      Please check the online system to confirm that you have successfully submitted your application.    Due to the volume of applications and related materials received, the Office of Graduate Admissions will only contact you if your application was successfully submitted and is deemed INCOMPLETE because of missing required materials. Otherwise you will hear from us when a decision has been rendered.    The following are acceptable document types for uploads to the online application system: PDF, JPEG, JPG, GIF, TIFF, PNG, Bitmap, DOC, DOCX, RTF and TXT.     What happens next?   Once your application has been submitted and all required documents have been received, it will be reviewed by the department to which you applied. When a decision is reached, you will be notified and will be able to access the decision online. If you are admitted, a paper notification will follow, and you will receive information about how to accept/decline your admission.

These tests do not require knowledge of technical terms or specialized vocabulary.         12-Point Exam     The NYU School of Professional Studies Foreign Language Proficiency Exam tests three skills\u2014listening, reading, and writing\u2014 that are necessary for everyday communicative tasks. Students are required to answer questions after listening to a passage to demonstrate comprehension, to translate into English and into the test language, and to write a short essay in response to a selection of general topics. The format of some language tests may be somewhat different, requiring short answers, multiple-choice selections, or other responses. Students are given two hours to complete the entire 12-point exam.         16-Point Exam   The 16-point exam is comprised of the 12-point exam, as well as a 350-word essay on a more complex subject. In the essay, students are required to write about abstract ideas, support an argument, hypothesize, and write in longer paragraphs. Students are given three hours to complete the entire 16-point exam. Please note that a perfect 12-point score on the first part of the exam is required in order for the 4-point essay portion to be graded.         4-Point Exam   For students who elected to take the 12-point exam and later wish to be tested on the extended 350-word essay portion of the 16-point exam, we offer an additional 4-point exam. This exam is offered only to students who received a perfect score on the 12-point exam. Students are given one hour (60 minutes) to complete the 4-point exam.           Scheduling an Exam            * It is important to note that the actual amount of credit granted is at the discretion of the institution receiving the results. Students are strongly urged to discuss accreditation with the institution\u2019s advisor prior to taking the exam. Exam results are valid for five years from the test date. Official letters will not be mailed to institutions for tests that are more than five years old.            Exam Results        An official letter stipulating the results of the examination will be mailed to the designated institution up to eight weeks after the test is taken. The student will receive an unofficial copy of the letter.   Allow two extra weeks during winter break. Though the official letter is sufficient for most institutions, should an official transcript be required, it can be obtained from the NYU Transcript Office .

These tests do not require knowledge of technical terms or specialized vocabulary.         12-Point Exam     The NYU School of Professional Studies Foreign Language Proficiency Exam tests three skills\u2014listening, reading, and writing\u2014 that are necessary for everyday communicative tasks. Students are required to answer questions after listening to a passage to demonstrate comprehension, to translate into English and into the test language, and to write a short essay in response to a selection of general topics. The format of some language tests may be somewhat different, requiring short answers, multiple-choice selections, or other responses. Students are given two hours to complete the entire 12-point exam.         16-Point Exam   The 16-point exam is comprised of the 12-point exam, as well as a 350-word essay on a more complex subject. In the essay, students are required to write about abstract ideas, support an argument, hypothesize, and write in longer paragraphs. Students are given three hours to complete the entire 16-point exam. Please note that a perfect 12-point score on the first part of the exam is required in order for the 4-point essay portion to be graded.         4-Point Exam   For students who elected to take the 12-point exam and later wish to be tested on the extended 350-word essay portion of the 16-point exam, we offer an additional 4-point exam. This exam is offered only to students who received a perfect score on the 12-point exam. Students are given one hour (60 minutes) to complete the 4-point exam.           Scheduling an Exam            * It is important to note that the actual amount of credit granted is at the discretion of the institution receiving the results. Students are strongly urged to discuss accreditation with the institution\u2019s advisor prior to taking the exam. Exam results are valid for five years from the test date. Official letters will not be mailed to institutions for tests that are more than five years old.            Exam Results        An official letter stipulating the results of the examination will be mailed to the designated institution up to eight weeks after the test is taken. The student will receive an unofficial copy of the letter.   Allow two extra weeks during winter break. Though the official letter is sufficient for most institutions, should an official transcript be required, it can be obtained from the NYU Transcript Office .

Students are required to answer questions after listening to a passage to demonstrate comprehension, to translate into English and into the test language, and to write a short essay in response to a selection of general topics. The format of some language tests may be somewhat different, requiring short answers, multiple-choice selections, or other responses.

This exam is offered only to students who received a perfect score on the 12-point exam. Students are given one hour (60 minutes) to complete the 4-point exam.           Scheduling an Exam            * It is important to note that the actual amount of credit granted is at the discretion of the institution receiving the results.

Learn More                           Apply Now          The NYU School of Professional Studies Office of Admissions carefully weighs each component of your application during the admissions review process. We use this approach to evaluate your ability to benefit from and contribute to the dynamic learning environment and the challenging curriculum that the Paul McGhee Division offers.   The following criteria will help you to better understand the admissions process and the types of information that are required to be submitted to the Office of Admissions in addition to your completed online application .   Personal Statement   The personal statement provides you with the opportunity to communicate your particular strengths and your level of intellectual capacity. It helps the Admissions Committee to gain a better understanding of you as a person and as a prospective student. It provides evidence of achievement that may not be reflected in other parts of your application and it presents the professional and life events that have influenced your academic trajectory, professional work, and/or your decision to return to school.         R\u00e9sum\u00e9   Reviewing your r\u00e9sum\u00e9 allows the Admissions Committee to better understand how the professional, personal, and volunteer experiences in which you have participated have shaped you as a person and as a prospective student. The accomplishments and responsibilities highlighted in your r\u00e9sum\u00e9 also serve as an invaluable demonstration of your motivation, maturity, and focus.   Official Transcripts   If you have previously studied at the college level, we require an official transcript from each college or university that you have attended. The Office of Admissions can review your application if you provide unofficial copies of your transcripts. However, if you are admitted, you must submit all official documents within your first semester of study. A transcript is considered &quot;official&quot; only when received by the Office of Admissions in a sealed envelope. If you are admitted you may also be required to submit an official high school transcript.                  International Students   International applicants greatly enrich our community and are encouraged to apply. Additional criteria for international students include:   Evaluation of Foreign Educational Credentials   If requested by the Office of Admissions, each foreign transcript must also be evaluated for equivalency to the U.S. educational system for admission and transfer credit purposes. Evaluations are acceptable only from evaluation services recognized by the National Association of Credential Evaluation Services . Please request a course-by-course evaluation.           Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) Scores   TOEFL scores are required for applicants who did not complete their education in the United States or in a country where the only primary language is English.             Minimum scores are 100 on the Internet-based test, 250 on the computer-based test, or 600 on the paper-based test.   IELTS can be submitted in place of the TOEFL; the recommended minimum score is a 7.0.               English Language Assessment   In addition to taking the TOEFL and regardless of their TOEFL score, international applicants are required to participate in an English language assessment consisting of an online test and an interview administered by the NYU School of Professional Studies American Language Institute (ALI). Participation in this assessment will result in the determination of your English Proficiency Level (EPL), which will be reported to the Office of Admissions. International applicants must have submitted an application in order to register for the English language assessment; the fee to register for the assessment is $150.     Based upon your score on the ALI Placement Test, one of four possible outcomes will occur:     You will satisfy the NYU School of Professional Studies English Proficiency Level requirement and will qualify to register for full-time degree study.   You will be conditionally admitted and you will be permitted to enroll in part-time degree coursework as you complete the required ALI English language support courses.   You will be conditionally admitted and you will be required to take English language courses with ALI full-time (for up to one full year) until you are fluent enough to begin degree study.   You will not meet the minimum EPL or the School's other admissions criteria and you will be required to reapply at a later date.     Please review the ALI Online Test Procedures for information on how to register for the test.                Please Note : The NYU School of Professional Studies reserves the right to request a TOEFL, IELTS, or English language assessment conducted by ALI from a U.S. citizen or permanent resident if their primary language is not English.

These tests do not require knowledge of technical terms or specialized vocabulary.         12-Point Exam     The NYU School of Professional Studies Foreign Language Proficiency Exam tests three skills\u2014listening, reading, and writing\u2014 that are necessary for everyday communicative tasks. Students are required to answer questions after listening to a passage to demonstrate comprehension, to translate into English and into the test language, and to write a short essay in response to a selection of general topics. The format of some language tests may be somewhat different, requiring short answers, multiple-choice selections, or other responses. Students are given two hours to complete the entire 12-point exam.         16-Point Exam   The 16-point exam is comprised of the 12-point exam, as well as a 350-word essay on a more complex subject. In the essay, students are required to write about abstract ideas, support an argument, hypothesize, and write in longer paragraphs. Students are given three hours to complete the entire 16-point exam. Please note that a perfect 12-point score on the first part of the exam is required in order for the 4-point essay portion to be graded.         4-Point Exam   For students who elected to take the 12-point exam and later wish to be tested on the extended 350-word essay portion of the 16-point exam, we offer an additional 4-point exam. This exam is offered only to students who received a perfect score on the 12-point exam. Students are given one hour (60 minutes) to complete the 4-point exam.

Learn More                           Apply Now          The NYU School of Professional Studies Office of Admissions carefully weighs each component of your application during the admissions review process. We use this approach to evaluate your ability to benefit from and contribute to the dynamic learning environment and the challenging curriculum that the Paul McGhee Division offers.   The following criteria will help you to better understand the admissions process and the types of information that are required to be submitted to the Office of Admissions in addition to your completed online application .   Personal Statement   The personal statement provides you with the opportunity to communicate your particular strengths and your level of intellectual capacity. It helps the Admissions Committee to gain a better understanding of you as a person and as a prospective student. It provides evidence of achievement that may not be reflected in other parts of your application and it presents the professional and life events that have influenced your academic trajectory, professional work, and/or your decision to return to school.         R\u00e9sum\u00e9   Reviewing your r\u00e9sum\u00e9 allows the Admissions Committee to better understand how the professional, personal, and volunteer experiences in which you have participated have shaped you as a person and as a prospective student. The accomplishments and responsibilities highlighted in your r\u00e9sum\u00e9 also serve as an invaluable demonstration of your motivation, maturity, and focus.   Official Transcripts   If you have previously studied at the college level, we require an official transcript from each college or university that you have attended. The Office of Admissions can review your application if you provide unofficial copies of your transcripts. However, if you are admitted, you must submit all official documents within your first semester of study. A transcript is considered &quot;official&quot; only when received by the Office of Admissions in a sealed envelope. If you are admitted you may also be required to submit an official high school transcript.                  International Students   International applicants greatly enrich our community and are encouraged to apply. Additional criteria for international students include:   Evaluation of Foreign Educational Credentials   If requested by the Office of Admissions, each foreign transcript must also be evaluated for equivalency to the U.S. educational system for admission and transfer credit purposes. Evaluations are acceptable only from evaluation services recognized by the National Association of Credential Evaluation Services . Please request a course-by-course evaluation.           Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) Scores   TOEFL scores are required for applicants who did not complete their education in the United States or in a country where the only primary language is English.             Minimum scores are 100 on the Internet-based test, 250 on the computer-based test, or 600 on the paper-based test.   IELTS can be submitted in place of the TOEFL; the recommended minimum score is a 7.0.               English Language Assessment   In addition to taking the TOEFL and regardless of their TOEFL score, international applicants are required to participate in an English language assessment consisting of an online test and an interview administered by the NYU School of Professional Studies American Language Institute (ALI). Participation in this assessment will result in the determination of your English Proficiency Level (EPL), which will be reported to the Office of Admissions. International applicants must have submitted an application in order to register for the English language assessment; the fee to register for the assessment is $150.     Based upon your score on the ALI Placement Test, one of four possible outcomes will occur:     You will satisfy the NYU School of Professional Studies English Proficiency Level requirement and will qualify to register for full-time degree study.   You will be conditionally admitted and you will be permitted to enroll in part-time degree coursework as you complete the required ALI English language support courses.   You will be conditionally admitted and you will be required to take English language courses with ALI full-time (for up to one full year) until you are fluent enough to begin degree study.   You will not meet the minimum EPL or the School's other admissions criteria and you will be required to reapply at a later date.     Please review the ALI Online Test Procedures for information on how to register for the test.                Please Note : The NYU School of Professional Studies reserves the right to request a TOEFL, IELTS, or English language assessment conducted by ALI from a U.S. citizen or permanent resident if their primary language is not English.

Learn More                           Apply Now          The NYU School of Professional Studies Office of Admissions carefully weighs each component of your application during the admissions review process. We use this approach to evaluate your ability to benefit from and contribute to the dynamic learning environment and the challenging curriculum that the Paul McGhee Division offers.   The following criteria will help you to better understand the admissions process and the types of information that are required to be submitted to the Office of Admissions in addition to your completed online application .   Personal Statement   The personal statement provides you with the opportunity to communicate your particular strengths and your level of intellectual capacity. It helps the Admissions Committee to gain a better understanding of you as a person and as a prospective student. It provides evidence of achievement that may not be reflected in other parts of your application and it presents the professional and life events that have influenced your academic trajectory, professional work, and/or your decision to return to school.         R\u00e9sum\u00e9   Reviewing your r\u00e9sum\u00e9 allows the Admissions Committee to better understand how the professional, personal, and volunteer experiences in which you have participated have shaped you as a person and as a prospective student. The accomplishments and responsibilities highlighted in your r\u00e9sum\u00e9 also serve as an invaluable demonstration of your motivation, maturity, and focus.   Official Transcripts   If you have previously studied at the college level, we require an official transcript from each college or university that you have attended. The Office of Admissions can review your application if you provide unofficial copies of your transcripts. However, if you are admitted, you must submit all official documents within your first semester of study. A transcript is considered &quot;official&quot; only when received by the Office of Admissions in a sealed envelope. If you are admitted you may also be required to submit an official high school transcript.                  International Students   International applicants greatly enrich our community and are encouraged to apply. Additional criteria for international students include:   Evaluation of Foreign Educational Credentials   If requested by the Office of Admissions, each foreign transcript must also be evaluated for equivalency to the U.S. educational system for admission and transfer credit purposes. Evaluations are acceptable only from evaluation services recognized by the National Association of Credential Evaluation Services . Please request a course-by-course evaluation.           Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) Scores   TOEFL scores are required for applicants who did not complete their education in the United States or in a country where the only primary language is English.             Minimum scores are 100 on the Internet-based test, 250 on the computer-based test, or 600 on the paper-based test.   IELTS can be submitted in place of the TOEFL; the recommended minimum score is a 7.0.               English Language Assessment   In addition to taking the TOEFL and regardless of their TOEFL score, international applicants are required to participate in an English language assessment consisting of an online test and an interview administered by the NYU School of Professional Studies American Language Institute (ALI). Participation in this assessment will result in the determination of your English Proficiency Level (EPL), which will be reported to the Office of Admissions. International applicants must have submitted an application in order to register for the English language assessment; the fee to register for the assessment is $150.     Based upon your score on the ALI Placement Test, one of four possible outcomes will occur:     You will satisfy the NYU School of Professional Studies English Proficiency Level requirement and will qualify to register for full-time degree study.   You will be conditionally admitted and you will be permitted to enroll in part-time degree coursework as you complete the required ALI English language support courses.   You will be conditionally admitted and you will be required to take English language courses with ALI full-time (for up to one full year) until you are fluent enough to begin degree study.   You will not meet the minimum EPL or the School's other admissions criteria and you will be required to reapply at a later date.     Please review the ALI Online Test Procedures for information on how to register for the test.                Please Note : The NYU School of Professional Studies reserves the right to request a TOEFL, IELTS, or English language assessment conducted by ALI from a U.S. citizen or permanent resident if their primary language is not English.

Applicants to NYU academic year study away programs are generally registered as full-time students at an accredited US college or university. All applicants are encouraged to include two different choices of locations for study and every attempt will be made to match students with one of their top two locations. Students who participate in study away programs have completed their freshman year of study (two full semesters) and have reached the age of 18 prior to the beginning of the term away. Students admitted to the program have earned a GPA of at least 3.0 or higher. Students who have completed at least one year of college but are not presently enrolled in a college or university or have already graduated are also eligible to apply; however, priority is given to students currently matriculated.   Students with disabilities who are requesting accommodations at NYU Global academic centers must contact the Moses Center for Students with Disabilities to discuss reasonable accommodations. Students are encouraged to contact the Moses Center for Students with Disabilities prior to choosing a location and should register with the Moses Center as soon as they receive notification of their admission to enroll. Information for students with disabilities who are requesting accommodations at an NYU academic center can be found on the Moses Center website.                  Eligibility &amp; Requirements   All students interested in applying to study at an NYU Global Academic Center must complete the online application which includes an agreement to the NYU Study Away Standard . All applicants are encouraged to include two different choices of locations for study and every attempt will be made to match students with one of their top two locations.     Eligible student types include:                                                        NYU Students - students currently enrolled in an undergraduate program at NYU                               NYU students need to fill out the online application, which includes a personal statement. Students applying to NYU Paris may also be required to submit the Language Background Form available for download within the online application.   Admissions Requirements   An integrated review of a student\u2019s academic background and University records is required to confirm admission to any NYU Global Academic Center. Initial acceptance to study away through NYU is granted conditionally until all of the following stipulations are met:   Academic Success &amp; Review of University Records   Please be aware that admission to any of the NYU Global study away sites is contingent upon the applicant\u2019s continued academic success and a review of his or her University records. Should a student\u2019s admission be revoked as a result of this review, New York University is not responsible for refunding any expenses incurred in preparation for the intended semester of study.   Students who apply to study away during their first semester in a new NYU school (internal transfers and LS transitioning students) should acknowledge the University policy that requires students to spend their first semester on campus in New York. Exceptions to that policy are granted on a case by case basis.   Discipline Statement   Given their unique nature, membership in a global campus community requires mutual respect, consideration, and concern for the well-being of others as well as a significant degree of personal integrity and maturity. Students whose prior behavior has been determined through the University student conduct process to have been disruptive to the University community and/or antithetical to these qualities may be precluded from participation in the study away experience. Accordingly, please be advised that information concerning student conduct actions is made available to the New York University Global Academic Centers and may be taken into consideration in the process of reviewing a student\u2019s application to participate. Students who have been placed on University disciplinary probation or on deferred suspension from University housing are ineligible to participate in study away during the period of their probation and/or deferred status. Students who have been suspended, withdrawn, or dismissed from the University and those who have been dismissed or suspended from University housing are permanently ineligible to enroll at the Global Academic Centers.   University Leave Policy   Students who have been on leave from the University must return to the New York City campus and successfully complete one academic semester (fall or spring) of full-time course work before enrolling at a Global Academic Center.
