Founded by Ai-jen in 2010, NDWA is the leading organization working to build power, respect, and fair labor standards for the 2.5 million nannies, housekeepers, and elderly caregivers in the U.S. She began organizing immigrant women workers in 1996 as an organizer at CAAAV Organizing Asian Communities in New York City, and in 2000, she co-founded Domestic Workers United (DWU), a city-wide organization of domestic workers. DWU led the way to the passage of the nation\u2019s first Domestic Workers Bill of Rights in 2010.   Realizing that the rapid aging of America \u2014 what she calls the Elder Boom \u2014 would require all of us to take action on care issues, Ai-jen helped launch Caring Across Generations in 2011. A movement to unite all caregivers and those they care for to create the systems and supports that allow all of us to live and age with dignity and independence, Caring Across Generations now counts more than 200 partners in their work to build the Caring Majority and support the Care Force.

Other fellowships include the Alston Bannerman Fellowship for Organizers of Color, the Twink Frey Visiting Scholar Fellowship at University of Michigan Center for the Education of Women, and the Prime Movers Fellowship. In 2010, Feminist Press recognized her in their \"40 Under 40\" awards. In honor of the 100th Anniversary of International Women's Day, Ai-jen was recognized by Women Deliver as one of 100 women internationally who are \"delivering\" for other women.
