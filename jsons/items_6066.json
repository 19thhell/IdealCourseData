The mission of the division is to advance the field by developing and testing noninvasive interventions that improve overall health, reduce symptom specific problems, promote long-term health, prevent disease and improve quality of life.   Dr. Joyce K. Anastasi, founding director, and Dr. Bernadette Capili, associate director, have long been involved in symptom management especially distressing, chronic symptoms largely associated with gastrointestinal, neurological and immunological conditions which often affect quality of life. These investigators were one of the first teams in the country to develop and incorporate a subspecialty curriculum in integrative therapies into a graduate nursing education program. They have designed and implemented two training programs for graduate and undergraduate nursing education on alternative systems of medicine and herbs/supplements focusing on safety, evidence, and common uses among individuals which chronic illnesses for symptom management. The division publishes a newsletter on herbs, nutraceuticals and dietary supplements for clinicians, faculty and students. In addition, a seminar series offers informal presentations of interest to nursing students, public health professionals and academic researchers and provides opportunities to discuss a variety of topics.

The mission of the division is to advance the field by developing and testing noninvasive interventions that improve overall health, reduce symptom specific problems, promote long-term health, prevent disease and improve quality of life.   Dr. Joyce K. Anastasi, founding director, and Dr. Bernadette Capili, associate director, have long been involved in symptom management especially distressing, chronic symptoms largely associated with gastrointestinal, neurological and immunological conditions which often affect quality of life. These investigators were one of the first teams in the country to develop and incorporate a subspecialty curriculum in integrative therapies into a graduate nursing education program. They have designed and implemented two training programs for graduate and undergraduate nursing education on alternative systems of medicine and herbs/supplements focusing on safety, evidence, and common uses among individuals which chronic illnesses for symptom management. The division publishes a newsletter on herbs, nutraceuticals and dietary supplements for clinicians, faculty and students. In addition, a seminar series offers informal presentations of interest to nursing students, public health professionals and academic researchers and provides opportunities to discuss a variety of topics.

Students analyze the impact of such illnesses and symptoms on family, community, and health care systems, including the availability of resources and barriers to resources. A focus is the leadership role of nurses in palliative care as it relates to symptom management, including the analysis and development of health care policies, protocols, standards of care, and evidence-based practice. Students critique clinical and research literature and available electronic information to support evidence-based practice.
