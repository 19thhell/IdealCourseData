What is the Capstone Program? Who comprises a Capstone Team?   Capstone is learning in action. Part of the core curriculum of the Masters program at NYU Wagner, it provides students with both a critical learning experience and an opportunity to perform a public service. Over the course of an academic year, students work in teams\u00a0\u2013\u00a0either to address challenges and identify opportunities for a client organization or to conduct research on a pressing social question. Ultimately, Capstone contributes not only to the students' education, but also to the public good.   Capstone teams are comprised of three to five NYU Wagner graduate students completing the last two semesters of their Master of Public Administration degree or their Master of Urban Planning degree. Students come to NYU Wagner with a wide variety of professional and educational backgrounds: They are seasoned professionals with years of public service behind them, recent college graduates committed to bettering the future or mid-career professionals who want to advance or shift their career paths. Yet for all their differences, they are united by the common desire to acquire the skills necessary to transform their personal commitment into public leadership.     What is the program timeline?\u00a0   March 2015: RFP process begins. All agencies interested in a Capstone project must submit a Capstone proposal online by June 12, 2015.   June 12, 2015: Deadline for proposal submission.   June 2015: Proposals are vetted and distributed to Capstone faculty for review.   June-August 2015: Faculty may reach out to prospective clients for clarification on the scope of projects and then select projects that will be presented to their classes.   Mid-August 2015: Prospective clients are notified if their proposals have been chosen to move on to the next phase of the selection process.   September 2015: Capstone projects are presented to students in their classes, and the students choose which projects they are interested in working on. Clients are notified whether their projects have been chosen or not.   October 2015: Breakfast meeting for all Capstone clients.   May 2016: Capstone projects conclude.   May 10,\u00a02016: Capstone Expo.      What types of projects have been done in the past?   Click here to review a sampling of past Capstone Projects.     How does my organization apply for a Capstone Team?   You must complete and submit a project proposal for consideration. Proposals for the 2015-2016 academic year must be submitted online through the electronic application .\u00a0     When are the project proposals due?   For the 2015 - 2016 academic year, project proposals are due June 12, 2015.     What can my organization expect from a Capstone Team? What will a Capstone Team expect of my organization?   All teams will develop and negotiate a scope-of-work agreement with their client once their proposal has been selected. Project teams will use their best efforts to perform the services described in the work plan and will inform the client of any potential problems which would change the scope of services. Client agencies agree to provide the assistance and access to information necessary for the Capstone Project team to perform effectively.   Organizations should also read our Mutual Expectations \u00a0document, which explains the roles and expectations of the various project stakeholders\u00a0\u2013\u00a0clients, students, faculty, and NYU Wagner\u00a0\u2013\u00a0that are understood during a Capstone project.     Is there a fee associated with engaging a Capstone Team?   An engagement fee of $5,000 is suggested for chosen projects. NYU Wagner recognizes there will be organizations for which this fee may be prohibitive. In these cases, the fee may be adjusted to reflect the resources available to each agency.   For internationally-based clients, Wagner will consider the provision of accommodations and in-country support\u00a0for a Capstone team in lieu of the engagement fee. Please note that international site visits should take place sometime between December 28, 2015 and January 25, 2016. (While projects are 8-months long, students are only available to travel overseas\u00a0during their winter break).   For domestic clients outside of NYC that require overnight stays to conduct research, Wagner will consider the provision of accommodations in lieu of the engagement fee.     What makes a good Capstone Project?   The best Capstone proposals are important but not urgent; achievable within the academic time frame and with the resources available; provide a clear definition of the problem or issue to be addressed; have a realistic scope; and specify tangible deliverables for the Capstone team to provide. We look for organizations that have been operating for at least three years, have at least three full-time employees, and can offer a mutually beneficial opportunity for the agency and the student team.     What is the project proposal selection process?   Submitted proposals are first vetted for feasibility and fit within Capstone's guidelines and NYU Wagner's learning objectives and curricular areas of focus. Then, approved proposals are distributed to the Capstone faculty for review, who may contact prospective clients for clarification on the scope of projects. The faculty select projects that will be presented to their classes where the students choose which projects they are interested in working on. Clients are then notified whether their projects have been chosen by a Capstone Team.     If my organization applies for a Capstone Team, are we certain to get one?   We receive more proposals than we have student teams. As a result, there is no guarantee that a proposal will be chosen. However, some projects that have not been chosen for Capstone have been downsized and \"chunked\" in order to be converted into internship opportunities for Wagner students.     What is a project liaison? How much time should a project liaison expect to put towards a Capstone Team?   All Capstone clients must designate one person in their agency who will act as the project liaison. Project liaisons are expected to act as the main organizational contact to the Capstone Team and to respond to the Capstone Team as appropriate. The time that a Project Liaison will devote to the project will depend on the size and scope of the Capstone project as agreed to by both the organization and team.     If my project proposal is accepted, what formal Capstone client activities should I know about?   Capstone clients will have the opportunity to attend a Capstone breakfast meeting in October and our Capstone Expo in May. As part of the Capstone Expo, each Capstone Team will be required to write an abstract and create a visual presentation that describes the project's purpose, methodology, key insights and recommendations.\u00a0     Who owns the work produced by the Capstone team?   The final work product is owned by the Capstone client organization. However, NYU Wagner reserves the right to publicly list the organization as a Capstone client, to keep copies of all Capstone teams' final reports for review by the Wagner community, and to include a brief project description in Capstone promotional materials. Furthermore, students will be allowed to use the work produced for their Capstone client in pursuit of their educational or professional careers.     Who do I contact if I have any other questions?   Should you have any additional questions about the Capstone Program, please send an email to wagner.capstone@nyu.edu , or call 212-998-7474.\u00a0                                           Submit a Proposal   We are now accepting proposals for the 2015-2016 academic year.

My organization asked the students to come up with innovative solutions and alternative interventions to specific identified issues. I was able to take the students into the field and show them some of our work and how the project could complement the organization's ongoing work. The students that chose our project are really talented and thoughtful, and I am excited to see their research fully actualized.               The transformative, thoughtful, strategic work your students are doing to implement a new and more sophisticated evaluation and monitoring system for our nonprofit is way beyond our expectations. Each member of the team is brighter and more hard-working than the next.

I hardly have a moment to breathe, most days, but look forward to meetings with our Capstone team since our dialogues are focused, engaging and eye-opening. I trust their work process, intellect and vision. Thank you for allowing us the opportunity to work with such a crackerjack team.

They listened carefully to our needs, were flexible in creating the project design, and delivered a professional product. We will be incorporating the team's insights into our planning.               Public policy schools have increasingly sought to provide students a 'real world' consultative experience by building external research projects into the curriculum.          Congressional Research Service      Read more                         Congressional Research Service, ' 13        Public policy schools have increasingly sought to provide students a 'real world' consultative experience by building external research projects into the curriculum. This experience, often referred to as a 'capstone' project, provides students a chance to work with a public or private organization in need of policy research through a formal contractual agreement. Such research partnerships between academic institutions and the Congressional Research Service (CRS) have proven extremely successful in recent years, providing public policy students with invaluable experience, exposure to working with a federal government agency and to potential employment opportunities, while at the same time generating high quality research that will benefit Congress through the work that CRS performs. Top schools with programs of particular interest have been identified based on these efforts. These include Columbia University, New York University, Princeton, Syracuse, The University of Texas, Texas A&amp;M, George Washington University, Georgetown, and Carnegie-Mellon. These programs are well-established, are of sufficient length for students to accomplish substantive research and analysis on a significant project, are based on a team concept, are guided by hands-on faculty with expertise in the subject areas, and have the full support of the school administration.

We have been trying to do this project for years, and the students were able to facilitate the process in a few months. Kudos and thanks to the Capstone management and to the Wagner School.

Students come to NYU Wagner with a wide variety of professional and educational backgrounds: They are seasoned professionals with years of public service behind them, recent college graduates committed to bettering the future or mid-career professionals who want to advance or shift their career paths. Yet for all their differences, they are united by the common desire to acquire the skills necessary to transform their personal commitment into public leadership.     What is the program timeline?\u00a0   March 2015: RFP process begins. All agencies interested in a Capstone project must submit a Capstone proposal online by June 12, 2015.   June 12, 2015: Deadline for proposal submission.   June 2015: Proposals are vetted and distributed to Capstone faculty for review.   June-August 2015: Faculty may reach out to prospective clients for clarification on the scope of projects and then select projects that will be presented to their classes.   Mid-August 2015: Prospective clients are notified if their proposals have been chosen to move on to the next phase of the selection process.   September 2015: Capstone projects are presented to students in their classes, and the students choose which projects they are interested in working on. Clients are notified whether their projects have been chosen or not.   October 2015: Breakfast meeting for all Capstone clients.   May 2016: Capstone projects conclude.   May 10,\u00a02016: Capstone Expo.      What types of projects have been done in the past?   Click here to review a sampling of past Capstone Projects.     How does my organization apply for a Capstone Team?   You must complete and submit a project proposal for consideration. Proposals for the 2015-2016 academic year must be submitted online through the electronic application .\u00a0     When are the project proposals due?   For the 2015 - 2016 academic year, project proposals are due June 12, 2015.     What can my organization expect from a Capstone Team? What will a Capstone Team expect of my organization?   All teams will develop and negotiate a scope-of-work agreement with their client once their proposal has been selected. Project teams will use their best efforts to perform the services described in the work plan and will inform the client of any potential problems which would change the scope of services. Client agencies agree to provide the assistance and access to information necessary for the Capstone Project team to perform effectively.   Organizations should also read our Mutual Expectations \u00a0document, which explains the roles and expectations of the various project stakeholders\u00a0\u2013\u00a0clients, students, faculty, and NYU Wagner\u00a0\u2013\u00a0that are understood during a Capstone project.     Is there a fee associated with engaging a Capstone Team?   An engagement fee of $5,000 is suggested for chosen projects. NYU Wagner recognizes there will be organizations for which this fee may be prohibitive. In these cases, the fee may be adjusted to reflect the resources available to each agency.   For internationally-based clients, Wagner will consider the provision of accommodations and in-country support\u00a0for a Capstone team in lieu of the engagement fee. Please note that international site visits should take place sometime between December 28, 2015 and January 25, 2016. (While projects are 8-months long, students are only available to travel overseas\u00a0during their winter break).   For domestic clients outside of NYC that require overnight stays to conduct research, Wagner will consider the provision of accommodations in lieu of the engagement fee.     What makes a good Capstone Project?   The best Capstone proposals are important but not urgent; achievable within the academic time frame and with the resources available; provide a clear definition of the problem or issue to be addressed; have a realistic scope; and specify tangible deliverables for the Capstone team to provide. We look for organizations that have been operating for at least three years, have at least three full-time employees, and can offer a mutually beneficial opportunity for the agency and the student team.     What is the project proposal selection process?   Submitted proposals are first vetted for feasibility and fit within Capstone's guidelines and NYU Wagner's learning objectives and curricular areas of focus. Then, approved proposals are distributed to the Capstone faculty for review, who may contact prospective clients for clarification on the scope of projects. The faculty select projects that will be presented to their classes where the students choose which projects they are interested in working on. Clients are then notified whether their projects have been chosen by a Capstone Team.     If my organization applies for a Capstone Team, are we certain to get one?   We receive more proposals than we have student teams. As a result, there is no guarantee that a proposal will be chosen. However, some projects that have not been chosen for Capstone have been downsized and \"chunked\" in order to be converted into internship opportunities for Wagner students.     What is a project liaison? How much time should a project liaison expect to put towards a Capstone Team?   All Capstone clients must designate one person in their agency who will act as the project liaison. Project liaisons are expected to act as the main organizational contact to the Capstone Team and to respond to the Capstone Team as appropriate. The time that a Project Liaison will devote to the project will depend on the size and scope of the Capstone project as agreed to by both the organization and team.     If my project proposal is accepted, what formal Capstone client activities should I know about?   Capstone clients will have the opportunity to attend a Capstone breakfast meeting in October and our Capstone Expo in May. As part of the Capstone Expo, each Capstone Team will be required to write an abstract and create a visual presentation that describes the project's purpose, methodology, key insights and recommendations.\u00a0     Who owns the work produced by the Capstone team?   The final work product is owned by the Capstone client organization. However, NYU Wagner reserves the right to publicly list the organization as a Capstone client, to keep copies of all Capstone teams' final reports for review by the Wagner community, and to include a brief project description in Capstone promotional materials. Furthermore, students will be allowed to use the work produced for their Capstone client in pursuit of their educational or professional careers.     Who do I contact if I have any other questions?   Should you have any additional questions about the Capstone Program, please send an email to wagner.capstone@nyu.edu , or call 212-998-7474.\u00a0                                           Submit a Proposal   We are now accepting proposals for the 2015-2016 academic year.

My organization asked the students to come up with innovative solutions and alternative interventions to specific identified issues. I was able to take the students into the field and show them some of our work and how the project could complement the organization's ongoing work. The students that chose our project are really talented and thoughtful, and I am excited to see their research fully actualized.

Public policy schools have increasingly sought to provide students a 'real world' consultative experience by building external research projects into the curriculum.          Congressional Research Service      Read more                         Congressional Research Service, ' 13        Public policy schools have increasingly sought to provide students a 'real world' consultative experience by building external research projects into the curriculum. This experience, often referred to as a 'capstone' project, provides students a chance to work with a public or private organization in need of policy research through a formal contractual agreement. Such research partnerships between academic institutions and the Congressional Research Service (CRS) have proven extremely successful in recent years, providing public policy students with invaluable experience, exposure to working with a federal government agency and to potential employment opportunities, while at the same time generating high quality research that will benefit Congress through the work that CRS performs. Top schools with programs of particular interest have been identified based on these efforts. These include Columbia University, New York University, Princeton, Syracuse, The University of Texas, Texas A&amp;M, George Washington University, Georgetown, and Carnegie-Mellon. These programs are well-established, are of sufficient length for students to accomplish substantive research and analysis on a significant project, are based on a team concept, are guided by hands-on faculty with expertise in the subject areas, and have the full support of the school administration.

What is the Capstone Program? Who comprises a Capstone Team?   Capstone is learning in action. Part of the core curriculum of the Masters program at NYU Wagner, it provides students with both a critical learning experience and an opportunity to perform a public service. Over the course of an academic year, students work in teams\u00a0\u2013\u00a0either to address challenges and identify opportunities for a client organization or to conduct research on a pressing social question. Ultimately, Capstone contributes not only to the students' education, but also to the public good.   Capstone teams are comprised of three to five NYU Wagner graduate students completing the last two semesters of their Master of Public Administration degree or their Master of Urban Planning degree. Students come to NYU Wagner with a wide variety of professional and educational backgrounds: They are seasoned professionals with years of public service behind them, recent college graduates committed to bettering the future or mid-career professionals who want to advance or shift their career paths. Yet for all their differences, they are united by the common desire to acquire the skills necessary to transform their personal commitment into public leadership.     What is the program timeline?\u00a0   March 2015: RFP process begins. All agencies interested in a Capstone project must submit a Capstone proposal online by June 12, 2015.   June 12, 2015: Deadline for proposal submission.   June 2015: Proposals are vetted and distributed to Capstone faculty for review.   June-August 2015: Faculty may reach out to prospective clients for clarification on the scope of projects and then select projects that will be presented to their classes.   Mid-August 2015: Prospective clients are notified if their proposals have been chosen to move on to the next phase of the selection process.   September 2015: Capstone projects are presented to students in their classes, and the students choose which projects they are interested in working on. Clients are notified whether their projects have been chosen or not.   October 2015: Breakfast meeting for all Capstone clients.   May 2016: Capstone projects conclude.   May 10,\u00a02016: Capstone Expo.      What types of projects have been done in the past?   Click here to review a sampling of past Capstone Projects.     How does my organization apply for a Capstone Team?   You must complete and submit a project proposal for consideration. Proposals for the 2015-2016 academic year must be submitted online through the electronic application .\u00a0     When are the project proposals due?   For the 2015 - 2016 academic year, project proposals are due June 12, 2015.     What can my organization expect from a Capstone Team? What will a Capstone Team expect of my organization?   All teams will develop and negotiate a scope-of-work agreement with their client once their proposal has been selected. Project teams will use their best efforts to perform the services described in the work plan and will inform the client of any potential problems which would change the scope of services. Client agencies agree to provide the assistance and access to information necessary for the Capstone Project team to perform effectively.   Organizations should also read our Mutual Expectations \u00a0document, which explains the roles and expectations of the various project stakeholders\u00a0\u2013\u00a0clients, students, faculty, and NYU Wagner\u00a0\u2013\u00a0that are understood during a Capstone project.     Is there a fee associated with engaging a Capstone Team?   An engagement fee of $5,000 is suggested for chosen projects. NYU Wagner recognizes there will be organizations for which this fee may be prohibitive. In these cases, the fee may be adjusted to reflect the resources available to each agency.   For internationally-based clients, Wagner will consider the provision of accommodations and in-country support\u00a0for a Capstone team in lieu of the engagement fee. Please note that international site visits should take place sometime between December 28, 2015 and January 25, 2016. (While projects are 8-months long, students are only available to travel overseas\u00a0during their winter break).   For domestic clients outside of NYC that require overnight stays to conduct research, Wagner will consider the provision of accommodations in lieu of the engagement fee.     What makes a good Capstone Project?   The best Capstone proposals are important but not urgent; achievable within the academic time frame and with the resources available; provide a clear definition of the problem or issue to be addressed; have a realistic scope; and specify tangible deliverables for the Capstone team to provide. We look for organizations that have been operating for at least three years, have at least three full-time employees, and can offer a mutually beneficial opportunity for the agency and the student team.     What is the project proposal selection process?   Submitted proposals are first vetted for feasibility and fit within Capstone's guidelines and NYU Wagner's learning objectives and curricular areas of focus. Then, approved proposals are distributed to the Capstone faculty for review, who may contact prospective clients for clarification on the scope of projects. The faculty select projects that will be presented to their classes where the students choose which projects they are interested in working on. Clients are then notified whether their projects have been chosen by a Capstone Team.     If my organization applies for a Capstone Team, are we certain to get one?   We receive more proposals than we have student teams. As a result, there is no guarantee that a proposal will be chosen. However, some projects that have not been chosen for Capstone have been downsized and \"chunked\" in order to be converted into internship opportunities for Wagner students.     What is a project liaison? How much time should a project liaison expect to put towards a Capstone Team?   All Capstone clients must designate one person in their agency who will act as the project liaison. Project liaisons are expected to act as the main organizational contact to the Capstone Team and to respond to the Capstone Team as appropriate. The time that a Project Liaison will devote to the project will depend on the size and scope of the Capstone project as agreed to by both the organization and team.     If my project proposal is accepted, what formal Capstone client activities should I know about?   Capstone clients will have the opportunity to attend a Capstone breakfast meeting in October and our Capstone Expo in May. As part of the Capstone Expo, each Capstone Team will be required to write an abstract and create a visual presentation that describes the project's purpose, methodology, key insights and recommendations.\u00a0     Who owns the work produced by the Capstone team?   The final work product is owned by the Capstone client organization. However, NYU Wagner reserves the right to publicly list the organization as a Capstone client, to keep copies of all Capstone teams' final reports for review by the Wagner community, and to include a brief project description in Capstone promotional materials. Furthermore, students will be allowed to use the work produced for their Capstone client in pursuit of their educational or professional careers.     Who do I contact if I have any other questions?   Should you have any additional questions about the Capstone Program, please send an email to wagner.capstone@nyu.edu , or call 212-998-7474.\u00a0                                           Submit a Proposal   We are now accepting proposals for the 2015-2016 academic year.

My organization asked the students to come up with innovative solutions and alternative interventions to specific identified issues. I was able to take the students into the field and show them some of our work and how the project could complement the organization's ongoing work. The students that chose our project are really talented and thoughtful, and I am excited to see their research fully actualized.               The transformative, thoughtful, strategic work your students are doing to implement a new and more sophisticated evaluation and monitoring system for our nonprofit is way beyond our expectations. Each member of the team is brighter and more hard-working than the next.

I hardly have a moment to breathe, most days, but look forward to meetings with our Capstone team since our dialogues are focused, engaging and eye-opening. I trust their work process, intellect and vision. Thank you for allowing us the opportunity to work with such a crackerjack team.               In our process of envisioning new opportunities for knowledge sharing that could help to strengthen the school reform community in New York City and nationally, our Capstone team's research was an invaluable resource.

They listened carefully to our needs, were flexible in creating the project design, and delivered a professional product. We will be incorporating the team's insights into our planning.               Public policy schools have increasingly sought to provide students a 'real world' consultative experience by building external research projects into the curriculum.          Congressional Research Service      Read more                         Congressional Research Service, ' 13        Public policy schools have increasingly sought to provide students a 'real world' consultative experience by building external research projects into the curriculum. This experience, often referred to as a 'capstone' project, provides students a chance to work with a public or private organization in need of policy research through a formal contractual agreement. Such research partnerships between academic institutions and the Congressional Research Service (CRS) have proven extremely successful in recent years, providing public policy students with invaluable experience, exposure to working with a federal government agency and to potential employment opportunities, while at the same time generating high quality research that will benefit Congress through the work that CRS performs. Top schools with programs of particular interest have been identified based on these efforts. These include Columbia University, New York University, Princeton, Syracuse, The University of Texas, Texas A&amp;M, George Washington University, Georgetown, and Carnegie-Mellon. These programs are well-established, are of sufficient length for students to accomplish substantive research and analysis on a significant project, are based on a team concept, are guided by hands-on faculty with expertise in the subject areas, and have the full support of the school administration.

We have been trying to do this project for years, and the students were able to facilitate the process in a few months. Kudos and thanks to the Capstone management and to the Wagner School.               As a former student, I found the Capstone project to be one of the highlights of the Wagner program both personally and professionally.

Wagner students recently completed a research study in Cameroon investigating the knowledge and practices of fever treatment, which we are using to inform our malaria education and communication efforts in the country. The students\u2019 dedication to the project not only made for a good working experience, but also ensured the quality of their work.

For more information on NYU's telephone service, please visit www.nyu.edu/servicelink/041214313233571 .   If you receive harassing telephone calls, notify your RA, GA, or Resident Hall manager at once. Residents in 240 Mercer Street and D'Agostino Hall should notify the Law School Office of Residential Life (1-212-998-6510.) NYU Residential Life and Housing Services and NYU Public Safety will be alerted. Public Safety will investigate the complaint. NYU Residential Life and Housing Services, in cooperation with Public Safety, will advise ITS Communications &amp; Computing Services to take appropriate action.       Faculty, Administrators, and Staff   The NYU telephone system supports the business and academic calls of University faculty, administrators, and staff.   In order to make long distance calls from a University telephone, an authorization code is necessary. Each University employee (i.e., client) is eligible to receive an individual authorization code if a budget officer, acting under the authority of a Dean or Vice President, accepts account responsibility for the charges associated with its use. Further information is available at www.nyu.edu/servicelink/041213517191762 .   The University does not permit calls to the 900 area code or to the 976 exchange.

Understanding of Proposal Guidelines   Agree to guidelines *      I have read and understood the Capstone proposal guidelines in full, including all of the frequently asked questions and mutual expectations , and agree to abide them.            III. Proposal Abstract (50-75 words)   Describe the key points of your proposal. *          IV. Organizational Description (1,000 words)   Please describe your organization or unit, including mission, scope of work, key program activities, target population, and number of years in operation. (For Capstone projects, we look for organizations that have been operating for at least three years, have at least three full-time employees, and can offer a mutually beneficial opportunity for the agency and the student team.)        Organizational Description *          V. Capstone Project Overview   Describe the scope of the project for which you would like a Capstone Project Team to focus. (The best Capstone proposals are important but not urgent; achievable within the academic timeframe and with the resources available; provide a clear definition of the problem or issue to be addressed; have a realistic scope; and specify tangible deliverables for the Capstone team to provide.)       \u00a0        Please provide a brief overview of the issue or problem. (500 word limit) *          Why is this issue of particular relevance to your organization? What are the implications of this issue or problem for your agency? (500 word limit) *          Please describe potential activities in which the Capstone Team might engage (i.e. conduct a literature review, create and administer a survey, evaluate a program, analyze a dataset, etc.). (500 word limit) *          Please describe specific skills or qualifications that would be helpful for the Capstone Team to have in order to address this problem (i.e. knowledge of specific computer software, language proficiency, program evaluation, etc.) (250 word limit) *          VI. Desired Outcomes (250 words)   Please describe the deliverables that are expected of the Capstone Team at the completion of the project (i.e. survey or evaluation instruments, draft policies and procedures, resource lists, analysis of large datasets, a comprehensive report, recommendations on how to proceed, etc.).       Please describe the deliverables that are expected of the Capstone Team at the completion of the project *          VII. Special Considerations   If applicable, please describe any special considerations that NYU Wagner and/or the Capstone Project Team should be aware.       \u00a0        Can you anticipate obstacles that a Capstone Team might encounter while working on this project (i.e. incomplete data, lack of buy-in for the project, staff turnover, etc.)? (250 word limit) *          Must a significant portion of research and data gathering be done during regular business hours? (Many Wagner students work full-time and may have constraints on their daytime availability). (50 word limit) *          Will the Capstone Team have access to private client data that may present obstacles for progress on the project, and how/when do you plan to have approval for the Capstone team to proceed with gathering information given potential obstacles? (100 word ) *          Will the Capstone Team be required to conduct field research and/or visit multiple locations, other than the primary client site, to complete their project? Where would the team travel? (250 word limit) *          \u00a0        An engagement fee of $5,000 is suggested for chosen projects. NYU Wagner recognizes there will be organizations for which this fee may be prohibitive. In these cases, the fee may be adjusted to reflect the resources available to each agency.\u00a0   For internationally-based clients, Wagner will consider the provision of accommodations and in-country support for a Capstone team in lieu of the engagement fee. Please note that international site visits should take place sometime between December 28, 2013 and January 25, 2014. (While projects are 8-months long, students are only available to travel overseas during their winter break).   For domestic clients outside of NYC that require overnight stays to conduct research, Wagner will consider the provision of accommodations in lieu of the engagement fee.         Do you anticipate any obstacles to supporting the Capstone program in the aforementioned ways? If so, what might your organization offer? (250 word limit) *          QUESTIONS?
