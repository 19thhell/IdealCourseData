Where game designers of every stripe butt heads, share ideas, and break bread together.   PRACTICE is an annual event that takes a close look at the concrete challenges of game design, bridging dialog across industries. Where else can a console developer discuss level design with a tabletop RPG writer? Or an iPhone puzzle creator debate economy balancing with collectable card game designer? Or a professional sports official share secrets with an experimental indie game artist? No other conference brings together such a diverse group of game designers for high-level dialog.         We explore the day-t0-day, nuts and bolts practice of game design \u2013 where the rubber of design ideas and methods meets the road  of meaningful, playable games. Join us for three days of lectures and panels, workshops and discussions, mixed with plenty of  game-playing and socializing.      For extensive videos from past years, check out our archive here.      PRACTICE in the press        The first two years of PRACTICE included an amazing lineup of speakers, from paper game legends like Richard Garfield and Renier Knitizia to videogame's newest stars like  Manveer Heir and Matt Boch.

Three Questions with a Game Designer   Game Center MFA students ask the speakers and panelists three questions about their design process, philopshy and strategies. Check here for more interviews as they come in.   An intimate gathering of top designers    PRACTICE is designed for a high-level exchange of ideas among professional game designers. Game design is a complex multi-threaded discipline, and PRACTICE is a unique opportunity to understand and refine what we do when we design games.    Lectures       Each year PRACTICE features presentations from a variety of expert and accomplished game designers. Speakers focus on design challenges and solutions in a wide range of games, from AAA videogames to collectable card games, to indie experiments to military simulations.   Watch a video of Robert Yang's lecture from PRACTICE 2013. More lectures are on our vimeo page.      Panels       In addition to individual speakers, PRACTICE features panels organized around topics of interest to working game designers. These panels allow speakers to exchange ideas more freely with each other and the attendees.   Open Problem Session       Open Problems is a high-energy &quot;open mic&quot; session in which any conference attendee can present a work or idea in progress for discussion and feedback.

We are concerned with the overall well-being of SSSW doctoral students and with their participation in the social, academic and professional life of the school. We function as a unifying body for all SSSW doctoral cohorts. We also collaborate with doctoral students from other academic departments, within and outside of NYU, especially with PhD students at other schools of social work in the region. Towards the accomplishment of these goals, the DSA serves as a liaison among SSSW faculty, university administrators and students.

GSA invites graduate students to bring feedback about the program, suggest events and come to them for direction and assistance. The GSA also plans several events for the student body throughout the academic year, such as student-to-student forums, student faculty meets, informal networking events for social work students, mentoring programs, coffee workshops, end-of-semester celebrations, career panels, and a graduation party.

SAASH seeks to develop an atmosphere of mutual aid and support among members and, at the same time, promote discussion on how our professional values as social workers are often connected to our positive moral and ethical values as non-theists and humanists. SAASH is also committed to exploring the ways in which the social, political, and historical foundations of the social work profession were, in many ways, influenced by humanist and non-theistic thinking, and how modern practitioners can revisit and reclaim the secular legacy of social work. Finally, SAASH wishes to promote dialogue between social work students and practitioners who identify as atheist, agnostic, and/or Secular Humanist, those who identify as religious or theist, and those who aren\u2019t sure where they stand, in hopes of enriching the intellectual and academic environment here at Silver.
