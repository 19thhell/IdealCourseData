In certain cases, the documentation may need to be retained for three years after submission of the quarterly or annual financial report if required by the sponsor.     NYU Approach     Departments must maintain documentation, including emails, to support charges to a sponsored project that were not previously submitted through New York University (NYU) administrative systems such as:     Personnel Action Submission System (PASS/xPASS)   Maximus Effort Reporting System (ERS)   Journal Entry Management System (JEMS)   AP Workflow   Accounts Payable   Purchasing   See the Technical Systems page for more information about these administrative systems.

In certain cases, the documentation may need to be retained for three years after submission of the quarterly or annual financial report if required by the sponsor.     NYU Approach     Departments must maintain documentation, including emails, to support charges to a sponsored project that were not previously submitted through New York University (NYU) administrative systems such as:     Personnel Action Submission System (PASS/xPASS)   Maximus Effort Reporting System (ERS)   Journal Entry Management System (JEMS)   AP Workflow   Accounts Payable   Purchasing   See the Technical Systems page for more information about these administrative systems.       All Purchasing Card (P-Card) holders must retain documentation for these purchases.                                    Handbook Table of Contents                      Select an Option...
