The seminar will be held at Vanderbilt Hall\u2019s Greenberg Lounge (first floor), 40 Washington Square South, on Monday, Nov. 3 from 5-6:30 p.m.   Arum and Roksa\u2019s 2011 book, Academically Adrift: Limited Learning on College Campuses, presented the findings of their longitudinal study of undergraduates\u2019 learning, socialization, and study habits. Their new book follows the same undergraduates through the remainder of college and out into the working world.   Built on interviews and surveys of nearly a thousand recent college graduates from a diverse range of colleges and universities, Aspiring Adults Adrift reveals a generation facing a difficult transition to adulthood. While some 20-somethings succeeded in landing jobs in their fields or pursued graduate degrees, more than half struggled to find decent employment, and a third were living with their parents a year after graduation. Despite these challenges, they remained hopeful about their futures. The authors argue that higher education is still worth the cost, but that both universities and students should do more to get the most out of the experience and investment.   Arum will lead the seminar, and will be joined by two respondents: Adam Gamoran, president of the William T. Grant Foundation, and Jennifer Jennings, assistant professor of sociology at NYU.   Reporters interested in attending should contact Rachel Harrison, NYU Office of Public Affairs, at 212.998.6797 or rachel.harrison@nyu.edu. Other attendees must RSVP online . The event is co-sponsored by the Applied Psychology Doctoral Student Colloquium, the Institute of Human Development and Social Change, the Department of Humanities and Social Sciences in the Professions, and the NYU Sociology Department.

Please email our advising team at comm.advisors@nyu.edu for any questions about the transfer/transition process.    The transfer/transition process depends on the student's home school:       Students transferring from within Steinhardt must fill out the transfer application which can be submitted to our offices (due April 1).    Students transferring from another school within NYU must fill out the internal transfer application through NYU's Office of Undergraduate Admissions. Note: Students transitioning from the Liberal Studies program have a separate process; please consult with your home school advisor for more information.    Students transferring from an institution outside of NYU must fill out the external transfer application through NYU's Office of Undergraduate Admissions.       Please note that effective Fall 2014, MCC will only accept transfers, transitions, and change of majors for the Fall semester.    Any student transferring or transitioning to the MCC major from within Steinhardt or elsewhere at NYU must have completed at least one MCC core course * before applying to transfer/transition, receiving a grade of B- or better. The Department also recommends that such students have at least a B- (2.7) cumulative grade point average. Effective Fall 2013, students entering the Media, Culture, and Communication major may not study abroad in their first semester. This allows new majors to participate in orientation and advisement activities organized by MCC's advising team.    *MCC has three core courses as of Fall 2015. Majors must take all three; minors take any two. Effective Fall 2014, any student taking an MCC core course (MCC-UE 001, 003, or 014) must earn a B- or better to use that course toward the major or the minor. (Note: Core courses taken before Fall 2014 are exempt from this grade requirement.) If a student receives a grade lower than a B-, that student may retake the course to improve the grade, but only one retaken course is allowed. Additionally, students may only retake a course once. This means that students receiving below a B- in two or more core courses (even if taken in the same semester) will have to explore with their advisor other options for majoring at NYU.    Students entering the MCC major in or after Fall 2015 must complete the MCC core by the end of their first semester as a junior. This new deadline for completing the core encourages external transfers who are early in their college careers, and it encourages transfers/transitions from Steinhardt and elsewhere in NYU who have already had successful experiences in the MCC core. The new deadline also ensures that all majors will have completed the MCC core prior to enrolling in a senior seminar.

The seminar will be held at Vanderbilt Hall\u2019s Greenberg Lounge (first floor), 40 Washington Square South, on Monday, Nov. 3 from 5-6:30 p.m.   Arum and Roksa\u2019s 2011 book, Academically Adrift: Limited Learning on College Campuses, presented the findings of their longitudinal study of undergraduates\u2019 learning, socialization, and study habits. Their new book follows the same undergraduates through the remainder of college and out into the working world.   Built on interviews and surveys of nearly a thousand recent college graduates from a diverse range of colleges and universities, Aspiring Adults Adrift reveals a generation facing a difficult transition to adulthood. While some 20-somethings succeeded in landing jobs in their fields or pursued graduate degrees, more than half struggled to find decent employment, and a third were living with their parents a year after graduation. Despite these challenges, they remained hopeful about their futures. The authors argue that higher education is still worth the cost, but that both universities and students should do more to get the most out of the experience and investment.   Arum will lead the seminar, and will be joined by two respondents: Adam Gamoran, president of the William T. Grant Foundation, and Jennifer Jennings, assistant professor of sociology at NYU.   Reporters interested in attending should contact Rachel Harrison, NYU Office of Public Affairs, at 212.998.6797 or rachel.harrison@nyu.edu. Other attendees must RSVP online . The event is co-sponsored by the Applied Psychology Doctoral Student Colloquium, the Institute of Human Development and Social Change, the Department of Humanities and Social Sciences in the Professions, and the NYU Sociology Department.

Please email our advising team at comm.advisors@nyu.edu for any questions about the transfer/transition process.    The transfer/transition process depends on the student's home school:       Students transferring from within Steinhardt must fill out the transfer application which can be submitted to our offices (due April 1).    Students transferring from another school within NYU must fill out the internal transfer application through NYU's Office of Undergraduate Admissions. Note: Students transitioning from the Liberal Studies program have a separate process; please consult with your home school advisor for more information.    Students transferring from an institution outside of NYU must fill out the external transfer application through NYU's Office of Undergraduate Admissions.       Please note that effective Fall 2014, MCC will only accept transfers, transitions, and change of majors for the Fall semester.    Any student transferring or transitioning to the MCC major from within Steinhardt or elsewhere at NYU must have completed at least one MCC core course * before applying to transfer/transition, receiving a grade of B- or better. The Department also recommends that such students have at least a B- (2.7) cumulative grade point average. Effective Fall 2013, students entering the Media, Culture, and Communication major may not study abroad in their first semester. This allows new majors to participate in orientation and advisement activities organized by MCC's advising team.    *MCC has three core courses as of Fall 2015. Majors must take all three; minors take any two. Effective Fall 2014, any student taking an MCC core course (MCC-UE 001, 003, or 014) must earn a B- or better to use that course toward the major or the minor. (Note: Core courses taken before Fall 2014 are exempt from this grade requirement.) If a student receives a grade lower than a B-, that student may retake the course to improve the grade, but only one retaken course is allowed. Additionally, students may only retake a course once. This means that students receiving below a B- in two or more core courses (even if taken in the same semester) will have to explore with their advisor other options for majoring at NYU.    Students entering the MCC major in or after Fall 2015 must complete the MCC core by the end of their first semester as a junior. This new deadline for completing the core encourages external transfers who are early in their college careers, and it encourages transfers/transitions from Steinhardt and elsewhere in NYU who have already had successful experiences in the MCC core. The new deadline also ensures that all majors will have completed the MCC core prior to enrolling in a senior seminar.

MCC's global media and culture curriculum is grounded in the liberal arts with core courses in theory and analysis. The major is not fashioned as a pre-professional program, although students can supplement their MCC courses with business entertainment or marketing classes at NYU Stern , for example. Juniors and Seniors can intern in the media industry for credit through MCC's internship program. This combination of rigorous academic coursework and industry experience has proven to be exceptional preparation for students' professional success. Students interested in news and reporting often decide to major (or double major) in journalism at the NYU Arthur Carter Journalism Institute , which is not part of the Media, Culture, and Communication program.    What can I do with a degree in Media, Culture, and Communication? The Media, Culture, and Communication program offers students a theoretical background for entry into a wide range of careers and graduate study. Popular industry options include: advertising, marketing, public relations, publishing, entertainment business, market research, and the media tech sector. MCC graduates also pursue advanced degrees in such areas as law, media studies and cultural studies, business, public policy, and journalism.    Where do MCC alumni work and how successful are they in finding jobs? A 2014 survey of recent MCC alumni showed that 95% of responders were either full-time employees or in graduate school. In addition, 73% of responders had accepted offers for full-time employment in the first 3 months after graduation. Our alumni work for companies and organizations such as Viacom, Buzzfeed, Ogilvy &amp; Mather, Simon and Schuster, CBS News, ESPN, NBC Universal, Sony Pictures, The New York Times , Capitol Music Group, the United Nations, the BBC, Nielsen, Conde Nast, among many others. They are enrolled in graduate study at universities across the globe, including Harvard, Columbia, Duke, Brown, Cambridge (UK), McGill (Canada), and Ritsumeikan University (Japan).    How do I apply? Undergraduate admissions at NYU is centrally coordinated. Prospective students should apply online directly through NYU's Office of Undergraduate Admissions .    I've heard that enrolling in the MCC major is competitive. How can I strengthen my application? Acceptance into MCC is coordinated by NYU's central Office of Undergraduate Admissions . MCC faculty and staff are not involved in the selection of undergraduate majors, and cannot comment on the strength of a particular student's application.    Can I transfer into MCC? MCC only accepts transfers in the Fall semester. The transfer/transition process depends on the student's home school:       Students transferring from within Steinhardt must fill out the transfer application which can be submitted to our offices (due April 1).    Students transferring from another school within NYU must fill out the internal transfer application through NYU's Office of Undergraduate Admissions. Note: Students transitioning from the Liberal Studies program have a separate process; please consult with your home school advisor for more information.    Students transferring from an institution outside of NYU must fill out the external transfer application through NYU's Office of Undergraduate Admissions. Please note that enrollment in the MCC major for external transfers is very competitive.       Can I visit the campus and learn more about the major in Media, Culture, and Communication? Yes, NYU offers opportunities for both high school and transfer students to visit the campus and learn more about its academic programs. Students who wish to visit the Department should contact MCC's Associate Director of Academic Affairs Rebecca Blough .    Is there an option to minor in Media, Culture, and Communication? Yes, students can minor in MCC. Another popular option is the cross-school minor in Business of Entertainment, Media, and Technology. More information about both of these options is described here .    Will all of my AP/IB credits transfer? NYU does allow some AP/IB credits to transfer into the program. See Steinhardt's list of approved substitutions .    Can I intern for credit while a student at MCC? Students with Junior and Senior standing can intern for credit . MCC's student media internship program benefits from the Department's close ties to cultural institutions and the NYC media industry.    Is financial aid available? Are there scholarships offered at NYU? Yes, NYU awards financial assistance to many of its students. In addition, NYU offers several scholarships .    What is NYU housing like?
