Fundamentally, cities are about proximity and heterogeneity, which bring both benefits and costs. Bringing large numbers of diverse people together in small spaces means opportunities for exciting and productive interaction on the one hand, but also greater possibilities for conflict, contagion, and congestion on the other. Students in this field will gain a solid understanding of these benefits and costs and how they are related.     The field is divided into two main parts. The first\u2014cities and urban government\u2014provides a foundation in urban growth and development, government and public finance. Why do cities exist in the first place and why do some grow more rapidly than others? How do people and businesses sort themselves within urban areas? What drives these decisions and what are their consequences? How does the fragmented structure of American local government contribute to residential sorting? What has research taught us about urban political dynamics and the role that governmental and nonprofit organizations play in the implementation of policy?   The second part focuses on specific policy areas. We include a broad array of issues, such as racial segregation, infrastructure, transportation, high housing costs, homelessness, crime, health problems, education, economic development and poverty. The areas are tied together by their focus on the spatial aspects of these problems and the policies directed at them. What does theory and research tell us about the ways in which location affects these problems and the ways in which these problems affect location decisions in turn? Students will gain substantial expertise in three of these areas and will be sufficiently familiar with the others so as to understand their many interactions.   Mastery of these areas requires some knowledge of contributions from a variety of disciplines, including political science, economics and sociology. Students will achieve substantial expertise in the urban subfield of one of the core social science disciplines, understand its theories regarding cities and be familiar with the leading empirical research.                                                                                    \u00a9 NYU Wagner   295 Lafayette Street, New York, NY 10012-9604   212.998.7400   Copyright and Fair Use   Contact Us   Sitemap   New York University"}, {"content": "Undergraduate Major in Public Policy | NYU Wagner                                    Jump to navigation                                                              Login &nbsp          Students       Student Applicants               Faculty &amp; Staff             Alumni       Employers                 About      FAQ      Donate      Contact Us                                                                                                                                                                  Faculty &amp; Research Faculty, Visiting Scholars &amp; Practitioners   Faculty Research   Faculty Projects and Initiatives   Seminars at NYU     Centers &amp; Institutes Centers &amp; Institutes Financial Access Initiative   The Furman Center for Real Estate &amp; Urban Policy   Institute for Civil Infrastructure Systems   Institute for Education and Social Policy   John Brademas Center for the Study of Congress   Center for Global Public Service and Social Impact   Research Center for Leadership in Action   Rudin Center for Transportation Policy &amp; Management   Initiatives The Governance Lab   Innovation Labs   M.L.

Wagner Graduate School of Public Service and the College of Arts and Science\u2014will prepare you to play roles in the creation, implementation, and evaluation of policies that address the challenges faced by domestic and global publics in the twenty-first century.\u00a0   Taught by top faculty from multiple disciplines, the major offers a diverse and rigorous curriculum designed to give you the tools and expertise you need to translate your passion into real change. These tools are drawn from diverse disciplines such as economics, political science, law and statistics. Public policy majors gain the capacity to:   think analytically and critically;   understand policy contexts and processes;   conduct and use research;   apply statistical, economic, and other quantitative and qualitative tools of analysis;   develop written, verbal, and interpersonal communication skills; and   understand their civic responsibilities and make ethical judgments.   This is an 11 course major with 6 core courses (quantitative analysis, economics, politics, and ethics and justice), 4 electives and a senior seminar requirement.   The idea underlying the major is that there is a core set of skills and tools that comprise the foundation of the study of public policy. The required courses in the major (coupled with additional electives) are designed to provide you with those skills and tools.   What to Do Now   Please note that the major is open only to current first- and second-year students.   General Advisement Recommendations   First-year students: complete at least the two prerequisite courses in Spring 2015  Second-year students: complete UPADM-GP 101 and UPADM-GP 140 in Spring 2015 (if you have completed the two prerequisite courses)   If you are a second-year student and have not completed the two prerequisite courses already, you should meet with one of the two faculty directors for advisement before Spring 2015 registration begins.\u00a0 All students are welcome to meet with the faculty directors for advisement.   Also, if you have questions, you may find some basic answers in the FAQs .   Looking Ahead   After graduating, Public Policy majors will be prepared for a wide range of jobs in the nonprofit, private and public sectors. Before coming to NYU Wagner for a graduate degree, undergraduate Public Policy majors from around the country worked at foundations, political advocacy organizations, consulting firms, government agencies and international policy institutes.   Some Public Policy majors also consider attending graduate programs in Public administration, international affairs, public health, urban planning or law.

Fundamentally, cities are about proximity and heterogeneity, which bring both benefits and costs. Bringing large numbers of diverse people together in small spaces means opportunities for exciting and productive interaction on the one hand, but also greater possibilities for conflict, contagion, and congestion on the other. Students in this field will gain a solid understanding of these benefits and costs and how they are related.     The field is divided into two main parts. The first\u2014cities and urban government\u2014provides a foundation in urban growth and development, government and public finance. Why do cities exist in the first place and why do some grow more rapidly than others? How do people and businesses sort themselves within urban areas? What drives these decisions and what are their consequences? How does the fragmented structure of American local government contribute to residential sorting? What has research taught us about urban political dynamics and the role that governmental and nonprofit organizations play in the implementation of policy?   The second part focuses on specific policy areas. We include a broad array of issues, such as racial segregation, infrastructure, transportation, high housing costs, homelessness, crime, health problems, education, economic development and poverty. The areas are tied together by their focus on the spatial aspects of these problems and the policies directed at them. What does theory and research tell us about the ways in which location affects these problems and the ways in which these problems affect location decisions in turn? Students will gain substantial expertise in three of these areas and will be sufficiently familiar with the others so as to understand their many interactions.   Mastery of these areas requires some knowledge of contributions from a variety of disciplines, including political science, economics and sociology. Students will achieve substantial expertise in the urban subfield of one of the core social science disciplines, understand its theories regarding cities and be familiar with the leading empirical research.                                                                                    \u00a9 NYU Wagner   295 Lafayette Street, New York, NY 10012-9604   212.998.7400   Copyright and Fair Use   Contact Us   Sitemap   New York University"}, {"content": "Undergraduate Major in Public Policy | NYU Wagner                                    Jump to navigation                                                              Login &nbsp          Students       Student Applicants               Faculty &amp; Staff             Alumni       Employers                 About      FAQ      Donate      Contact Us                                                                                                                                                                  Faculty &amp; Research Faculty, Visiting Scholars &amp; Practitioners   Faculty Research   Faculty Projects and Initiatives   Seminars at NYU     Centers &amp; Institutes Centers &amp; Institutes Financial Access Initiative   The Furman Center for Real Estate &amp; Urban Policy   Institute for Civil Infrastructure Systems   Institute for Education and Social Policy   John Brademas Center for the Study of Congress   Center for Global Public Service and Social Impact   Research Center for Leadership in Action   Rudin Center for Transportation Policy &amp; Management   Initiatives The Governance Lab   Innovation Labs   M.L.

Wagner Graduate School of Public Service and the College of Arts and Science\u2014will prepare you to play roles in the creation, implementation, and evaluation of policies that address the challenges faced by domestic and global publics in the twenty-first century.\u00a0   Taught by top faculty from multiple disciplines, the major offers a diverse and rigorous curriculum designed to give you the tools and expertise you need to translate your passion into real change. These tools are drawn from diverse disciplines such as economics, political science, law and statistics. Public policy majors gain the capacity to:   think analytically and critically;   understand policy contexts and processes;   conduct and use research;   apply statistical, economic, and other quantitative and qualitative tools of analysis;   develop written, verbal, and interpersonal communication skills; and   understand their civic responsibilities and make ethical judgments.   This is an 11 course major with 6 core courses (quantitative analysis, economics, politics, and ethics and justice), 4 electives and a senior seminar requirement.   The idea underlying the major is that there is a core set of skills and tools that comprise the foundation of the study of public policy. The required courses in the major (coupled with additional electives) are designed to provide you with those skills and tools.   What to Do Now   Please note that the major is open only to current first- and second-year students.   General Advisement Recommendations   First-year students: complete at least the two prerequisite courses in Spring 2015  Second-year students: complete UPADM-GP 101 and UPADM-GP 140 in Spring 2015 (if you have completed the two prerequisite courses)   If you are a second-year student and have not completed the two prerequisite courses already, you should meet with one of the two faculty directors for advisement before Spring 2015 registration begins.\u00a0 All students are welcome to meet with the faculty directors for advisement.   Also, if you have questions, you may find some basic answers in the FAQs .   Looking Ahead   After graduating, Public Policy majors will be prepared for a wide range of jobs in the nonprofit, private and public sectors. Before coming to NYU Wagner for a graduate degree, undergraduate Public Policy majors from around the country worked at foundations, political advocacy organizations, consulting firms, government agencies and international policy institutes.   Some Public Policy majors also consider attending graduate programs in Public administration, international affairs, public health, urban planning or law.
