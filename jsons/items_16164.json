It is also a method of thinking characterized by its   attention to the contexts in which people live and work. Students of   history enter into an exciting world of debates about how best to   understand past human experience \u2013 cultural, social, economic, and   political \u2013 and the implications of different historical understandings   for the present. Rethinking and revising accepted historical conclusions   is one of the most important and compelling tasks of the historian.    The History major at NYUAD is itself designed to rethink and revise   conventional features of the discipline. Students select from a range of   courses that are roughly commensurate with global human experience.   They also pursue historical study across a range of chronological and   geographical scales \u2013 from short to long dur\u00e9es; and from globally   thematic courses that explore connections and comparisons among world   regions, to regionally focused courses that offer an in-depth   exploration of four long-standing zones of human interaction and   imagination:    Indian Ocean World , which includes not just the   areas and countries bordering the ocean basin but also the areas   corresponding to the historic scope of the Ottoman and Mughal empires,   Persia, parts of Central Asia, Southeast Asia, East Africa, and parts of   the South Pacific.    Asia-Pacific World , which includes areas   corresponding to the historic scope of the Mongol, Qing, and Russian   empires, Northeast Asia, parts of Central and Inner Asia, parts of   Southeast Asia, Australasia, and the Americas.    Atlantic World , which encompasses Europe (including Russia and the USSR), the Americas, West Africa, and the Caribbean.    Mediterranean World , which encompasses all those   areas adjacent to the Mediterranean and contiguous seas, including the   historic scope of the Habsburg, Venetian, and Ottoman empires, parts of   southern and central Europe, North Africa, and the Near East.                  Students wishing to develop regional expertise with regard to the   history of Abu Dhabi and the UAE can do so by taking courses in the   Indian Ocean and Mediterranean World categories; many of these regional   courses also include experiential learning opportunities in the form of   class trips.      All History majors develop a foundation of knowledge that is both   genuinely globally comparative and genuinely regionally grounded. They   also acquire the theoretical and methodological tools necessary to   undertake their own historical research, using primary documents, in   ways that meet the highest intellectual standards. They learn to find,   analyze, and interpret many different kinds of evidence; to organize it   into a coherent whole; and to present it clearly in written or oral   form. Having mastered historical methods of research and thinking,   majors graduate well prepared for advanced study and teaching in   history, and for the pursuit of many professions including policymaking,   law, medicine, teaching, politics, diplomacy, and business.        History majors are required to take The Theory and   Practice of History (offered every fall semester) and a minimum of seven   elective courses distributed as follows: at least one global thematic   course; at least two courses in two different regional areas (Indian   Ocean, Asia-Pacific, Atlantic, and Mediterranean); at least one course   that primarily covers a period before 1800; and at least one course from   Arts and Humanities Colloquia.         Certain History courses may count towards more than   one regional field within the major, but a single course can only fill   one field. Courses in the Core Curriculum or other concentrations may   also count toward the major if approved by the student\u2019s mentor.        Requirements for the major are 10 courses, distributed as follows:    1 Required Course: Theory and Practice of History  7 Electives: one Global thematic course; two courses in two   different regional areas; one course in a period before 1800; and one   Arts and Humanities Colloquium  Capstone Project Research Seminar (2-semester sequence during   senior year; double majors writing their capstone project in a different   program are required instead to take 2 additional history electives)              All NYUAD History majors develop a foundation of knowledge that is both genuinely globally comparative and genuinely regionally grounded.

                                           History is the study of human experience, considered in relation to particular times and places. It is also a method of thinking characterized by its attention to the contexts in which people have lived and worked. Students of history gain invaluable skills and techniques when they master this method of thinking. They learn to analyze and interpret many different kinds of evidence\u2014cultural, social, economic, and political; to organize it into a coherent whole; and to present it clearly in written or oral form. In the process, students also learn to justify and question their own and others\u2019 conclusions, for history is always an argument about what actually happened. Indeed, rethinking and revising accepted historical conclusions is one of the most important and most interesting tasks of the historian. Faculty and students in history are engaged in the study of a wide range of historical questions, focusing on different time periods and different geographic regions.   The goal of the History major is to provide students with both a foundation of historical knowledge and the tools to undertake their own historical research, using primary documents when possible, in ways that meet the highest intellectual standards.   The major in History prepares students for graduate work, teaching, and for any of the many professions that benefit from analytical thinking and argumentation, including politics, law, medicine, and business, as well as furnishing the wherewithal for lifelong personal enrichment. The NYUAD History major focuses on global history, conceived in terms of four overlapping regions:      Indian Ocean World , which includes not just the areas and countries bordering the ocean basin but also the areas corresponding to the historic scope of the Ottoman and Mughal empires, Persia, parts of Central Asia, Southeast Asia, East Africa, and parts of the South Pacific.       Asia-Pacific World , which includes areas corresponding to the historic scope of the Mongol, Qing, and Russian empires, Northeast Asia, parts of Central and Inner Asia, parts of Southeast Asia, Australasia, and the Americas.       Atlantic World , which encompasses Europe (including Russia and the USSR), the Americas, West Africa, and the Caribbean.       Mediterranean World , which encompasses all those areas adjacent to the Mediterranean and contiguous seas, including the historic scope of the Habsburg, Venetian, and Ottoman empires, parts of southern and central Europe, North Africa, and the Near East.     Certain History courses may be able to count towards more than one regional field within the major. A student who wishes to use a particular course to fulfill a requirement in a field other than the one under which the course is listed may request permission from the mentor. A single course can fulfill only one field.   History majors are required to take The Theory and Practice of History and a minimum of seven elective courses distributed as follows: at least one global thematic course; at least two courses in different regional areas (Indian Ocean, Asia-Pacific, Atlantic, and Mediterranean); at least one course that primarily covers a period before 1800; and at least one course from Arts and Humanities Colloquia. Courses in the Core Curriculum or other concentrations may also count toward the major if approved by the student\u2019s mentor.

This course examines the recent history of the region from the mid-18th century until the Arab uprisings of 2010&ndash;2012. We explore the last Islamic empires, the intrusion of European colonial powers, the modernist, nationalist and Islamic reactions to aggression, the creation of authoritarian systems of power and the multiform protests that have shaken them. The Egyptian, Iranian, Palestinian, and Saudi experiences are examined more closely.

Muslims subsequently developed and expressed their faith in the disciplines of law, theology, and mysticism, even as their religious communities fractured into a variety of Sunni and Shi&rsquo;a groups.

ACS-AD 202 Paradise Lost: Muslims, Christians and Jews in al-Andalus                                                                              From the beginning of the 8th to the beginning of the 17th century, Islam played a crucial role in the history of the Iberian peninsula. Today this period is often portrayed as one of inter-religious harmony, while al-Andalus is simultaneously mourned in contemporary Islamist discourse as a lost paradise. In this course we investigate the rich and complex history of al-Andalus, focusing on the changing relationships between Muslim, Christian, and Jewish communities.

We learn about Arab seafaring and trade in the Indian Ocean and the creation of the &quot;Arabian Seas.&quot; We read the narratives of Arab merchants, such as Suleiman the Merchant and Abu Hassan al-Sirafi who came to China from the Gulf in the 9th and the 10th centuries, and the great travelogue by Abu Abdallah Ibn Battuta, who traveled to China all the way from North Africa in the 14th century. We study the history of the corresponding periods in Chinese history&mdash;the Tang, Song, and Yuan dynasties, and to complement the Arab travelogues, read the narrative of Ma Huan, the Chinese Muslim who sailed from China to Mecca and other cities in the region in the 15th century. The class visits Quanzhou, better known as Zaytoon, a city dominated by Arabs for several centuries, and other port cities in the Yangzi Delta and north in the Grand Canal on the way to Beijing.    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

The syllabus moves from the early encounter between Islam and the Jews at the time of the Prophet Muhammad, discussing the Qur&rsquo;an and other foundational texts, to the legal and actual status of the Jews. We will examine how the famous Cairo Geniza documents illuminate Jewish (and Islamic) life, and how changes in the economy affected developments in Jewish law. The course will also examine the organization and functions of the Jewish community and will address the large question of how much autonomy the Jews actually had. We will also read literary sources showing how deeply influenced the Jews were by Arabic culture. Where relevant, comparisons will be drawn with the situation of the Christian minority in the Islamic world and with that of Jews living in Medieval Latin Europe.

Throughout, we will be focusing on gender, class, ethnic, and religious cleavages. Part I will cover late nineteenth-century religious practices as well as social and gender relations. Part II will explore the role of imperialist powers during the Constitutional Revolution and subsequent politics of oil in the Pahlavi period. Part III will turn to the social, cultural, and economic reasons for the emergence of Islamism. Here we concentrate on the links between Islamist and Leftist intellectual discourses during the 1970s, Khomeini&rsquo;s appropriation of these discourses during the Islamic Revolution, and the Islamist state&rsquo;s consolidation of power during the Iran-Iraq war of the 1980s. Part IV will focus on the process whereby, during the 1990s, many leftist Islamists gravitated towards a human rights discourse and declared themselves Muslim Reformists. Here we will give special attention to debates over democratization and human rights, gender/sexuality, and religious/ethnic diversity.    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

Since the middle ages, however, it has been surpassed by Europe in economic performance. This course explores this reversal in fortune. Was it due to culture, religion, law, geography, agrarian structure, globalization, or state policy? What attempts have been made to catch up with the West? Which have been successful? How has the history of the Near East compared to that of other parts of the world and what light do those comparisons shed on the region&rsquo;s experience?    *Note: Passing the Economics Placement test will stand in place of the prerequiste (ECON-AD 101).

How does it differ from world history? International history? Transnational history? And why has writing global histories become a new intellectual imperative for historians today? This gateway course for the history program provides students with skills to answer these questions. It challenges them to examine when categories like the nation and civilization enhance or inhibit historical understanding, and to consider alternative units of place and space for historical inquiry.

When and where did these, and other pressing environmental concerns, have their origins? What can history teach us about how we might best address these issues in the present? This course offers a comprehensive overview of the world&rsquo;s environmental history with a focus on the period from 1500 C.E. to the present &ndash; a time marked by a dramatic intensification in the use of land, water, and energy resources. The course&rsquo;s central goal is to understand the relationships between globalization, natural resource and energy use, and environmental change, and to explain how these relationships unfolded, and continue to unfold, differently in major world regions, including the Gulf. By incorporating material from the fields of ecology, biology, geology, demography, economics, political science, and anthropology, this course also provides students with important historical grounding in the multidisciplinary field of global environmental studies.

It traces the history of the various protest movements and explores a plethora of national experiences with respect to domestic and transnational networks of dissent as well as global imaginaries. Taking into account the aesthetics and performativity of protest, the course examines the role of cultural practices, action repertoires, the media, visual representations, lifestyle and fashion, the politics of memory, and the impact of dissent on political decision-makers and society at large.

It seeks to answer three fundamental questions: what are the underlying causes of revolution; how and why do revolutions migrate or undergo cultural translation; and to what extent have revolutions become the catalyst for societal (dis/re)organization in modernity. Readings include historical documents as well as theoretical works by Burke, Marx, Lenin, Lukacs, Arendt, Fanon, Debray, and Marcuse.

HIST-AD 118J World War I: A Case Study in the Causes and Consequences of War                                                                   The First World War was the seminal event of the 20th century. It left ten million soldiers and six million civilians dead. Under the strain of war and defeat, Russia, Germany, Austria-Hungary, and the Ottoman Empire collapsed in revolution. Large portions of France lay in ruins and England&rsquo;s wealth shattered. The war set the stage for the disastrous events of the 20th century. In this course we will examine the broad background to the war: the roles of nationalism, colonialism, and militarism, and the consequences of the decline of the Ottoman Empire. We will analyze the immediate responses to the crisis of 1914, the judgments and misjudgments that started the conflict. We will examine war strategies, the costs and futility of its battles. By looking at diaries, letters, and contemporary writings, we will study its human impact. And we will study the larger outcomes of the war: changes in society, the revolutions, the peace settlements and their consequences.    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

HIST-AD 120 World War II in Global Perspective                                             The Second World War was the most destructive in human history and has become a touchstone for historical understanding in the postwar period. This course seeks to examine not only the strategic decisions of major belligerent states (Germany, the Soviet Union, Japan, Britain and the United States), but also the transformative power of the war in societies across the globe. Course topics will include the experience of soldiers and civilians, the mobilization of populations within far-flung empires, the use of new weapons and occupation strategies, and the critical social and political consequences of the war on populations across Europe, Asia, Africa, America and the Middle East.

How, specifically, did Islam spread in relation to the extension and intensification of agriculture and trade? What diverse forms have Islamic ideas, institutions, practices, and subjectivities taken in this expansive world region? What, additionally, is the relationship between Indian Ocean Muslims&rsquo; beliefs and practices and those of the followers of other religions, including Hinduism, Buddhism, and Christianity? This course addresses these questions by engaging with cutting-edge scholarship from the fields of global, Indian Ocean, and Islamic history, as well as a wide variety of primary source materials. Throughout, students also probe the relationship between power and the production of knowledge about Islam.

Situated at the center of the Indian Ocean world, the Indian subcontinent is currently home to over a billion people, and is the site of richly interconnected histories with regions around the wider Indian Ocean, including the Gulf. The course explores these histories, with a focus on understanding major cultural, political, economic, and environmental connections and changes as they affected ordinary people (including migrant laborers) and shaped the nature of collective identities (ethnic, national, religious, caste, class, gender, regional, and linguistic) over time. In developing an understanding of how collective identities were produced historically, students ultimately acquire valuable tools for appraising and navigating competing models of nationalism, cosmopolitanism, and universalism in the wider Indian Ocean world today.

Introduced by merchant activity in the eighth century CE, Islam by the fifteenth century had become the religion of ruling elites throughout much of the western Sudan and along the East African littoral, where it was the foundation for a celebrated urban development. A sustained period of Islamic reform ensued in the western Sudan from the seventeenth through the nineteenth centuries, coterminous with the transatlantic slave trade, whose end arguably stimulated slaving activity across the Sahara and Indian Ocean (activity that long antedates that of the Atlantic). By means of these various trades and other mechanisms, many African Muslims were transported into the Americas as well as the Indian Ocean, and the course will follow their experiences as well as their legacies among African-descended populations, concluding with a consideration of their relationship, as well as that of Africa itself, to developments in the broader Muslim world up to the present day.

We examine the role of food and drugs, especially opium, in Chinese social, cultural, economic, and political history, with an emphasis on the pre-modern period. Topics may include the relationship of health and diet; food in religious and ritual practice, gastronomy, consumption and the material culture of food and drugs, restaurants and catering; famine; imperial dining practices; tobacco smoking; opium smoking, cultivation, and elimination; the Opium Wars; and food, drugs, and identity, including the global association of China with food and with opium.

The goal of the course is to identify the best ways of asking and answering questions about the widespread environmental challenges that are seemingly inherent in China&rsquo;s economic development. Are the challenges new to Chinese history &ndash; particular to modernization &ndash; or are they rooted in long-standing patterns of land use and resource exploitation? How to do we square the history of damage wrought to nature with the equally salient history of &ldquo;Asian&rdquo; notions of &ldquo;living in harmony&rdquo; with nature, exemplified by philosophical Daoism and millennia of poetic and painting traditions extolling the beauty and wonder of nature? Who, moreover, is entitled to do what with and about the environment: what are the roles of the state?; of scientists and engineers?; of humanists? The course doubles as an introduction to the history of China, and to the multidisciplinary field of environmental studies.

This course looks closely at borderlands between China and other sovereign states, and borderlands between upland and lowland peoples in and around the region that some scholars call &ldquo;Zomia,&rdquo; the elevated parts of mainland Southeast Asia that often lie beyond the reach of governments based in lowland population centers. The course readings raise questions about indigeneity, migration, and state-building in what may be the most ethnically diverse part of the world. It tests the heuristic limits of key historical categories like nation, state, and citizenship, and further explores alternative notions of political and cultural community.

Beginning with recordings of oral tradition originating in the early empire of Mali to novels addressing the roles of African colonial intermediaries to music protesting apartheid in South Africa, students will engage with a variety of sources of cultural and artistic nature. The course will focus on historical developments such as the Atlantic and internal slave trades, the process of European colonization, religious practice, decolonization, genocide and migration, urbanization, and AIDS. We will also examine various themes, such as local and imposed notions of race and ethnicity, lived experiences of and Africans&rsquo; responses to colonialism on the continent, issues of gender and class, and political resistance. Our broad goal is to investigate to what extent long-term historical dynamics determine the present. Students will not only watch films, listen to music, and read literature, but also read reflections on the methods of using these sources as a way of studying the history of Africa. Course requirements provide students with a language and historical framework for understanding the dynamic history of the continent.

HIST-AD 163 Ideas into Ideologies: Nineteenth-Century German Ideas and Their Global Legacies                                                        What makes ideas historical? How do ideas travel beyond their originating contexts and become embedded in different temporal, linguistic, and cultural settings, often with vastly unexpected consequences? How do intellectuals feature as cultural agents and producers of ideology in such processes? The course explores these and other issues by following the trajectories of some influential ideas articulated in German letters during the &ldquo;Long Nineteenth Century&rdquo; (1789&ndash;1914) and seeks to explain the diverse European and global legacies they inspired during and after this period. Focusing on the interplay between theory and practice, the course investigates how such ideas changed in the course of their dissemination, appropriation, and re-interpretation, in ways that radically transformed the modern world.

HIST-AD 169 From the &quot;Chilean Road to Socialism&quot; to the Pinochet Era: Chile and the Global Cold War                                                         This course explores some of Latin America&rsquo;s most significant social and political events during the Cold War: the democratic election in 1970 of a Marxist president in Chile, his overthrow by a military coup d&rsquo;&eacute;tat in 1973, and the installation of a military regime led by General Augusto Pinochet that lasted until 1989. During this period, Chile attracted the world&rsquo;s attention for many different reasons. Among them was the experimental nature of its social and political transformations, namely a democratic transition to socialism, as well as the authoritarian implantation of neo-liberal policies.    This course seeks to understand both of these experiments, focusing on their global connections beyond the well-known diplomatic tensions of the Cold War. Along with an analysis of Chile&#39;s social structure, political system, and economic history, this course will highlight the importance of gender roles, subaltern agency, and popular movements. Finally, the course will also address the traumatic dimension of Chile&rsquo;s Cold War experience trough the study of violence, truth, and memory during Pinochet&rsquo;s regime.

It will begin with an overview of the Mongol empire and its legacies in Central Asia and the broader Muslim world. We will compare the emerging post-Mongol Eurasian and Ottoman states through the lenses of law, political legitimacy, succession, and ruling institutions. We will then compare Russian and Ottoman civilizing missions, imperial nationalisms, treatments of sectarianism and ethnic minorities, constitutionalisms, public health policies, responses to Islamic modernism, Marxist and other radical leftist ideas, and women&rsquo;s emancipation. The course will conclude by considering how post-imperial modernization projects transformed identity, gender, and religion in Central Asia and the Middle East.

What picture of the human being emerged with this turn? How did the turn toward the Classics contribute to the development of modern humanism? How was this humanism itself taken up in the Enlightenment and the development of modern education systems, and what remains of humanism today?    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

MDURB-AD 124J Urban Form of Shanghai                                                                   Shanghai has evolved markedly through key stages in the history of urban form, vestiges of which are found within the city today: an old walled \"Chinese city\"; tree-lined boulevards and commercial avenues of 19th and 20th century foreign settlements; and suburban development in Pudong. This class examines each key stage, combining readings with in situ urban inquiry. Readings cover Chinese reflections on the city in general and Shanghai in particular, as well as urban studies classics like Lewis Mumford&rsquo;s The Culture of Cities Trips take students to historically significant cultural spaces, including the old City God Temple, Fuzhou Road Bookshops, alleyway houses, The Peace Hotel, the Great World amusement park, People&rsquo;s Park, the Moganshan Road contemporary art complex, as well as nearby waterway towns that illustrate aspects of Shanghai&rsquo;s history before urbanization.

POLSC-AD 141X Ibn Khaldun and Political Theory                                                                                         Written by the Maghrebian Muslim historian Ibn Khaldun and usually dated around 1377, the Muqaddimah is often described as the founding text of the philosophy of history and the history of civilizations. Its themes include the secular and religious sources of social solidarity, why individuals identify with their group and subordinate their interests to its norms, why they accept the authority of their political leaders, the tensions between nomadic and sedentary or desert and urban societies, organizational and tactical factors in military success, the division of labor and the economic transition from subsistence to surplus, demographic expansion and collapse, luxury and the decay of tribal solidarity in urban conglomerations, and the social conditions of scientific and artistic flourishing. The course involves a close reading of six chapters of the Muqaddimah (on general social theory, the theory of Bedouin society, the theory of political authority, the theory of urban society, the theory of economic development, and the sociology of science) and draws upon Western political and social theorists, such as Adam Smith and Emile Durkheim, for clarification and perspective.

This course surveys (a) the history of the capitalist system from Dutch and British hegemony through the American 20th century, the growth of corporations, various approaches to economic development, and the current opening up of the world to new economic powers, and (b) the related political history of European colonialism, nationalism, postcolonial societies, the Cold War, and the emerging multipolar world of today. It considers the nature of crises and social change, efforts to establish stability in the face of conflicts and disruptions, and possible futures open to the contemporary world.
