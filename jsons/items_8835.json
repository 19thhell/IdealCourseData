SUBCATEGORIES DESCRIPTION   INDEXING TERMS REMARKS CITATIONS         Styles/Periods/Groups/Movements   - Description      DEFINITION A prose description of the salient  characteristics of a work of art in relation to a particular style,  historical period, group, school, or movement.  EXAMPLE \"Vases in the Kerch style take their name from an area on the Black Sea  where numerous examples have been found. The style is characterized by  an elaborate and often flamboyant use of polychromy, gilding, and relief  work to augment the simple red-on-black scheme of earlier Attic vases  ...\" [1]   [Figure 9]  This eclectic style is purely Roman, with  references to works by 4th-century BC Greek sculptors such as Skopas and  Lysippos [Figure 5] . \"The  gardens of Versailles represent the culmination of a development that  started more than a hundred years earlier. The Early Renaissance garden  still retained its medieval character of hortus conclusus . It  was, however, geometrized to express the idea of an ideal nature,  forming thereby a complement to the ideal city of the epoch. During the  sixteenth century, this concept of static perfection was substituted by  the idea of a mysterious and fantastic world consisting of a variety of    'places.' \" [2]  \"In  the early 1870s Manet, at the height of his career, suddenly gave up his  flat style, and adopted both the brilliant palette and the broken  brushwork of the Impressionists. Some of his later pictures are  well-nigh indistinguishable from theirs. But the most memorable of  these, A Bar at the Folies-Berg&egrave;re , painted in 1881-82,  ... is a brilliant restatement -- in Impressionist terms -- of Manet's  interest in the human figure.\" [3]  The erotic theme with half-length figures and rich coloring is  typical of David's history paintings done in Brussels following his  exile from France in 1816. The vivid colors and realistic flesh tones  that were inspired by the art of Rubens combined with Greek-inspired  forms are characteristic of late Neoclassicism   [Figure 6] . \"The evolution of Duccio's style from the   Crevole Madonna to the   Madonna of the Franciscans is most apparent in the heightened  realism of the figures. The strongly geometricized face and the  pattern-like arrangement of hands and striations of the Crevole  Madonna are indebted to Guido da Siena and, perhaps, other artists  of his generation. The Madonna of the Franciscans seems  somewhat more mature. In it one sees for the first time the graceful,  refined Duccio who endows his figures with vibrant personalities...\" [4]  DISCUSSION This category contains  a description of the work of art in terms of the style, period, group,  or movement whose aesthetic it reflects. This description is then broken  out into indexing terms that characterize the work, and to associate it  with other similar works. Stylistic terminology epitomizes a work's  salient characteristics, placing it in the context of other works  created in the same or similar style. It also acts as an aid to the  reader when it is not possible to see the work first hand.   Distinguishing between terms for styles, periods, groups, and movements  is problematic. The terminology used in the field of art history is  sometimes vague and is often the subject of much debate. Even when the  terminology is accepted, definitions may not be shared. For example, Pre-Raphaelite   can be used to refer to a broad range of work, from that created by the  original seven members of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood between  1848 and about 1853, through all those who were influenced by them, or  adopted their characteristic style. Futurism as a movement  differs from   futurist as a general style. Some terms such as Nazca   are also used broadly to define \"stylistical periods,\" i.e., the time  during which a certain style was in broad use or favor. The meaning of a  specific term may also vary over time, making it important to record the  source of the concepts represented by each term, and the source for the  vocabulary itself. [5]    A single term, such as Baroque , can have many meanings; for  example, it may be used broadly to refer to the art of the seventeenth  century in general, or more narrowly to refer specifically to the style  of Pietro da Cortona when seen in opposition with the  seventeenth-century classicism of   Poussin .  Certain broad terms, such as Ancient ,   Medieval , or   Renaissance , have a readily accepted chronological meaning, and  are subdivided into well-known secondary eras: archaic , classical ,   Hellenistic ; Old Kingdom , New Kingdom ; High  Renaissance . The same can be said of certain broad stylistic  designations, such as Byzantine or Baroque , which  encompass styles such as   Theodosian , Comnenian , and Paleologan . While not  defined by specific dates, these terms are familiar enough to be  understood by most advanced students and professionals. The order and  structure offered by such designations makes them useful pedagogical and  communication tools. Some expressions for temporal  periods, such as Napoleon III , also have a stylistic designation  attached to them, in this case Second Empire , but these terms  are rarely synonymous. The time spans referred to by different  styles and periods often overlap, as do   Neoclassical and   Georgian . Other terms, such as Renaissance , can refer to  both a style and a period. The definition and parameters  of certain terms, such as Mannerist ,   Rococo , Neoclassical , and Romantic , and their  applicability to a particular period or style, have been debated. The  meaning of these terms is nebulous, as are their dates and parameters.  These ambiguities open their meaning to a variety of interpretations.  Nevertheless, such terms are commonly used, as they often provide a  useful way to link otherwise diverse or disparate material.    Stylistic or period terms may be based on historical events, and  therefore have a chronological as well as a visual meaning. Period  designations are most often linked to historical eras designated by  rulers or governments. Dynasties are used for China, Japan, and Egypt,  sometimes with subdivisions. Ruling families provide names such as Tudor ,   Stuart , or Ming . There are also periods associated with  the style of art contemporary with the reign of a specific monarch, such  as Louis XIV , Napoleonic ,   Victorian , or Ptolemaic . Often styles or  periods take their names from a technique used in a particular place at  a certain time. Terms such as red figure or black figure   are examples of technically based styles, as is Pointillism .    While tempting, it is not possible to attach a strictly  chronological definition to a stylistic or period term. This is best  illustrated by works that fall on the cusp of such definitions or are  stylistically retardatory. These historically complex examples include  the furniture made for Mme DuBarry's house at Louveciennes ,  which dates to the Louis XVI period but is Louis XV in  style, or the Georgian silver made early in Victoria's   reign. In Chinese art , archaism , or the choice of a  style from an earlier period, can be an aesthetic statement. Works  outside the \"mainstream\" of Western culture, such as provincial work, or  works from geographic areas that are more distant from the historic  centers of artistic production, such as Magna Graecia or Colonial  America , will show stylistic characteristics that may be associated  with an earlier time. Some terms, such as Impressionist,  Post-Impressionist, and   Surrealist, refer only to a style or artistic movement. The  output of such an artistic group may be less visually homogeneous if  the links between its members are primarily philosophical. Often, in the  twentieth century, these designations overlap chronologically, and  therefore cannot be said to define periods. Style and period terms,  therefore, should not be used to sort or order works chronologically.    Styles or periods may also be used to separate the work of a  particular artist into distinct groups, such as Picasso's Rose  Period or Blue Period . These terms are very specific, and  have little relevance beyond the study of that artist's oeuvre. Stylistic similarities also form the basis for the idea of \"school,\"  which has been used, for example, to group related late-nineteenth- and  twentieth-century works under terms such as the School of Paris   or the New York School . \"School\" has also been used more loosely  to refer to a group of artists who exhibited together, such as the Ashcan  School , or to artistic families (some of which continued for  centuries) such as the Kano School in Japan. These terms are  recorded when the object represents the visual characteristics  associated with the work of a particular \"school.\"  Source The identification and analysis of style constitute a significant part  of the art-historical literature. The scholar or cataloger of the object  will be able to draw upon these studies, but will rarely find the work  at hand discussed in detail. It is more likely that terms will be  assigned on the basis of comparison of the object to other known  examples. Associating a specific work with a stylistic term will  continue to be a matter of judgment and open to debate.    USES Style and period terms are used to group similar works  in order to examine the development of an artistic idea. In some  traditions, such as the study of Indian art, stylistic analysis is the  prime source of information about a work, providing clues to its  origins, creation, and dating. Style and period terms  should not be used to order or sort works chronologically. The CREATION  - DATE subcategory serves this function.  ACCESS The style should be accessible in INDEXING TERMS. Researchers may wish  to locate all works of a particular style or period. This type of  criterion may be combined with other characteristics of the object, to  formulate a query to find, for example, Mannerist drawings where the  subject portrays Rome . Since different terms can be  used to refer to the same style (e.g.,   Mannerist and Maniera ), connections between alternate  forms of terms referring to styles, groups, movements, or periods should  be established. This category should be able to  accommodate varying degrees of specificity, in order to make it possible  for researchers to formulate broader or narrower queries on the  information contained in it. For example, while one researcher may want  to find works from the Medieval period, another may wish to find  examples of Gothic or High Gothic works; or one  researcher may be interested in Colonial African works in  general, while another may wish to find Afro-Portuguese works,  and a third Bini-Portuguese works.  RELATIONSHIPS The actual date when the object was created should be specified in CREATION - DATE . Characteristics of the creator of  the work, including culture and nationality, should be included in the  subcategory CREATION -   CREATOR - IDENTITY . The subcategory CREATION - DATE should be used to order objects chronologically; it  should not be used to provide numerical equivalents for period terms.    When a work is created using a technique that has also given its  name to a style, such as a painting by Seurat, the technique, pointillism ,  should be indicated in the category MATERIALS  AND TECHNIQUES , and the style, Pointillism or Neo-Impressionism ,  should be given in this category.         Styles/Periods/Groups/Movements - Indexing Terms      DEFINITION The term or terms identifying a style,  historical period, school, or art movement whose characteristics are  represented by the work of art.

Indexing terms  can consist of a single word, multiple words, or a numeric code. They  may be those used by a scholar in an article or book, or may be drawn  from a controlled vocabulary. Many different terms may  apply to the same object.  SOURCE Style or  period terms are assigned on the basis of the secondary literature and,  whenever possible, a direct examination of the object. Stylistic  characterization may also be based on primary sources.    ACCESS As the same style or period may have more than one  name, access on variant terms is recommended. Likewise, as some styles  or periods, such as   Byzantine , can be further broken down into styles such as   Comnenian or Palaeologan , access on both broader and  narrower terms enhances retrieval.  TERMINOLOGY/FORMAT The use of controlled vocabularies is recommended, such as the   AAT (especially Styles and Periods  hierarchy), the Index of  Jewish Art , or   Villard's   Syst&egrave;me d&eacute;scriptif des antiquit&eacute;s classiques .         Styles/Periods/Groups/Movements   - Remarks      DEFINITION Additional notes on the style or period of  a work, including a summary of the source where a stylistic association  was found, or a justification of the stylistic or period term chosen.
