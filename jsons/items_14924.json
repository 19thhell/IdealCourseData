Part of the core curriculum of the MPA and MUP programs at NYU Wagner, it provides students with both a critical learning experience and an opportunity to perform a public service. Over the course of an academic year, students work in teams-either to address challenges and identify opportunities for an outside organization or to conduct research on a pressing social question. Ultimately, Capstone contributes not only to the students' education, but also to the public good.   In architecture, the capstone is the crowning piece of an arch, the center stone that holds the arch together, giving it shape and strength. Wagner's Capstone program plays a similar role, by integrating and enhancing student learning in several different arenas: a content or issue area, key process skills including project management and teamwork, and methods for gathering, analyzing and reporting data. Capstone requires students to interweave their learning in all these areas and to do so in real time, in an unpredictable, complex real-world environment.   Join us for the 2015 Capstone Expo  Date: Tuesday, May 12, 2015  Time: 5:00pm-6:30pm / Reception to Follow from 6:30pm-7:30pm  Location: NYU Kimmel Center, Rosenthal Pavilion - 10th Floor  60 Washington Square South, New York, NY 10012  RSVP: here   Capstone FAQs   What are the prerequisites for Capstone registration?   Why Capstone?   What is the timeline for the Capstone registration process?   How do I request registration for Capstone?   How are Capstone projects selected? How are Capstone projects assigned?   When will I learn about project specifics?   How are teams selected and how many people are there on a team?   What is required of students?   What resources are available to capstone groups?   How are individuals and groups graded?   What types of projects have been done in the past?   What if I have an idea for a Capstone project?   What is the Capstone Expo?    What are the prerequisites for Capstone registration?   For Capstone prerequisites, refer to your program requirement checksheet on the right hand column of the courses homepage .   Why Capstone?   The purpose of Capstone is to give students an opportunity, with faculty oversight, to quickly analyze and learn about an organization; to hone process skills such as project management, team work, self-reflection, and conflict management; and to research, analyze, and report out on data.   There is one Research Capstone section which is designed for the few students who know they want to pursue a career in quantitative research, most of whom expect to go on to pursue a Ph.D. As with the client-based Capstone projects, students still work in teams in the Research Capstone section; they just don't have a formal outside client.   It is important to keep in mind that Capstone is a process that is ultimately meant to provide students with broad content and experience within their specializations. It is not meant to provide experience in a specific organization or sector. We encourage students to seek out internships and job opportunities to gain experience in specific organizations, rather than rely on the Capstone program to provide that experience.   What is the timeline for the Capstone registration process?   Details regarding when to submit a Capstone registration request can be found in the informational video on the right side of this page. Assuming you have met all of the Capstone prerequisites and submitted your registration request, you will receive a permission number to register on July 1.   How do I request registration for Capstone?   Students cannot register themselves for Capstone via Albert. The registration process is described in the informational video on the right side of this page. All students requesting registration in Capstone are required to watch the video. Students who have met all prerequisites for Capstone and have submitted their registration request will given seats in sections based on their program and specialization.   How are Capstone projects selected? How are Capstone projects assigned?   Potential Capstone clients respond to a request for proposals in the spring. All proposals are vetted by Wagner administration and\u00a0viable projects are submitted to Capstone faculty for comment. In autumn, Capstone faculty leaders present a slate of possible projects to students in their section and students are assigned to Capstone groups by faculty.   When will I learn about project specifics?   Students are presented with a slate of vetted projects from which to choose when classes begin in the Fall semester.   How are teams selected and how many people are there on a team?   Several factors play a role in team composition: interest in various projects, skill sets needed\u00a0for\u00a0a given project, diversity of skill sets and experience on each team, and team size. The specific team selection details vary depending on the individual Capstone instructors. Faculty are encouraged to get information from students, including their interest areas, resumes, and transcripts, in order to help ensure that there is an appropriate team composition for each project. Some faculty begin this process over the summer; others do it in the first weeks of the school year. Faculty make the final decision on team composition, and there is no guarantee that students will be assigned to their first or second choices. Most teams have 4-5 students.   What is required of students?   Course requirements include: enrollment in both semesters; attendance and participation in class activities and client and team meetings; completion of assignments on time; conducting field work; negotiating scope of work agreements with clients; occasional large group discussions out of class time; and the preparation and presentation of the team's findings. Capstone involves presentations from the instructor and guest speakers, class discussion, team meetings and project-oriented fieldwork with a client organization. There may be additional requirements depending on the specific course or instructor, or based on the nature of a given project. In addition, we have a list of Mutual Expectations that can be found here.   What resources are available to Capstone groups?   Each Capstone team will be reimbursed up to $500 for expenses such as reproduction, binding, local travel, and/or preparation of Capstone documents and display materials.   Supplemental travel funding may be available for reimbursement for airfare and train trips for Capstone students who are traveling outside of NYC to conduct their research. This supplemental funding does not cover accommodations or meals, and students who choose projects outside of NYC should expect to contribute financially to support their research. NYU does not advance money, but only reimburses expenses, requiring proof of travel to process payment (original boarding passes and proof of purchase).   How are individuals and groups graded?   Students are graded on both the products they deliver to their clients and evidence of progressive learning throughout the course. Grading considers students' participation in the team's work and class activities and their ability to act on peer and faculty feedback. Assessment for grading purposes also includes evaluations by fellow team members, faculty and clients, as well as a self-evaluation.   What types of projects have been done in the past?   Click here to review a sampling of past Capstone Projects   What if I have an idea for a Capstone project?   If you have a potential client for a Capstone project, the client needs to go through the formal request for proposal process. For details click here.   A Capstone proposal must be submitted by the client, not the student. Please note that there is no guarantee that a submitted project will be selected or that it will be appropriate for a student's program and specialization Capstone section. Students may not work on a project for their employer.   What is the Capstone Expo?   The Capstone Expo is an opportunity for all Capstone teams to come together and share process and findings with clients, faculty, administration,\u00a0other students, and members of the wider NYU community. Each team writes an abstract and creates a poster board presentation that describes the project's purpose, methodology, key insights, and recommendations. This is a great opportunity for teams to show off the fruit of their hard work and see what other Capstone teams have been working on.

The establishment of the Team Achievement Award reflects the complex environment of the University and reinforces the collaboration and partnership necessary to achieve key goals. Teams may be nominated by their team leader, project sponsor, or other key leader of the University for whom the team\u2019s efforts yield benefit. Nominations for academic year 2014-2015 are accepted from November 19, 2014 to February 6, 2015.   What makes a winning team?   Criteria   There are four criteria that will be used in determining the winning team, which should excel in one or more of the below areas. Results should be tangible, measurable, and verifiable.       Operational Excellence \u2013 Significant changes, modifications, or approaches that measurably improve work productivity, efficiency, and quality.   Exceptional Service \u2013 Achieving measurable improvement in interactions with internal and external customers.   Impact \u2013 Accomplishments that have a measurable positive impact on the entire department, school, or unit, or across parts of the University.   Innovation \u2013 Developing an innovative process or procedure that measurably impacts the University community in a positive manner.     Eligibility     Teams (ranging from 5 to 15 contributors) are comprised of administrators from multiple schools or units of the University.   Groups who have been formed for specific purposes and worked a minimum of 6 months to achieve defined goals in a measurable way are eligible.   All individuals on the team will be performing those duties in addition to their normal job responsibilities.   The team must have completed its work and measurable improvements been achieved no earlier than the previous academic year (i.e., nominations for academic year 2014-2015 should be for results achieved no earlier than academic year 2013-2014).   Administrators are eligible, however the following positions are not eligible: Dean, Vice President, members of the University Leadership Team, and teams that are involved on a sporadic or one-time basis or are providing support to the team as part of their normal job duties.     Selection Process   The award selection committee will review and consider nominations received for the Team Achievement Award.

Part of the core curriculum of the MPA and MUP programs at NYU Wagner, it provides students with both a critical learning experience and an opportunity to perform a public service. Over the course of an academic year, students work in teams-either to address challenges and identify opportunities for an outside organization or to conduct research on a pressing social question. Ultimately, Capstone contributes not only to the students' education, but also to the public good.   In architecture, the capstone is the crowning piece of an arch, the center stone that holds the arch together, giving it shape and strength. Wagner's Capstone program plays a similar role, by integrating and enhancing student learning in several different arenas: a content or issue area, key process skills including project management and teamwork, and methods for gathering, analyzing and reporting data. Capstone requires students to interweave their learning in all these areas and to do so in real time, in an unpredictable, complex real-world environment.   Join us for the 2015 Capstone Expo  Date: Tuesday, May 12, 2015  Time: 5:00pm-6:30pm / Reception to Follow from 6:30pm-7:30pm  Location: NYU Kimmel Center, Rosenthal Pavilion - 10th Floor  60 Washington Square South, New York, NY 10012  RSVP: here   Capstone FAQs   What are the prerequisites for Capstone registration?

What are the prerequisites for Capstone registration?   For Capstone prerequisites, refer to your program requirement checksheet on the right hand column of the courses homepage .   Why Capstone?   The purpose of Capstone is to give students an opportunity, with faculty oversight, to quickly analyze and learn about an organization; to hone process skills such as project management, team work, self-reflection, and conflict management; and to research, analyze, and report out on data.   There is one Research Capstone section which is designed for the few students who know they want to pursue a career in quantitative research, most of whom expect to go on to pursue a Ph.D. As with the client-based Capstone projects, students still work in teams in the Research Capstone section; they just don't have a formal outside client.   It is important to keep in mind that Capstone is a process that is ultimately meant to provide students with broad content and experience within their specializations. It is not meant to provide experience in a specific organization or sector. We encourage students to seek out internships and job opportunities to gain experience in specific organizations, rather than rely on the Capstone program to provide that experience.   What is the timeline for the Capstone registration process?   Details regarding when to submit a Capstone registration request can be found in the informational video on the right side of this page. Assuming you have met all of the Capstone prerequisites and submitted your registration request, you will receive a permission number to register on July 1.   How do I request registration for Capstone?   Students cannot register themselves for Capstone via Albert. The registration process is described in the informational video on the right side of this page. All students requesting registration in Capstone are required to watch the video. Students who have met all prerequisites for Capstone and have submitted their registration request will given seats in sections based on their program and specialization.   How are Capstone projects selected? How are Capstone projects assigned?   Potential Capstone clients respond to a request for proposals in the spring. All proposals are vetted by Wagner administration and\u00a0viable projects are submitted to Capstone faculty for comment. In autumn, Capstone faculty leaders present a slate of possible projects to students in their section and students are assigned to Capstone groups by faculty.   When will I learn about project specifics?   Students are presented with a slate of vetted projects from which to choose when classes begin in the Fall semester.   How are teams selected and how many people are there on a team?   Several factors play a role in team composition: interest in various projects, skill sets needed\u00a0for\u00a0a given project, diversity of skill sets and experience on each team, and team size. The specific team selection details vary depending on the individual Capstone instructors. Faculty are encouraged to get information from students, including their interest areas, resumes, and transcripts, in order to help ensure that there is an appropriate team composition for each project. Some faculty begin this process over the summer; others do it in the first weeks of the school year. Faculty make the final decision on team composition, and there is no guarantee that students will be assigned to their first or second choices. Most teams have 4-5 students.   What is required of students?   Course requirements include: enrollment in both semesters; attendance and participation in class activities and client and team meetings; completion of assignments on time; conducting field work; negotiating scope of work agreements with clients; occasional large group discussions out of class time; and the preparation and presentation of the team's findings. Capstone involves presentations from the instructor and guest speakers, class discussion, team meetings and project-oriented fieldwork with a client organization. There may be additional requirements depending on the specific course or instructor, or based on the nature of a given project. In addition, we have a list of Mutual Expectations that can be found here.   What resources are available to Capstone groups?   Each Capstone team will be reimbursed up to $500 for expenses such as reproduction, binding, local travel, and/or preparation of Capstone documents and display materials.   Supplemental travel funding may be available for reimbursement for airfare and train trips for Capstone students who are traveling outside of NYC to conduct their research. This supplemental funding does not cover accommodations or meals, and students who choose projects outside of NYC should expect to contribute financially to support their research. NYU does not advance money, but only reimburses expenses, requiring proof of travel to process payment (original boarding passes and proof of purchase).   How are individuals and groups graded?   Students are graded on both the products they deliver to their clients and evidence of progressive learning throughout the course. Grading considers students' participation in the team's work and class activities and their ability to act on peer and faculty feedback. Assessment for grading purposes also includes evaluations by fellow team members, faculty and clients, as well as a self-evaluation.   What types of projects have been done in the past?   Click here to review a sampling of past Capstone Projects   What if I have an idea for a Capstone project?   If you have a potential client for a Capstone project, the client needs to go through the formal request for proposal process. For details click here.   A Capstone proposal must be submitted by the client, not the student. Please note that there is no guarantee that a submitted project will be selected or that it will be appropriate for a student's program and specialization Capstone section. Students may not work on a project for their employer.   What is the Capstone Expo?   The Capstone Expo is an opportunity for all Capstone teams to come together and share process and findings with clients, faculty, administration,\u00a0other students, and members of the wider NYU community. Each team writes an abstract and creates a poster board presentation that describes the project's purpose, methodology, key insights, and recommendations. This is a great opportunity for teams to show off the fruit of their hard work and see what other Capstone teams have been working on.

The establishment of the Team Achievement Award reflects the complex environment of the University and reinforces the collaboration and partnership necessary to achieve key goals. Teams may be nominated by their team leader, project sponsor, or other key leader of the University for whom the team\u2019s efforts yield benefit. Nominations for academic year 2014-2015 are accepted from November 19, 2014 to February 6, 2015.   What makes a winning team?   Criteria   There are four criteria that will be used in determining the winning team, which should excel in one or more of the below areas. Results should be tangible, measurable, and verifiable.       Operational Excellence \u2013 Significant changes, modifications, or approaches that measurably improve work productivity, efficiency, and quality.   Exceptional Service \u2013 Achieving measurable improvement in interactions with internal and external customers.   Impact \u2013 Accomplishments that have a measurable positive impact on the entire department, school, or unit, or across parts of the University.   Innovation \u2013 Developing an innovative process or procedure that measurably impacts the University community in a positive manner.     Eligibility     Teams (ranging from 5 to 15 contributors) are comprised of administrators from multiple schools or units of the University.   Groups who have been formed for specific purposes and worked a minimum of 6 months to achieve defined goals in a measurable way are eligible.   All individuals on the team will be performing those duties in addition to their normal job responsibilities.   The team must have completed its work and measurable improvements been achieved no earlier than the previous academic year (i.e., nominations for academic year 2014-2015 should be for results achieved no earlier than academic year 2013-2014).   Administrators are eligible, however the following positions are not eligible: Dean, Vice President, members of the University Leadership Team, and teams that are involved on a sporadic or one-time basis or are providing support to the team as part of their normal job duties.
