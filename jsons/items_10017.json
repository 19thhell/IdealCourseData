Prince Zeid Ra\u2019ad Zeid Al-Hussein, Jordan\u2019s Permanent Representative to the United Nations, Will Speak at the Graduate Convocation Ceremony on May 20   NEW YORK, May 15, 2014 \u2013 Close to 1,500 undergraduate and graduate students from across the country and around the world will receive their degrees from the NYU School of Continuing and Professional Studies (NYU-SCPS) during Convocation ceremonies that will recognize them for their completion of rigorous, professionally oriented programs of study. The NYU home to learning and applied research related to key knowledge-based industries where the New York region leads globally, NYU-SCPS prepares students who are just beginning on their career paths, as well as those who are seasoned veterans.    NYU-SCPS Dean Dennis Di Lorenzo noted, \u201cNYU-SCPS truly serves as an incubator for innovation and thought leadership in growing and evolving industries. Our students come from across the country and around the globe to acquire educational credentials that provide them with the access and opportunity needed to compete and succeed. Their diversity, drive, and determination epitomize the very essence of what an NYU education is all about. Through these Convocation ceremonies, we acknowledge and celebrate their hard work, sacrifice, and achievement.\u201d    This year\u2019s student Convocation speakers are prime examples of the unique individuals that NYU-SCPS attracts and prepares for personal and professional success.        Theresa Cardamone , who enrolled in college after a 38-year hiatus, will address the undergraduate class. Rather than attending college in her early 20s, Cardamone chose to devote her life to her greatest passion\u2014horses. During the time when her peers were completing their degrees, she was managing a California horse farm, raising world-class Arabians, leaving her no time to pursue an undergraduate degree. Realizing that she would, one day, want to transition out of this highly competitive industry, Cardamone moved to New York City and enrolled in the NYU-SCPS Paul McGhee Undergraduate Division, which provided credit for her prior learning and life experience. After decades of being away from formal education, she is graduating with a B.A. in Social Sciences and a 3.96 grade point average.      Sejal Daftari , who will be this year\u2019s graduate Convocation student speaker, is an example of an NYU-SCPS student who has left home and family behind to gain an educational credential that will help to distinguish her in the growing field of human resource management. A native of Mumbai, India, Daftari was deeply motivated by Mahatma Gandhi\u2019s quote, \u201cLearn as if you were to live forever.\u201d She understood the invaluable and lasting role that education would play in defining her personally and professionally. During her tenure at NYU-SCPS, Daftari has been involved in the Student Council, has served as the Student Council representative of the NYU- Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM) student club, and has benefitted from internships that include a stint as an executive compensation consultant at Bank of America. She is graduating with an M.S. in Human Resource Management and Development, and a 3.88 grade point average.    This year\u2019s Convocation speakers reflect the School\u2019s progressive stance on providing transformative educational experiences to nontraditional students, as well as its deep commitment to offering a truly global perspective in all facets of teaching and learning.          Undergraduate Speaker   Cathy Sandeen, Ph.D.  Cathy Sandeen serves as vice president for Education Attainment and Innovation at the American Council on Education (ACE), the nation\u2019s largest and most visible association representing all sectors of higher education.    She oversees ACE\u2019s efforts to increase postsecondary educational attainment, capitalizing on her expertise in technology and higher education innovation, nontraditional students, prior learning assessment, alternative credentials, and MOOCs. She also oversees ACE\u2019s Center for Education Attainment and Innovation, including major grant programs, the ACE credit recommendation service, veterans\u2019 programs, and development of new initiatives.    From 2006 to 2012, Dr. Sandeen served as dean of UCLA Extension at the University of California, Los Angeles, which educates 50,000 students per year. Prior to joining UCLA, Dr. Sandeen served as vice provost and dean of University Extension and Summer Session at University of California, Santa Cruz, and held several positions at University of California, San Francisco.    A prolific writer and speaker, Dr. Sandeen is the 2009 recipient of the Research and Scholarship Award by the University Professional Continuing Education Association (UPCEA). Dr. Sandeen earned a Ph.D. in Communication from the University of Utah and an M.B.A. from the UCLA Anderson School of Management. She was an ACE fellow in 2010-11.          Graduate Speaker   H.R.H. Prince Zeid Ra\u2019ad Zeid Al-Hussein, Ph.D.  H.R.H. Prince Zeid Ra\u2019ad Zeid Al-Hussein is Jordan\u2019s permanent representative to the United Nations, a post he has held since September 2010, and previously from 2000-2007.

He also served as Jordan\u2019s deputy permanent representative at the U.N., with the rank of ambassador, from 1996-2000.    In January 2014, he was president of the U.N. Security Council and is presently chairman of the Security Council\u2019s 1533 and 1521 committees with regard to two sanctions regimes: the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Liberia.    Prince Zeid is a member of the Advisory Committee to The Institute for Historical Justice and Reconciliation based in The Hague; serves on the International Advisory Councils of the International Peace Institute and The Security Council Report; is an honorary member of the Advisory Board of the Center for Global Affairs at the NYU School of Continuing and Professional Studies; is a member of the International Advisory Board of The International Center for Ethics, Justice, and Public Life at Brandeis University; and is a member of the Advisory Board for the Krieger School of Arts and Sciences at The Johns Hopkins University.
