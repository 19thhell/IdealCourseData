By analyzing different aspects of religion, health &amp; medicine, education, music, and work, both teachers and students can understand the American Revolution better. What was everyday life like during the American Revolution? How did the American Revolution affect schools, churches, middle-class workers, or doctors? Has the American Revolution created any everlasting traditions in the everyday life of Americans?
