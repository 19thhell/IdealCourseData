Itinerary &amp; Seminars    Throughout the week, you will have the opportunity to meet and work with several percussionists and contractors who are actively pursuing careers on Broadway. A typical session will cover a variety of topics, including: an overview of the show and book, setup issues, use of technology and video monitors, artist background, subbing on Broadway, pay-scale for Broadway musicians, and many others. Artists will perform excerpts from their book, and hands-on participants will be sent a portion of a show to prepare and perform for the percussionists in a masterclass setting. Participants are typically sent 4 - 6 pieces from one show to prepare.
