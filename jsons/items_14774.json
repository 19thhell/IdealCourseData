Rachel Baruch, NYU Gallatin School of Individualized Study                               Rachel Baruch is a sophomore at the NYU Gallatin School of Individualized Study, where she is focusing on neuropsychology and criminology. When Rachel isn't trying to convince her roommate that a diagram of a spliced brain is appropriate living room decor, she can be found developing Jewish pluralistic spaces everyplace she can. Rachel was part of the NYU Bronfman Center team responsible for Chavurah, an award winning, peer-led Jewish learning experience. She is also founder of The Schmooze Project, an online base for the facilitation of inter-denominational connection and conversation that was inspired by her summer spent on the Bronfman Youth Fellowship in Israel.   Rachel speaks English and Hebrew \u2013 the latter proved to be an asset recently when it gave her the ability to lend a hand on Martin Scorsese\u2019s upcoming documentary, \u201cThe New York Review of Books: A 50 Year Argument.\u201d Rachel spent this past summer in Tel Aviv interning as Media &amp; Marketing Manager for Axis Innovation, a company that works on a global scale to connect start ups and investors. Rachel keeps a journal (in an actual notebook!) and is a contributor to the Huffington Post. This year Rachel took the Gallup Strengths Quest, which revealed her top five strengths to be input, learner, communication, responsibility, and individualization. Rachel is excited to contribute her strengths to the NYU Leadership Fellows and the greater NYU community.                                                                                      John Bautista, NYU Steinhardt School of Culture, Education and Human Development                               John Bautista is a junior in the Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development where he studies Media, Culture, and Communication. Originally from Manila, Philippines, John is active in various service initiatives at NYU including the NYU Service Project and Alternative Breaks, where he led a trip to the Dominican Republic to promote education over spring break of his sophomore year. John also currently works as an Admissions Ambassador, giving campus tours to prospective students and parents. He also promotes community building at NYU through his roles as an Orientation Leader and Peer Mentor for new students in Steinhardt and as a Resident Assistant in Broome.   Outside of NYU, John has pursued internships in the non-profit and entertainment industries and has had freelance production experience for theatre and concerts. John is thrilled to be part of the NYU Leadership Fellows. He believes that NYU students are the most passionate and driven people he has encountered, and he cannot wait to meet, build connections, and learn from his peers.                                                                                      Alexandra Cardinale, NYU Steinhardt School of Culture, Education and Human Development                               Alexandra Cardinale passionately advocates for nontraditional education. Before her academic career at NYU, she left high school to travel to eight countries over nine months to study international relations and grassroots activism. Through her service and intellectual pursuits abroad, she fell in love NYU\u2019s Media, Culture and Communications program- which, thanks to a series of brilliant professors- has led her to refine that drive with her two minors, Law and Society, and the Business of Entertainment, Media and Technology.   Now as a Junior, Alex has covered ground across industries, through her social venture start up Live To Give, as a business curioso with WNYC and NYPR in radio, marketing fanatic with Business Insider, global coordinator as the Director of Global Operations with TEDxNYU and all around technical nerd. She continues expand her voice with her YouTube show Business ReCaffeinated (a business offshoot of her old political news and satire show, The Meme Factory), and has recently found a mad passion for strategic consulting.   Alex\u2019s odd path to what she defines as a successful education may not meet traditional standards- and yet it is exactly what she believes gives her an edge to challenge her peers to not find the right answer, but to ask better questions. She holds this high standard of curiosity not only to herself, but to the intellectual circles she chooses to surround herself with. Needless to say, with the NYU leadership fellows, Alex is thrilled to experiment and engage with the like-minded budding leaders of her generation.                                                                                      Joshua Dean, NYU Stern School of Business                               Josh Dean is interested leveraging social media and storytelling to disrupt the nonprofit and public sectors by connecting people to causes and movements and empowering them to drive change.   He co-founded Live To Give HQ, a storytelling platform for people to raise money for charity, with fellow NYU Leadership Fellow and close friend Alexandra Cardinale. Josh and Alex have raised $40,000 in seed funding for Live To Give through winning the Stern Social Impact Business Challenge and applying for small grants. They attended Clinton Global Initiative University in Phoenix, AZ, last month. Josh and Alex hope to empower people to tell powerful stories and raise money for nonprofits from across the country.   Josh worked on Senator Cory Booker\u2019s Special Election Campaign in 2013 from June to October, when he was elected. This past summer, he interned for the Senator in Washington D.C., working for his communications and digital team.He is active in the Stern Social Impact community, holding a leadership position for Net Impact and co-founding the Net Impact Collaborative Experience, a weekly meeting for social entrepreneurs to share ideas and resources. The goal of the meetings is to cover a whiteboard with ideas. Josh's favorite leadership experience has been serving as a Peer Mentor for Project OutReach, a program that brings together service-minded incoming freshmen and transfer students for leadership training, service, reflection, and activities all around the city. His two groups inspire him to continue being active in the service community and to continue reflecting   Josh believes that the world is slowly but surely becoming less racist and less homophobic, yet, we are having trouble working with people we disagree with. He hopes to learn how to push people who have fundamental disagreements to work together through the NYU Leadership Fellowship Program.

Caren is a part of NYU's Model UN as it helps her find solutions for global crises in an attempt to make a change. She is pursuing scientific and social research projects and is glad to be a part of the Presidential Honors Scholars where she can get the proper guidance.

She enjoys experiencing new shows around NYC and exploring new forms of art and expression. Caren has the honor to take on leadership roles at NYU and is proud to be a Welcome Week Leader, a Sophomore Cohort President, and an Undergraduate Writing Tutor. Caren is excited to share her knowledge and experiences with others and to learn from them. She is enthusiastic about receiving the chance to develop her leadership skills and apply them. She hopes she would be able to spread positive energy around her peers and to help them actualize their potential.

This summer Robert has remained in New York City working for both NYU\u2019s Project OutReach and Memorial Sloan Kettering\u2019s Finance Department. Both experiences have allowed Robert to continually cultivate his knowledge of volunteer organizations, general accounting, and the greater financial services industry.   In regards to New York University\u2019s 2014-2015 Leadership Fellows Program, Robert will add a steadfast commitment to sharing his viewpoints with others. Moreover, he will employ active listening in discerning new leadership styles counter to his own. He looks forward to exposing himself to new vantage points and furthering his development as a leader.

Tali Kuhel, NYU College of Arts and Sciences                               Tali is a creative and collaborative community builder on the NYU campus. She has demonstrated her passion for community engagement and volunteerism as Social Action Chair of NYU\u2019s Hillel board, past Vice President of NYU\u2019s Shalhevet community and, currently, as President of NYU\u2019s Shalhevet community.

Jennifer Lau, NYU College of Arts and Sciences                               Jennifer Lau is a junior at New York University, majoring in Politics with minor studies in both Chinese and Public Health. Born and raised in Queens, New York, Jennifer is both an engaged New Yorker and a proud, first-generation Chinese American. She has been involved with several non-profit organizations dedicated to serving lower-income, minority communities of NY, including the Charles B. Wang Community Health Center (CBWCHC), a federally qualified health center that aims to provide healthcare to financially disadvantaged Asian Americans.   Her budding interest in public health, with its roots at the health center, only magnified during her experience abroad in China, where living standards are lower and open dialogue about health concerns are more taboo. Her exposure to inner-city politics, through her involvements in City Council Member Margaret Chin's re-election campaign and in a public interest law firm, the Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund (AALDEF), furthered her interest in the link between politics and public health. With a constant desire for new knowledge, Jennifer hopes to begin connecting the dots in the world through the varied experiences and diverse individuals she meets along the way.                                                                                      Kenny Lee, NYU College of Arts and Sciences                               An economics major in CAS, Kenny is an avid film photographer, aspiring writer, passionate adventurer, and proud South Korean. Since his return from his two-year-long military service in Korea, Kenny has been serving as multiple leadership roles in NYU. Last year he served as a business administrator at Greenwich Hotel Hall Council, contributing to active residential community building within the hall. Kenny has been writing for the opinion section of Washington Square News on a regular basis, shedding light on diverse topics such as education, international volunteer work, LGBTQ activism, and green energy. Last winter, he travelled NYU Alternative Breaks teammates to Rio Grande Valley, a southernmost tip of Texas, to work with a nonprofit to empower immigrant communities in the region. After spring semester, he had a privilege of taking a wonderful adventure in China with NYU Shanghai students.   Through such experiences, Kenny realized the value of inclusive leadership that can empower the members as well as organization. While collaborating on various projects with PricewaterhouseCoopers consultants and analysts this summer in Seoul, he could witness firsthand how even a small change in leadership framework can catalyze an extraordinary change within an organization. Kenny is now poised to start off as an RA at Founders Hall, and as a proud member of NYU Leadership Fellows Program. Without any doubt, he is excited to apply what he learned and push his boundaries through this initiative, and to see where the adventure takes him this year.

Annais developed a deep sense of humanitarianism from her parents who often reminded her of the quote by Edmund Burke: \u201cthe only thing necessary for the triumph of evil, is for good men to do nothing\u201d. This quote inspired her and instilled a deep interest in Politics as a way to answer the call to arms she feels in the face of social injustice, grievous inequality and other systematic issues currently affecting our country and our world.   Annais plans to attend law school following her undergraduate education, become a public interest lawyer and later a politician so that she may help address both societal and environmental issues that do not get the attention they deserve. In her spare time Annais tutors children as part of NYU\u2019s America Reads program. She also works for the College of Arts and Science where she mentors and guides freshman students in her role as College Leader. Annais hopes to add value to the world around her by maintaining a high level of positivity and offering her talents in ways that benefit her peers and her community.

In her free time, Selena likes reading and playing the piano. She will add value to the Leadership Fellows Program, her peer fellows and the larger NYU community through her leadership and passion for volunteerism.

Greyson is taking on the responsibility of President of Entrepreneurship and Innovation Association, or in short EIA, and plans to work hard to create more possibilities for students interested in startups and entrepreneurship.   Besides entrepreneurship, Greyson loves fishing and has spent last two summers working in northern Minnesota at a fishing resort. Although his work at the resort strays from his interests in startups, Greyson has a greater understanding business operations and customer satisfaction from working alongside the owner. Greyson is not afraid of networking and getting to know new people. Greyson hopes to use the experience and knowledge gained from the NYU Leadership Fellows to build a bigger community between the newly merged School of Engineering and the main campus.

As part of the NYU Leadership Fellows Program, she aims to work with an inspiring team of people to strengthen NYU\u2019s community and foster leadership through a range of events and activities. She hopes to use Brighter Today as a tool to further unite peers, build leadership and create a more ecofriendly environment at NYU: creating awareness about some of the world\u2019s most pressing issues, combing skills to transform ideas into actions and ultimately helping to enact change both at NYU and in the world.

At home in New York, Alanah rounds out her time as an active volunteer with the peer led organization The Doula Project as well as writing her ongoing research, among various creative projects.   With an understanding of leadership as a trait to be developed rather than an elite position to inhabit, Alanah is honored to participate in the Leadership Fellows Program and looks forward to fostering open and inclusive leadership in collaboration with her community at NYU and beyond.
