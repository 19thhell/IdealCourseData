The program provides exposure to domestic legal structures throughout Latin America, and the challenges faced by legal systems in the region. It has a particular focus on economic and institutional development, which provides a platform for addressing the crosscutting social, legal, and business challenges that this dynamic and fast-growing region faces. Courses focus on administrative issues in dispute resolution in Latin America; transnational bankruptcy and sovereign debt restructuring; commercial transactions in Latin America; and the legal and economic history of institutions in Latin America. A clinic is offered that focuses on policy advocacy on a variety of issues, such as human rights, access to justice, and institutional development in Latin America.   All courses are taught in English by faculty from the region and are held in NYU\u2019s Academic Center in Buenos Aires. These faculty members consist of leading academics and practitioners in Argentina and Brazil.   The program offers the opportunity to study Spanish at NYU\u2019s Academic Center in Buenos Aires and to interface with regional law firms and legal institutions. Selected students from our local partner, the University of Buenos Aires School of Law (UBA), will also participate in NYU Law courses, providing NYU students with opportunities to interact with local students and have dynamic classroom discussions that incorporate local viewpoints. In addition, students may also choose to take select law courses in Spanish offered by UBA.   NYU Law Abroad encourages students to delve into the cultural context of the region\u2019s legal issues by planning excursions to places of academic and cultural interest in Buenos Aires. The Academic Center in Buenos Aires also makes various extra-curricula activities available to NYU Law students.   Students also have the opportunity to pursue Directed Research in their fields of interest.   Professor Florencia Marotta-Wurgler is the NYU Faculty Program Director. She oversees the program in coordination with the On-Site Program Director, Professor Marcelo Alegre , a law and philosophy professor at UBA School of Law.

Some courses may be subject to the adjunct cap. For more information about academic requirements please visit the Academic Service page here .   All courses administered by NYU Law are evaluated with letter grades, appearing on student transcripts and counting towards the student \u2019 s GPA. However, courses offered and administered by the University of Buenos Aires School of Law, the partner institution, will not count towards GPA, only appearing on transcripts as credits earned, rather than as individual courses.   Spring 2015 Courses     Law and Institutions in Latin America (Three Credits)   Deals: Commercial Transactions in Latin America (Two Credits)   Transnational Credit and Insolvency in Latin America (Two Credits)   Clinic on Policy Advocacy in Latin America (Two Seminar Credits and Three Fieldwork Credits)   Dispute Resolution in Latin America (Three Credits)   Public and Corporate Governance in Latin America (Three Credits)   Directed Research: Students making previous arrangements with faculty either in Buenos Aires or Washington Square may receive up to two credits for research conducted while in Buenos Aires.     Language Courses: Students who have a working knowledge of the Spanish language will generally receive a greater benefit from their experience. Students are therefore encouraged to take language courses at NYU or elsewhere before participating. Students may also find it useful to take language courses offered by the Academic Center while studying in Buenos Aires. No law school credit will be awarded for courses intended solely for language instruction, however; NYU language courses will appear in transcripts.   Tuition and Living Costs   Students participating in NYU Law Abroad pay full tuition to NYU Law for the semester. Tuition will cover a full course load; students who wish to take additional courses may do so at an additional expense. Information about NYU Law School tuition can be found in the following link: http://www.law.nyu.edu/financialaid/budgetandbudgeting/studentexpensebudget/index.htm   For information about cost of living and other expenses please visit: http://www.nyu.edu/global/global-academic-centers/buenos-aires/admitted-students/costs-budgeting/cost-of-living.html   Housing   Students can find their own apartment before they arrive by working with a recommended rental agency.   Passport, Visa and Residence Permit Requirements   Students should obtain the necessary passport and visa to study in Argentina. Students are able to coordinate the process with the Office of Global Services.

The program provides exposure to domestic legal structures throughout Latin America, and the challenges faced by legal systems in the region. It has a particular focus on economic and institutional development, which provides a platform for addressing the crosscutting social, legal, and business challenges that this dynamic and fast-growing region faces. Courses focus on administrative issues in dispute resolution in Latin America; transnational bankruptcy and sovereign debt restructuring; commercial transactions in Latin America; and the legal and economic history of institutions in Latin America. A clinic is offered that focuses on policy advocacy on a variety of issues, such as human rights, access to justice, and institutional development in Latin America.   All courses are taught in English by faculty from the region and are held in NYU\u2019s Academic Center in Buenos Aires. These faculty members consist of leading academics and practitioners in Argentina and Brazil.   The program offers the opportunity to study Spanish at NYU\u2019s Academic Center in Buenos Aires and to interface with regional law firms and legal institutions. Selected students from our local partner, the University of Buenos Aires School of Law (UBA), will also participate in NYU Law courses, providing NYU students with opportunities to interact with local students and have dynamic classroom discussions that incorporate local viewpoints. In addition, students may also choose to take select law courses in Spanish offered by UBA.   NYU Law Abroad encourages students to delve into the cultural context of the region\u2019s legal issues by planning excursions to places of academic and cultural interest in Buenos Aires. The Academic Center in Buenos Aires also makes various extra-curricula activities available to NYU Law students.   Students also have the opportunity to pursue Directed Research in their fields of interest.   Professor Florencia Marotta-Wurgler is the NYU Faculty Program Director. She oversees the program in coordination with the On-Site Program Director, Professor Marcelo Alegre , a law and philosophy professor at UBA School of Law.

Some courses may be subject to the adjunct cap. For more information about academic requirements please visit the Academic Service page here .   All courses administered by NYU Law are evaluated with letter grades, appearing on student transcripts and counting towards the student \u2019 s GPA. However, courses offered and administered by the University of Buenos Aires School of Law, the partner institution, will not count towards GPA, only appearing on transcripts as credits earned, rather than as individual courses.   Spring 2015 Courses     Law and Institutions in Latin America (Three Credits)   Deals: Commercial Transactions in Latin America (Two Credits)   Transnational Credit and Insolvency in Latin America (Two Credits)   Clinic on Policy Advocacy in Latin America (Two Seminar Credits and Three Fieldwork Credits)   Dispute Resolution in Latin America (Three Credits)   Public and Corporate Governance in Latin America (Three Credits)   Directed Research: Students making previous arrangements with faculty either in Buenos Aires or Washington Square may receive up to two credits for research conducted while in Buenos Aires.     Language Courses: Students who have a working knowledge of the Spanish language will generally receive a greater benefit from their experience. Students are therefore encouraged to take language courses at NYU or elsewhere before participating. Students may also find it useful to take language courses offered by the Academic Center while studying in Buenos Aires. No law school credit will be awarded for courses intended solely for language instruction, however; NYU language courses will appear in transcripts.   Tuition and Living Costs   Students participating in NYU Law Abroad pay full tuition to NYU Law for the semester. Tuition will cover a full course load; students who wish to take additional courses may do so at an additional expense. Information about NYU Law School tuition can be found in the following link: http://www.law.nyu.edu/financialaid/budgetandbudgeting/studentexpensebudget/index.htm   For information about cost of living and other expenses please visit: http://www.nyu.edu/global/global-academic-centers/buenos-aires/admitted-students/costs-budgeting/cost-of-living.html   Housing   Students can find their own apartment before they arrive by working with a recommended rental agency.   Passport, Visa and Residence Permit Requirements   Students should obtain the necessary passport and visa to study in Argentina. Students are able to coordinate the process with the Office of Global Services.

Specialized programs are available in Africana studies, art and architecture, business, mathematics, British literature and writing, pre-health, and psychology. Courses in math, biology, chemistry, and physics accommodate students whose schedules might not otherwise allow for a semester of global study. Additionally, NYU is the only institution in London to offer science courses approved by the American Medical College Application Service (AMCAS) for medical school admittance. NYU London encourages students to enroll in for-credit internships with key institutions in fields including marketing, finance, media, law, politics, health, and theatre.     Students who spend a semester at NYU London live and learn in the heart of Bloomsbury, a neighborhood that is home to the British Museum, the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, and the West End (London\u2019s famous theatre district). Each semester, NYU London staff plans day trips to places such as the historic cities of Bath, Cambridge, and Oxford. In addition to exploring London\u2019s myriad cultural sites, students often participate in short-term or semester-long community service projects.
