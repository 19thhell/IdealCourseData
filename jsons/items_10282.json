With possible exceptions, we would anticipate that most of our dual-degree students would opt for the health ethics track; however we note that these tracks have significant overlap both in intent and in course offerings. Students who might consider taking a masters degree in bioethics might include individuals wishing to serve as bioethicists for hospitals, medical schools or other health-related institutions; individuals wishing to approach public-health and/or global public health issues from the perspective of ethics; individuals wishing to participate in public policy from the perspective of ethics; individuals wishing to do research in bioethics; and individuals with an intrinsic interest in the area and/or modes of inquiry inherent in bioethical thinking.   The Medical School has had various ties with Arts and Science for over three decades, including an earlier dual degree program, an MD/MA in Philosophy. Our current program has the same director, Dr. William Ruddick (Director of the NYU Center for Bioethics and Director of the MA in Bioethics Program) and the same primary donor, Dr. Arthur Zitrin (Professor of Psychiatry emeritus) who has endowed a Chair of Bioethics held by Dr. Ruddick.\u00a0 Importantly, the new specialized degree in Bioethics includes courses in environmental issues, as well as in other NYU graduate schools and departments.\u00a0   The NYU Masters in Bioethics is a thirty-two credit program; at the most intense level of participation, the course work may be completed in two full semesters plus additional time completing an independent study specifically designed to complement and integrate with ongoing research activity. The core of the program consists of two required courses: Advanced Introduction to Bioethics, and Advanced Introduction to Environmental Ethics (4 credits each). Students may then select the remainder of their coursework (20 credits) from a menu of course offerings at the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, at the Steinhardt School of Social Work, at the NYU School of Law, and the Robert P. Wagner Graduate School of Public Service. Finally, all students in the Masters Program are required to complete a course of independent study: either a Masters project (extended essay) or a practicum (4 credits).\u00a0   Timeline:   The MD/MA in Bioethics allows students to complete both degrees in five years of full-time study. Medical Students accepted to the dual degree program will generally first fulfill their MD requirements in the first three years of the program followed by a dedicated year of MA degree coursework. Any remaining Independent Study requirements would be completed concurrently with return to the medical school.   During the dedicated year of MA coursework, students will be expected to opt for one of three possible forms of independent study: thesis research, as currently defined; a practicum experience in bioethics; or a mentored hypothesis-driven research project. Students will begin this project during their first year in the MA program but need not complete it at that time. After finishing the fall and spring semesters dedicated solely to the MA Program, students will resume clinical training in the medical school while concurrently completing the practicum or research project. In addition, students are welcome to take one additional course per semester in the field of Bioethics during this fifth year, but only if such courses do not interfere with their medical school obligations.   All students completing their independent study (any format) will be required to complete a written project (thesis). Students who elect the hypothesis-driven research track will be required to submit a thesis in the form of a research report and to make a final research presentation (thesis defense) to the MA Program.   A portion of their M.D. degree elective time (at a maximum of 8 weeks), Scholarly Project requirement, and/or any additional free time can be applied to the continuing pursuit of this practicum or research project. \u00a0Students may also be eligible to apply their research project to requirements at the medical school for graduation with Honors, subject to the approval by the Directors of the Honors Program.   A sample curriculum follows:   \u00a0   Fall   Spring   Summer   1st Year   Medical School Curriculum   Medical School Curriculum   \u00a0   2nd Year   Medical School Curriculum   Medical School Curriculum     \u00a0     3rd Year   Medical School Curriculum   Medical School Curriculum   \u00a0   4th Year   MA Curriculum   MA Curriculum   Medical Curriculum/MA Curriculum -Independent Study   5th Year   Medical School Curriculum*   Medical School Curriculum*   \u00a0   Independent Study may continue into the fall semester of medical school if combined with medical school elective time. Students should consult with both the medical school and MA Program Directors to identify any such curricular needs.   Application Process :   We propose that students wishing to participate in the dual-degree MD/MA in Bioethics will be permitted to apply for the MA program either concurrently with their application for medical school, or during medical school, at the time that they develop their interest in the program.   Students wishing to apply prior to medical school will need to submit separate applications to each program, and receive acceptance to both, in order to be accepted into the dual degree. Students admitted into the dual degree program from the start of enrollment in the medical school will have a space reserved for them in the Masters Program. Students will be required to remain in good academic standing during medical school.   Students wishing to apply during medical school will generally be expected to submit their application during the application season prior to their participation, though in exceptional cases early applications may be accepted.   Tuition and Funding :   The total cost of the tuition and fees for the MA in bioethics is roughly $45,000 (for 2009-10). Students participating in the dual-degree program will be expected to pay the full cost of this degree separate from the medical degree . However, medical students may inquire with the MA program regarding potential financial assistance. The School of Medicine may also assist the student in identifying other sources of funds where available.

A sample curriculum follows:   \u00a0   Fall   Spring   Summer   1st Year   Medical School Curriculum   Medical School Curriculum   \u00a0   2nd Year   Medical School Curriculum   Medical School Curriculum     \u00a0     3rd Year   Medical School Curriculum   Medical School Curriculum   \u00a0   4th Year   MA Curriculum   MA Curriculum   Medical Curriculum/MA Curriculum -Independent Study   5th Year   Medical School Curriculum*   Medical School Curriculum*   \u00a0   Independent Study may continue into the fall semester of medical school if combined with medical school elective time. Students should consult with both the medical school and MA Program Directors to identify any such curricular needs.   Application Process :   We propose that students wishing to participate in the dual-degree MD/MA in Bioethics will be permitted to apply for the MA program either concurrently with their application for medical school, or during medical school, at the time that they develop their interest in the program.   Students wishing to apply prior to medical school will need to submit separate applications to each program, and receive acceptance to both, in order to be accepted into the dual degree. Students admitted into the dual degree program from the start of enrollment in the medical school will have a space reserved for them in the Masters Program. Students will be required to remain in good academic standing during medical school.   Students wishing to apply during medical school will generally be expected to submit their application during the application season prior to their participation, though in exceptional cases early applications may be accepted.   Tuition and Funding :   The total cost of the tuition and fees for the MA in bioethics is roughly $45,000 (for 2009-10). Students participating in the dual-degree program will be expected to pay the full cost of this degree separate from the medical degree . However, medical students may inquire with the MA program regarding potential financial assistance. The School of Medicine may also assist the student in identifying other sources of funds where available.
