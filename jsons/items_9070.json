All first-year students are required to register for a CAS Freshman Seminar in either the fall or spring semester of their first year as part of the CCP. The Seminar does not need to have any connection with your anticipated field of study or future career.   The variety of Seminars spans the full range of the natural sciences, social sciences, and humanities. The Seminars are small, intellectually stimulating classes that are taught by extraordinary faculty who are leaders in their fields.   Unless noted as \"Spring 2015\", the seminars below are offered in the Fall 2014 semester.   You can find syllabi for many of the seminars here . A syllabus outlines readings, assignments, and topics for the semester, and often includes a breakdown of how final grades are calculated. Make sure the seminars you select are a good match for you.        Telling Their Own Stories: The Irish in New York City   FRSEM-UA 540   Instructor: Linda Dowling Almeida   Tuesday, 2:00-4:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note: conflicts with Principles of Biology RCT (Tuesday, 2:00 p.m.-4:45 p.m.) and Intro Experimental Physics I Lab (Tuesday, 2:00 p.m.-5:00 p.m.).   This interdisciplinary seminar focuses on oral history as a resource for understanding the 20th century history of the Irish in America, particularly in New York. Students will explore the discipline as it has progressed over the last twenty years, developing their own research, writing, and interviewing skills along the way and enjoying access to the 300+ interviews in Glucksman Ireland House's Oral History holdings in the Archives of Irish America. The course will demonstrate how oral history gives life to ethnic communities like those of the Irish longshoremen who worked Chelsea Piers in the West Village before it was an entertainment destination, personalizes dramatic events like 9/11, or provides insight into to why John Patrick Shanley wrote Doubt . In addition to traditional texts, we will listen to and conduct interviews, read Irish-American fiction, walk the streets of the communities we study, and screen films and documentaries exploring the lives of Irish Americans. This course will introduce students not only to oral history but to the history of the Irish in America.   LINDA DOWLING ALMEIDA, Adjunct Assistant Professor of Irish Studies at NYU\u2019s Glucksman Ireland House, teaches classes in the history and literature of Irish America. Her book Irish Immigrants in New York City, 1945-1995 compares the experience of the Irish who arrived in the 1950s with that of their counterparts thirty and forty years later. Professor Almeida has published chapters in The Irish World Wide , Ireland in the 1950s , and Making the Irish American , and has delivered papers on pedagogical approaches to oral history to both the Oral History Association and the International Oral History Association. Her latest project involves the production of podcasts on a variety of themes and issues drawn from the archives.   Propaganda Portraits: Royal Imagery in the Age of Absolutism   FRSEM-UA 488   Instructor: William Ambler   Wednesday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note: conflicts with Principles of Biology RCT  ( Wednesday, 2:00 p.m.- 4:45  p . m . ) and Physics I RCT ( Wednesda y, 2:00 p.m.-3:15p.m.).    This course studies the relationship between art and politics in European baroque state portraiture. In the 17th century, with few means to reach a broad populace, depictions of the king played a central part in convincing the people of a monarch\u2019s legitimate authority. The most talented artists of the age glorified their kings in ways that gave visual form to political theories that justified increasingly centralized royal rule. We set the portraits in the context of debates that preoccupied the European courts of the time: the Reformation; the dynastic ambitions of European royal houses; and political theories of legitimate government. We also consider the position of artists at a royal court and preexisting traditions of royal imagery.   WILLIAM AMBLER is an independent art historian with expertise in Spanish baroque art and eighteenth-century English architecture. He has been a curator at the Hispanic Society of America in New York City and has participated in exhibitions there, as well as at the Metropolitan Museum, Jewish Museum, and Federal Reserve in Washington, D.C.   Global Citizenship: Theory and Practice   FRSEM-UA 484   Instructor: Ulrich Baer   Wednesday, 2:00-4:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note: conflicts with Principles of Biology RCT (Wednesday, 2:00 p.m.-4:45 p.m.) and Physics I RCT (Wednesday, 2:00 p.m.-3:15p.m.).   This seminar explores the notion and practice of global citizenship\u2014the capacity and willingness to think across and beyond actual and imagined boundaries, and to develop skills that can solve problems and explore opportunities in unfamiliar contexts. The course examines globalization as a historical, economic, and cultural phenomenon. Topics include local resistance to global homogeneity; the notion of universal humanism; human rights; the role of language in global contexts; the idea of citizenship; the specificity of culture and arts; the idea of film or photography as universal languages; and an exploration of New York City as an international city that has turned its diversity into strength. The seminar brings in guest speakers who identify as global citizens, and asks students to consider how their own actions\u2014ranging from activism to business leadership\u2014may have an impact on those outside their immediate world.   ULRICH BAER, Vice Provost of Arts, Humanities, and Multicultural Affairs and Professor of Comparative Literature and German, was awarded the College\u2019s Golden Dozen Award for Excellence in Teaching in 1998 and 2004. He is the author of Remnants of Song: Trauma and the Experience of Modernity in Charles Baudelaire and Paul Celan and Spectral Evidence: The Photography of Trauma ; editor of the literary anthology 110 Stories: New York Writes after September 11 ; and editor and translator of The Poet\u2019s Guide to Life: The Wisdom of Rainer Maria Rilke . He has also published widely on photography and has co-taught a seminar entitled \u201cArchive, Image, Text\u201d with Professor Shelley Rice from the Tisch School of the Arts.   Game Theory and the Humanities   FRSEM-UA 506   Instructor: Steven J. Brams   Wednesday, 4:55\u20137:25 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note: conflicts with Principles of Biology RCT (Wednesday, 5:00 p.m.-7:45 p.m.) and Physics I RCT (Wednesday, 5:00 p.m.-6:15p.m.).   Game theory is a mathematical theory of strategy that has been applied to the analysis of conflict and cooperation in such fields as economics, political science, and biology. In this seminar, we discuss more unusual applications\u2014to history, literature, philosophy, the Bible, theology, and law. We discuss Abraham\u2019s decision to offer his son Isaac for sacrifice; the choices made by accused witches and their persecutors in medieval witch trials; Lady Macbeth's incitement of her husband to murder King Duncan in Shakespeare\u2019s play; several strategic games played by presidents and their antagonists in domestic crises (e.g., the Civil War) and international crises (e.g., the Cuban missile crisis), and coping mechanisms used by characters in catch-22 games (including those in Joseph Heller's novel Catch-22 ).   Prerequisite: No mathematical background beyond high school mathematics is assumed, but a willingness to learn and apply sophisticated reasoning to analyze the interactions of players in games is essential. STEVEN J. BRAMS is Professor of Politics at NYU. He is the author of several books\u2014most recently, Mathematics and Democracy and Game Theory and the Humanities \u2014that apply game theory and social choice theory to voting and elections, bargaining and fairness, international relations, and the Bible, theology and literature.

He is an American Association for the Advancement of Science Fellow and was a Guggenheim Fellow and Visiting Scholar at the Russell Sage Foundation.    How We See   FRSEM-UA 497   Instructor: Marisa Carrasco   Thursday, 9:30 a.m.\u201312:00 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note: conflicts with Principles of Biology RCT (Thursday, 9:30 a.m.-12:15 p.m. ).   Do we see the world the way we do because we are the way we are or because the world is the way it is? This course looks at what we know about vision from multiple scientific perspectives: perceptual psychology tells us about the process of seeing and provides important insights into the workings of visual mechanisms; neuropsychology shows us what happens to perception when these mechanisms malfunction; neuroscience tells us about processes at the level of cells and neural systems. At the same time, we discuss modes and techniques of scientific inquiry from these different perspectives. How do vision scientists learn? What kinds of experiments do they conduct? How has the development of new neuroimaging techniques (fMRI, for example) shaped the field?   MARISA CARRASCO is Collegiate Professor and Professor of Psychology and Neural Science, as well as a former Chairperson of the Department of Psychology. Born and raised in Mexico City, she received her licentiate in psychology from the National University of Mexico and her PhD in psychology (cognition and perception) from Princeton University. She conducts research in cognitive neuroscience, exploring the relation between the psychological and neural mechanisms involved in visual perception and attention. Her papers have been published in the leading scientific journals in the field, and she has won numerous prestigious awards and fellowships throughout her career, such as an American Association of University Women Fellowship, a National Young Investigator Award from the National Science Foundation, a Cattell Fellowship, and a Guggenheim Fellowship.   Latin America at the Start of the 21st Century: Coming of Age or Continuing Chaos?   FRSEM-UA 306   Instructor: Jorge G. Casta\u00f1eda   Monday, 9:30 a.m.\u201312:00 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note: conflicts with Principles of Biology I Lecture ( Monday, 9:3 0 a.m.\u20131 0:45 a .m.) and Intro Experimental Physics I Lecture ( Monday , 11:00 a.m.\u201312:15 p.m.).   This seminar focuses on Latin America\u2019s longstanding problems and possible solutions to them. It takes up such topics as the absence of orderly, peaceful, and steady democratic governance following independence from colonial rule, and the consolidation of representative democracy today; the slowdown of economic growth in the last 20 years and prospects for a new economic takeoff; the phenomenon of widespread violence, and growing respect for human rights; and how the traditional weakness of civil society is being overcome. For each topic, there are readings dealing with its political, economic, and cultural dimensions in both past and present. JORGE D. CASTA\u00d1EDA is Global Distinguished Professor of Politics and Latin American and Caribbean Studies. Professor at the National Autonomous University of Mexico since 1979, he has also been a visiting professor at the University of California at Berkeley, Princeton, and Dartmouth.

He is the author of, among many other books, Utopia Unarmed: The Latin American Left after the Cold War; Compa\u00f1ero: The Life and Death of Che Guevara; Perpetuating Power; Ex-Mex: From Migrants to Immigrants; and Leftovers: Tales of the Latin American Left (with Marco Morales) He has also written articles for many newspapers and magazines in Mexico, the United States, and other countries.   Literature and Machines   FRSEM-UA 572   Instructor: Nicola Cipani   Thursday, 12:30 p.m.\u20133:00 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note: conflicts with Principles of Biology RCT (Thursday, 12:30 p.m.-4:45 p.m.), Physics I Lecture ( Thursday, 12:30 p.m.-1:45 p.m.), Physics I RCT (Thursday, 2:00 p.m.-3:15 p.m. ), and Advanced General Chem I Lab (Thursday, 2:30 p.m.-6:45 p.m.).    Machine metaphors play an important role in modern literature, conveying beliefs, anxieties, shifts, and reflections on key topics, including the nature of consciousness and creativity; the dynamics of desire and gratification; gender roles; the organization of society; the meaning of \u201cnature\u201d; and the function of technology. This course explores different manifestations of the machine theme, broadly clustered around the following categories: imaginary machines constituting the centerpiece of narrative plots; machine aesthetic as modernist ideal; and mechanization of the inventive process (text-generating machines). Students read and discuss a selection of works from different cultural contexts, primarily from the late 19 th and 20 th century (e.g., Belle \u00c9poque, Futurist, and postwar), representing a wide spectrum of attitudes toward the machine, from dreamy immersion in virtual realities to enlightened machine-assisted awakening, from the fear of dehumanization to the desire for man-machine fusion. NICOLA CIPANI is Assistant Clinical Professor at the Department of Italian Studies and has been working at NYU for ten years. His interests include reception of antiquity in medieval and early modern culture, Renaissance philosophy, the intersection of verbal/visual forms (such as the art of memory, emblem books, and representations of dreams), and 20 th -century experimental literature. At the Italian Department he has served in the capacity of Director of Language Programs (since 2005), Director of Summer Programs (2011-12), and Director of Undergraduate Studies (2011, 2013).   In Search of Lost Time   FRSEM-UA 503   Instructor: Marcelle Clements   Thursday, 2:00\u20134:45 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note: conflicts with Principles of Biology RCT (Thursday, 2:00 p.m.-4:45 p.m.), Physics I RCT (Thursday, 2:00 p.m.-3:15 p.m.), and Advanced General Chem I Lab (Thursday, 2:30 p.m.-6:45 p.m.).   We read Marcel Proust (350 pages per week, in translation) as he should be read: hedonistically\u2014with respect and admiration but also with delectation. At more than 4,000 pages, In Search of Lost Time is one of modern literature\u2019s most challenging and pleasurable reads, still unparalleled in how it combines finesse and wit with raw emotion, self-examination with social history, and psychological acuity with a portrait of the French beau monde at the outset of modernity. Though Proust (1871\u20131922) is often cited as France\u2019s greatest novelist, many readers never move past the first fifty pages of his novel, reading the same gorgeous sentences again and again. However, as its architecture cannot be appreciated until it has been read once in its entirety, we move at a brisk pace through all six volumes; when we read the final volume, we can begin to understand the extraordinarily intimate relationship Proust has created with his reader. In-class creative writing exercises are designed to help with the reading and to expand an expressive, personal response.   MARCELLE CLEMENTS is Collegiate Professor and Fellow of the New York Institute for the Humanities at NYU. She is the author of a collection of essays, The Dog Is Us and Other Observations , a book of nonfiction, The Improvised Woman , and two novels, Rock Me and, most recently, Midsummer . Her prizewinning articles and essays on the arts, culture, and politics have appeared in many national publications.   Political Theater   FRSEM-UA 476   Instructor: Eric Dickson   Monday, 2:00-4:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note: conflicts with Intro Experimental Physics I Lab (Monday, 12:30 p.m.-3:30 p.m.).      This interdisciplinary seminar offers a survey of political theater, and of the use of theatrical elements in practical politics, from the ancient Greeks to the present. How have dramatic depictions of politics changed over time? In what ways have political plays been used to advance political agendas, both by the powerful and by dissidents and protest movements? To what extent can we understand political speeches and political campaigns as essentially theatrical productions? In a typical week, students will read one full-length play, accompanied by appropriate readings from political science or social psychology. Through these readings, writing assignments, and class discussion, we address the development of different dramatic techniques and forms throughout the history of theater; the co-evolving relationship between politically-themed spectacles and changing ideas about citizenship and political legitimacy; and the political psychology of speeches and campaign techniques. ERIC S. DICKSON is Associate Professor of Politics and a faculty affiliate in the Department of Psychology. His research interests include political communication, election campaigning, political leadership, and identities in politics. His work, which uses both game theory and social-scientific experiments, focuses on the interface between political strategy and political psychology. He also has an extensive background in theater.   Political Cinema and Representation of the \u201cOther\u201d   FRSEM-UA 463   Instructor: Shimon Dotan   Friday, 9:30 a.m.\u201312:00 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note: conflicts with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m.\u2013 12:15 p.m.) and with Advanced Ch emistry I recitation (Friday, 9:30 a.m.\u201310:45 a .m.).   In contemporary war \u201cthe other\u201d is viewed not only as an enemy to be fought, but often as one to be eliminated. How do filmmakers fight against (or alternately, reinforce) such deadly representations? In exploring various cinematic and thematic elements we will primarily focus on films from one of the world\u2019s most conflict-ridden regions\u2014the Middle East. We will also explore films from Russia, Germany, France and the US. Through readings and film screenings, we will investigate how \u201cthe other\u201d is constructed politically, aesthetically and ethically. This class is designed for anyone interested in filmmaking and film criticism, contemporary politics and history, cinema of conflict and violence, and the ethical questions associated with them. SHIMON DOTAN, a Fellow of the New York Institute of the Humanities at NYU, is an award-winning filmmaker with thirteen feature films to his credit. His films have received the Silver Bear Award at the Berlin Film Festival ( The Smile of the Lamb ), numerous Israeli Academy Awards, including Best Film and Best Director ( Repeat Dive ; The Smile of the Lamb ), and Best Film at the Newport Beach Film Festival ( You Can Thank Me Later ). His film Hot House won the Special Jury Prize at Sundance in 2007. He has taught filmmaking and film studies at Tel Aviv University in Israel and at Concordia University in Montreal and is a member of the Directors and Writers Guilds of America (DGA, WGA).   The Literature of Capitalism   FRSEM-UA 576   Instructor: Thomas Easton   Thursday, 11:00 a.m.\u20141:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note: conflicts with Principles of Biology RCT (Thursday, 11:00 a.m.-1:45 p.m.) and Physics I Lecture (Thursday, 12:30 p.m.-1:45 p.m.).   This course explores how some of the most enduring themes in literature, such as greed, ambition, failure, innovation, prosperity, and opportunity, are reflected in literature about capitalism. Readings are likely to include works by eighteenth-century English essayist Samuel Johnson; children\u2019s book author Horatio Alger and novelist Mark Twain; and contemporary Chinese memoirist Aisling Juanjuan Shen. The nature of property rights, subtle distinctions between success and crime, and the relative value of diligence and luck are other themes we consider. Our discussions about characters and stories are informed by work in economics, ranging from Adam Smith\u2019s writings on productivity and ethics to Thomas Piketty\u2019s writings on income inequality. Weekly essays assigned.   THOMAS EASTON is American finance editor at the Economist , where he previously worked as New York and Hong Kong bureau chief. Earlier in his career, he was the bureau chief for The Baltimore Sun in New York and Tokyo and a senior editor at Forbes . He has taught business reporting and journalism at Columbia\u2019s Graduate School of Journalism. At the Economist , his purview also includes legal coverage. Mr. Easton holds an AB in literature from Brown, an MBA from Columbia Business School, and an MSL from Yale Law School.   Gender, Sexuality and the Law   FRSEM-UA 480   Instructor: Shelley Fischel   Wednesday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note: conflicts with Principles of Biology RCT (Wednesday, 2:00 p.m.-4:45 p.m.), and Physics I RCT (Wednesday, 2:00 p.m.-3:15 p.m).   What impact has law had on gender and sexuality inequalities? What impact could or should law have? This course explores gender and sexuality discrimination in American jurisprudence as it has developed under the Constitution as well as its consequences in the spheres of work, politics, and social life. We address such matters as marriage and divorce law, the Civil Rights Act and Title IX, and the unique, perhaps troubling ways that criminal law treats crimes associated with sexuality, rape, domestic abuse, and sexual orientation. We also address the intersection of these matters with issues of gender identity and sexual orientation. This course offers a history of US sex law and analyzes contemporary doctrinal, judicial, and legislative developments.   SHELLEY D. FISCHEL served as Executive Vice President at Home Box Office, Inc., where she was responsible for Human Resources, Facilities and Real Estate, and labor law matters until her retirement in December 2009. She oversaw all sexual discrimination claims in the company. She received her JD from Columbia University and her LLM from NYU.   Trials of the Century   FRSEM-UA 434   Instructor: Jack Ford    Monday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note: conflicts with Intro Experimental Physics I Lab (Monday, 12:30 p.m.-3:30 p.m.).   How does a trial become viewed as a \u201ctrial of the century\u201d? What does that designation say about the crime and the personalities involved, about the legal, social, and political implications of the case, and about the nature and extent of the attendant media coverage? Since the trial of Socrates, the public has been intrigued, galvanized, and even entertained by the real drama of real trials, which often act as a prism through which society\u2019s strengths and weaknesses are revealed. This course offers in-depth examinations of select \u201ctrials of the century\u201d in the US, approaching each case from a specific angle, from celebrity (the Lindbergh kidnapping case and the trial of O.J. Simpson) to race (the trials of the Scottsboro Boys), politics (the Chicago Seven), and religion (the Scopes Monkey Trial).   JACK FORD is an Emmy and Peabody Award-winning journalist, author, and nationally recognized trial attorney. Currently a CBS News Legal Analyst, he has had a distinguished career on network and cable television. As a litigator, he successfully handled a number of high-profile cases, such as the Northeast\u2019s first death-penalty trial; one of the nation\u2019s first corporate homicide cases; and the Wall Street insider-trading scandal of the late 1980s. He has also written articles for respected legal publications. The recipient of five honorary degrees in recognition of his professional accomplishments and his extensive public service, he has taught at, in addition to NYU, Yale College and Fordham Law School.   Wiseguys, Spies, and Private Eyes: Heroes and Villains in American Culture, Film, and Literature   FRSEM-UA 449   Instructor: Eddy Friedfeld   Thursday, 4:55\u20137:25 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note: conflicts with Advan ced General Chem I Lab (Thursday , 2:30 p.m.-6 :45 p.m.).   This seminar explores the ways in which specific American archetypes and themes are perceived and articulated\u2014from the rugged Old West individualist, to the persevering underdog who becomes a boxing champ, to the Cold War era superspy. We examine representations of heroes and villains in modern American popular culture and how the great films and novels of three particular genres, the Detective, the Gangster, and the Spy, influenced our understanding of these archetypes. From the early influences of Hamlet and Macbeth to Sherlock Holmes, Raymond Chandler\u2019s Philip Marlowe, Mario Puzo\u2019s (and Francis Ford Coppola\u2019s) The Godfather , James Bond, and Batman, we look at the mythology and evolution of heroes and villains through popular and high culture icons, the genesis of the genres and how they developed over time, and how great directors, actors, and writers influenced audiences worldwide and were themselves influenced by culture and history.   EDDY FRIEDFELD is a film and entertainment journalist and historian, as well as an attorney specializing in corporate restructuring. He is the co-author of Caesar\u2019s Hours with comedy legend Sid Caesar, and is working on a book on the history of comedy in America. He was the senior consultant for the PBS documentary Make \u2019Em Laugh: The Funny Business of America , has appeared on Fox News, PBS, and WOR and Bloomberg Radio, has written and lectured extensively on entertainment and film, and has produced and hosted tributes to Dick Van Dyke, Eric Idle, Dick Cavett, Alan King, Robert Altman, George Carlin, and Paul Newman, among others. He received his BA from Columbia College and his JD from NYU Law School. He also teaches at Yale College.   The New Worlds of Work and Care   FRSEM-UA 500   Instructor: Kathleen Gerson   Wednesday, 3:30\u20136:00 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note: conflicts with Principles of Biology I RCT (Wednesday, 3:30 p.m.-6:15 p.m.) and Physics I RCT (Wednesday, 5:00 p.m.-6:00 p.m.).   The early 21st century represents a period of immense social change in both the public world of work and the private world of family care. New technologies have blurred the boundary between home and work. New opportunities and pressures have sent more women into the workplace. The \u201cnew economy\u201d has created jobs with more short-term flexibility, but less long-term security. And new options in intimate relationships have created more diverse and voluntary, but less predictable, family bonds. These intertwined shifts are reshaping the daily lives and life pathways of American women and men. This seminar addresses several questions: What does an overview of changes in work, family, and gender patterns tell us about where we are now and where we are going? What are the major dilemmas created by these changes, and how are people coping with these conflicts? What are the implications for the future? And what can we do to enhance the opportunities and limit the insecurities of these new social arrangements?   KATHLEEN GERSON, Collegiate Professor and Professor of Sociology, is a recognized authority on the connections among gender, work, and family life in postindustrial societies. She has held visiting positions at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences at Stanford University, the Russell Sage Foundation in New York City, and the Center for the Study of Status Passages in the Life Course at Bremen University, Germany and has won numerous prestigious prizes for her scholarly work. Her books include The Unfinished Revolution: Coming of Age in a New Era of Gender, Work, and Family ; The Time Divide: Family, Work, and Gender Inequality (with Jerry A. Jacobs); No Man\u2019s Land: Men\u2019s Changing Commitments to Family and Work ; and Hard Choices: How Women Decide About Work, Career, and Motherhood .   \u201cLaboratories for Democracy\u201d: Making American Cities Better   FRSEM-UA 456   Instructor: Eric Gioia   Thursday, 4:55\u20137:25 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note: conflicts with Advanced General Chem I Lab (Thursday, 2:30 p.m.-6:45 p.m.).   Cities, states, and municipalities serve as what Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis called \u201clittle laboratories for democracy\u201d\u2014where ideas flourish and problems get solved. This course examines the intersection of ideas, politics, and action in cities in the US and around the world, particularly those related to improving the urban environment. We study best practices, evaluate their effectiveness, and determine whether and how successful policies and programs can be replicated. This course asks students to not only think critically about issues of public policy but also to think anew about the role they play in shaping it. Topics for student projects are drawn from current issues and problems facing decision-makers and elected officials in America today.   ERIC GIOIA is an attorney with extensive experience in business, law, and government. He joined J.P. Morgan in January 2010 after serving for eight years on the New York City Council. Prior to serving on City Council, he practiced law at Milbank, Tweed, Hadley &amp; McCloy LLP, and served in the White House under President Bill Clinton. Professor Gioia holds a BA from New York University and a JD from Georgetown University Law Center.   Is Karl Marx Still Relevant?   FRSEM-UA 413   Instructor: Jeff Goodwin   Tuesday, 3:30\u20136:10 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note: conflicts with Principles of Biology RCT (Tuesday, 3:30 p.m.-6:15 p.m.), Physics I RCT (Tuesday, 5:00 p.m.-6:15 p.m.), and Intro Experimental Physics I Lab (Tuesday, 2:00 p.m.-5:00 p.m.).   There was a time not so long ago when a critical engagement with the writings of Karl Marx was considered an obligatory intellectual and political rite of passage. No serious intellectual or political activist could not read Marx\u2014whether one ultimately accepted or rejected Marx\u2019s ideas, in whole or in part. Is this still true? Are Marx\u2019s ideas, or some of them, still relevant? Which of his ideas remain important or valuable for people who wish to understand\u2014and perhaps to change\u2014the contemporary world? Which of Marx\u2019s ideas are problematic or pass\u00e9? To address these questions, this seminar critically examines some of Marx\u2019s most important writings, including The Communist Manifesto , The German Ideology , The Civil War in France , and\u2014above all\u2014 Capital , Marx\u2019s magnum opus. In assessing the contemporary relevance of Marx\u2019s ideas, we also read several efforts by Marx\u2019s followers to understand a range of important phenomena, including the nature of the state, current US politics, and the ongoing economic crisis. JEFF GOODWIN is Professor of Sociology. He has written extensively about social movements, revolutions, and terrorism. His books include The Social Movements Reader ; Contention in Context ; Passionate Politics ; and No Other Way Out: States and Revolutionary Movements, 1945\u20131991 . He is currently writing a book about why states and rebels sometimes employ terrorism as a strategy. He is a winner of the College\u2019s Golden Dozen Award for Teaching Excellence.   What is College For?   FRSEM-UA 474   Instructor: Trace Jordan   Wednesday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note: conflicts with Principles of Biology I RCT (Wednesday, 2:00 p.m.-4:45 p.m.), and Physics I RCT (Wednesday, 2:00 p.m.-3:15 p.m.).   Why did you decide to attend college? To broaden your intellectual horizons and become a more open-minded person? To gain specialized knowledge? To achieve a more successful and financially rewarding career? To make new friends? To become an engaged participant in a democratic society? To satisfy your parents\u2019 plans for your future? Or perhaps some combination of these reasons that you are still figuring out? This seminar examines historical and contemporary discussions about the personal and social goals of higher education and studies issues that have the potential to profoundly transform the college experience in coming years. It also prompts students to be more reflective and purposeful about their own academic choices at NYU.   TRACE JORDAN is Clinical Professor and Associate Director of the College Core Curriculum. His research interests and publications include the role of science education in a liberal arts curriculum, the use of computer simulations for teaching and learning chemistry, and the impact of interest and motivation on educational engagement and achievement. Professor Jordan is a two-time winner of the College\u2019s Golden Dozen Award for Teaching Excellence.   Social Challenges of Climate Change   FRSEM-UA 212   Instructor: Eric Klinenberg   Wednesday, 2:00-4:40 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note: conflicts with Principles of Biology I I RCT (Wednesday, 2:00 p.m.-4:45 p.m.) and Physics I I RCT (Wednesday, 2:00 p.m.-3:15  p.m.).   Climate change is a \u201cwicked problem,\u201d so daunting, complex, and consequential that it\u2019s difficult to comprehend and analyze, let alone solve. It\u2019s also an urgent problem, because in all likelihood we have a limited time frame to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, lest we create irreversible and catastrophic changes to the ecosystem that sustains human life. This seminar examines whether and how the social sciences can help us understand the challenge of climate change. We will briefly overview climate science and learn about the rise of \u201cweird weather,\u201d but the core themes of the course concern questions about communication and cognition, cultural values and material consumption, politics and persuasion, mitigation and adaptation, economics and social justice, power and social movements, and the possibility of creating new, more sustainable ways of living on earth. We will dedicate several sessions to Superstorm Sandy and its aftermath, with a focus on the question of how to rebuild a more resilient city and region in anticipation of more extreme weather events.   ERIC KLINENBERG is Professor of Sociology and Director of the Institute of Public Knowledge at NYU, as well as Research Director for the federal government's Rebuild by Design competition. He's the author of the acclaimed books Heat Wave , Fighting for Air , Going Solo , and Modern Romance (with Aziz Ansari). In addition to his scholarship, Professor Klinenberg has contributed to The New Yorker, Rolling Stone, The New York Times Magazine, and This American Life .     Branding: People, Places, Things   FRSEM-UA 422   Instructor: Richard L. Lewis   Tuesday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note: conflicts with Principles of Biology RCT ( Tuesday , 2:00 p.m.-4:45 p.m.) , and Intro Experimental Physics I Lab (Tuesday, 2:00 p.m.- 5:00 p.m.).   Brands help us avoid making the same decisions over and over by building bridges of trust; it\u2019s reassuring that a visit to McDonald\u2019s is pretty much the same all around the world. Brands provide information, advice, smiles, and community, using a variety of rational and emotional tools to connect with us. Even brand owners are sometimes uncertain as to how their brand has cemented a relationship with an audience. This course analyzes what makes brands tick: how they\u2019re created, and how time, technology, distribution, competitors, and consumers force them to change. We also examine the dark side of brands\u2019 magnetism. Finally, we examine our budding, personal brands, or reputations, which is how our family, friends, enemies, teachers and bosses evaluate us.   RICHARD L. LEWIS is an independent marketing consultant who solves business, branding, and strategic problems for companies, professionals, and individuals. He was the longtime Managing Director at TBWA/Chiat/Day, and has written two bestselling books about advertising. He has also taught at Yale College.   The Doctor\u2019s Dilemma: Being Both Correct and Right   FRSEM-UA 379   Instructor: Michael E. Makover   Thursday, 6:20\u20138:50 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note: conflicts with Advanced General Chemistry I Lab ( Thursday, 2:30 p.m.\u20136:45 p.m.).   Dr. Saul Farber, former Dean of the NYU School of Medicine, frequently cautioned that just because an action or conclusion was correct did not mean that it was right . Ethics, laws, and religious and cultural beliefs intersect in every medical encounter and healthcare issue, affecting patients\u2019 options and care. The challenging issues to be studied and debated in this seminar include the following: Should doctors help terminal patients die to relieve intractable suffering? Should doctors participate in executions or in the interrogation of terrorists? Do we want to know so much about our genetic makeup that we are faced with terribly difficult consequences of that knowledge? Is \u201calternative medicine\u201d a reasonable alternative? What makes a good doctor good? Who should pay for your healthcare? The course aims to teach students how to address such questions by learning to think like doctors and scientists, to apply logic tempered by human values and experience, to analyze information critically, and to present ideas effectively and honestly.   MICHAEL E. MAKOVER is Clinical Assistant Professor of Medicine at the NYU School of Medicine and Attending Physician at the NYU Medical Center. He is also the Chief Medical Officer for a major union. An internist and rheumatologist, he is the author of Mismanaged Care , as well as articles on healthcare quality, ethics, and economics, and is currently writing another book entitled 120 Years Young . He was an aide to Senator Robert F. Kennedy and a spokesman for the American Cancer Society and the New York Heart Association.   Literary Theory and Its Applications   FRSEM-UA 355   Instructor: John Maynard   Tuesday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note: conflicts with Principles of Biology RCT (Tuesday, 2:00 p.m.-4:45 p.m.) and Intro Experimental Physics I Lab (Tuesday, 2:00 p.m.-5:00 p.m.).   Students in this seminar read a selection of essays from major thinkers about literature, mainly from the latter half of the twentieth century to the present, and learn to evaluate different approaches. They complete the course by preparing a discussion of a work of literature using one or more of the conceptual approaches they have studied. Emphasis is placed on learning how to analyze theoretical problems and how to improvise in applying them to new situations. The seminar is recommended for students interested in any area of the humanities.   JOHN MAYNARD is Professor of English at NYU. His interests include literary interpretation, readers and reading, literary theory, biography, and Victorian and modern literature. He has published books on a variety of subjects in Victorian literature and is editor of Victorian Literature and Culture . His most recent book is on readers and reading. From 1983 to 1989, he served as chair of the Department of English. He likes New York City, New York theater, and bicycling.   Great Science, Fabulous Science, and Voodoo Science   FRSEM-UA 457   Instructor: Allen Mincer   Wednesday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note: conflicts with Principles of Biology I RCT (Wednesday, 2:00 p.m.-4:45 p.m.) and Physics I RCT (Wednesday, 2:00 p.m.-3:15  p.m.).   Science is often portrayed as following a very clearly-defined set of procedures: start with a hypothesis, do an experiment and, based on the results, reject the hypothesis or adopt it as a working assumption. The actual process, however, is rarely so straightforward. In addition, the stories as usually told or recorded may differ from what really happened. For most of the semester, we study some famous, some lesser known, and some infamous experiments, mainly in the physical sciences, selected to illustrate intellectual tours de force, sloppiness, error, self-deception, and fraud, and the sometimes murky boundaries between them. Along the way, issues such as the discarding of \u201cfaulty data,\u201d theoretical bias, and probabilistic tools for hypothesis acceptance and rejection are discussed. In the latter part of the semester, we discuss how scientific ideas are evaluated by the media, in the courtroom, and in government.   Prerequisites: students must have taken high school chemistry, physics, and calculus.   ALLEN MINCER, Collegiate Professor and Professor of Physics, specializes in experimental particle physics and particle astrophysics. He is currently a member of the ATLAS collaboration, which is studying the nature of the elementary building blocks of matter at the CERN Large Hadron Collider in Geneva, Switzerland. His research at NYU has a long, continuous history of generous support by grants from the National Science Foundation. He is co-author of approximately 400 scientific publications, including the discovery of the top quark with the D-Zero collaboration and the discovery of a particle consistent with the Standard Model Higgs Boson with the ATLAS Collaboration. In addition to teaching in the Physics Department, he has taught in the Steinhardt School\u2019s Department of Teaching and Learning, been involved in research in physics education, and has twice been awarded the College\u2019s Golden Dozen Award for Teaching Excellence.   The Writer in New York   FRSEM-UA 367   Instructor: Vincent Passaro   Thursday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note: conflicts with Principles of Biology RCT (Thursday, 2:00 p.m.-4:45 p.m.) , Physics I RCT ( Thursday, 2:00 p.m.-3:15 p.m.), and Advanced General Chem I Lab (Thursday, 2:30 p.m.-6:45 p.m.).   This seminar presents New York as a kind of super-literary event, a vivid aesthetic and social organism that enlarges and tunes the artistic imagination and the writer\u2019s crucial powers of observation. We examine how a number of writers have negotiated\u2014and how the city has powerfully influenced\u2014the fragile construction of their literary art and their personal identities. We attend to the perennial difficulties of money and competition that preoccupies most writers living here, the stress that characterizes both life in New York and the life of the writer, and how those strained lives have helped to create a kind of literary tradition of their own. Through the readings\u2014from Whitman to James, from Crane to Millay to Fitzgerald, from the Beats to the Downtown writers to recent web postings\u2014we try to understand the New York writer\u2019s particular forms of misery and joy.   VINCENT PASSARO is the author of the New York novel Violence, Nudity, Adult Content . His widely anthologized short fiction, essays, criticism and reviews have appeared in GQ , Esquire , Harper\u2019s Magazine , The Nation , the New York Times Magazine , and the London Sunday Times Magazine , among other venues, and he has written online for Salon.com and Mr. Beller\u2019s Neighborhood , a site dedicated to stories from New York.   Xenophon of Athens\u2014Cavalry Commander and Socratic Philosopher   FRSEM-UA 514   Instructor: Vincent Renzi   Tuesday, 12:30-3:15 p.m.    Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note: conflicts with Principles of Biology II RCT (Tuesday, 12:3 0 p.m.-3:15 p.m.) and Physics I I Lecture (Tuesday  &amp; Thursday, 12:30 p.m.-1:45 p.m. ) .   The greatest ancient you\u2019ve never heard of, Xenophon of Athens (c. 425\u2013355 B.C.E.) was a brilliant general, student of Socrates, and renowned author. His heroism leading the army of the Ten Thousand inspired the conquests of Alexander the Great and Julius Caesar. His political philosophy informed the thought of Cicero, Machiavelli, Franklin, and Jefferson. When knowledge of Greek was still required for admission to college, his fame was ubiquitous, as his writings formed the basis of the pre-college curriculum. Readings, in English translation: Apology of Socrates, Symposium, Memorabilia, Cyropaedia, Cavalry Commander, Anabasis , and the film based on the latter, The Warriors (1979). VINCENT RENZI is Clinical Professor in the Foundations of Contemporary Culture and of Classics, and is a director of undergraduate studies for the College Core Curriculum. A scholar of ancient Greek philosophy, he also has interests in arts and aesthetics and in 19th and 20th century philosophy, and is a recipient of the College's Golden Dozen Award for Teaching Excellence.   The Image of Business in American Literature   FRSEM-UA 440   Instructor: Saul Rosenberg   Friday, 9:30 a.m.\u201312:00 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note: conflicts with General Ch emistry I recitations (Friday, 9:30 a.m.\u201312:1 5 p.m.) and with Advanced Ch emistry I recitation (Friday, 9:30 a.m.\u201310:45 a .m.).   What is the relationship between virtue, material success, and happiness? This course asks how some of the most engaging American writers and filmmakers have treated the central ideas of business from the nation\u2019s founding to the present. How did the idea of \u201cdoing well by doing good\u201d fare as the Republic grew? We examine classic mid-19th century writers\u2019 thoughts about \u201cgetting and spending\u201d and reactions to the moral collapse inherent in the \u201cbusiness\u201d of slavery. We observe how our theme fared with the emergence in the later 19th century of the \u201crobber barons,\u201d the rise of the corporation, and the enormous influx of immigrants. For the 20th century, we look at films Greed and Wall Street and novels such as The Great Gatsby and The Fountainhead . The course finishes with reflections on the recent financial crisis.   SAUL ROSENBERG earned a PhD in American Literature from Columbia and degrees from Berkeley and Cambridge. In addition to teaching at NYU, he has taught American literature at Columbia University and the 92nd Street Y, and served as associate editor of Commentary magazine. He is a consultant at McKinsey &amp; Company, the leading management consulting firm, where he manages publishing and knowledge management programs. He writes regularly on books for the Wall Street Journal .   History, Memory, and the Quest for Social Justice in the U.S.   FRSEM-UA 437   Instructor: Jack Salzman   Wednesday, 11:00 a.m.\u20131:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note: conflicts with Experimental Physics I Lab ( Wednesday 9:00 a.m.\u201312:00 p.m.)  and Principles of Biology I RCT (Wednesday, 11:00 a.m.-1:45 p.m.).   This course explores the relationship between history and memory in the United States from the mid-20th century to the present. One of its primary objectives is to address the ethics of memory. Do we remember events not as they are but as we are? Do we have an obligation to remember events from the past? If we do, which events must we remember, and how do we remember those we did not experience? Or, as Marc Aug\u00e9 argues, is it essential for the health of the individual and of society that we know how to forget? We consider such events and issues as the response to the Holocaust; internment camps for Japanese Americans; racial segregation; the bombing of Dresden and Hiroshima; anticommunism; the Civil Rights Movement; the destruction of the World Trade Center, and genocides in Rwanda and Darfur. We address the role that museums, photography, film, and popular culture have in defining our individual and collective memory.   JACK SALZMAN served as the Director of the Center for American Culture Studies at Columbia University and editor of Prospects: An Annual of American Cultural Studies . He is the Editor-in-Chief of the Encyclopedia of African American Culture and History . Much of his work has been devoted to the relationship between African Americans and American Jews, including Struggles in the Promised Land (with Cornel West) and Bridges and Boundaries , the catalog for an exhibition at the Jewish Museum in New York. He recently completed We Remember the Children , a collection of memoirs by Holocaust survivors. He is writing a book on the impact of the Holocaust on Jews and social justice in the US. Professor Salzman has received the Distinguished Teaching Award and two Fulbrights.   The Cultural Nature of Language   FRSEM-UA 496   Instructor: Bambi Schieffelin   Friday, 9:30 a.m.\u201312:00 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note: conflicts with General Chem I RCT (Friday, 9:30 a.m.-12:15 p.m.) and Advanced General Chem I RCT ( Friday , 9:30 a.m.-10:45 a .m.).   Whether it\u2019s accents, pronouns, swearing, or spelling, how one uses language is never value-free. In this seminar we examine language-using as a social practice, and analyze how speakers and their language(s) are evaluated and regulated across a range of contexts and cultures. Starting with how children learn to talk, or don\u2019t (e.g., feral children), we examine speech and silence across a range of societies. We look at popular attitudes toward language and the practices by which people regulate its use in the media (e.g., political correctness), in legal and educational institutions (e.g., \u201cEnglish Only\u201d), and in multilingual cities (e.g., Barcelona, Montreal) in order to understand how ideas about language are often recruited to non-linguistic concerns, such as who should be included and who excluded. In thinking about the cultural nature of language in this way, we critically explore issues of identity and authority. BAMBI SCHIEFFELIN is Collegiate Professor and Professor of Anthropology. A linguistic anthropologist, she is the author of The Give and Take of Everyday Life: Language Socialization of Kaluli Children and co-editor of, among other books, The Acquisition of Literacy: Ethnographic Perspectives ; Language Ideologies: Practice and Theory ; and Consequences of Contact . She has also published articles in the preeminent journals of her field. She is completing a book on the impact of Christianity on the language and social life of Bosavi people of Papua New Guinea over the past twenty-five years, and continues research on linguistic creativity and change as evidenced in computer-mediated communication such as IM. Professor Schieffelin received the College\u2019s Golden Dozen Award for Teaching Excellence in 2010.   The Supreme Court and the Religion Clauses: Religion and State in America   FRSEM-UA 218   Instructor: John E. Sexton   Wednesday, 6:30 p.m.\u20138:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note: conflicts with Principles of Biology I RCT ( Wednesday, 6:3 0 p.m.\u20137 :45 p.m.).   Should members of the Native American Church be allowed to smoke peyote at religious ceremonies? Can a public high school invite a rabbi to give a benediction and convocation at graduation? Should a state legislator rely on his or her religious convictions in forming a view about the legality of capital punishment or abortion? The course divides these questions into three subject areas: religious liberty; separation of church and state; and the role of religion in public and political life. It focuses on how the Supreme Court has dealt with these areas and, more important, invites students to construct anew a vision of the proper relationship between religion, state, and society in a twenty-first-century liberal constitutional democracy. Most students consider the workload for this course very heavy; please do not enroll unless you are willing and eager to perform at a high and demanding level.   JOHN E. SEXTON, President of New York University, was the Dean of the NYU Law School from 1988 to 2002. He has taught courses on the Constitution and the courts, and has led seminars on the intersection of religion and the law. Before he came to NYU, he served as law clerk for Chief Justice Warren Burger of the US Supreme Court, and has testified frequently before the US Congress. In addition to his law degree, he holds a doctorate in the history of American religion.   Computational Thought   FRSEM-UA 385   Instructor: Dennis E. Shasha    Monday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note : conflicts with Intro Experimental Physics I Lab (Monday, 12:30 p.m.-3:30 p.m.).   Prerequisites: AP calculus, discrete mathematics, or programming experience Computational technology and methods lie at the core of modern science, commerce, entertainment, and, regrettably, war. There are very powerful ideas underlying the field that have roots in mathematics, linguistics, engineering, and even philosophy. Some of its greatest inventions were born in caf\u00e9s or as responses to a puzzle. Some recent algorithmic methods come from studying ants and evolution. This course introduces computational thinking as it builds on logic, linguistics, heuristics, artificial intelligence, and biological computing. The learning style combines straight lecture, interactive discussions of puzzles and games, and short computer programs (in the programming language Python which you will learn). Students make a few presentations during the semester about topics such as the solutions to computationally motivated puzzles, the relative power of linguistic descriptions, and their very own simulations of either an auction or a multi-bank elevator. The goal is for students to learn to think about computation from multiple perspectives and to synthesize those perspectives when faced with unsolved challenges. DENNIS SHASHA is Professor of Computer Science at the Courant Institute of New York University where he works with biologists on pattern discovery for network inference; with computational chemists on algorithms for protein design; with physicists and financial specialists on algorithms for time series; on clocked computation for DNA computing; and on computational reproducibility. Other areas of interest include database tuning as well as tree and graph matching. Because he likes to type, he has written six books of puzzles about a mathematical detective named Dr. Ecco, a volume of the biographies of great computer scientists, and a book about the future of computing. He has also written five technical books about database tuning, biological pattern recognition, time series, DNA computing, statistics, and causal inference in molecular networks. He has co-authored over seventy journal papers, seventy conference papers, and twenty patents. Professor Shasha has also written the puzzle column for various publications including Scientific American .   America\u2019s Role in International Affairs since World War II   FRSEM-UA 405   Instructor: James B. Sitrick   Wednesday, 3:30\u20136:00 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note: conflicts with Principles of Biology I RCT ( Wednesday, 3:3 0 p.m.\u20136:15 p.m.) and Physics I RCT (Wednesday, 5:00 p.m.-6:15 p.m.).   This seminar explores America\u2019s role in international affairs since World War II, interweaving current foreign policy challenges into the conversation. To provide historical perspective, the class first reads George F. Kennan\u2019s classic book American Diplomacy, 1900\u20131950 . Subsequent topics include the creation of the UN during the late 1940s and some of its more recent activities, including possible reform; the CIA; the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962; US involvement in Vietnam in the 1960s and early 1970s; US involvement in the Middle East (particularly with respect to Israel, Iran, and Iraq); the imperial presidency (comparing Arthur Schlesinger Jr.\u2019s celebrated 1973 book on the subject with the actions of the Bush 43 administration); and the foreign policy challenges of the Obama administration.   JAMES B. SITRICK serves as Of Counsel to the international law firm of Baker &amp; McKenzie, which has offices in seventy cities in forty countries. He previously served as chairman and CEO of Coudert Brothers, the oldest international law firm in the United States. His government and NGO service includes extensive work for the Department of the Treasury in drafting international legislation and negotiating treaties with foreign countries. He has also served as secretary general of the World Federation of United Nations Associations. In addition, he serves as a trustee of many American and European cultural institutions, as well as on the Arts and Science Board of Overseers at NYU.   First Amendment Freedom of Expression   FRSEM-UA 235   Instructor: Stephen D. Solomon    Monday and Wednesday, 11:00 a.m.\u201312:15 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note: conflicts with Introductory Experimental Physics I Lecture (Monday , 11:00 a.m.\u201312:15 p.m .) ,  Intro Experimental Physics I Lab (Wednesday, 9:00 a.m.-12:00 p.m.), and Principles of Biology I RCT (Wednesday, 11:00 a.m.-12:15 p.m.).   Prerequisites: A score of 4 o r 5 in either AP U.S. History OR in AP U.S. Government and Politics (or equivalent international exam) ; both recommended.   Conflicts over freedom of speech and the press erupt into public debate almost every week. Congress passes a law to purge indecency from online communications. A judge issues an order shutting down a website that publishes secret documents. Reporters go to jail for refusing to reveal the identity of sources. Although the First Amendment appears on its face to prohibit any governmental restrictions on speech and the press, the Supreme Court in fact balances free and open expression against other vital social interests. The starting point of this course, which involves both history and law, is the robust debate that occurred in the early Republic over prosecutions for seditious libel (the crime of criticizing the government or public officials). We examine how the Supreme Court has interpreted freedom of expression by looking at a rich variety of contemporary conflicts, including libel of public and private persons, prior restraints against publication, flag burning, and restrictions on freedom of speech during wartime. STEPHEN D. SOLOMON is Associate Professor in NYU\u2019s Arthur L. Carter Journalism Institute. His book Ellery\u2019s Protest: How One Young Man Defied Tradition &amp; Sparked the Battle over School Prayer tells the story of the controversial Supreme Court decision in which the justices ruled that state-organized prayer and Bible reading in public schools violated the First Amendment. He is currently working on An American Invention: The Founding Generation and the Struggle for Freedom of Speech , to be published by Macmillan. Professor Solomon is a recipient of the College\u2019s Golden Dozen Award for Teaching Excellence. He earned a JD at Georgetown University Law Center.   The Problem of Beauty   FRSEM-UA 550   Instructor: G. Gabrielle Starr   Tuesday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note: conflicts with Principles of Biology I RCT (Tuesday, 2:00 p.m.-4:45 p.m.) and Intro Experimental Physics I Lab (Tuesday, 2:00 p.m.-5:00 p.m.).   What is beauty for? It is common in many circumstances to think of beauty as \u201cmerely\u201d beautiful\u2014something nice to have, but an unnecessary add-on to what really matters. This hasn\u2019t always been the case. Beauty has played an important part in philosophy, ethics and theology, and now it is playing an increasingly interesting role in biology, neuroscience, social policy, and design. But what is beauty, anyway? And why should we care? This course explores the role of beauty across a variety of disciplines and across \u201clong time\u201d (not just the period from the ancient world to the present, but even the long time of evolution).   G. GABRIELLE STARR is Professor of English and Seryl Kushner Dean of the College of Arts and Science. She has published widely on eighteenth-century British literature and the history of the aesthetic. With collaborators in NYU\u2019s Center for Neural Science, she has pursued research in the field of neuroaesthetics and published the results in Frontiers in Human Neuroscience . In addition, Dean Starr has just published a book entitled Feeling Beauty: Aesthetic Experience in the Brain and Across the Arts.   Welcome to College: The Novel   FRSEM-UA 371   Instructor: Carol Sternhell   Wednesday, 12:30 p.m.\u20133:00 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note: conflicts with Principles of Biology I RCT ( Wednesday, 12:30 p.m.\u20133:1 5 p.m.) and Physics I RCT ( Wednesday, 2:00 p.m.\u20133 :15 p.m.).   Starting college can be exhilarating\u2014and terrifying. A chance for intellectual enlightenment\u2014or intense loneliness. An escape from a stultifying small town of narrow-minded people\u2014or a riot of alcohol, sex, and drugs. In this class we read a selection of college novels from different historical periods, ranging from F. Scott Fitzgerald\u2019s This Side of Paradise to Tom Wolfe\u2019s I Am Charlotte Simmons . We discuss these novels from a variety of perspectives: literary, historical, and journalistic. In addition to presenting biographical and historical and cultural reports on at least two of the authors and their novels, students write about their own experiences as first-year students at NYU in several genres, including fiction and nonfiction. Together we explore this important life passage, examining life as we live it.   CAROL STERNHELL is Associate Professor of Journalism and a Director of the Arthur L. Carter Journalism Institute\u2019s Studio 20 graduate program. She created the department\u2019s study-away programs in London, Prague, and Accra and was also a founder of the Women\u2019s Studies major (now Gender and Sexuality Studies). She has written extensively about feminism, motherhood, and literature for a variety of publications. Before coming to NYU, she worked as an editor at Newsday , a general assignment reporter for the New York Post , and a freelance magazine writer. She received the College\u2019s Golden Dozen Award for Teaching Excellence in 2005.   School and Society: NYU in the Sixties and Seventies   FRSEM-UA 255   Instructor: Arthur Tannenbaum   Tuesday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note: conflicts with Intro Experimental Physics I Lab ( Tuesday, 2:00 p.m.-5 :00 p.m.) and Principles of Biology I RCT ( Tuesday, 2:00 p.m.-4:4 5 p.m.).   The 1960s and 1970s brought profound changes in American society, changes mirrored in the history of the nation, academe, and New York University. It was a time that witnessed the struggle for civil rights, assassinations, war abroad and riots at home, and a youth-led revolution in music, dress, and values. This course aims to develop an appreciation of those years by examining the events and the reactions as they affected campuses and students across America. Students prepare reports on different aspects of the era and work on group projects. In both cases, and in the spirit of the times, the topics are self-chosen with the approval of the group and the seminar leader.   ARTHUR TANNENBAUM is Associate Curator and Social Work Librarian in the Bobst Library, and has also taught in the English Department. First as a student and then as a faculty member, he has been at NYU for more than thirty years. In 1992 he received the University\u2019s Distinguished Teaching Medal in recognition for his work with students.   Language and Reality in Modern Science and Literature   FRSEM-UA 210   Instructor: Friedrich Ulfers   Tuesday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note: conflicts with Principles of Biology I RCT ( Tuesday, 2:00 p.m.\u20134:4 5 p.m.) and Intro Experimental Physics I Lab ( Tuesday, 2:00 p.m.\u20135:00 p.m.).   The course explores the possibility that there exists a common ground between the two cultures of science and the humanities. It posits the hypothesis of a correlation between postclassical science (e.g., quantum theory) and \u201cpostmodern\u201d literature and philosophy. Among the key notions examined are Heisenberg\u2019s \u201cuncertainty principle\u201d and the \u201cundecidability\u201d of deconstructive theory. The discussion of these notions and of their implications in literary works revolves around their effect on classical logic, the referential function of language, and the traditional goal of a complete explanation/description of reality.

Reading The Dream of the Red Chamber   FRSEM-UA 461   Instructor: Jing Wang   Monday, 3:30\u20136:10 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note: conflicts with Introductory Experimental Physics I Lab ( Monday, 12:30 p.m.\u20133:30 p.m.) .   Cao Xueqin\u2019s mid-18th century literary epic The Dream of the Red Chamber is widely regarded as the culmination of the vernacular novel of imperial China. With a tragic love story between two aristocratic teenagers at its dramatic center, it covers a vast terrain of culture and social life\u2014the question of what is eternal and what is ephemeral; the nature of \u201cqing,\u201d as the heart of being that both animates and destroys life; individual talent and its fragility; the decadence of the elite; and growing, if hidden, social and class tensions. The novel\u2019s manifold structure and intricate plot development, coupled with its dazzling array of memorable characters, makes it one of the most complex and colorful of all time. Note: Both reading and discussions are conducted in English. No knowledge of Chinese culture, language, or history is required or assumed. Native Chinese speakers who wish to read and enjoy this masterpiece in the original language are advised to choose a different Freshman Seminar and take Reading The Dream of the Red Chamber (EAST-UA 228) as an elective course in the future.

Telling Their Own Stories: The Irish in New York City   FRSEM-UA 540   Instructor: Linda Dowling Almeida   Tuesday, 2:00-4:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note: conflicts with Principles of Biology RCT (Tuesday, 2:00 p.m.-4:45 p.m.) and Intro Experimental Physics I Lab (Tuesday, 2:00 p.m.-5:00 p.m.).   This interdisciplinary seminar focuses on oral history as a resource for understanding the 20th century history of the Irish in America, particularly in New York. Students will explore the discipline as it has progressed over the last twenty years, developing their own research, writing, and interviewing skills along the way and enjoying access to the 300+ interviews in Glucksman Ireland House's Oral History holdings in the Archives of Irish America. The course will demonstrate how oral history gives life to ethnic communities like those of the Irish longshoremen who worked Chelsea Piers in the West Village before it was an entertainment destination, personalizes dramatic events like 9/11, or provides insight into to why John Patrick Shanley wrote Doubt . In addition to traditional texts, we will listen to and conduct interviews, read Irish-American fiction, walk the streets of the communities we study, and screen films and documentaries exploring the lives of Irish Americans. This course will introduce students not only to oral history but to the history of the Irish in America.   LINDA DOWLING ALMEIDA, Adjunct Assistant Professor of Irish Studies at NYU\u2019s Glucksman Ireland House, teaches classes in the history and literature of Irish America. Her book Irish Immigrants in New York City, 1945-1995 compares the experience of the Irish who arrived in the 1950s with that of their counterparts thirty and forty years later. Professor Almeida has published chapters in The Irish World Wide , Ireland in the 1950s , and Making the Irish American , and has delivered papers on pedagogical approaches to oral history to both the Oral History Association and the International Oral History Association. Her latest project involves the production of podcasts on a variety of themes and issues drawn from the archives.   Propaganda Portraits: Royal Imagery in the Age of Absolutism   FRSEM-UA 488   Instructor: William Ambler   Wednesday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note: conflicts with Principles of Biology RCT  ( Wednesday, 2:00 p.m.- 4:45  p . m . ) and Physics I RCT ( Wednesda y, 2:00 p.m.-3:15p.m.).    This course studies the relationship between art and politics in European baroque state portraiture. In the 17th century, with few means to reach a broad populace, depictions of the king played a central part in convincing the people of a monarch\u2019s legitimate authority. The most talented artists of the age glorified their kings in ways that gave visual form to political theories that justified increasingly centralized royal rule. We set the portraits in the context of debates that preoccupied the European courts of the time: the Reformation; the dynastic ambitions of European royal houses; and political theories of legitimate government. We also consider the position of artists at a royal court and preexisting traditions of royal imagery.   WILLIAM AMBLER is an independent art historian with expertise in Spanish baroque art and eighteenth-century English architecture. He has been a curator at the Hispanic Society of America in New York City and has participated in exhibitions there, as well as at the Metropolitan Museum, Jewish Museum, and Federal Reserve in Washington, D.C.   Global Citizenship: Theory and Practice   FRSEM-UA 484   Instructor: Ulrich Baer   Wednesday, 2:00-4:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note: conflicts with Principles of Biology RCT (Wednesday, 2:00 p.m.-4:45 p.m.) and Physics I RCT (Wednesday, 2:00 p.m.-3:15p.m.).   This seminar explores the notion and practice of global citizenship\u2014the capacity and willingness to think across and beyond actual and imagined boundaries, and to develop skills that can solve problems and explore opportunities in unfamiliar contexts. The course examines globalization as a historical, economic, and cultural phenomenon. Topics include local resistance to global homogeneity; the notion of universal humanism; human rights; the role of language in global contexts; the idea of citizenship; the specificity of culture and arts; the idea of film or photography as universal languages; and an exploration of New York City as an international city that has turned its diversity into strength. The seminar brings in guest speakers who identify as global citizens, and asks students to consider how their own actions\u2014ranging from activism to business leadership\u2014may have an impact on those outside their immediate world.   ULRICH BAER, Vice Provost of Arts, Humanities, and Multicultural Affairs and Professor of Comparative Literature and German, was awarded the College\u2019s Golden Dozen Award for Excellence in Teaching in 1998 and 2004.

He has also published widely on photography and has co-taught a seminar entitled \u201cArchive, Image, Text\u201d with Professor Shelley Rice from the Tisch School of the Arts.   Game Theory and the Humanities   FRSEM-UA 506   Instructor: Steven J. Brams   Wednesday, 4:55\u20137:25 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note: conflicts with Principles of Biology RCT (Wednesday, 5:00 p.m.-7:45 p.m.) and Physics I RCT (Wednesday, 5:00 p.m.-6:15p.m.).   Game theory is a mathematical theory of strategy that has been applied to the analysis of conflict and cooperation in such fields as economics, political science, and biology. In this seminar, we discuss more unusual applications\u2014to history, literature, philosophy, the Bible, theology, and law. We discuss Abraham\u2019s decision to offer his son Isaac for sacrifice; the choices made by accused witches and their persecutors in medieval witch trials; Lady Macbeth's incitement of her husband to murder King Duncan in Shakespeare\u2019s play; several strategic games played by presidents and their antagonists in domestic crises (e.g., the Civil War) and international crises (e.g., the Cuban missile crisis), and coping mechanisms used by characters in catch-22 games (including those in Joseph Heller's novel Catch-22 ).   Prerequisite: No mathematical background beyond high school mathematics is assumed, but a willingness to learn and apply sophisticated reasoning to analyze the interactions of players in games is essential. STEVEN J. BRAMS is Professor of Politics at NYU. He is the author of several books\u2014most recently, Mathematics and Democracy and Game Theory and the Humanities \u2014that apply game theory and social choice theory to voting and elections, bargaining and fairness, international relations, and the Bible, theology and literature.

He is an American Association for the Advancement of Science Fellow and was a Guggenheim Fellow and Visiting Scholar at the Russell Sage Foundation.    How We See   FRSEM-UA 497   Instructor: Marisa Carrasco   Thursday, 9:30 a.m.\u201312:00 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note: conflicts with Principles of Biology RCT (Thursday, 9:30 a.m.-12:15 p.m. ).   Do we see the world the way we do because we are the way we are or because the world is the way it is? This course looks at what we know about vision from multiple scientific perspectives: perceptual psychology tells us about the process of seeing and provides important insights into the workings of visual mechanisms; neuropsychology shows us what happens to perception when these mechanisms malfunction; neuroscience tells us about processes at the level of cells and neural systems. At the same time, we discuss modes and techniques of scientific inquiry from these different perspectives. How do vision scientists learn? What kinds of experiments do they conduct? How has the development of new neuroimaging techniques (fMRI, for example) shaped the field?   MARISA CARRASCO is Collegiate Professor and Professor of Psychology and Neural Science, as well as a former Chairperson of the Department of Psychology. Born and raised in Mexico City, she received her licentiate in psychology from the National University of Mexico and her PhD in psychology (cognition and perception) from Princeton University. She conducts research in cognitive neuroscience, exploring the relation between the psychological and neural mechanisms involved in visual perception and attention.

Latin America at the Start of the 21st Century: Coming of Age or Continuing Chaos?   FRSEM-UA 306   Instructor: Jorge G. Casta\u00f1eda   Monday, 9:30 a.m.\u201312:00 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note: conflicts with Principles of Biology I Lecture ( Monday, 9:3 0 a.m.\u20131 0:45 a .m.) and Intro Experimental Physics I Lecture ( Monday , 11:00 a.m.\u201312:15 p.m.).   This seminar focuses on Latin America\u2019s longstanding problems and possible solutions to them. It takes up such topics as the absence of orderly, peaceful, and steady democratic governance following independence from colonial rule, and the consolidation of representative democracy today; the slowdown of economic growth in the last 20 years and prospects for a new economic takeoff; the phenomenon of widespread violence, and growing respect for human rights; and how the traditional weakness of civil society is being overcome. For each topic, there are readings dealing with its political, economic, and cultural dimensions in both past and present. JORGE D. CASTA\u00d1EDA is Global Distinguished Professor of Politics and Latin American and Caribbean Studies. Professor at the National Autonomous University of Mexico since 1979, he has also been a visiting professor at the University of California at Berkeley, Princeton, and Dartmouth.

He is the author of, among many other books, Utopia Unarmed: The Latin American Left after the Cold War; Compa\u00f1ero: The Life and Death of Che Guevara; Perpetuating Power; Ex-Mex: From Migrants to Immigrants; and Leftovers: Tales of the Latin American Left (with Marco Morales) He has also written articles for many newspapers and magazines in Mexico, the United States, and other countries.   Literature and Machines   FRSEM-UA 572   Instructor: Nicola Cipani   Thursday, 12:30 p.m.\u20133:00 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note: conflicts with Principles of Biology RCT (Thursday, 12:30 p.m.-4:45 p.m.), Physics I Lecture ( Thursday, 12:30 p.m.-1:45 p.m.), Physics I RCT (Thursday, 2:00 p.m.-3:15 p.m. ), and Advanced General Chem I Lab (Thursday, 2:30 p.m.-6:45 p.m.).    Machine metaphors play an important role in modern literature, conveying beliefs, anxieties, shifts, and reflections on key topics, including the nature of consciousness and creativity; the dynamics of desire and gratification; gender roles; the organization of society; the meaning of \u201cnature\u201d; and the function of technology. This course explores different manifestations of the machine theme, broadly clustered around the following categories: imaginary machines constituting the centerpiece of narrative plots; machine aesthetic as modernist ideal; and mechanization of the inventive process (text-generating machines). Students read and discuss a selection of works from different cultural contexts, primarily from the late 19 th and 20 th century (e.g., Belle \u00c9poque, Futurist, and postwar), representing a wide spectrum of attitudes toward the machine, from dreamy immersion in virtual realities to enlightened machine-assisted awakening, from the fear of dehumanization to the desire for man-machine fusion. NICOLA CIPANI is Assistant Clinical Professor at the Department of Italian Studies and has been working at NYU for ten years. His interests include reception of antiquity in medieval and early modern culture, Renaissance philosophy, the intersection of verbal/visual forms (such as the art of memory, emblem books, and representations of dreams), and 20 th -century experimental literature. At the Italian Department he has served in the capacity of Director of Language Programs (since 2005), Director of Summer Programs (2011-12), and Director of Undergraduate Studies (2011, 2013).   In Search of Lost Time   FRSEM-UA 503   Instructor: Marcelle Clements   Thursday, 2:00\u20134:45 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note: conflicts with Principles of Biology RCT (Thursday, 2:00 p.m.-4:45 p.m.), Physics I RCT (Thursday, 2:00 p.m.-3:15 p.m.), and Advanced General Chem I Lab (Thursday, 2:30 p.m.-6:45 p.m.).   We read Marcel Proust (350 pages per week, in translation) as he should be read: hedonistically\u2014with respect and admiration but also with delectation. At more than 4,000 pages, In Search of Lost Time is one of modern literature\u2019s most challenging and pleasurable reads, still unparalleled in how it combines finesse and wit with raw emotion, self-examination with social history, and psychological acuity with a portrait of the French beau monde at the outset of modernity. Though Proust (1871\u20131922) is often cited as France\u2019s greatest novelist, many readers never move past the first fifty pages of his novel, reading the same gorgeous sentences again and again. However, as its architecture cannot be appreciated until it has been read once in its entirety, we move at a brisk pace through all six volumes; when we read the final volume, we can begin to understand the extraordinarily intimate relationship Proust has created with his reader. In-class creative writing exercises are designed to help with the reading and to expand an expressive, personal response.   MARCELLE CLEMENTS is Collegiate Professor and Fellow of the New York Institute for the Humanities at NYU. She is the author of a collection of essays, The Dog Is Us and Other Observations , a book of nonfiction, The Improvised Woman , and two novels, Rock Me and, most recently, Midsummer . Her prizewinning articles and essays on the arts, culture, and politics have appeared in many national publications.   Political Theater   FRSEM-UA 476   Instructor: Eric Dickson   Monday, 2:00-4:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note: conflicts with Intro Experimental Physics I Lab (Monday, 12:30 p.m.-3:30 p.m.).      This interdisciplinary seminar offers a survey of political theater, and of the use of theatrical elements in practical politics, from the ancient Greeks to the present. How have dramatic depictions of politics changed over time? In what ways have political plays been used to advance political agendas, both by the powerful and by dissidents and protest movements? To what extent can we understand political speeches and political campaigns as essentially theatrical productions? In a typical week, students will read one full-length play, accompanied by appropriate readings from political science or social psychology. Through these readings, writing assignments, and class discussion, we address the development of different dramatic techniques and forms throughout the history of theater; the co-evolving relationship between politically-themed spectacles and changing ideas about citizenship and political legitimacy; and the political psychology of speeches and campaign techniques. ERIC S. DICKSON is Associate Professor of Politics and a faculty affiliate in the Department of Psychology. His research interests include political communication, election campaigning, political leadership, and identities in politics. His work, which uses both game theory and social-scientific experiments, focuses on the interface between political strategy and political psychology. He also has an extensive background in theater.   Political Cinema and Representation of the \u201cOther\u201d   FRSEM-UA 463   Instructor: Shimon Dotan   Friday, 9:30 a.m.\u201312:00 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note: conflicts with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m.\u2013 12:15 p.m.) and with Advanced Ch emistry I recitation (Friday, 9:30 a.m.\u201310:45 a .m.).   In contemporary war \u201cthe other\u201d is viewed not only as an enemy to be fought, but often as one to be eliminated. How do filmmakers fight against (or alternately, reinforce) such deadly representations? In exploring various cinematic and thematic elements we will primarily focus on films from one of the world\u2019s most conflict-ridden regions\u2014the Middle East. We will also explore films from Russia, Germany, France and the US. Through readings and film screenings, we will investigate how \u201cthe other\u201d is constructed politically, aesthetically and ethically. This class is designed for anyone interested in filmmaking and film criticism, contemporary politics and history, cinema of conflict and violence, and the ethical questions associated with them. SHIMON DOTAN, a Fellow of the New York Institute of the Humanities at NYU, is an award-winning filmmaker with thirteen feature films to his credit. His films have received the Silver Bear Award at the Berlin Film Festival ( The Smile of the Lamb ), numerous Israeli Academy Awards, including Best Film and Best Director ( Repeat Dive ; The Smile of the Lamb ), and Best Film at the Newport Beach Film Festival ( You Can Thank Me Later ). His film Hot House won the Special Jury Prize at Sundance in 2007. He has taught filmmaking and film studies at Tel Aviv University in Israel and at Concordia University in Montreal and is a member of the Directors and Writers Guilds of America (DGA, WGA).   The Literature of Capitalism   FRSEM-UA 576   Instructor: Thomas Easton   Thursday, 11:00 a.m.\u20141:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note: conflicts with Principles of Biology RCT (Thursday, 11:00 a.m.-1:45 p.m.) and Physics I Lecture (Thursday, 12:30 p.m.-1:45 p.m.).   This course explores how some of the most enduring themes in literature, such as greed, ambition, failure, innovation, prosperity, and opportunity, are reflected in literature about capitalism. Readings are likely to include works by eighteenth-century English essayist Samuel Johnson; children\u2019s book author Horatio Alger and novelist Mark Twain; and contemporary Chinese memoirist Aisling Juanjuan Shen. The nature of property rights, subtle distinctions between success and crime, and the relative value of diligence and luck are other themes we consider. Our discussions about characters and stories are informed by work in economics, ranging from Adam Smith\u2019s writings on productivity and ethics to Thomas Piketty\u2019s writings on income inequality. Weekly essays assigned.   THOMAS EASTON is American finance editor at the Economist , where he previously worked as New York and Hong Kong bureau chief. Earlier in his career, he was the bureau chief for The Baltimore Sun in New York and Tokyo and a senior editor at Forbes . He has taught business reporting and journalism at Columbia\u2019s Graduate School of Journalism. At the Economist , his purview also includes legal coverage. Mr. Easton holds an AB in literature from Brown, an MBA from Columbia Business School, and an MSL from Yale Law School.   Gender, Sexuality and the Law   FRSEM-UA 480   Instructor: Shelley Fischel   Wednesday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note: conflicts with Principles of Biology RCT (Wednesday, 2:00 p.m.-4:45 p.m.), and Physics I RCT (Wednesday, 2:00 p.m.-3:15 p.m).   What impact has law had on gender and sexuality inequalities? What impact could or should law have? This course explores gender and sexuality discrimination in American jurisprudence as it has developed under the Constitution as well as its consequences in the spheres of work, politics, and social life. We address such matters as marriage and divorce law, the Civil Rights Act and Title IX, and the unique, perhaps troubling ways that criminal law treats crimes associated with sexuality, rape, domestic abuse, and sexual orientation. We also address the intersection of these matters with issues of gender identity and sexual orientation. This course offers a history of US sex law and analyzes contemporary doctrinal, judicial, and legislative developments.   SHELLEY D. FISCHEL served as Executive Vice President at Home Box Office, Inc., where she was responsible for Human Resources, Facilities and Real Estate, and labor law matters until her retirement in December 2009. She oversaw all sexual discrimination claims in the company. She received her JD from Columbia University and her LLM from NYU.   Trials of the Century   FRSEM-UA 434   Instructor: Jack Ford    Monday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note: conflicts with Intro Experimental Physics I Lab (Monday, 12:30 p.m.-3:30 p.m.).   How does a trial become viewed as a \u201ctrial of the century\u201d? What does that designation say about the crime and the personalities involved, about the legal, social, and political implications of the case, and about the nature and extent of the attendant media coverage? Since the trial of Socrates, the public has been intrigued, galvanized, and even entertained by the real drama of real trials, which often act as a prism through which society\u2019s strengths and weaknesses are revealed. This course offers in-depth examinations of select \u201ctrials of the century\u201d in the US, approaching each case from a specific angle, from celebrity (the Lindbergh kidnapping case and the trial of O.J. Simpson) to race (the trials of the Scottsboro Boys), politics (the Chicago Seven), and religion (the Scopes Monkey Trial).   JACK FORD is an Emmy and Peabody Award-winning journalist, author, and nationally recognized trial attorney. Currently a CBS News Legal Analyst, he has had a distinguished career on network and cable television. As a litigator, he successfully handled a number of high-profile cases, such as the Northeast\u2019s first death-penalty trial; one of the nation\u2019s first corporate homicide cases; and the Wall Street insider-trading scandal of the late 1980s. He has also written articles for respected legal publications. The recipient of five honorary degrees in recognition of his professional accomplishments and his extensive public service, he has taught at, in addition to NYU, Yale College and Fordham Law School.   Wiseguys, Spies, and Private Eyes: Heroes and Villains in American Culture, Film, and Literature   FRSEM-UA 449   Instructor: Eddy Friedfeld   Thursday, 4:55\u20137:25 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note: conflicts with Advan ced General Chem I Lab (Thursday , 2:30 p.m.-6 :45 p.m.).   This seminar explores the ways in which specific American archetypes and themes are perceived and articulated\u2014from the rugged Old West individualist, to the persevering underdog who becomes a boxing champ, to the Cold War era superspy. We examine representations of heroes and villains in modern American popular culture and how the great films and novels of three particular genres, the Detective, the Gangster, and the Spy, influenced our understanding of these archetypes. From the early influences of Hamlet and Macbeth to Sherlock Holmes, Raymond Chandler\u2019s Philip Marlowe, Mario Puzo\u2019s (and Francis Ford Coppola\u2019s) The Godfather , James Bond, and Batman, we look at the mythology and evolution of heroes and villains through popular and high culture icons, the genesis of the genres and how they developed over time, and how great directors, actors, and writers influenced audiences worldwide and were themselves influenced by culture and history.   EDDY FRIEDFELD is a film and entertainment journalist and historian, as well as an attorney specializing in corporate restructuring. He is the co-author of Caesar\u2019s Hours with comedy legend Sid Caesar, and is working on a book on the history of comedy in America.

He received his BA from Columbia College and his JD from NYU Law School. He also teaches at Yale College.   The New Worlds of Work and Care   FRSEM-UA 500   Instructor: Kathleen Gerson   Wednesday, 3:30\u20136:00 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note: conflicts with Principles of Biology I RCT (Wednesday, 3:30 p.m.-6:15 p.m.) and Physics I RCT (Wednesday, 5:00 p.m.-6:00 p.m.).   The early 21st century represents a period of immense social change in both the public world of work and the private world of family care. New technologies have blurred the boundary between home and work. New opportunities and pressures have sent more women into the workplace. The \u201cnew economy\u201d has created jobs with more short-term flexibility, but less long-term security. And new options in intimate relationships have created more diverse and voluntary, but less predictable, family bonds. These intertwined shifts are reshaping the daily lives and life pathways of American women and men. This seminar addresses several questions: What does an overview of changes in work, family, and gender patterns tell us about where we are now and where we are going? What are the major dilemmas created by these changes, and how are people coping with these conflicts? What are the implications for the future? And what can we do to enhance the opportunities and limit the insecurities of these new social arrangements?   KATHLEEN GERSON, Collegiate Professor and Professor of Sociology, is a recognized authority on the connections among gender, work, and family life in postindustrial societies.

Cities, states, and municipalities serve as what Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis called \u201clittle laboratories for democracy\u201d\u2014where ideas flourish and problems get solved. This course examines the intersection of ideas, politics, and action in cities in the US and around the world, particularly those related to improving the urban environment. We study best practices, evaluate their effectiveness, and determine whether and how successful policies and programs can be replicated. This course asks students to not only think critically about issues of public policy but also to think anew about the role they play in shaping it. Topics for student projects are drawn from current issues and problems facing decision-makers and elected officials in America today.

Professor Gioia holds a BA from New York University and a JD from Georgetown University Law Center.   Is Karl Marx Still Relevant?   FRSEM-UA 413   Instructor: Jeff Goodwin   Tuesday, 3:30\u20136:10 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note: conflicts with Principles of Biology RCT (Tuesday, 3:30 p.m.-6:15 p.m.), Physics I RCT (Tuesday, 5:00 p.m.-6:15 p.m.), and Intro Experimental Physics I Lab (Tuesday, 2:00 p.m.-5:00 p.m.).   There was a time not so long ago when a critical engagement with the writings of Karl Marx was considered an obligatory intellectual and political rite of passage. No serious intellectual or political activist could not read Marx\u2014whether one ultimately accepted or rejected Marx\u2019s ideas, in whole or in part. Is this still true? Are Marx\u2019s ideas, or some of them, still relevant? Which of his ideas remain important or valuable for people who wish to understand\u2014and perhaps to change\u2014the contemporary world? Which of Marx\u2019s ideas are problematic or pass\u00e9? To address these questions, this seminar critically examines some of Marx\u2019s most important writings, including The Communist Manifesto , The German Ideology , The Civil War in France , and\u2014above all\u2014 Capital , Marx\u2019s magnum opus. In assessing the contemporary relevance of Marx\u2019s ideas, we also read several efforts by Marx\u2019s followers to understand a range of important phenomena, including the nature of the state, current US politics, and the ongoing economic crisis. JEFF GOODWIN is Professor of Sociology. He has written extensively about social movements, revolutions, and terrorism. His books include The Social Movements Reader ; Contention in Context ; Passionate Politics ; and No Other Way Out: States and Revolutionary Movements, 1945\u20131991 .

What is College For?   FRSEM-UA 474   Instructor: Trace Jordan   Wednesday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note: conflicts with Principles of Biology I RCT (Wednesday, 2:00 p.m.-4:45 p.m.), and Physics I RCT (Wednesday, 2:00 p.m.-3:15 p.m.).   Why did you decide to attend college? To broaden your intellectual horizons and become a more open-minded person? To gain specialized knowledge? To achieve a more successful and financially rewarding career? To make new friends? To become an engaged participant in a democratic society? To satisfy your parents\u2019 plans for your future? Or perhaps some combination of these reasons that you are still figuring out? This seminar examines historical and contemporary discussions about the personal and social goals of higher education and studies issues that have the potential to profoundly transform the college experience in coming years. It also prompts students to be more reflective and purposeful about their own academic choices at NYU.   TRACE JORDAN is Clinical Professor and Associate Director of the College Core Curriculum. His research interests and publications include the role of science education in a liberal arts curriculum, the use of computer simulations for teaching and learning chemistry, and the impact of interest and motivation on educational engagement and achievement. Professor Jordan is a two-time winner of the College\u2019s Golden Dozen Award for Teaching Excellence.   Social Challenges of Climate Change   FRSEM-UA 212   Instructor: Eric Klinenberg   Wednesday, 2:00-4:40 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note: conflicts with Principles of Biology I I RCT (Wednesday, 2:00 p.m.-4:45 p.m.) and Physics I I RCT (Wednesday, 2:00 p.m.-3:15  p.m.).   Climate change is a \u201cwicked problem,\u201d so daunting, complex, and consequential that it\u2019s difficult to comprehend and analyze, let alone solve. It\u2019s also an urgent problem, because in all likelihood we have a limited time frame to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, lest we create irreversible and catastrophic changes to the ecosystem that sustains human life. This seminar examines whether and how the social sciences can help us understand the challenge of climate change. We will briefly overview climate science and learn about the rise of \u201cweird weather,\u201d but the core themes of the course concern questions about communication and cognition, cultural values and material consumption, politics and persuasion, mitigation and adaptation, economics and social justice, power and social movements, and the possibility of creating new, more sustainable ways of living on earth. We will dedicate several sessions to Superstorm Sandy and its aftermath, with a focus on the question of how to rebuild a more resilient city and region in anticipation of more extreme weather events.   ERIC KLINENBERG is Professor of Sociology and Director of the Institute of Public Knowledge at NYU, as well as Research Director for the federal government's Rebuild by Design competition. He's the author of the acclaimed books Heat Wave , Fighting for Air , Going Solo , and Modern Romance (with Aziz Ansari). In addition to his scholarship, Professor Klinenberg has contributed to The New Yorker, Rolling Stone, The New York Times Magazine, and This American Life .     Branding: People, Places, Things   FRSEM-UA 422   Instructor: Richard L. Lewis   Tuesday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note: conflicts with Principles of Biology RCT ( Tuesday , 2:00 p.m.-4:45 p.m.) , and Intro Experimental Physics I Lab (Tuesday, 2:00 p.m.- 5:00 p.m.).   Brands help us avoid making the same decisions over and over by building bridges of trust; it\u2019s reassuring that a visit to McDonald\u2019s is pretty much the same all around the world. Brands provide information, advice, smiles, and community, using a variety of rational and emotional tools to connect with us. Even brand owners are sometimes uncertain as to how their brand has cemented a relationship with an audience. This course analyzes what makes brands tick: how they\u2019re created, and how time, technology, distribution, competitors, and consumers force them to change. We also examine the dark side of brands\u2019 magnetism. Finally, we examine our budding, personal brands, or reputations, which is how our family, friends, enemies, teachers and bosses evaluate us.   RICHARD L. LEWIS is an independent marketing consultant who solves business, branding, and strategic problems for companies, professionals, and individuals. He was the longtime Managing Director at TBWA/Chiat/Day, and has written two bestselling books about advertising. He has also taught at Yale College.   The Doctor\u2019s Dilemma: Being Both Correct and Right   FRSEM-UA 379   Instructor: Michael E. Makover   Thursday, 6:20\u20138:50 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note: conflicts with Advanced General Chemistry I Lab ( Thursday, 2:30 p.m.\u20136:45 p.m.).   Dr. Saul Farber, former Dean of the NYU School of Medicine, frequently cautioned that just because an action or conclusion was correct did not mean that it was right . Ethics, laws, and religious and cultural beliefs intersect in every medical encounter and healthcare issue, affecting patients\u2019 options and care. The challenging issues to be studied and debated in this seminar include the following: Should doctors help terminal patients die to relieve intractable suffering? Should doctors participate in executions or in the interrogation of terrorists? Do we want to know so much about our genetic makeup that we are faced with terribly difficult consequences of that knowledge? Is \u201calternative medicine\u201d a reasonable alternative? What makes a good doctor good? Who should pay for your healthcare? The course aims to teach students how to address such questions by learning to think like doctors and scientists, to apply logic tempered by human values and experience, to analyze information critically, and to present ideas effectively and honestly.   MICHAEL E. MAKOVER is Clinical Assistant Professor of Medicine at the NYU School of Medicine and Attending Physician at the NYU Medical Center. He is also the Chief Medical Officer for a major union. An internist and rheumatologist, he is the author of Mismanaged Care , as well as articles on healthcare quality, ethics, and economics, and is currently writing another book entitled 120 Years Young . He was an aide to Senator Robert F. Kennedy and a spokesman for the American Cancer Society and the New York Heart Association.   Literary Theory and Its Applications   FRSEM-UA 355   Instructor: John Maynard   Tuesday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note: conflicts with Principles of Biology RCT (Tuesday, 2:00 p.m.-4:45 p.m.) and Intro Experimental Physics I Lab (Tuesday, 2:00 p.m.-5:00 p.m.).   Students in this seminar read a selection of essays from major thinkers about literature, mainly from the latter half of the twentieth century to the present, and learn to evaluate different approaches. They complete the course by preparing a discussion of a work of literature using one or more of the conceptual approaches they have studied. Emphasis is placed on learning how to analyze theoretical problems and how to improvise in applying them to new situations. The seminar is recommended for students interested in any area of the humanities.   JOHN MAYNARD is Professor of English at NYU. His interests include literary interpretation, readers and reading, literary theory, biography, and Victorian and modern literature. He has published books on a variety of subjects in Victorian literature and is editor of Victorian Literature and Culture . His most recent book is on readers and reading. From 1983 to 1989, he served as chair of the Department of English. He likes New York City, New York theater, and bicycling.   Great Science, Fabulous Science, and Voodoo Science   FRSEM-UA 457   Instructor: Allen Mincer   Wednesday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note: conflicts with Principles of Biology I RCT (Wednesday, 2:00 p.m.-4:45 p.m.) and Physics I RCT (Wednesday, 2:00 p.m.-3:15  p.m.).   Science is often portrayed as following a very clearly-defined set of procedures: start with a hypothesis, do an experiment and, based on the results, reject the hypothesis or adopt it as a working assumption. The actual process, however, is rarely so straightforward. In addition, the stories as usually told or recorded may differ from what really happened. For most of the semester, we study some famous, some lesser known, and some infamous experiments, mainly in the physical sciences, selected to illustrate intellectual tours de force, sloppiness, error, self-deception, and fraud, and the sometimes murky boundaries between them. Along the way, issues such as the discarding of \u201cfaulty data,\u201d theoretical bias, and probabilistic tools for hypothesis acceptance and rejection are discussed. In the latter part of the semester, we discuss how scientific ideas are evaluated by the media, in the courtroom, and in government.   Prerequisites: students must have taken high school chemistry, physics, and calculus.   ALLEN MINCER, Collegiate Professor and Professor of Physics, specializes in experimental particle physics and particle astrophysics. He is currently a member of the ATLAS collaboration, which is studying the nature of the elementary building blocks of matter at the CERN Large Hadron Collider in Geneva, Switzerland. His research at NYU has a long, continuous history of generous support by grants from the National Science Foundation. He is co-author of approximately 400 scientific publications, including the discovery of the top quark with the D-Zero collaboration and the discovery of a particle consistent with the Standard Model Higgs Boson with the ATLAS Collaboration. In addition to teaching in the Physics Department, he has taught in the Steinhardt School\u2019s Department of Teaching and Learning, been involved in research in physics education, and has twice been awarded the College\u2019s Golden Dozen Award for Teaching Excellence.   The Writer in New York   FRSEM-UA 367   Instructor: Vincent Passaro   Thursday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note: conflicts with Principles of Biology RCT (Thursday, 2:00 p.m.-4:45 p.m.) , Physics I RCT ( Thursday, 2:00 p.m.-3:15 p.m.), and Advanced General Chem I Lab (Thursday, 2:30 p.m.-6:45 p.m.).   This seminar presents New York as a kind of super-literary event, a vivid aesthetic and social organism that enlarges and tunes the artistic imagination and the writer\u2019s crucial powers of observation. We examine how a number of writers have negotiated\u2014and how the city has powerfully influenced\u2014the fragile construction of their literary art and their personal identities. We attend to the perennial difficulties of money and competition that preoccupies most writers living here, the stress that characterizes both life in New York and the life of the writer, and how those strained lives have helped to create a kind of literary tradition of their own. Through the readings\u2014from Whitman to James, from Crane to Millay to Fitzgerald, from the Beats to the Downtown writers to recent web postings\u2014we try to understand the New York writer\u2019s particular forms of misery and joy.   VINCENT PASSARO is the author of the New York novel Violence, Nudity, Adult Content . His widely anthologized short fiction, essays, criticism and reviews have appeared in GQ , Esquire , Harper\u2019s Magazine , The Nation , the New York Times Magazine , and the London Sunday Times Magazine , among other venues, and he has written online for Salon.com and Mr. Beller\u2019s Neighborhood , a site dedicated to stories from New York.   Xenophon of Athens\u2014Cavalry Commander and Socratic Philosopher   FRSEM-UA 514   Instructor: Vincent Renzi   Tuesday, 12:30-3:15 p.m.    Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note: conflicts with Principles of Biology II RCT (Tuesday, 12:3 0 p.m.-3:15 p.m.) and Physics I I Lecture (Tuesday  &amp; Thursday, 12:30 p.m.-1:45 p.m. ) .   The greatest ancient you\u2019ve never heard of, Xenophon of Athens (c. 425\u2013355 B.C.E.) was a brilliant general, student of Socrates, and renowned author. His heroism leading the army of the Ten Thousand inspired the conquests of Alexander the Great and Julius Caesar. His political philosophy informed the thought of Cicero, Machiavelli, Franklin, and Jefferson. When knowledge of Greek was still required for admission to college, his fame was ubiquitous, as his writings formed the basis of the pre-college curriculum. Readings, in English translation: Apology of Socrates, Symposium, Memorabilia, Cyropaedia, Cavalry Commander, Anabasis , and the film based on the latter, The Warriors (1979). VINCENT RENZI is Clinical Professor in the Foundations of Contemporary Culture and of Classics, and is a director of undergraduate studies for the College Core Curriculum. A scholar of ancient Greek philosophy, he also has interests in arts and aesthetics and in 19th and 20th century philosophy, and is a recipient of the College's Golden Dozen Award for Teaching Excellence.   The Image of Business in American Literature   FRSEM-UA 440   Instructor: Saul Rosenberg   Friday, 9:30 a.m.\u201312:00 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note: conflicts with General Ch emistry I recitations (Friday, 9:30 a.m.\u201312:1 5 p.m.) and with Advanced Ch emistry I recitation (Friday, 9:30 a.m.\u201310:45 a .m.).   What is the relationship between virtue, material success, and happiness? This course asks how some of the most engaging American writers and filmmakers have treated the central ideas of business from the nation\u2019s founding to the present. How did the idea of \u201cdoing well by doing good\u201d fare as the Republic grew? We examine classic mid-19th century writers\u2019 thoughts about \u201cgetting and spending\u201d and reactions to the moral collapse inherent in the \u201cbusiness\u201d of slavery. We observe how our theme fared with the emergence in the later 19th century of the \u201crobber barons,\u201d the rise of the corporation, and the enormous influx of immigrants. For the 20th century, we look at films Greed and Wall Street and novels such as The Great Gatsby and The Fountainhead . The course finishes with reflections on the recent financial crisis.   SAUL ROSENBERG earned a PhD in American Literature from Columbia and degrees from Berkeley and Cambridge. In addition to teaching at NYU, he has taught American literature at Columbia University and the 92nd Street Y, and served as associate editor of Commentary magazine. He is a consultant at McKinsey &amp; Company, the leading management consulting firm, where he manages publishing and knowledge management programs. He writes regularly on books for the Wall Street Journal .   History, Memory, and the Quest for Social Justice in the U.S.   FRSEM-UA 437   Instructor: Jack Salzman   Wednesday, 11:00 a.m.\u20131:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note: conflicts with Experimental Physics I Lab ( Wednesday 9:00 a.m.\u201312:00 p.m.)  and Principles of Biology I RCT (Wednesday, 11:00 a.m.-1:45 p.m.).   This course explores the relationship between history and memory in the United States from the mid-20th century to the present. One of its primary objectives is to address the ethics of memory. Do we remember events not as they are but as we are? Do we have an obligation to remember events from the past? If we do, which events must we remember, and how do we remember those we did not experience? Or, as Marc Aug\u00e9 argues, is it essential for the health of the individual and of society that we know how to forget? We consider such events and issues as the response to the Holocaust; internment camps for Japanese Americans; racial segregation; the bombing of Dresden and Hiroshima; anticommunism; the Civil Rights Movement; the destruction of the World Trade Center, and genocides in Rwanda and Darfur. We address the role that museums, photography, film, and popular culture have in defining our individual and collective memory.   JACK SALZMAN served as the Director of the Center for American Culture Studies at Columbia University and editor of Prospects: An Annual of American Cultural Studies . He is the Editor-in-Chief of the Encyclopedia of African American Culture and History . Much of his work has been devoted to the relationship between African Americans and American Jews, including Struggles in the Promised Land (with Cornel West) and Bridges and Boundaries , the catalog for an exhibition at the Jewish Museum in New York. He recently completed We Remember the Children , a collection of memoirs by Holocaust survivors. He is writing a book on the impact of the Holocaust on Jews and social justice in the US. Professor Salzman has received the Distinguished Teaching Award and two Fulbrights.   The Cultural Nature of Language   FRSEM-UA 496   Instructor: Bambi Schieffelin   Friday, 9:30 a.m.\u201312:00 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note: conflicts with General Chem I RCT (Friday, 9:30 a.m.-12:15 p.m.) and Advanced General Chem I RCT ( Friday , 9:30 a.m.-10:45 a .m.).   Whether it\u2019s accents, pronouns, swearing, or spelling, how one uses language is never value-free. In this seminar we examine language-using as a social practice, and analyze how speakers and their language(s) are evaluated and regulated across a range of contexts and cultures. Starting with how children learn to talk, or don\u2019t (e.g., feral children), we examine speech and silence across a range of societies. We look at popular attitudes toward language and the practices by which people regulate its use in the media (e.g., political correctness), in legal and educational institutions (e.g., \u201cEnglish Only\u201d), and in multilingual cities (e.g., Barcelona, Montreal) in order to understand how ideas about language are often recruited to non-linguistic concerns, such as who should be included and who excluded. In thinking about the cultural nature of language in this way, we critically explore issues of identity and authority. BAMBI SCHIEFFELIN is Collegiate Professor and Professor of Anthropology. A linguistic anthropologist, she is the author of The Give and Take of Everyday Life: Language Socialization of Kaluli Children and co-editor of, among other books, The Acquisition of Literacy: Ethnographic Perspectives ; Language Ideologies: Practice and Theory ; and Consequences of Contact . She has also published articles in the preeminent journals of her field. She is completing a book on the impact of Christianity on the language and social life of Bosavi people of Papua New Guinea over the past twenty-five years, and continues research on linguistic creativity and change as evidenced in computer-mediated communication such as IM. Professor Schieffelin received the College\u2019s Golden Dozen Award for Teaching Excellence in 2010.   The Supreme Court and the Religion Clauses: Religion and State in America   FRSEM-UA 218   Instructor: John E. Sexton   Wednesday, 6:30 p.m.\u20138:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note: conflicts with Principles of Biology I RCT ( Wednesday, 6:3 0 p.m.\u20137 :45 p.m.).   Should members of the Native American Church be allowed to smoke peyote at religious ceremonies? Can a public high school invite a rabbi to give a benediction and convocation at graduation? Should a state legislator rely on his or her religious convictions in forming a view about the legality of capital punishment or abortion? The course divides these questions into three subject areas: religious liberty; separation of church and state; and the role of religion in public and political life. It focuses on how the Supreme Court has dealt with these areas and, more important, invites students to construct anew a vision of the proper relationship between religion, state, and society in a twenty-first-century liberal constitutional democracy. Most students consider the workload for this course very heavy; please do not enroll unless you are willing and eager to perform at a high and demanding level.   JOHN E. SEXTON, President of New York University, was the Dean of the NYU Law School from 1988 to 2002. He has taught courses on the Constitution and the courts, and has led seminars on the intersection of religion and the law. Before he came to NYU, he served as law clerk for Chief Justice Warren Burger of the US Supreme Court, and has testified frequently before the US Congress. In addition to his law degree, he holds a doctorate in the history of American religion.   Computational Thought   FRSEM-UA 385   Instructor: Dennis E. Shasha    Monday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note : conflicts with Intro Experimental Physics I Lab (Monday, 12:30 p.m.-3:30 p.m.).   Prerequisites: AP calculus, discrete mathematics, or programming experience Computational technology and methods lie at the core of modern science, commerce, entertainment, and, regrettably, war. There are very powerful ideas underlying the field that have roots in mathematics, linguistics, engineering, and even philosophy. Some of its greatest inventions were born in caf\u00e9s or as responses to a puzzle. Some recent algorithmic methods come from studying ants and evolution. This course introduces computational thinking as it builds on logic, linguistics, heuristics, artificial intelligence, and biological computing. The learning style combines straight lecture, interactive discussions of puzzles and games, and short computer programs (in the programming language Python which you will learn). Students make a few presentations during the semester about topics such as the solutions to computationally motivated puzzles, the relative power of linguistic descriptions, and their very own simulations of either an auction or a multi-bank elevator. The goal is for students to learn to think about computation from multiple perspectives and to synthesize those perspectives when faced with unsolved challenges. DENNIS SHASHA is Professor of Computer Science at the Courant Institute of New York University where he works with biologists on pattern discovery for network inference; with computational chemists on algorithms for protein design; with physicists and financial specialists on algorithms for time series; on clocked computation for DNA computing; and on computational reproducibility. Other areas of interest include database tuning as well as tree and graph matching. Because he likes to type, he has written six books of puzzles about a mathematical detective named Dr. Ecco, a volume of the biographies of great computer scientists, and a book about the future of computing. He has also written five technical books about database tuning, biological pattern recognition, time series, DNA computing, statistics, and causal inference in molecular networks. He has co-authored over seventy journal papers, seventy conference papers, and twenty patents. Professor Shasha has also written the puzzle column for various publications including Scientific American .   America\u2019s Role in International Affairs since World War II   FRSEM-UA 405   Instructor: James B. Sitrick   Wednesday, 3:30\u20136:00 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note: conflicts with Principles of Biology I RCT ( Wednesday, 3:3 0 p.m.\u20136:15 p.m.) and Physics I RCT (Wednesday, 5:00 p.m.-6:15 p.m.).   This seminar explores America\u2019s role in international affairs since World War II, interweaving current foreign policy challenges into the conversation. To provide historical perspective, the class first reads George F. Kennan\u2019s classic book American Diplomacy, 1900\u20131950 . Subsequent topics include the creation of the UN during the late 1940s and some of its more recent activities, including possible reform; the CIA; the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962; US involvement in Vietnam in the 1960s and early 1970s; US involvement in the Middle East (particularly with respect to Israel, Iran, and Iraq); the imperial presidency (comparing Arthur Schlesinger Jr.\u2019s celebrated 1973 book on the subject with the actions of the Bush 43 administration); and the foreign policy challenges of the Obama administration.   JAMES B. SITRICK serves as Of Counsel to the international law firm of Baker &amp; McKenzie, which has offices in seventy cities in forty countries. He previously served as chairman and CEO of Coudert Brothers, the oldest international law firm in the United States. His government and NGO service includes extensive work for the Department of the Treasury in drafting international legislation and negotiating treaties with foreign countries. He has also served as secretary general of the World Federation of United Nations Associations. In addition, he serves as a trustee of many American and European cultural institutions, as well as on the Arts and Science Board of Overseers at NYU.   First Amendment Freedom of Expression   FRSEM-UA 235   Instructor: Stephen D. Solomon    Monday and Wednesday, 11:00 a.m.\u201312:15 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note: conflicts with Introductory Experimental Physics I Lecture (Monday , 11:00 a.m.\u201312:15 p.m .) ,  Intro Experimental Physics I Lab (Wednesday, 9:00 a.m.-12:00 p.m.), and Principles of Biology I RCT (Wednesday, 11:00 a.m.-12:15 p.m.).   Prerequisites: A score of 4 o r 5 in either AP U.S. History OR in AP U.S. Government and Politics (or equivalent international exam) ; both recommended.   Conflicts over freedom of speech and the press erupt into public debate almost every week. Congress passes a law to purge indecency from online communications. A judge issues an order shutting down a website that publishes secret documents. Reporters go to jail for refusing to reveal the identity of sources. Although the First Amendment appears on its face to prohibit any governmental restrictions on speech and the press, the Supreme Court in fact balances free and open expression against other vital social interests. The starting point of this course, which involves both history and law, is the robust debate that occurred in the early Republic over prosecutions for seditious libel (the crime of criticizing the government or public officials). We examine how the Supreme Court has interpreted freedom of expression by looking at a rich variety of contemporary conflicts, including libel of public and private persons, prior restraints against publication, flag burning, and restrictions on freedom of speech during wartime. STEPHEN D. SOLOMON is Associate Professor in NYU\u2019s Arthur L. Carter Journalism Institute. His book Ellery\u2019s Protest: How One Young Man Defied Tradition &amp; Sparked the Battle over School Prayer tells the story of the controversial Supreme Court decision in which the justices ruled that state-organized prayer and Bible reading in public schools violated the First Amendment. He is currently working on An American Invention: The Founding Generation and the Struggle for Freedom of Speech , to be published by Macmillan. Professor Solomon is a recipient of the College\u2019s Golden Dozen Award for Teaching Excellence. He earned a JD at Georgetown University Law Center.   The Problem of Beauty   FRSEM-UA 550   Instructor: G. Gabrielle Starr   Tuesday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note: conflicts with Principles of Biology I RCT (Tuesday, 2:00 p.m.-4:45 p.m.) and Intro Experimental Physics I Lab (Tuesday, 2:00 p.m.-5:00 p.m.).   What is beauty for? It is common in many circumstances to think of beauty as \u201cmerely\u201d beautiful\u2014something nice to have, but an unnecessary add-on to what really matters. This hasn\u2019t always been the case. Beauty has played an important part in philosophy, ethics and theology, and now it is playing an increasingly interesting role in biology, neuroscience, social policy, and design. But what is beauty, anyway? And why should we care? This course explores the role of beauty across a variety of disciplines and across \u201clong time\u201d (not just the period from the ancient world to the present, but even the long time of evolution).   G. GABRIELLE STARR is Professor of English and Seryl Kushner Dean of the College of Arts and Science. She has published widely on eighteenth-century British literature and the history of the aesthetic.

Welcome to College: The Novel   FRSEM-UA 371   Instructor: Carol Sternhell   Wednesday, 12:30 p.m.\u20133:00 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note: conflicts with Principles of Biology I RCT ( Wednesday, 12:30 p.m.\u20133:1 5 p.m.) and Physics I RCT ( Wednesday, 2:00 p.m.\u20133 :15 p.m.).   Starting college can be exhilarating\u2014and terrifying. A chance for intellectual enlightenment\u2014or intense loneliness. An escape from a stultifying small town of narrow-minded people\u2014or a riot of alcohol, sex, and drugs. In this class we read a selection of college novels from different historical periods, ranging from F. Scott Fitzgerald\u2019s This Side of Paradise to Tom Wolfe\u2019s I Am Charlotte Simmons . We discuss these novels from a variety of perspectives: literary, historical, and journalistic. In addition to presenting biographical and historical and cultural reports on at least two of the authors and their novels, students write about their own experiences as first-year students at NYU in several genres, including fiction and nonfiction. Together we explore this important life passage, examining life as we live it.   CAROL STERNHELL is Associate Professor of Journalism and a Director of the Arthur L. Carter Journalism Institute\u2019s Studio 20 graduate program. She created the department\u2019s study-away programs in London, Prague, and Accra and was also a founder of the Women\u2019s Studies major (now Gender and Sexuality Studies). She has written extensively about feminism, motherhood, and literature for a variety of publications. Before coming to NYU, she worked as an editor at Newsday , a general assignment reporter for the New York Post , and a freelance magazine writer. She received the College\u2019s Golden Dozen Award for Teaching Excellence in 2005.   School and Society: NYU in the Sixties and Seventies   FRSEM-UA 255   Instructor: Arthur Tannenbaum   Tuesday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note: conflicts with Intro Experimental Physics I Lab ( Tuesday, 2:00 p.m.-5 :00 p.m.) and Principles of Biology I RCT ( Tuesday, 2:00 p.m.-4:4 5 p.m.).   The 1960s and 1970s brought profound changes in American society, changes mirrored in the history of the nation, academe, and New York University. It was a time that witnessed the struggle for civil rights, assassinations, war abroad and riots at home, and a youth-led revolution in music, dress, and values. This course aims to develop an appreciation of those years by examining the events and the reactions as they affected campuses and students across America. Students prepare reports on different aspects of the era and work on group projects. In both cases, and in the spirit of the times, the topics are self-chosen with the approval of the group and the seminar leader.   ARTHUR TANNENBAUM is Associate Curator and Social Work Librarian in the Bobst Library, and has also taught in the English Department. First as a student and then as a faculty member, he has been at NYU for more than thirty years. In 1992 he received the University\u2019s Distinguished Teaching Medal in recognition for his work with students.   Language and Reality in Modern Science and Literature   FRSEM-UA 210   Instructor: Friedrich Ulfers   Tuesday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note: conflicts with Principles of Biology I RCT ( Tuesday, 2:00 p.m.\u20134:4 5 p.m.) and Intro Experimental Physics I Lab ( Tuesday, 2:00 p.m.\u20135:00 p.m.).   The course explores the possibility that there exists a common ground between the two cultures of science and the humanities. It posits the hypothesis of a correlation between postclassical science (e.g., quantum theory) and \u201cpostmodern\u201d literature and philosophy. Among the key notions examined are Heisenberg\u2019s \u201cuncertainty principle\u201d and the \u201cundecidability\u201d of deconstructive theory. The discussion of these notions and of their implications in literary works revolves around their effect on classical logic, the referential function of language, and the traditional goal of a complete explanation/description of reality. Readings include selections from the works of Virginia Woolf, Borges, Kundera, Pirsig, and Pynchon, and from non-technical texts on quantum and chaos theory.   FRIEDRICH ULFERS is Associate Professor of German. Winner of the College\u2019s Golden Dozen Award for Teaching Excellence, the University\u2019s Distinguished Teaching Medal, and NYU Alumni Association Great Teacher Award, he has taught not only in the German Department but also in the Draper Interdisciplinary Master\u2019s Program, offering courses on Nietzsche, Kafka, and other figures. He has written widely on 20th-century German authors and is at present preparing a study of Nietzsche as a postmodernist.   The Art and Architecture of Papal Rome 1490\u20131610: Two Michelangelos, Buonarroti and Merisi da Caravaggio   FRSEM-UA 366   Instructor: Guy Walton   Wednesday, 9:30 a.m.\u2013noon   Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note: conflicts with Principles of Biology I Lecture (Monday and Wednesday 9:30\u201310:45 a.m. ), Principles of Biology I RCT (Wednesday, 11:00 a.m-1:45 p.m.), and Introductory Experimental Physics I Lab ( Wednesday, 9:00 a.m.\u201312:00 p.m.)   Early and recent biographies and films about the lives of Michelangelo Buonarroti and Caravaggio provide the starting point for this course, which sets their art in the larger context of, first, papal patronage (the courts of Sixtus IV, Julius II, Leo X, Clement VII, Paul III, Sixtus V, and Paul V), and second, the culture of Renaissance and Counter Reformation Rome. Students develop a major research paper on the masterpieces of painting and sculpture the \u201ctwo Michelangelos\u201d produced.   GUY WALTON is Professor Emeritus of Art History at the College of Arts and Science. His degrees are from Wesleyan University and NYU\u2019s Institute of Fine Arts (MA, PhD).

His published works include scholarly articles, reviews, and exhibition catalogs. He is the author of Louis XIV\u2019s Versailles .   Reading The Dream of the Red Chamber   FRSEM-UA 461   Instructor: Jing Wang   Monday, 3:30\u20136:10 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note: conflicts with Introductory Experimental Physics I Lab ( Monday, 12:30 p.m.\u20133:30 p.m.) .   Cao Xueqin\u2019s mid-18th century literary epic The Dream of the Red Chamber is widely regarded as the culmination of the vernacular novel of imperial China. With a tragic love story between two aristocratic teenagers at its dramatic center, it covers a vast terrain of culture and social life\u2014the question of what is eternal and what is ephemeral; the nature of \u201cqing,\u201d as the heart of being that both animates and destroys life; individual talent and its fragility; the decadence of the elite; and growing, if hidden, social and class tensions. The novel\u2019s manifold structure and intricate plot development, coupled with its dazzling array of memorable characters, makes it one of the most complex and colorful of all time. Note: Both reading and discussions are conducted in English. No knowledge of Chinese culture, language, or history is required or assumed. Native Chinese speakers who wish to read and enjoy this masterpiece in the original language are advised to choose a different Freshman Seminar and take Reading The Dream of the Red Chamber (EAST-UA 228) as an elective course in the future. Consult the CAS Bulletin for prerequisites.   JING WANG is Assistant Research Scholar in the College of Arts and Science and the Department of East Asian Studies, where, from 1999 to 2006, she was Lecturer in Chinese.

The aim was to offer freshmen, in their very   first semester, the opportunity to be in a small, intellectually   stimulating class taught by an expert professor. From the start, the   program proved to be highly popular with students and instructors alike.   The number of seminars has grown from a mere seven in the fall of 1992   to more than eighty in recent years (now offered in both fall and spring). The instructors have been   drawn not only from the College\u2019s faculty but also from NYU\u2019s   professional schools and from among New York\u2019s professional, cultural,   and governmental leaders. With the launching of the College Cohort   Program in fall 2012, every CAS freshman is required to take one of these seminars. Since 2005, the College has extended the principles behind these first-year seminars to the Advanced Honors Seminars program for sophomores, juniors, and (space permitting) seniors. The FRESHMAN SEMINARS    have as their goals to put new students into contact with leading   thinkers, to introduce them to important subjects, to challenge them   intellectually through rigorous standards of analysis and oral and   written argumentation, and to prepare them to conduct their own   research. To that end, they stress demanding readings and writing   assignments that introduce students to an essential research skill\u2014such   as a literature review, quantitative reasoning, critical use of primary   sources, the identification of a research problem, critical analysis of   texts, or confrontations with works or art. In addition to participating   actively in class discussions, students are expected to give oral   presentations in class. A final paper will typically, though not always,   have gone through one or more revisions, perhaps revised with the   benefit of in-class comments. In other seminars the focus may be on   individual or group projects.  Fall 2014  Language and Reality in Modern Science and Literature FRSEM-UA 210 Instructor: Friedrich Ulfers Tuesday, 2:00-4:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Thursday, 3:30-4:30 p.m. The course explores the possibility that there exists a common ground between the two cultures of science and the humanities. It posits the hypothesis of a correlation between postclassical science (e.g., quantum theory) and \"postmodern\" literature and philosophy. Among the key notions examined are Heisenberg's \"uncertainty principle\" and the \"undecidability\" of deconstructive theory. The discussion of these notions and of their implications in literary works revolves around their effect on classical logic, the referential function of language, and the traditional goal of a complete explanation/description of reality. Readings include selections from the works of Virginia Woolf, Borges, Kundera, Pirsig, and Pynchon, and from non-technical texts on quantum and chaos theory. FRIEDRICH ULFERS is Associate Professor of German. Winner of the College's Golden Dozen Award for Teaching Excellence, the University's Distinguished Teaching Medal, and NYU Alumni Association Great Teacher Award, he has taught not only in the German Department but also in the Draper Interdisciplinary Master's Program, offering courses on, among others, Nietzsche and Kafka. He has written widely on 20th-century German authors and is at present preparing a study of Nietzsche as a postmodernist.  The Supreme Court and the Religion Clauses: Religion and State in America FRSEM-UA 218 Instructor: John E. Sexton  syllabus Tuesday, 6:45-8:45 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Friday, 11:00 a.m.-noon Note: conflicts with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m.-1:45 p.m.) and with Advanced Chemistry I recitation (Friday, 11:00 a.m.-12:15 p.m.). Should members of the Native American Church be allowed to smoke peyote at religious ceremonies? Can a public high school invite a rabbi to give a benediction and convocation at graduation? Should a state legislator rely on his or her religious convictions in forming a view about the legality of capital punishment or abortion? The course divides these questions into three subject areas: religious liberty; separation of church and state; and the role of religion in public and political life. It focuses on how the Supreme Court has dealt with these areas and, more important, invites students to construct anew a vision of the proper relationship between religion, state, and society in a twenty-first-century liberal constitutional democracy. Most students consider the workload for this course very heavy; please do not enroll unless you are willing and eager to perform at that level. JOHN E. SEXTON, President of New York University, was the Dean of the NYU Law School from 1988 to 2002. He has taught courses on the Constitution and the courts, and has led seminars on the intersection of religion and the law. Before he came to NYU, he served as law clerk for Chief Justice Warren Burger of the US Supreme Court, and has testified frequently before the US Congress. In addition to his law degree, he holds a doctorate in the history of American religion.  First Amendment Freedom of Expression FRSEM-UA 235 Instructor: Stephen D. Solomon   syllabus Monday and Wednesday, 11:00 a.m.-12:15 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Friday, 11:00 a.m.-noon Note: conflicts with Introductory Experimental Physics I (Monday 11:00 a.m.\u201312:15 p.m.), General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m.\u20131:45 p.m.) and with Advanced Chemistry I recitation (Friday, 11:00 a.m.\u201312:15 p.m.). Prerequisites: A score of 4 or 5 in either AP U.S. History OR in AP U.S. Government and Politics (or equivalent international exam); both recommended. Conflicts over freedom of speech and the press erupt into public debate almost every week. Congress passes a law to purge indecency from online communications. A judge issues an order shutting down a website that publishes secret documents. Reporters go to jail for refusing to reveal the identity of sources. Although the First Amendment appears on its face to prohibit any governmental restrictions on speech and the press, the Supreme Court in fact balances free and open expression against other vital social interests. The starting point of this course, which involves both history and law, is the robust debate that occurred in the early Republic over prosecutions for seditious libel (the crime of criticizing the government or public officials). We examine how the Supreme Court has interpreted freedom of expression by looking at a rich variety of contemporary conflicts, including libel of public and private persons, prior restraints against publication, flag burning, and restrictions on freedom of speech during wartime. STEPHEN D. SOLOMON is Associate Professor in NYU's Arthur L. Carter Journalism Institute. His book Ellery's Protest: How One Young Man Defied Tradition &amp; Sparked the Battle over School Prayer tells the story of the controversial Supreme Court decision in which the justices ruled that state-organized prayer and Bible reading in public schools violated the First Amendment. He is currently working on An American Invention: The Founding Generation and the Struggle for Freedom of Speech , to be published by Macmillan. Solomon is a recipient of the College's Golden Dozen Award for Teaching Excellence. He earned a JD at Georgetown University Law Center.  School and Society: NYU in the Sixties and Seventies FRSEM-UA 255 Instructor: Arthur Tannenbaum Tuesday, 2:00-4:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Thursday, 2:00-3:00 p.m. The 1960s and 1970s brought profound changes in American society, changes mirrored in the history of the nation, academe, and New York University.

Disease in History: Epidemics and Pandemics from Antiquity to the Present FRSEM-UA 265 Instructor: Richard W. Hull   syllabus Wednesday 2:00-4:45 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Monday, 3:30-4:30 p.m. This seminar focuses on the historical dimensions of several major epidemics that profoundly affected human societies in Europe, Asia, Africa, and the Americas. Students identify each epidemic and explore its causes, origins, means of transmission, efforts at containment, and impacts on societies, particularly on their cultural development. They examine representations of the epidemic in the arts, media, and literature of the period, as well as assess the effects of each disease on demographics, religions, economies, and ways of life. To what extent did an epidemic, or plague, accelerate or slow fundamental changes in human relationships within societies and between them, and the ways people viewed themselves and their universe? RICHARD HULL is Professor of History. A specialist in African and European history, he is the author of numerous books, including African Cities and Towns ; Modern Africa ; and Munyakare: African Civilizations , as well as coauthor of the two-volume World Civilizations . He has received both the Great Teacher Award and three Golden Dozen Awards for Teaching Excellence at the College.  Latin America at the Start of the 21st Century: Coming of Age or Continuing Chaos? FRSEM-UA 306 Instructor: Jorge G. Casta\u00f1eda  syllabus Monday, 9:30 a.m.-noon Required cohort meeting: Friday, 11:00 a.m.-noon Note: conflicts with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m.-1:45 p.m.) and with Advanced Chemistry I recitation (Friday, 11:00 a.m.-12:15 p.m.). This seminar focuses on Latin America's longstanding problems and possible solutions to them. It takes up such topics as the absence of orderly, peaceful, and steady democratic governance following independence from colonial rule, and the consolidation of representative democracy today; the slowdown of economic growth in the last 20 years and prospects for a new economic takeoff; the phenomenon of widespread violence, and growing respect for human rights; and how the traditional weakness of civil society is being overcome. For each topic, there are readings dealing with its political, economic, and cultural dimensions in both past and present. JORGE D. CASTA\u00d1EDA is Global Distinguished Professor of Politics and Latin American and Caribbean Studies. Professor at the National Autonomous University of Mexico since 1979, he has also been a visiting professor at the University of California at Berkeley, Princeton, and Dartmouth.

He has also written articles for many newspapers and magazines in Mexico, the United States, and other countries.  The Operas of Gilbert and Sullivan FRSEM-UA 333 Instructor: Rena Charnin Mueller   syllabus Thursday, 9:45 a.m.-12:15 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Tuesday, 11:00 a.m.-noon The operas of Gilbert and Sullivan were composed during a period of intense change in the world of symphonic music and opera in the 19th century. This seminar examines the major works and their historical, cultural, and musical contexts, with particular attention to The Mikado , which will soon celebrate the 130th anniversary of its premiere in 1885, and which became, arguably, one of the most contentious compositions to reach the stage. It also examines the lives of the composer and the librettist and their respective milieu. In addition, we study the staging of light opera through a close look at the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company and its singers, scenic designers, choreographers, and costumers, drawing on the collections of the Morgan Library in New York, which houses the principal sources for the music and numerous artifacts from the productions. RENA CHARNIN MUELLER teaches historical musicology in the Music Department. She was the editor of the Journal of the American Liszt Society from 2001 to 2011 and won the Lizst Medal in 2011. Her research interests include Lizst, Wagner, operetta, and the Broadway musical, in particular its adaptation of elite musical forms. With M\u00e1ria Eckhardt, she is preparing a complete thematic catalogue of Liszt's music; their previous collaboration was on the Liszt \"List of Works\" for The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians 2001 . She is also editing The Gondoliers for the Gilbert &amp; Sullivan Complete Edition.  Literary Theory and Its Applications FRSEM-UA 355 Instructor: John Maynard   syllabus Tuesday, 2:00-4:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Thursday, 2:00-3:00 p.m. Students in this seminar read a selection of essays from major thinkers about literature, mainly from the latter half of the twentieth century to the present, and learn to evaluate different approaches. They complete the course by preparing a discussion of a work of literature using one or more of the conceptual approaches they have studied. Emphasis is placed on learning how to analyze theoretical problems and how to improvise in applying them to new situations. The seminar is recommended for students interested in any area of the humanities. JOHN MAYNARD is Professor of English at NYU. His interests include literary interpretation, readers and reading, literary theory, biography, and Victorian and modern literature. He has published books on a variety of subjects in Victorian literature and is editor of Victorian Literature and Culture . His most recent book is on readers and reading.

From Mind to Brain and Back Again FRSEM-UA 357 Instructor: Joseph LeDoux Monday, 2:00-4:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Wednesday, 3:30-4:30 p.m. One of the great debates in history is the nature of consciousness: to what extent we are \"hard-wired\" as opposed to shaped by experience? Several hundred years ago, this fundamental question would have been addressed by philosophers. In the late 19th century, the birth of psychology gave us ways of studying the mind scientifically rather than simply speculating about it. Modern neuroscience gives us a new approach, one in which we use discoveries about the brain to understand who we are and why we are that way. What have we learned? And does this approach enhance (or diminish) our sense of who we are? In this course we look at issues both historically and in terms of modern discoveries, using the topic of emotions, and their relation to the brain, as a window on the broader problem of mind and brain. JOSEPH LEDOUX, University Professor and Henry and Lucy Moses Professor of Science, is on the faculty of the Center for Neural Science and of the Department of Psychology at NYU. He received his PhD in psychology from the State University of New York at Stony Brook in 1977. Before coming to NYU in 1989, he was a postdoctoral fellow and then Assistant Professor in the Department of Neurology at Cornell University Medical College. In addition to articles in scholarly journals, he is author of The Emotional Brain: The Mysterious Underpinnings of Emotional Life and Synaptic Self: How Our Brains Become Who We Are . He is the recipient of the 2005 Fyssen International Prize in Cognitive Science. He is also a member of a rock band, The Amygdaloids, an all-NYU band that plays original music about mind and brain. They have two CDs: Heavy Mental and Theory of My Mind .  The Art and Architecture of Papal Rome 1490-1610: Two Michelangelos - Buonarroti and Merisi da Caravaggio FRSEM-UA 366 Instructor: Guy Walton   syllabus Wednesday, 9:30 a.m.-noon Required cohort meeting: Monday, 11:00 a.m.-noon Note: conflicts with Principles of Biology I (Monday and Wednesday 9:30-10:45 a.m.) and with Introductory Experimental Physics I (Monday 11:00 a.m.-12:15 p.m.) Early and recent biographies and films about the lives of Michelangelo Buonarroti and Caravaggio provide the starting point for this course, which sets their art in the larger context of, first, papal patronage (the courts of Sixtus IV, Julius II, Leo X, Clement VII, Paul III, Sixtus V, and Paul V), and second, the culture of Renaissance and Counter Reformation Rome. Students develop a major research paper on the masterpieces of painting and sculpture the \"two Michelangelos\" produced. GUY WALTON is Professor Emeritus of Art History at the College of Arts and Science. His degrees are from Wesleyan University and NYU's Institute of Fine Arts (MA, PhD). His research and publications have centered on the courts of Europe of the early modern period, including those of the popes in Rome, and on the artists and architects who worked for many rulers. His published works include scholarly articles, reviews, and exhibition catalogs. He is the author of Louis XIV's Versailles .  The Writer in New York FRSEM-UA 367 Instructor: Vincent Passaro Thursday, 2:00-4:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Tuesday, 2:00-3:00 p.m. This seminar presents New York as a kind of super-literary event, a vivid aesthetic and social organism that enlarges and tunes the artistic imagination and the writer's crucial powers of observation. We examine how a number of writers have negotiated-and how the city has powerfully influenced-the fragile construction of their literary art and their personal identities. We attend to the perennial difficulties of money and competition that preoccupies most writers living here, the stress that characterizes both life in New York and the life of the writer, and how those strained lives have helped to create a kind of literary tradition of their own. Through the readings'from Whitman to James, from Crane to Millay to Fitzgerald, from the Beats to the Downtown writers to recent web postings-we try to understand the New York writer's particular forms of misery and joy. VINCENT PASSARO is the author of the New York novel Violence, Nudity, Adult Content . His widely anthologized short fiction, essays, criticism and reviews have appeared in GQ , Esquire , Harper's Magazine , The Nation , the New York Times Magazine , and the London Sunday Times Magazine , among other venues, and he has written online for Salon.com and Mr. Beller's Neighborhood , a site dedicated to stories from New York.  Welcome to College: The Novel FRSEM-UA 371 Instructor: Carol Sternhell  syllabus Wednesday, 11:00 a.m.-1:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Friday, 11:00 a.m.-noon Note: conflicts with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m.-1:45 p.m.) and with Advanced Chemistry I recitation (Friday, 11:00 a.m.-12:15 p.m.). Starting college can be exhilarating-and terrifying. A chance for intellectual enlightenment-or intense loneliness. An escape from a stultifying small town of narrow-minded people-or a riot of alcohol, sex, and drugs. In this class we read a selection of college novels from different historical periods, ranging from F. Scott Fitzgerald's This Side of Paradise to Tom Wolfe's I Am Charlotte Simmons . We discuss these novels from a variety of perspectives: literary, historical, and journalistic. In addition to presenting biographical and historical and cultural reports on at least two of the authors and their novels, students write about their own experiences as first-year students at NYU in several genres, including fiction and nonfiction. Together we explore this important life passage, examining life as we live it. CAROL STERNHELL is Associate Professor of Journalism and a Director of the Arthur L. Carter Journalism Institute's Studio 20 graduate program. She created the department's study-away programs in London, Prague, and Accra and was also a founder of the Women's Studies major (now Gender and Sexuality Studies). She has written about extensively about feminism, motherhood, and literature for a variety of publications. Before coming to NYU, she worked as an editor at Newsday , a general assignment reporter for the New York Post , and a freelance magazine writer. She received the College's Golden Dozen Award for Teaching Excellence in 2005.  The Doctor's Dilemma: Being Both Correct and Right FRSEM-UA 379 Instructor: Michael E. Makover  syllabus Tuesday, 6:20-8:50 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Friday, 11:00-noon Note: conflicts with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m.-1:45 p.m.) and with Advanced Chemistry I recitation (Friday, 11:00 a.m.-12:15 p.m.). Dr. Saul Farber, former Dean of the NYU School of Medicine, frequently cautioned that just because an action or conclusion was correct, did not mean that it was right. Ethics, laws, and religious and cultural beliefs intersect in every medical encounter and healthcare issue, affecting patients' options and care. The challenging issues to be studied and debated in this seminar include the following: Should doctors help terminal patients die to relieve intractable suffering? Should doctors participate in executions or in the interrogation of terrorists? Do we want to know so much about our genetic makeup that we are faced with terribly difficult consequences of that knowledge? Is \"alternative medicine\" a reasonable alternative? What makes a good doctor good? Who should pay for your healthcare? The course aims to teach students how to address such questions by learning to think like doctors and scientists, to apply logic tempered by human values and experience, to analyze information critically, and to present ideas effectively and honestly. Approximately 50 pages of reading, and 750 words of writing, per week. MICHAEL E. MAKOVER is Clinical Assistant Professor of Medicine at the NYU School of Medicine and Attending Physician at the NYU Medical Center. He is also the Chief Medical Officer for a major union. An internist and rheumatologist, he is the author of Mismanaged Care , as well as articles on healthcare quality, ethics, and economics, and currently writing another book entitled 120 Years Young . He was an aide to Senator Robert F. Kennedy and a spokesman for the American Cancer Society and the New York Heart Association.  Suffering and Comfort: Explorations in Narrative Medicine and Other Sources FRSEM-UA 393 Instructor: Michele Shedlin  syllabus Wednesday, 4:55-7:25 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Monday, 3:30-4:30 p.m. This seminar explores the nature of suffering and comfort, coping and resilience, in a context where scientific advances have created heretofore unimaginable possibilities, choices, and dilemmas for all of us. How do people cope with the complexities that illness and the need for care bring into our lives? Readings in narrative medicine and other sources, including film, newspaper and magazine articles, novels, poetry and religious texts, guide our discussions about the different ways individuals and cultures view these important dimensions of the human experience.

America's Role in International Affairs since World War II FRSEM-UA 405 Instructor: James B. Sitrick   syllabus Wednesday, 3:30-6:00 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Monday, 3:30-4:30 p.m. This seminar explores America's role in international affairs since World War II, interweaving current foreign policy challenges into the conversation. To provide historical perspective, the class first reads George F. Kennan's classic book American Diplomacy, 1900-1950 . Subsequent topics include the creation of the UN during the late 1940s and some of its more recent activities, including possible reform; the CIA; the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962; US involvement in Vietnam in the 1960s and early 1970s; US involvement in the Middle East (particularly with respect to Israel, Iran, and Iraq); the imperial presidency (comparing Arthur Schlesinger Jr.'s celebrated 1973 book on the subject with the actions of the Bush 43 administration); and the foreign policy challenges of the Obama administration.

FRSEM-UA 413 Instructor: Jeff Goodwin Wednesday, 3:30\u20136:10 p.m Required cohort meeting: Monday, 3:30\u20134:30 p.m. There was a time not so long ago when a critical engagement with the writings of Karl Marx was considered an obligatory intellectual and political rite of passage. No serious intellectual or political activist could not read Marx\u2014whether one ultimately accepted or rejected Marx\u2019s ideas, in whole or in part. Is this still true? Are Marx\u2019s ideas, or some of them, still relevant? Which of his ideas remain important or valuable for people who wish to understand\u2014and perhaps to change\u2014the contemporary world? Which of Marx\u2019s ideas are problematic or pass\u00e9? To address these questions, this seminar critically examines some of Marx\u2019s most important writings, including The Communist Manifesto , The German Ideology , The Civil War in France , and\u2014above all\u2014 Capital , Marx\u2019s magnum opus. In assessing the contemporary relevance of Marx\u2019s ideas, we also read several efforts by Marx\u2019s followers to understand a range of important phenomena, including the nature of the state, current US politics, and the ongoing economic crisis. JEFF GOODWIN is Professor of Sociology. He has written extensively about social movements, revolutions, and terrorism. His books include The Social Movements Reader ; Contention in Context ; Passionate Politics ; and No Other Way Out: States and Revolutionary Movements, 1945\u20131991 .

Branding: People, Places, Things FRSEM-UA 422 Instructor: Richard L. Lewis Tuesday, 2:00-4:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Thursday, 3:30-4:30 p.m. Brands help us avoid making the same decisions over and over by building bridges of trust; it's reassuring that a visit to McDonald's is pretty much the same all around the world. Brands provide information, advice, smiles, and community, using a variety of rational and emotional tools to connect with us. Even brand owners are sometimes uncertain as to how their brand has cemented a relationship with an audience. This course analyzes what makes brands tick: how they're created, and how time, technology, distribution, competitors, and consumers force them to change. We also examine the dark side of brands' magnetism. Finally, we examine our budding, personal brands, or reputations, which is how our family, friends, enemies, teachers and bosses evaluate us. RICHARD L. LEWIS is an independent marketing consultant who solves business, branding, and strategic problems for companies, professionals, and individuals. He was the longtime Managing Director at TBWA/Chiat/Day, and has written two bestselling books about advertising. He has also taught at Yale College.  Trials of the Century FRSEM-UA 434 Instructor: Jack Ford  syllabus Monday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Wednesday, 3:30\u20134:30 p.m. How does a trial become viewed as a \u201ctrial of the century\u201d' What does that designation say about the crime and the personalities involved, about the legal, social, and political implications of the case, and about the nature and extent of the attendant media coverage? Since the trial of Socrates, the public has been intrigued, galvanized, and even entertained by the real drama of real trials, which often act as a prism through which society\u2019s strengths and weaknesses are revealed. This course offers in-depth examinations of select \u201ctrials of the century\u201d in the US, approaching each case from a specific angle, from celebrity (the Lindbergh kidnapping case and the trial of O.J. Simpson) to race (the trials of the Scottsboro Boys), politics (the Chicago Seven), and religion (the Scopes Monkey Trial). JACK FORD is an Emmy and Peabody Award-winning journalist, author, and nationally recognized trial attorney. Currently a CBS News Legal Analyst, he has had a distinguished career on network and cable television. As a litigator, he successfully handled a number of high-profile cases, such as the Northeast\u2019s first death-penalty trial; one of the nation\u2019s first corporate homicide cases; and the Wall Street insider-trading scandal of the late 1980s.

The recipient of five honorary degrees in recognition of his professional accomplishments and his extensive public service, he has taught at, in addition to NYU, Yale College and Fordham Law School.  Frederick Douglass and the Transformative Life FRSEM-UA 435 Instructor: Philip Kunhardt  syllabus Thursday, 11:00 a.m.-1:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Tuesday, 11:00 a.m.-noon Note: conflicts with Physics I (Tuesday and Thursday 12:30-1:45 p.m.) Few figures in American history are as compelling or inspiring as the former-slave-turned-abolitionist-editor Frederick Douglass, whose eloquence and moral passion resonate still. A complex and at times conflicted figure, his life intersected with some of the most interesting and charged characters of his age, including Abraham Lincoln, Susan B. Anthony, William Lloyd Garrison, Harriet Tubman, John Brown, and many others. This seminar takes a deep and sustained look at the life and work of this American prophet. Students read a wide selection of his writings-now considered some of the most important and original of the 19th century-in addition to biographies and historical treatments, which open up vistas on the central issues of race and human freedom. We explore important questions in the light of Douglass's thinking: Is there a legitimate use of violence in the pursuit of noble ends? Does there exist, as Douglass believed, a force of progress in history? How do self-awareness, moral insight, and public eloquence undergird the effectiveness of a reformer? PHILIP KUNHARDT is Distinguished Scholar in Residence in the Humanities, and teaches history and biography in the College of Arts and Science. He focuses on the lives of transformative figures and has co-authored five books, including Looking for Lincoln , The American President , and P.T. Barnum: America's Greatest Showman .

History, Memory, and the Quest for Social Justice in the U.S. FRSEM-UA 437 Instructor: Jack Salzman   syllabus Monday, 11:00 a.m.-1:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Wednesday, 12:30-1:30 p.m. Note: conflicts with Experimental Physics I (Monday 11:00 a.m.-12:15 p.m.) This course explores the relationship between history and memory in the United States from the mid-20th century to the present. One of its primary objectives is to address the ethics of memory. Do we remember events not as they are but as we are? Do we have an obligation to remember events from the past? If we do, which events must we remember, and how do we remember those we did not experience? Or, as Marc Aug\u00e9 argues, is it essential for the health of the individual and of society that we know how to forget? Among the events, controversies, and We consider such events and issues as the response to the Holocaust; internment camps for Japanese Americans; racial segregation; the bombing of Dresden and Hiroshima; anticommunism; the Civil Rights Movement; the destruction of the World Trade Center, and genocides in Rwanda and Darfur. We address the role that museums, photography, film, and popular culture have in defining our individual and collective memory. JACK SALZMAN served as the Director of the Center for American Culture Studies at Columbia University and editor of Prospects: An Annual of American Cultural Studies . He is the Editor-in-Chief of the Encyclopedia of African American Culture and History . Much of his work has been devoted to the relationship between African Americans and American Jews, including Struggles in the Promised Land (with Cornel West) and Bridges and Boundaries , the catalog for an exhibition at the Jewish Museum in New York. He recently completed We Remember the Children , a collection of memoirs by Holocaust survivors. He is writing a book on the impact of the Holocaust on Jews and social justice in the US. Professor Salzman has received the Distinguished Teaching Award and two Fulbrights.  The Image of Business in American Literature FRSEM-UA 440 Instructor: Saul Rosenberg Monday, 4:55-7:25 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Friday, 12:30-1:30 p.m. Note: conflicts with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m.-1:45 p.m.). What is the relationship between virtue, material success, and happiness? This course asks how some of the most engaging American writers and filmmakers have treated the central ideas of business from the nation's founding to the present. How did the idea of \"doing well by doing good\" fare as the Republic grew? We examine classic mid-19th century writers' thoughts about \"getting and spending\" and reactions to the moral collapse inherent in the \"business\" of slavery. We observe how our theme fared with the emergence in the later 19th century of the \"robber barons,\" the rise of the corporation, and the enormous influx of immigrants. For the 20th century, we look at films Greed and Wall Street and novels such as The Great Gatsby and The Fountainhead . The course finishes with reflections on the recent financial crisis. SAUL ROSENBERG earned a PhD in American Literature from Columbia and degrees from Berkeley and Cambridge. In addition to teaching at NYU, he has taught American literature at Columbia University and the 92nd Street Y, and served as associate editor of Commentary magazine.

Wiseguys, Spies, and Private Eyes: Heroes and Villains in American Culture, Film, and Literature FRSEM-UA 449 Instructor: Eddy Friedfeld   syllabus Thursday, 4:55\u20137:25 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Tuesday, 3:30\u20134:30 p.m. This seminar explores the ways in which specific American archetypes and themes are perceived and articulated\u2014from the rugged Old West individualist, to the persevering underdog who becomes a boxing champ, to the Cold War\u2013era superspy. We examine representations of heroes and villains in modern American popular culture and how the great films and novels of three particular genres, the Detective, the Gangster, and the Spy, influenced our understanding of these archetypes. From the early influences of Hamlet and Macbeth to Sherlock Holmes, Raymond Chandler\u2019s Philip Marlowe, Mario Puzo\u2019s (and Francis Ford Coppola\u2019s) The Godfather , James Bond, and Batman, we look at the mythology and evolution of heroes and villains through popular and high culture icons, the genesis of the genres and how they developed over time, and how great directors, actors, and writers influenced audiences worldwide and were themselves influenced by culture and history. EDDY FRIEDFELD is a film and entertainment journalist and historian, as well as an attorney specializing in corporate restructuring. He is the co-author of Caesar\u2019s Hours with comedy legend Sid Caesar, and is working on a book on the history of comedy in America.

This course examines the intersection of ideas, politics, and action in cities in the US and around world, particularly those related to improving the urban environment. We study best practices, evaluate their effectiveness, and determine whether and how successful policies and programs can be replicated. This course asks students to not only think critically issues of public policy but also to think anew about the role they play in shaping it. Topics for student projects are drawn from current issues and problems facing decision-makers and elected officials in America today. ERIC GIOIA is an attorney with extensive experience in business, law, and government. He joined J.P. Morgan in January 2010 after serving for eight years on the New York City Council. Prior to serving on City Council, he practiced law at Milbank, Tweed, Hadley &amp; McCloy LLP, and served in the White House under President Bill Clinton. Professor Gioia holds a BA from New York University and a JD from Georgetown University Law Center.  Reading The Dream of the Red Chamber FRSEM-UA 461 Instructor: Jing Wang Monday, 3:30-6:10 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Wednesday, 3:30-4:30 p.m. Cao Xueqin's mid-18th century literary epic The Dream of the Red Chamber is widely regarded as the culmination of the vernacular novel of imperial China. With a tragic love story between two aristocratic teenagers at its dramatic center, it covers a vast terrain of culture and social life-the question of what is eternal and what is ephemeral; the nature of \"qing,\" as the heart of being that both animates and destroys life; individual talent and its fragility; and the decadence of the elite, as well as growing, if hidden, social and class tensions. The novel's manifold structure and intricate plot development, coupled with its dazzling array of memorable characters, makes it one of the most complex and colorful of all time. Note: Both reading and discussions are conducted in English. No knowledge of Chinese culture, language, or history is required or assumed. Native Chinese speakers who wish to read and enjoy this masterpiece in the original language are advised to choose a different Freshman Seminar and take Reading The Dream of the Red Chamber (EAST-UA 228) as an elective course in the future. Consult the CAS Bulletin for prerequisites.

Political Cinema and Representation of the \"Other\" FRSEM-UA 463 Instructor: Shimon Dotan Friday, 9:30 a.m.-noon Required cohort meeting: Friday, 12:30-1:30 p.m. Note: conflicts with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m.-1:45 p.m.) and with Advanced Chemistry I recitation (Friday, 11:00 a.m.-12:15 p.m.). In contemporary war, \"the other\" is viewed not only as an enemy to be fought but often, as one to be eliminated. How do filmmakers fight against (or alternately, reinforce) such deadly representations? In exploring various cinematic and thematic elements we will primarily focus on films from one of the world's most conflict-ridden regions\u2014the Middle East. We will also explore films from Russia, Germany, France and the US. Through readings and film screenings, we will investigate how \"the other\" is constructed politically, aesthetically and ethically. This class is designed for anyone interested in filmmaking and film criticism, contemporary politics and history, cinema of conflict and violence, and the ethical questions associated with them. SHIMON DOTAN, a Fellow of the New York Institute of the Humanities at NYU, is an award-winning filmmaker with thirteen feature films to his credit. His films have received the Silver Bear Award at the Berlin Film Festival ( The Smile of the Lamb ), numerous Israeli Academy Awards, including Best Film and Best Director ( Repeat Dive; The Smile of the Lamb ), and Best Film at the Newport Beach Film Festival ( You Can Thank Me Later ). His film Hot House won the Special Jury Prize at Sundance in 2007.

New Media, Activism, and Social Change FRSEM-UA 465 Instructor: Arely Zimmerman Wednesday, 2:00-4:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Monday, 2:00-3:00 p.m. This class explores the uses of networked communication to mobilize civic, political, and social movement participation. Students explore the opportunities and limits of digital activism in transforming social inequalities, fostering social connectivity, and deepening democratic citizenship. We problematize how race, class, gender, generation, and other categories of difference shape digital media literacy and access, and how marginalized communities overcome barriers to online digital participation. While we focus primarily on immigrant rights and other social justice movements in the U.S., we also use comparative cases from across the globe to compare and contrast how new media is reshaping the way people engage in politics, form and express political and civic identities, organize across borders, and act collectively. ARELY ZIMMERMAN holds a PhD in Political Science from the University of California (Los Angeles), with specializations in political theory and race and ethnic politics. Her work examines social movements and immigrant rights activism through the lens of democratic theory. Her current book project, Contesting Citizenship: Central Americans and the Politics of Belonging Across Borders , outlines a framework of citizenship in contexts of transnational exclusion through a case study of US Central American communities and their struggles for legalization. She is concurrently working on new research in the areas of youth, second generation Latino/a civic engagement, and new media.  What is College For? FRSEM-UA 474 Instructor: Trace Jordan  syllabus Wednesday, 2:00-4:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Monday, 2:00-3:00 p.m. Why did you decide to attend college? To broaden your intellectual horizons and become a more open-minded person? To gain specialized knowledge? To achieve a more successful and financially rewarding career? To make new friends? To become an engaged participant in a democratic society? To satisfy your parents' plans for your future? Or perhaps some combination of these reasons that you are still figuring out? This seminar examines historical and contemporary discussions about the personal and social goals of higher education and studies issues that have the potential to profoundly transform the college experience in coming years. It also prompts students to be more reflective and purposeful about their own academic choices at NYU. TRACE JORDAN is Clinical Professor and Associate Director of the College Core Curriculum. His research interests and publications include the role of science education in a liberal arts curriculum, the use of computer simulations for teaching and learning chemistry, and the impact of interest and motivation on educational engagement and achievement.

Gender, Sexuality and the Law FRSEM-UA 480 Instructor: Shelley Fischel Monday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Wednesday, 3:30\u20134:30 p.m. What impact has law had on gender and sexuality inequalities? What impact could or should law have? This course explores gender and sexuality discrimination in American jurisprudence as it has developed under the Constitution as well as its consequences in spheres of work, politics, and social life. We address such matters as marriage and divorce law, the Civil Rights Act and Title IX, and the unique, perhaps troubling ways that criminal law treats crimes associated with sexuality, rape, domestic abuse, and sexuality orientation. We also address the intersection of these matters with issues of gender identity and sexual orientation. This course offers a history of US sex law and analyzes contemporary doctrinal, judicial and legislative developments. SHELLEY D. FISCHEL served as Executive Vice President of Home Box Office, Inc., responsible for Human Resources, Facilities and Real Estate, as well as labor law matters, until her retirement in December 2009. She oversaw all sexual discrimination claims in the company. She received her JD from Columbia University and her LLM from NYU.  Global Citizenship: Theory and Practice FRSEM-UA 484 Instructor: Ulrich Baer Monday, 2:00-4:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Wednesday, 3:30-4:30 p.m. The seminar explores the notion and practice of global citizenship-the capacity and willingness to think across and beyond actual and imagined boundaries, and to develop skills that can solve problems and explore opportunities in unfamiliar contexts. The course examines globalization as a historical, economic, and cultural phenomenon. Topics include local resistance to global homogeneity; the notion of universal humanism; human rights; the role of language in global contexts; the idea of citizenship; the specificity of culture and arts; the idea of film or photography as universal languages; and an exploration of New York City as an international city that has turned its diversity into strength. The seminar brings in guest speakers who identify as global citizens, and asks students to consider how their own actions-ranging from activism to business leadership-may have an impact on those outside their immediate world. ULRICH BAER, Vice Provost of Arts, Humanities and Multicultural Affairs and Professor of Comparative Literature and German, was awarded the College's Golden Dozen Award for Excellence in Teaching in 1998 and 2004.

Propaganda Portraits: Royal Imagery in the Age of Absolutism FRSEM-UA 488 Instructor: William Ambler Wednesday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m Required cohort meeting: Monday, 2:00\u20133:00 p.m. This course studies the relationship between art and politics in European baroque state portraiture. In the 17th century, with few means to reach a broad populace, depictions of the king played a central part in convincing the people of a monarch\u2019s legitimate authority. The most talented artists of the age glorified their kings in ways that gave visual form to political theories that justified increasingly centralized royal rule. We set the portraits in the context of debates that preoccupied the European courts of the time: the Reformation; the dynastic ambitions of European royal houses; and political theories of legitimate government. We also consider the position of artists at a royal court and preexisting traditions of royal imagery. WILLIAM AMBLER is an independent art historian with expertise in Spanish baroque art and eighteenth-century English architecture. He has been a curator at the Hispanic Society of America in New York City and has participated in exhibitions there, as well as at the Metropolitan Museum, Jewish Museum, and Federal Reserve in Washington, D.C.  The Cultural Nature of Language FRSEM-UA 496 Instructor: Bambi Schieffelin Wednesday, 2:00-4:45 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Monday, 2:00-3:00 p.m. From accents, pronouns, swearing, and spelling, how one uses language is never value-free. In this seminar we examine language-using as a social practice, and analyze how speakers and their language(s) are evaluated and regulated across a range of contexts and cultures. Starting with how children learn to talk, or don't (e.g., feral children), we examine speech and silence across a range of societies. We look at popular attitudes toward language and the practices by which people regulate its use in the media (e.g., political correctness), in legal and educational institutions (e.g., \"English Only\"), and in multilingual cities (e.g., Barcelona, Montreal) in order to understand how ideas about language are often recruited to non-linguistic concerns, such as who should be included and who excluded. In thinking about the cultural nature of language in this way, we critically explore issues of identity and authority. BAMBI SCHIEFFELIN is Collegiate Professor and Professor of Anthropology. A linguistic anthropologist, she is the author of The Give and Take of Everyday Life: Language Socialization of Kaluli Children and co-editor of, among other books, The Acquisition of Literacy: Ethnographic Perspectives ; Language Ideologies: Practice and Theory ; and Consequences of Contact . She has also published articles in the preeminent journals of her field. She is completing a book on the impact of Christianity on the language and social life of Bosavi people of Papua New Guinea over the past twenty-five years, and continues research on linguistic creativity and change as evidenced in computer-mediated communication such as IM. Professor Schieffelin received the College's Golden Dozen Award for Teaching Excellence in 2010.  How We See FRSEM-UA 497 Instructor: Marisa Carrasco  syllabus Thursday, 9:30 a.m.-noon Required cohort meeting: Tuesday, 11:00 a.m.-noon Do we see the world the way we do because we are the way we are or because the world is the way it is? This course looks at what we know about vision from multiple scientific perspectives: perceptual psychology tells us about the process of seeing, and provides important insights into the workings of visual mechanisms; neuropsychology shows us what happens to perception when these mechanisms malfunction; neuroscience tells us about processes at the level of cells and neural systems. At the same time, we discuss modes and techniques of scientific inquiry from these different perspectives. How do vision scientists learn? What kinds of experiments do they conduct? How has the development of new neuroimaging techniques (fMRI, for example) shaped the field? MARISA CARRASCO is Collegiate Professor and Professor of Psychology and Neural Science, as well as a former Chairperson of the Department of Psychology. Born and raised in Mexico City, she received her licentiate in psychology from the National University of Mexico and her PhD in psychology (cognition and perception) from Princeton University. She conducts research in cognitive neuroscience, exploring the relation between the psychological and neural mechanisms involved in visual perception and attention. Her papers have been published in the leading scientific journals in the field, and she has won numerous prestigious awards and fellowships throughout her career, such as an American Association of University Women Fellowship, a National Young Investigator Award from the National Science Foundation, a Cattell Fellowship, and a Guggenheim Fellowship.  The New Worlds of Work and Care FRSEM-UA 500 Instructor: Kathleen Gerson   syllabus Wednesday, 3:30\u20136:00 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Monday, 3:30\u20134:30 p.m. The early 21st century represents a period of immense social change in both the public world of work and the private world of family care. New technologies have blurred the boundary between home and work. New opportunities and pressures have sent more women into the workplace. The \u201cnew economy\u201d has created jobs with more short-term flexibility, but less long-term security. And new options in intimate relationships have created more diverse and voluntary, but less predictable, family bonds. These intertwined shifts are reshaping the daily lives and life pathways of American women and men. This seminar addresses several questions: What does an overview of changes in work, family, and gender patterns tell us about where we are now and where we are going? What are the major dilemmas created by these changes, and how are people coping with these conflicts? What are the implications for the future? And what can we do to enhance the opportunities and limit the insecurities of these new social arrangements? KATHLEEN GERSON, Collegiate Professor and Professor of Sociology, is a recognized authority on the connections among gender, work, and family life in postindustrial societies. She has held visiting positions at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences at Stanford University, the Russell Sage Foundation in New York City, and the Center for the Study of Status Passages in the Life Course at Bremen University, Germany and has won numerous prestigious prizes for her scholarly work. Her books include The Unfinished Revolution: Coming of Age in a New Era of Gender, Work, and Family ; The Time Divide: Family, Work, and Gender Inequality (with Jerry A. Jacobs); No Man\u2019s Land: Men\u2019s Changing Commitments to Family and Work ; and Hard Choices: How Women Decide About Work, Career, and Motherhood .  Frontiers of Biology FRSEM-UA 502 Instructor: Edo Kussell  syllabus Tuesday, 3:30-6:00 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Thursday, 3:30-4:30 p.m. Prerequisites: Both AP Biology 4 or 5 (or equivalent international credential) and at least one additional AP science (or mathematics) score of 4 or 5 (or equivalent international credential). This seminar focuses on the latest discoveries in biology and the technological innovations that enable them. Through a combination of readings, lectures, and discussions, the seminar leapfrogs classical textbook biology and mere memorization to present science at the forefront of biological research. Topics that may be covered (always in great depth and detail) include metagenomics, synthetic biology, quantitative immunology, microbial ecology, and biology at the single-molecule level. Emphasis is placed on understanding how the scientific research process works in today's world. Students contribute on a weekly basis to an on-line science blog: http://www.frontiersofbiology.org . This demanding course is geared towards highly motivated individuals, with a superlative high school background in science and a deep passion for scientific inquiry, but is open to students in all majors. EDO KUSSELL is Associate Professor of Biology and Physics, and a faculty member in the Center for Genomics and Systems Biology at NYU.

His research is on evolutionary dynamics in general, with a focus on microorganisms, and his lab studies bacterial adaptations to fluctuating environments, combining mathematical modeling, physics, and experimental biology.  In Search of Lost Time FRSEM-UA 503 Instructor: Marcelle Clements   syllabus Thursday, 2:00\u20134:45 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Tuesday, 2:00\u20133:00 p.m. We read Marcel Proust (in translation) as he should be read: hedonistically\u2014with respect and admiration but also with delectation. At more than 4,000 pages, In Search of Lost Time is one of modern literature\u2019s most challenging and pleasurable reads, still unparalleled in how it combines finesse and wit with raw emotion, self-examination with social history, and psychological acuity with a portrait of the French beau monde at the outset of modernity. Though Proust (1871\u20131922) is often cited as France\u2019s greatest novelist, many readers never move past the first fifty pages of his novel, reading the same gorgeous sentences again and again. However, as its architecture cannot be appreciated until it has been read once in its entirety, we move at a brisk pace through all six volumes; when we read the final volume, we can begin to understand the extraordinarily intimate relationship Proust has created with his reader. In-class creative writing exercises are designed to help with the reading and to expand an expressive, personal response. Reading assignments average 350 pages per week. MARCELLE CLEMENTS is Collegiate Professor and Fellow of the New York Institute for the Humanities at NYU. She is the author of a collection of essays, The Dog Is Us and Other Observations , a book of nonfiction, The Improvised Woman , and two novels, Rock Me and, most recently, Midsummer . Her prizewinning articles and essays on the arts, culture, and politics have appeared in many national publications.  American Wars, Past and Present: Vietnam, Iraq (I and II), Afghanistan FRSEM-UA 504 Instructor: Marilyn B. Young   syllabus Friday, 9:30 a.m.-noon Required cohort meeting: Tuesday, 3:30-4:30 p.m. Note: conflicts with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m.-1:45 p.m.) and with Advanced Chemistry I recitation (Friday, 11:00 a.m.-12:15 p.m.). This course considers the last two major wars of the 20th century and the first two wars of the 21st. It begins with the history and memory of the Vietnam War. We then move on to examine Gulf War I (Operation Desert Storm), which was shaped by how the administration of George H.W. Bush understood the Vietnam War. The subsequent war in Iraq (Operation Iraqi Freedom) can be understood in part in terms of what some policymakers believed to be the unfinished business of Gulf War I, yet it, too, was fought in the shadow of Vietnam analogies. Finally, in terms of tactics and goals, the war in Afghanistan, launched in response to 9/11, has been shaped by all three of the preceding wars. We examine these wars through primary documents and secondary sources as well as the documentary and fiction film in which they have been represented. The overarching concern of the seminar is the ongoing haunting of American politics\u2014military and civilian\u2014by a war fought over three decades ago. There are two connected questions: Can history teach? What does it teach? MARILYN B. YOUNG, Collegiate Professor and Professor of History, is a former Chair of the History Department. Her teaching and her writing focus on U.S. foreign policy. Her books include The Vietnam Wars, 1945-1990 and The Rhetoric of Empire: American China Policy, 1895-1901 . She has also edited several collections of essays on the wars in Iraq and, most recently, Bombing Civilians: A 20th-Century History . She was Director of the Project on the Cold War as a Global Conflict at NYU's International Center for Advanced Study from 2001 to 2004 and served as President of the Society of Historians of American Foreign Relations in 2011. She has been the recipient of a Guggenheim Fellowship and of an American Council of Learned Societies Fellowship, and has won the College's Golden Dozen Award for Teaching Excellence twice. She is currently Co-Director of the Tamiment Center on the Cold War.  Helen of Troy and Her Ghosts FRSEM-UA 505 Instructor: Liana Theodoratou Tuesday, 3:30-6:00 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Thursday, 3:30-4:30 p.m. In Homer's Iliad , Helen, reflecting on her destiny, proclaims that her function is not primarily to be a woman, but to be first and foremost a story: \"On us the gods have set an evil destiny,\" she explains, \"that we should be a singer's theme / for generations to come\" (Il.6.357-58). Taking its point of departure from the Helen of ancient Greece-the daughter of Zeus and Leda-this course traces the various Helens whose stories have been told throughout the history of Western literature-from the Helen of Homer to that of Sappho, Aeschylus, Euripides, Pierre de Ronsard, Christopher Marlowe, J.G.W. Goethe, Jean Giraudoux, W.B.Yeats, Paul Val\u00e9ry, Yannis Ritsos, and beyond. Tracing this history will permit us to think about the survival of the past in the present, about the role and place of representation in the establishment of identity in general, and about the way in which the present is haunted by the phantoms of the past. LIANA THEODORATOU is Clinical Professor and Director of the Alexander S. Onassis Program in Hellenic Studies and Director of the NYU in Athens Program. She is a recipient of the College's Outstanding Teaching Award and of its Golden Dozen Award for Teaching Excellence. She has written widely on ancient and modern Greek poetry and has translated several works by, among others, Foucault, Althusser, and Derrida into Modern Greek. She is currently completing a book on the politics of mourning in contemporary Greek poetry, entitled Mourning Becomes Greece .  Game Theory and the Humanities FRSEM-UA 506 Instructor: Steven J. Brams   syllabus Wednesday, 4:55-7:25 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Monday, 3:30-4:30 p.m. Game theory is a mathematical theory of strategy that has been applied to the analysis of conflict and cooperation in such fields as economics, political science, and biology. In this seminar, we discuss more unusual applications-to history, literature, philosophy, the Bible, theology, and law. We discuss Abraham's decision to offer his son Isaac for sacrifice; the choices made by accused witches and their persecutors in medieval witch trials; Lady Macbeth's incitement of her husband to murder King Duncan in Shakespeare's play; several strategic games played by presidents and their antagonists in domestic crises (e.g., the Civil War) and international crises (e.g., the Cuban missile crisis), and coping mechanisms used by characters in catch-22 games (including those in Joseph Heller's novel Catch-22). Prerequisite: No mathematical background beyond high school mathematics is assumed, but a willingness to learn and apply sophisticated reasoning to analyze the interactions of players in games is essential . STEVEN J. BRAMS is Professor of Politics at NYU. He is the author of several books-most recently, Mathematics and Democracy and Game Theory and the Humanities -that apply game theory and social choice theory to voting and elections, bargaining and fairness, international relations, and the Bible, theology and literature. He holds two patents for fair-division algorithms and is Chairman of the Advisory Board of Fair Outcomes, Inc., and a former president of the Peace Science Society and of the Public Choice Society. He is an American Association for the Advancement of Science Fellow and was a Guggenheim Fellow and Visiting Scholar at the Russell Sage Foundation.  Writing the Self and New York FRSEM-UA 520 Instructor: David J. Dent Tuesday, 3:30\u20136:00 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Thursday, 3:30\u20134:30 p.m. Students begin the semester by dusting off their college admissions essay. In our first exercise, we push beyond the boundary of the personal essay to expand it into a piece of narrative nonfiction. For the rest of the semester, students explore New York through a series of writing assignments on urban life designed to sharpen their skills in social and cultural analysis and writing. Students read classic pieces of literary nonfiction, personal essays and fiction about life in New York. DAVID J. DENT is Associate Professor of Journalism and Social and Cultural Analysis at NYU. His book In Search of Black America was a New York Times Notable Book of 2000. He has written for the New York Times , Playboy , GQ , Salon , and the Washington Post among others, and blogs at www.bushobamaamerica.com (which he founded). He is author of the forthcoming The American Extreme , to be published by St. Martin\u2019s Press, and The Best Essay of Your Life: The College Admissions Essay , to be published by Random House. He and his wife Valerie are co-founders and directors of www.writeforthefuture.com, which uses the tools of journalism to help middle and high school students become better writers.  Race and Culture in Brazil FRSEM-UA 536 Instructor: Dylon Robbins Monday, 3:30-6:00 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Friday, 12:30-1:30 p.m. Note: conflicts with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m.-1:45 p.m). Brazil is often invoked in conversations about race and culture, held up as an example for its presumably more egalitarian race relations, considered the embodiment of an exceptional fusion of African, Indigenous, and European elements and a model for understanding heterogeneity and difference. And yet it is also a nation frequently cited for its incidence of violence and extreme economic inequality. This seminar explores some of the unique contradictions shaping Brazilian reality. We trace the history of race relations in the ongoing transformation of Brazilian culture, looking at key social, political, and economic factors such as slavery and the plantation economy, popular music, Carnival, populism, racial democracy, affirmative action, and urban and rural violence. How do race and culture coincide and diverge in Brazil? And what may we gather about these convergences and divergences from textual, musical, and cinematic examples? DYLON ROBBINS is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Spanish and Portuguese. He teaches courses on Brazil and the Caribbean, with particular emphasis on the cultural and theoretical production of these regions and their place in the African Diaspora. With support from a Fulbright-Hays Fellowship, he undertook research in Brazil at the Cinemateca Brasileira and the Instituto de Estudos Brasileiros and, in Cuba, at the ICAIC, the Biblioteca Nacional, and the Casa de las Am\u00e9ricas. Professor Robbins is currently completing his book manuscript on popular music and political subjectivity in Brazil.  Pirates, Privateers and Other Maritime Renegades of the Caribbean FRSEM-UA 538 Instructor: Edgardo Morales Tuesday, 9:30 a.m.-12:00 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Thursday, 9:30-10:30 a.m. Today,   the Jolly Roger\u2014the pirate flag\u2014is displayed on toys and makes for   compelling cinema. In real life, however, flying that flag was a   criminal act punishable with the death penalty. This course is about the   pirates, privateers and runaways of the early modern Caribbean, who   fought, stole, lied and killed in order to make a living and either to   collaborate with or oppose bosses and empires. We use the history of   maritime renegades as an opportunity to develop historical research and   writing skills, and to help us think critically about topics that might   otherwise escape scholarly inquiry, for while outsiders often described   them as mere villains, privateers like Francis Drake, pirates like Anne   Bonny, or runaway slaves like Tom King lived at the very center of the   important political questions of their age. Students read original   documents from the 16th, 17th, and 18th centuries as well as   contemporary historical scholarship. EDGARDO PEREZ MORALES   teaches at NYU's Center for Latin American and Caribbean Studies. He   graduated with a PhD in history from the University of Michigan and has   conducted research on privateers during the Age of Revolutions in   archives and libraries in Colombia, Cuba, France, Jamaica, Spain and the   United States.  Facing Fascism: The Spanish Civil War and U.S. Culture FRSEM-UA 539 Instructor: James D. Fernandez Monday, 11:00 a.m.-1:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Wednesday, 11:00 a.m.-noon Note: conflicts with Experimental Physics I (Monday 11:00 a.m.-12:15 p.m.) Prerequisites: 4 or 5 in AP Spanish or reported 4 or 5 in either AP U.S. History or AP World History (or international equivalent). The Great Depression. Liberal democracy in crisis. On the rise: a spectrum of ideologies ranging from anarchism to fascism, promising solutions to the afflictions of people all over the planet. July 1936: a right-wing military coup attempts to overthrow a democratically elected left-wing coalition government in Spain, and war begins. This course explores the place occupied by Spain and the Spanish Civil War in American culture from the 1930s forward; how journalists, writers, artists, and citizens reacted to the war; and how the legacy of the war has affected U.S. culture over the last 70 years. It also introduces students to research methods in history and culture, as they carry out a major archival research project based on unique sources in NYU's Abraham Lincoln Brigade Archives (ALBA), a vast collection of materials that chronicles the lives of the 2,800 Americans who, between 1936 and 1939, volunteered to fight fascism in Spain. JAMES D. FERN\u00c1NDEZ is Associate Professor in the Department of Spanish and Portuguese. His research interests include the literature, history, and culture of modern Spain; autobiography; cultural relations between Spain and Latin America; and visions of Spain in the United States. He served as the Director of NYU's King Juan Carlos I of Spain Center from 1995 to 2007 and as Chairperson of the Department of Spanish and Portuguese from 2003 to 2007. He is the Vice-Chairperson of the Board of Governors of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade Archives. He is the author of Apology to Apostrophe: Autobiography and the Rhetoric of Self-Representation in Spain and co-editor of the essay collection Facing Fascism: New York and the Spanish Civil War .  In Their Own Words: Oral History and Irish New York FRSEM-UA 540 Instructor: Linda Dowling Almeida  syllabus Tuesday, 9:30 a.m.\u2013noon Required cohort meeting: Thursday, 9:30\u201310:30 a.m. This interdisciplinary course focuses on oral history as a resource for understanding the 20th-century history of the Irish in America, particularly in New York. With access to the 300-plus interviews in Glucksman Ireland House's Oral History collection, students explore the discipline of oral history as it has progressed over the last twenty years and develop their own research, writing and interviewing skills. The course demonstrates how oral history gives life to ethnic communities like those of Irish longshoremen, personalizes dramatic events like 9/11, and provides insight into Irish American literature. In addition to reading traditional texts, we work with digital maps, walk the streets of the communities we study, and screen documentaries. LINDA DOWLING ALMEIDA, Adjunct Assistant Professor of Irish Studies at NYU\u2019s Glucksman Ireland House, teaches classes in the history and literature of Irish America. Her book Irish Immigrants in New York City, 1945-1995 (2001) compares the experience of the Irish who arrived in the 1950s with that of their counterparts thirty and forty years later. Professor Almeida has published chapters in The Irish World Wide (1992), Ireland in the 1950s (2004), and Making the Irish American (2006) and delivered papers on pedagogical approaches to oral history to both the Oral History Association and the International Oral History Association. Her latest project involves the production of podcasts on a variety of themes and issues drawn from the archives. Conspiracy Theories: Paranoid Fictions Before and After Freud FRSEM-UA 541 Instructor: Eliot Borenstein  syllabus Wednesday, 9:30 a.m.\u2013noon Required cohort meeting: Monday, 11:00 a.m.\u2013noon Note: conflicts with Principles of Biology I (Monday and Wednesday 9:30\u201310:45 a.m.) and with Introductory Experimental Physics I (Monday, 11:00 a.m.\u201312:15 p.m.). Conspiracy theories are intricate attempts to impose rational order on increasingly chaotic systems, all through the vehicle of narrative. They are explanatory myths but, unlike many creation stories, they deal with demiurges rather than full-fledged gods, seeking to show how dark forces have ruined a preexisting world, rather than inventing a world whole-cloth. In this course, we read narratives that both exemplify and explore the modernist and postmodernist paranoid mindset. Our readings consist primarily of novels and short stories, but also include works of literary and psychological theory, as well as case studies in the rise and fall of particular conspiracy theories. ELIOT BORENSTEIN, Collegiate Professor and Professor of Russian and Slavic Studies, has served as Chairperson of the Department of Russian &amp; Slavic Studies and as Director of the College Core Curriculum. Before coming to NYU in 1995, he directed the Fulbright Program in the Russian Federation and taught at the University of Virginia. His first book, Men without Women: Masculinity and Revolution in Russian Fiction, 1917-1919 , won the AATSEEL award for best work in literary scholarship in 2000. In 2007, he published Overkill: Sex and Violence in Contemporary Russian Popular Culture , which received the AWSS award for best book in Slavic Gender Studies in 2008. Recently, he was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship to finish the companion volume, Catastrophe of the Week: Apocalyptic Entertainment in Post-Soviet Russia . He is a two-time recipient of the College's Golden Dozen Award for Teaching Excellence.  Anthropology and Literature of the Other FRSEM-UA 542 Instructor: Thomas Beidelman Monday, 12:30\u20133:00 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Wednesday, 12:30\u20131:30 p.m. This course considers the central problem in social anthropology and history: the translation of the beliefs and practices of societies different from our own in place or time (or both) into words we can understand. How can we comprehend the world of the ancient Greeks through a translation of Homer? How can we be sure that we grasp what the King James Bible \u201creally\u201d means, when we are five centuries removed from its translation (in seventeenth-century monarchical England) from the even more remote Hebrew and Greek? We begin and end the course with translations in an African context: an anthropologist\u2019s account of her effort to translate Hamlet to the Ghanaians she was studying, and two interconnected novels by Chinua Achebe that raise profound questions of identity, meaning, and displacement. T. O. BEIDELMAN is Professor of Anthropology at NYU. He is the author of many books and articles on the anthropology and history of Africa, social theory, religion, symbolism and colonialism. His most recent books are The Culture of Colonialism (2012) and The Cool Knife (1997). He is presently working on a book on how Homer may be used to teach introductory anthropology. He is the recipient of the College\u2019s Golden Dozen Award for Teaching Excellence and the Herskovits Prize for the best American book on Africa published in the social sciences. He has a D. Phil. from Trinity College, Oxford University.  The Wild Child FRSEM-UA 543 Instructor: Patricia Crain   syllabus Thursday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Tuesday, 2:00\u20133:00 p.m. Childhood as Western culture has imagined it since the 18th century is full of paradoxes: sequestered, protected, and schooled, yet free, creative, and imaginative. As this child of modernity was being invented, another child came into being: the so-called \u201cwild\u201d or \u201cferal\u201d child, without parents or language, emerging on the margins of society, an object of fear and fascination, of scientific investigation and artistic imaginings. This seminar explores notable 19th-century feral child cases\u2014Victor of Aveyron and Kaspar Hauser\u2014and the contemporary documents that introduced them. We try to understand the cultural significance of the wild child and consider why this figure has drawn the attention of novelists, playwrights, and filmmakers, across historical and national borders. What does the wild child allow art to explore and reflect upon? What does the wild child have to say about constructions of modern childhood and of gender, race, and sexuality? PATRICIA CRAIN is Associate Professor of English. She is the award-winning author of The Story of A: The Alphabetization of America from The New England Primer to The Scarlet Letter , as well as of articles on the history of childhood and the history of literacy in America. Her current project is a study of the child reader in the 19thcentury US. She has also taught at Princeton University and at the University of Minnesota-Twin Cities  Harems and Court Cultures FRSEM-UA 544 Instructor: Leslie Peirce  syllabus Thursday, 3:30-6:00 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Tuesday, 3:30-4:30 p.m. Everyone knows the stereotype of harems, but this course studies them as an important historical phenomenon widespread in time and space. Although sometimes merely sexual objects or vehicles for biological reproduction, women living in harems and royal courts typically enjoyed a society of their own that was often highly developed culturally. They might, moreover, wield considerable power\u2014political, economic and artistic. While this course focuses principally on females, it is almost as much about males; for example, their own gendered spaces and cultures and their relationships with harem and court women. Studying harems informs us about social formations, expressions of political power, shifting conceptions of gender, and the ways in which women's separation and seclusion from males has been used in history to distinguish elites from ordinary people. The course focuses principally on the Near East, but includes extensive comparison with European and East Asian court and harem cultures. LESLIE PEIRCE, Silver Professor and Professor of History and Middle Eastern Studies, is an authority on the history and culture of the Ottoman Empire. She is the author of the prize-winning books Morality Tales: Law and Gender in the Ottoman Court of Aintab (2003) and The Imperial Harem: Women and Sovereignty in the Ottoman Empire (1993) and many scholarly articles. The focus of her current research is captivity and enslavement in the early-modern Eurasian region; she is writing a biography of a Russian slave who became concubine, then queen, of the sultan Suleyman the Magnificent.  Media and Communication in the Middle Ages FRSEM-UA 545 Instructor: Brigitte M. Bedos-Rezak   syllabus Tuesday, 2:00-4:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Thursday, 2:00-3:00 p.m. Medieval tools of communication and methods of transportation circulated news, rumors, propaganda, and revolutionary ideas; permitted contact with the supernatural; equipped governments with bureaucratic powers of local subjugation and global interaction; enabled people to travel far away from their homes on pilgrimages, diplomatic missions, entertainment tours (jongleurs, troubadours), commercial ventures, explorations, and conquests. With a focus on Western Europe, we consider modes and means of communication: languages, speech and writing, gestures, fashions, rituals, images, artifacts, and maps. Assessing the breadth of medieval mobility will elucidate a pre-modern world-system that extended across Eurasia, including the Mongol Empire, the Middle East, and China. BRIGITTE M. BEDOS-REZAK is Professor of History at NYU. Trained in France at the Sorbonne and at the \u00c9cole nationale des Chartes (Paris), her teaching and research interests cover medieval Europe, in particular its urban life and secular elites. She is particularly interested in the ways that increasingly material communicative practices shaped concepts of identity. Select publications include Les sceaux de villes (1980); When Ego was Imago: Signs of Identity in the Middle Ages (2010); \"Semiotic Anthropology: The Twelfth-Century Experiment,\" in European Transformations 950-1200 (2011); and \"Mutually Contextual: Materials, Bodies, and Objects,\" in Cultural Histories of the Material World (2013).  Travel and Communication in the Ancient World FRSEM-UA 546 Instructor: Raffaella Cribiore   syllabus Monday, 3:30-6:00 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Wednesday, 3:30\u20134:30 p.m This course explores traveling, communicating, and spreading news in antiquity. Unlike moderns, the ancients did not travel for leisure, and the notion of travel as \u201croutine\u201d would have been foreign to them; their journeys had mythic and epic significance and took place under precarious conditions. Likewise, whereas today we are able to communicate with each other in multiple convenient ways, sending letters and messages in the Greek and Roman worlds was cumbersome and time-intensive. Nonetheless, people did get in touch with each other and exchange news. Indeed, one of the goals of the course is to question what might be called a \u201cprogressive model\u201d of understanding communication(s) that automatically assumes the superiority of modern technology. RAFFAELLA CRIBIORE is Professor of Classics and an expert on education in antiquity. Her publications include Writing, Teachers and Students in Greco-Roman Egypt ; Gymnastics of the Mind: Greek Education in Hellenistic and Roman Egypt , which won the Goodwin Prize in 2003; and Women\u2019s Letters from Ancient Egypt, 300BC-AD 800 (with Roger Bagnall). Her most recent book, The School of Libanius in Late Antique Antioch , is the study of an elite school of rhetoric in Syria. Great Science, Fabulous Science, and Voodoo Science FRSEM-UA 547 Instructor: Allen Mincer   syllabus Wednesday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Monday, 2:00\u20133:00 p.m. Science is often portrayed as following a very clearly-defined set of procedures: start with a hypothesis, do an experiment and, based on the results, reject the hypothesis or adopt it as a working assumption. The actual process, however, is rarely so straightforward. In addition, the stories as usually told or recorded may differ from what really happened. For most of the semester, we study some famous, some lesser known, and some infamous experiments, mainly in the physical sciences, selected to illustrate intellectual tours de force, sloppiness, error, self-deception, and fraud, and the sometimes murky boundaries between them. Along the way, issues such as the discarding of \u201cfaulty data,\u201d theoretical bias, and probabilistic tools for hypothesis acceptance and rejection are discussed. In the latter part of the semester, we discuss how scientific ideas are evaluated by the media, in the courtroom, and in government. To take this course, students should have had high school chemistry, physics, and calculus. ALLEN MINCER, Collegiate Professor and Professor of Physics, specializes in experimental particle physics and particle astrophysics. He is currently a member of the ATLAS collaboration, which is studying the nature of the elementary building blocks of matter at the CERN Large Hadron Collider in Geneva, Switzerland. His research at NYU has a long, continuous history of generous support by grants from the National Science Foundation. He is co-author of approximately 400 scientific publications, including the discovery of the top quark with the D-Zero collaboration and the discovery of a particle consistent with the Standard Model Higgs Boson with the ATLAS Collaboration. In addition to teaching in the Physics Department, he has taught in the Steinhardt School\u2019s Department of Teaching and Learning, been involved in research in physics education, and has twice been awarded the College\u2019s Golden Dozen Award for Teaching Excellence. The Problem of Beauty FRSEM-UA 550 Instructor: G. Gabrielle Starr  syllabus Tuesday, 2:00-4:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Thursday, 3:30-4:30 p.m. What is beauty for? It is common in many circumstances to think of beauty as \"merely\" beautiful-something nice to have, but an unnecessary add-on to what really matters. This hasn't always been the case. Beauty has played an important part in philosophy, ethics and theology, and now it is playing an increasingly interesting role in biology, neuroscience, social policy and design. But what is beauty, anyway? And why should we care? This course explores the role of beauty across a variety of disciplines and across \"long time\" (not just the period from the ancient world to the present, but even the long time of evolution). G. GABRIELLE STARR is Professor of English and Seryl Kushner Dean of the College of Arts and Science. She has published widely on eighteenth-century British literature and the history of the aesthetic. With collaborators in NYU's Center for Neural Science, she has pursued research in the field of neuroaesthetics and published the results in Frontiers in Human Neuroscience . In addition, Dean Starr has just published a book entitled Feeling Beauty: Aesthetic Experience in the Brain and Across the Arts .  Renewal and Expansion in 12th-Century Europe FRSEM-UA 558 Instructor: Jill N. Claster   syllabus Thursday, 2:00-4:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Tuesday, 2:00-3:00 p.m. The 12th century in Europe was a period of astonishing change and creativity, as peace gradually replaced several centuries of invasions and chaos. The result was the growth of towns and trade; the expansion of literacy and the rise of universities; the rise in the position of women; the growth and expansion of technology; and an amazing amount of travel and adventure, of which the Crusades are only a part. These and more are part of our inheritance from this age. However, there was also an underside to the century, and we study that as well: the rise of anti-Semitism; the persecution of heretics; the harsh treatment of lepers and the poor. We contrast the sometimes terrible realities of what one historian has called a \"persecuting society\" with its exuberant accomplishments. JILL N. CLASTER is Professor of History Emerita. A medievalist, she has taught and studied the era of the Crusades extensively and is the author of the recently published book Sacred Violence: The European Crusades to the Middle East, 1096-1396 . She served as Dean of the College of Arts and Science and as Director of the Kevorkian Center for Near Eastern Studies. She was the recipient of a Fulbright Grant and was honored with the Distinguished Alumni Award by the Alumni Association of NYU.  Civil Rights and Civil Wrongs: The Fight for Equality in the United States FRSEM-UA 560 Instructor: K. Kevyne Baar   syllabus Thursday, 9:30 a.m.-noon Required cohort meeting: Tuesday, 11:00 a.m.-noon This course looks at the intersection of the three major movements for social justice and civil rights in the United States since 1850: the movements for African Americans' rights, women's rights, and gay rights. We pay particular attention to points of convergence and points of divergence, alliances and conflicts. For example, though some abolitionists and women's rights advocates found common cause in the 1850s, many abolitionists would feel their work was done with passage of the Fifteenth Amendment (which enfranchised formerly enslaved African American men). More recently, feminism in the 1970s had to contend with charges that it excluded women of color, lesbians, and working-class women. We set the dialogue on civil rights, including tensions over exclusions based on gender and sexuality, race, and class, in a world context and take a measure of where it stands today. KEVYNE BAAR is returning to NYU from a year spent teaching at Hacettepe University in Ankara, Turkey, on a Fulbright Award. A self-described non-traditional scholar, she entered academic life after a long career in theatre and union organizing, and spent ten years as an archivist at NYU's Tamiment Library and Robert F. Wagner Labor Archives, to which she attributes the important role that archives play in her courses. She is the recipient of the College's Outstanding Teaching Award for her course \"Women, the Entertainment Industry and the Blacklist Era.\"  Music and State Power 1948-1994: South Africa, Czechoslovakia, and the U.S. FRSEM-UA 561 Instructor: Michael Beckerman Wednesday, 12:30-3:00 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Friday, 12:30-1:30 p.m. Note: conflicts with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m.-1:45 p.m.) This course looks at the relationship between music, ethnic and racial difference, and state power under the communist regime in Czechoslovakia and the apartheid regime in South Africa between 1948 and 1994. We set the stage by exploring each country's unique historical context, then address such topics as State control of musical activity; the role of jazz and popular music in the struggle for equality and democracy; the symbolic power of national anthems in creating a national self-image; and finally, the role of sound in the revolutions that brought an end to communism in Czechoslovakia and apartheid in South Africa. We also look at the US in the same period. While there was no clear revolution in the US-either of a repressive or a liberating kind-we can ask questions about similar forces at work here. The culminating event of the course is an online video conference featuring presentations by class members and an international group of scholars. MICHAEL BECKERMAN is Collegiate Professor and Carroll and Milton Petrie Professor of Music at NYU and Distinguished Professor of History at Lancaster University. His wide range of scholarly expertise includes film scoring, the music of the Roma (Gypsies), Mozart, Brahms, exiled composers, and Czech music history. He is the author of, among other publications, Dvo\u0159\u00e1k and His World and Jan\u00e1\u010dek and His World . A pianist and composer, he has written the ballet Asolando Suite ; incidental music to The Tempest ; the Dark Woods Variations ; and the Hiawatha Melodrama .

Modern Poetry: Craft and Revolution FRSEM-UA 564 Instructor: Matthew Rohrer  syllabus Monday 11:00 a.m.-1:45 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Wednesday, 11:00 a.m.-noon Note: conflicts with Experimental Physics I (Monday, 11:00 a.m.-12:15 p.m.). This course thrusts students headlong into the dark cobwebby interiors of the modern poem. We look at several revolutions in thinking about what poems are, beginning in England in 1798, coming to Walt Whitman's and Emily Dickinson's America in the 1850s, stopping in Harlem in the 1920s, and ending up online. We look at how modern poems are actually put together, considering such elemental concerns as image, voice, and structure. And we also write our own poems, sometimes with these examples as our models. Students leave this course with a deeper understanding of the lineage of the modern poem and what makes the modern poem go, as well as, thanks to the generous and critical attentions of the workshop, the same understanding of their own work. MATTHEW ROHRER is a Clinical Associate Professor in the Creative Writing Program, where he teaches undergraduates and graduate students. He is the author of seven books of poetry, was a founder of Fence Magazine and Fence Books, and has participated in residencies and performances at the Museum of Modern Art (NYC) and the Henry Museum (Seattle). His poems have been widely anthologized, and he has appeared on NPR's All Things Considered and The Next Big Thing .  Interpreting the City FRSEM-UA 565 Instructor: David Serlin Tuesday, 9:30 a.m.-noon Required cohort meeting: Friday, 11:00 a.m.-noon Note: conflicts with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m.-1:45 p.m.) and with Advanced Chemistry I recitation (Friday, 11:00 a.m.-12:15 p.m.). This course uses New York City as both a field site and laboratory in order to give students theoretical and methodological tools for interpreting urban culture. For the millions of people who live, work, and visit, the city may at times appear to be a vast impersonal metropolis, but one nonetheless made meaningful by the infinite number of interactions that take place in and through its streets, buildings, spaces, and objects. So how might we come to understand urban culture not as something fixed but as a process? Readings in history, anthropology, museum studies, and critical theory (such as sensory studies), inform students' exploration of the physical and cognitive impacts of the built environment in relation to the economic, ethnic, gendered, sexual, and subjective dimensions of urban experience. Students make site visits, analyzing objects through written and visual documentation, and execute multimedia presentations, such as a virtual museum exhibit. DAVID SERLIN is Associate Professor of Communication at the University of California, San Diego, where he teaches courses in historical methodology, museum studies, visual and material culture, and architecture as a medium of communication. He is the author or editor of numerous books and articles, including Replaceable You: Engineering the Body in Postwar America , and serves on the editorial collective for the Radical History Review . During 2014-15 he will be a Visiting Research Professor in the Department of Social and Cultural Analysis at NYU. Digging for Dragon Bones: Unearthing Ancient China FRSEM-UA 567 Instructor: Roderick Campbell   syllabus Tuesday, 2:00-4:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Thursday, 2:00-3:00 p.m. Despite being less than a century old, the practice of archaeology of China has challenged, verified or rewritten traditional Chinese history since its inception. Today, with decades of double-digit economic growth driving countless archaeological salvage projects, the rate of discovery is surpassing the ability of archaeologists to make sense of the changing picture of the Chinese past. In this course we explore the prehistory and early history of the land that would become China in light of the most recent discoveries, such as the lost Bronze Age civilization of Sanxingdui and the first emperor's terracotta army. Through archaeological reports, historical texts, images and film, we attempt to come to grips with the vast and varied landscape that gave birth to one of the world's great civilizations. RODERICK CAMPBELL is Assistant Professor of East Asian Archaeology and History at NYU's Institute for the Study of the Ancient World. His research interests are archaeological political theory, sacrifice, and Shang civilization. Professor Campbell is co-director of a bone working assemblage at Anyang and is broadening his research into a multi-sited investigation of the Shang economy. He has recently published an edited volume entitled Violence and Civilization: Studies of Social Violence in History and Prehistory , and his book Archaeology of the Chinese Bronze Age: From Erlitou to Anyang is forthcoming with Cotsen Institute Press. Current writing projects include articles on cattle traction, the introduction to wheeled vehicles to China, the nature of animals in Shang art and a synthetic book-length multi-disciplinary history of the Shang polity. Gotham Schools: Urban Education Policy and the Pursuit of Equity FRSEM-UA 568 Instructor: Jennifer Jennings   syllabus Thursday, 3:30\u20136:00 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Friday, 12:30\u20131:30 p.m. Note: conflicts with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m.\u20131:45 p.m.). Never before has there been a stronger policy effort to reform America\u2019s urban schools. This course explores urban education reforms by using New York City as a case study. Through considering policy changes around school accountability and standardized testing, teacher evaluation, school choice, and prekindergarten access in New York City, we think systematically about their effects on schools, teachers, and students. In doing so, we grapple with many of the challenges that researchers face in conducting sociological and educational research. Whether your future lies in classrooms, a non-profit organization, the statehouse, the courthouse, or elsewhere, this course supplies you with a sociological toolkit to become a thoughtful and rigorous consumer of social science research. JENNIFER JENNINGS is Assistant Professor of Sociology at New York University. Before attending graduate school, she taught high school English and Social Studies in urban schools in New Jersey. Jennings\u2019s research focuses on understanding the impact of a range of education policies, such as the No Child Left Behind Act, teacher evaluation reform, and school choice, on educators\u2019 behavior and on racial, socioeconomic, and gender stratification in educational outcomes. She is currently working on a book manuscript entitled Why Schools Matter: The Impact of Schools on Children\u2019s Life Chances .  The Other City: New York in Poetry FRSEM-UA 569 Instructor: Tom\u00e1s Urayo\u00e1n Noel   syllabus Tuesday, 3:30-6:00 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Thursday, 3:30-4:30 p.m. Beyond the touristy New York, there is another city, an immigrant, working-class, bohemian, peripheral, and sometimes even quiet city. This seminar explores this other New York as captured by generations of poets, from Walt Whitman to Garc\u00eda Lorca to Patti Smith and the Nuyorican Poets Cafe. We combine close reading and formal analysis of poetry with visits to specific neighborhoods, sites, and archives (including digital archives). Along the way, we examine the mechanics of writing critically about poetry; explore alternative research tools, such as the field note, the microblog, oral history, and digital humanities project; and use our surroundings as a laboratory to experiment with different kinds of literary observation and analysis. Supplemental readings drawn from history, anthropology, journalism, and literary and cultural studies guide us in our explorations. TOM\u00c1S URAYO\u00c1N NOEL is an Assistant Professor in the Department of English and the Department of Spanish and Portuguese. Before coming to NYU, he taught at SUNY Albany and was a 2011-2012 Ford Foundation Postdoctoral Fellow at the Center for Puerto Rican Studies at Hunter College. He is the author of In Visible Movement: Nuyorican Poetry from the Sixties to Slam , and of various books of poetry in English and Spanish, as well as a contributing editor of Mandorla: New Writing from the Americas . His essays, poetry, and translations have appeared in such journals as Contemporary Literature , Fence , Small Axe , Latino Studies , and La Noria (Cuba). Also a performance poet, Noel has been featured in New York City venues such as the Nuyorican Poets Cafe and the Poetry Project at St. Mark's Church, as well as nationally and internationally.  Literature and Machines FRSEM-UA 572 Instructor: Nicola Cipani   syllabus Wednesday, 2:15-4:45 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Monday, 2:00-3:00 p.m. Machine   metaphors play an important role in modern literature, conveying   beliefs, anxieties, shifts, and reflections on key topics, including the   nature of consciousness and creativity; the dynamics of desire and   gratification; gender roles; the organization of society; the meaning of   \"nature\"; and the function of technology. This course explores   different manifestations of the machine theme, broadly clustered around   the following categories: imaginary machines constituting the   centerpiece of narrative plots; machine aesthetic as modernist ideal;   and mechanization of the inventive process (text-generating machines).   Students read and discuss a selection of works from different cultural   contexts, primarily from the late 19th and 20th century (e.g., Belle   \u00c9poque, Futurist, and postwar), representing a wide spectrum of   attitudes toward the machine, from dreamy immersion in virtual realities   to enlightened machine-assisted awakening, from the fear of   dehumanization to the desire for man-machine fusion. NICOLA   CIPANI is Assistant Clinical Professor at the Department of Italian   Studies and has been working at NYU for ten years. His interests include   reception of antiquity in medieval and early modern culture,   Renaissance philosophy, the intersection of verbal/ visual forms (such   as the art of memory, emblem books, and representations of dreams), and   20th-century experimental literature. At the Italian Department he has   served in the capacity of Director of Language Programs (since 2005),   Director of Summer Programs (2011-12), and Director of Undergraduate   Studies (2011, 2013).  From Guant\u00e1namo to GITMO: Camps, the U.S., and Comparative Colonialisms in the 20th Century FRSEM-UA 573 Instructor: Monica Kim   syllabus Monday, 2:00-4:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Friday, 12:30-1:30 p.m. Note: conflicts with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m.-1:45 p.m.) The   concentration camp has become a symbol of 20th century conflicts. In   this seminar, we examine shifts in the global imperial landscape through   a close study of people's experiences of building, living in, and   surviving camps. Rather than approaching the \"camp\" as an exception to   the everyday, we ask: How did the concentration camp develop? When did   societies perceive the need for one? How has decolonization changed (or   not changed) the practices of making a camp? How can the workings of a   particular camp shed light on the contemporaneous political landscape?   And what role does the \"camp\" play in different societies historical   memories? Emphasizing historical connections between the camps we use as   case studies, which may include German camps in 1880s Namibia and   British camps in 1950s Kenya, we begin with the reconcentrado policy of   Spanish colonialism in Cuba in 1880s and end with reflections on the   implications of Guant\u00e1namo Bay in Cuba for US imperialism. Readings   include both historical scholarship and an array of primary sources   (memoirs, oral history interviews, military documents, legal cases and   film). MONICA KIM is Assistant Professor in the Department of   History. Her research and teaching focus on three key issues concerning   the United States vis-\u00e0-vis the world: the relationships between   liberalism and racial formations; global militarism and sovereignty; and   transnational social movements and international law. Her current book   project, Humanity Interrogated , examines mid-20th-century crises around   warfare through a history of military interrogation rooms during the   Korean War. She has been a Fellow at the Penn Humanities Forum at the   University of Pennsylvania and also the University of Chicago.  Spring 2015  The Making of an Iconic Image FRSEM-UA 392 Instructor: Deborah Willis  syllabus Tuesday, 9:30 a.m.-noon Required cohort meeting: Thursday, 9:30-10:30 a.m. Iconic   images are pictures that become rooted in our personal memory and are   stored away for future reference through our experiences with them.   Often, the power of an iconic image is such that it extends beyond its   original purpose and takes on another form socially and historically.   This seminar explores the range of ideas and methods used by   photographers, artists, historians, filmmakers, and critical thinkers in   addressing the notion of iconic images within photography, video, and   film. Combining historical, contemporary, and theoretical approaches to   identity politics and visual culture, it addresses how images are   constructed. Class discussions highlight the trends and transformations   that have characterized the evolution of the iconic image. We use a   series of case studies to explore the construction of beauty and style,   gendered images, race, and pop culture. We also consider issues of   representation, display, and reception, particularly in relation to the   wider social context in which art, music, and culture are experienced in   private and public spaces. In addition to classes held on campus, field   trips are taken to archives, museums and galleries. Each week students   discuss a photograph of their own choice. DEBORAH WILLIS is   University Professor and Chairperson of the Department of Photography   &amp; Imaging at the Tisch School of the Arts at NYU and has an   affiliated appointment with Africana Studies in the Faculty of Arts and   Science. She has pursued a dual professional career as an art   photographer and as one of the nation's leading historians of African   American photography and curator of African American culture. She was a   2005 Guggenheim Fellow and Fletcher Fellow, and a 2000 MacArthur Fellow,   as well as the 1996 recipient of the Anonymous Was a Woman Foundation   Award. Professor Willis has just received the Honored Educator Award at   the Society for Photographic Education. Reading The Dream of the Red Chamber FRSEM-UA 461 Instructor: Jing Wang Monday, 3:30-6:10 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Wednesday, 3:30-4:30 p.m. Cao Xueqin's mid-18th century literary epic The Dream of the Red Chamber    is widely regarded as the culmination of the vernacular novel of   imperial China. With a tragic love story between two aristocratic   teenagers at its dramatic center, it covers a vast terrain of culture   and social life-the question of what is eternal and what is ephemeral;   the nature of \"qing,\" as the heart of being that both animates and   destroys life; individual talent and its fragility; and the decadence of   the elite, as well as growing, if hidden, social and class tensions.   The novel's manifold structure and intricate plot development, coupled   with its dazzling array of memorable characters, makes it one of the   most complex and colorful of all time. Note: Both reading and   discussions are conducted in English. No knowledge of Chinese culture,   language, or history is required or assumed. Native Chinese speakers who   wish to read and enjoy this masterpiece in the original language are   advised to choose a different Freshman Seminar and take Reading The   Dream of the Red Chamber (EAST-UA 228) as an elective course in the   future. Consult the CAS Bulletin for prerequisites. JING   WANG is Assistant Research Scholar in the College of Arts and Science   and the Department of East Asian Studies, where, from 1999 to 2006, she   was Lecturer in Chinese.

In addition to literary   translations, she also publishes personal essays.  Political Cinema and Representation of the \"Other\" FRSEM-UA 463 Instructor: Shimon Dotan Monday, 3:30-6:00 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Friday, 12:30-1:30 p.m. Note:   conflicts with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m.-1:45   p.m.)  In contemporary war, \"the other\" is viewed not only   as an enemy to be fought but often, as one to be eliminated. How do   filmmakers fight against (or alternately, reinforce) such deadly   representations? In exploring various cinematic and thematic elements we   will primarily focus on films from one of the world's most   conflict-ridden regions\u2014the Middle East. We will also explore films from   Russia, Germany, France and the US. Through readings and film   screenings, we will investigate how \"the other\" is constructed   politically, aesthetically and ethically. This class is designed for   anyone interested in filmmaking and film criticism, contemporary   politics and history, cinema of conflict and violence, and the ethical   questions associated with them. SHIMON DOTAN, a Fellow of the   New York Institute of the Humanities at NYU, is an award-winning   filmmaker with thirteen feature films to his credit. His films have   received the Silver Bear Award at the Berlin Film Festival ( The Smile of the Lamb ), numerous Israeli Academy Awards, including Best Film and Best Director ( Repeat Dive; The Smile of the Lamb ), and Best Film at the Newport Beach Film Festival ( You Can Thank Me Later ).

Synesthesia: Intersections of the Visual and Literary Arts FRSEM-UA 490 Instructor: Amy Bonnaffons Tuesday, 11:00 a.m.-1:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Thursday, 11:00 a.m.\u2013noon Note: conflicts with Physics I (Tuesday and Thursday 12:30-1:45 p.m.) This course will ask students to engage in both creative and academic writing as they explore the intersections of the visual and literary arts. How have notable writers been influenced and inspired by visual art? How have artists and writers attempted to \u201ctranslate\u201d one art form into the other? What do the literary and visual creative processes have in common, and what can each teach us about the other? We examine these questions through academic study and creative practice. Students visit NYC museums and galleries (the Guggenheim, MoMA, Brooklyn Museum, etc); read work by Kurt Vonnegut, Allen Ginsberg, Frank O\u2019Hara, Anne Sexton, and more; and write poetry, fiction, and essays inspired by visual art. In fall 2013 the class blogged some of its creative writing exercises at http://nyusynesthesia.tumblr.com AMY BONNAFFONS is a language lecturer in the Expository Writing Program. Her writing has appeared in the Wall Street Journal , the New York Daily News , Kenyon Review , Anderbo , and elsewhere, and has won awards from Yale University and Open City Magazine .

She holds a B.A. from Yale and an M.F.A. in Fiction Writing from NYU. Women in Social Movements in Latin America FRSEM-UA 493 Instructor: Pamela Calla  syllabus Thursday, 2:00-4:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Friday, 12:30-1:30 p.m. Note: conflicts with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m.\u20131:45 p.m.) The overarching theme of this seminar is women\u2019s political agency, in terms of emancipatory thought and action, in social movements throughout Latin America. While we locate this agency in specific national contexts, we also look at the rising transnationalism of the movements under scrutiny. More concretely, we focus on indigenous and other popular sectors, as well as the middle class, concentrating on the ways in which women brought new meanings and vitality to diverse forms of struggle. One of our central considerations is the historical relationship between social movements and the state, and the gendered logics that enter into negotiations between the two. We seek to weave together women\u2019s individual and collective thought and action, based on their own notion of what constitutes political and democratic gain, and the struggle for economic, cultural, racial, and gender justice. PAMELA CALLA, an anthropologist, is a Visiting Associate Professor at the Center for Latin American and Caribbean Studies at NYU and Director of the Observatory on Racism of the Universidad de la Cordillera in La Paz, Bolivia. She co-coordinates the \u201cNetwork of Observatories on Racism in the Americas,\u201d a joint initiative of Universidad de la Cordillera and the Teresa Lozano Long Institute of Latin American Studies, University of Texas. Her research focuses on race, gender, ethnicity, and state formation in Bolivia. She coedited Antropolog\u00eda del Estado: Dominaci\u00f3n y pr\u00e1cticas contestatarias en America Latina and Observando el racismo: Racismo y regionalismo en el proceso constituyente boliviano (to which she also contributed), and was an associate researcher of the United Nations Development Project\u2019s \u201cThe State of the State in Bolivia.\u201d  Nuclear Energy FRSEM-UA 512 Instructor: Antoine Cerfon  syllabus Monday, 2:00-4:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Wednesday, 3:30-4:30 p.m. Nuclear   power currently provides 13% of the world's electricity and is expected   to play an important role in the diversified energy mix that countries   are developing to meet the world's growing energy needs. As a   carbon-free, continuous energy source, it is an attractive solution for   base-load electricity production, and a desirable complement to   intermittent sources such as solar and wind. However, it also faces   serious technological, economical and societal challenges that question   its development. In this seminar, we follow a multidisciplinary approach   to explore the different dimensions of the debate about nuclear power.   We look at the basic nuclear physics in the core of power plants, the   different power plant concepts and their engineering solutions, the   nuclear fuel cycle, the issues of waste, safety and proliferation,   nuclear power economics, and the place of nuclear energy in the global   energy landscape. ANTOINE CERFON is Assistant Professor of   Mathematics at the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences. He   obtained his PhD in the Department of Nuclear Science and Engineering at   MIT, and stayed there for two more years as a post-doctoral researcher   before joining NYU in 2012. His main area of study is in plasma physics   for particle accelerators and nuclear fusion applications.  Encountering Martin Luther King, Jr. FRSEM-UA 519 Instructor: Philip Kunhardt  syllabus Thursday, 11:00 a.m.-1:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Tuesday, 11:00 a.m.-noon Note: conflicts with Physics I (Tuesday and Thursday 12:30-1:45 p.m.) This   course seeks to remember the human being at the center of the civil   rights movement, which took up the unfinished legacy of the Civil War   and Reconstruction to demand social and racial justice. Students explore   Martin Luther King Jr's thought, oratory, character, and public actions   in a way that makes him unforgettable to them. We consider his   tenaciously held philosophy of nonviolent social change, and his growth   from a southern Baptist minister to a civil rights activist to a   visionary leader of global human rights and peace. In what ways can new   information about his inner conflicts and personal flaws change our   appreciation of his moral stature? And how do we understand him in the   context of his times, amidst fellow activists, adversaries, elected   leaders, and critics during one of the most volatile, freedom-advancing   periods of American history? We consider the lessons of King and his   times for our own vastly changed but still violence-prone and   violence-haunted world. PHILIP KUNHARDT is Distinguished Scholar in Residence in the Humanities,   and teaches history and biography in the College of Arts and Science.   He focuses on the lives of transformative figures and has co-authored   five books, including Looking for Lincoln , The American President , and P.T. Barnum: America's Greatest Showman .   He was also writer and co-producer of more than a dozen documentary   films for PBS, ABC, HBO, Discovery, and others, including the ten-part   PBS series The American President , and the sixteen-part Freedom: A History of US . Before coming to NYU he was a Bard Center Fellow at Bard College in Annandale-on-Hudson, New York. Into the Urban Wild: Nature Writing and the City FRSEM-UA 522 Instructor: Tara K. Parmiter  syllabus Tuesday, 9:30 a.m.-noon Required cohort meeting: Friday, 11:00 a.m.-noon Note: conflicts with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m.-1:45 p.m.) and with Advanced Chemistry I recitation (Friday, 11:00 a.m.-12:15 p.m.). Essayist Loren Eiseley asserts that \"even in New York City there are patches of wilderness,\" encouraging his readers to rethink the way they define and limit their use of this loaded word. In this course we examine both the idea and the manifestation of these wildernesses, questioning the assumptions and the rhetoric we use when talking about the existence, construction, representation, cultivation, or manipulation of nature in our urban environment. We immerse ourselves in classics of American nature writing and then venture into the city, using our texts as lenses for reading such spaces as Central Park, the High Line, the Brooklyn Botanic Garden, and the American Natural History Museum. Readings include selections by Henry David Thoreau, John Burroughs, Aldo Leopold, Rachel Carson, Loren Eiseley, Annie Dillard, Terry Tempest Williams, bell hooks, Wendell Berry, and William Cronon, among others. Students compose both critical analyses of the texts and their own nature writing based on their exploration of and research into their own \"patch\" of New York wilderness. TARA K. PARMITER is a Senior Language Lecturer in the Expository Writing Program and a Mentor in the Undergraduate Writing Tutors Program. Her research interests include literature and the environment, turn-of-the-twentieth century women's literature, children's literature, travel narratives, and popular culture. She has published on topics ranging from the imagined landscapes in L. M. Montgomery's Anne of Green Gables novels to summer vacationing in Kate Chopin's The Awakening to journey narratives in the Muppet movies. She received her BA from Cornell and her PhD in English and American Literature from NYU.  Cultures of Science and Belief FRSEM-UA 527 Instructor: Noelle J. Mol\u00e9   syllabus Wednesday, 2:00-4:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Monday, 3:30-4:30 p.m. We regularly take for granted that scientific knowledge is objective. At the same time, we also know that scientific knowledge is constantly in flux, and that what we \"knew\" to be true yesterday is not true today. This seminar positions science along a spectrum of worldviews-explanatory models that provide causal reasons and underlying logics for events and actions-that includes magic, occultism, witchcraft, science, spirituality, and religion. Within particular historical and cultural contexts, a hurricane might be explained as the result of a witch's curse, a moving cold front, or an angry god. This course questions our deeply held assumptions regarding the neutrality of science and the so-called backwardness of folk belief; as we learn, the threshold between the categories of \"knowledge\" and \"belief\" is actually more blurred than we might initially expect. We explore the social, economic, and political implications of these hierarchies of knowledge, and examine how they shape how we experience our own bodies, our own feelings, and even our own minds. NOELLE J. MOL\u00c9 is a cultural anthropologist and author of Labor Disorders in Neoliberal Italy: Mobbing, Well-being and the Workplace . She is currently investigating the rise of scientific skepticism and supernatural beliefs in Italy as twin responses to a millennial crisis in knowledge production. She is a Senior Lecturer in the Expository Writing Program.  Sensual Shifts: From Looking to Listening in Modernist Literature FRSEM-UA 529 Instructor: Angela Frattarola  syllabus Tuesday, 3:30-6:00 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Thursday, 3:30-4:30 p.m. From Greek philosophy to the Enlightenment, vision was the privileged sense. Traditionally associated with knowledge and rationality, vision encourages a subject to keep a distanced, analytical perspective of an object. But does this always have to be the case? Can the other senses allow new ways of conceiving of and experiencing the relationship between the self and the world? This seminar begins by examining the dominance of vision in modernity and turns to audition as a way of thinking about alternative perceptions of the self and the world. We accomplish this by closely reading modernist novels that suggest a growing skepticism toward vision and heightened attention to sound and listening. In order to think about why modernists brought sound to the forefront of their art, we attempt to gain a sense of the modernist soundscape and the new auditory technologies of the time. Readings for the course consist of essays from sound studies as well as novels by Virginia Woolf, Dorothy Richardson, Jean Rhys, and James Joyce. ANGELA FRATTAROLA is a Senior Lecturer and Writing Tutor Mentor in NYU's Expository Writing Program. Her essays on modernist literature have appeared in such journals as Modern Drama , Genre , Mosaic , Studies in the Novel , Journal of Modern Literature , and Woolf Studies Annual . She has nearly completed a manuscript entitled Auditory Narrative in the Modernist Novel: Early Twentieth-Century Soundscapes and Audio-Technologies , a study that examines how modernist literature was shaped by developing auditory technologies and changes in auditory perception at the turn of the century.  A History of Disbelief FRSEM-UA 548 Instructor: Mitchell Stephens   syllabus Thursday, 12:30-3:00 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Tuesday, 12:30-1:30 p.m. Note: conflicts with Physics I (Tuesday and Thursday 12:30-1:45 p.m.) This seminar takes up an extended history of atheism and doubt (in the context of a history of religion). It begins with references to anthropology, the Hebrews and India, before discussing the skeptics and the development of disbelief in Greece and Rome. The course then follows the uneven progress of this idea and its consequences in continental Europe during the Renaissance, the Scientific Revolution, the Enlightenment, and the Romantic period, and in 19th-century England and America, where disbelief was allied with radical politics. Finally, we move on to the connection between disbelief and realism, modernism and postmodernism. The main arguments for and against the existence of God are considered. However, the main purpose of this course is to force students to confront and grapple with some of the most sophisticated and profound human expressions of disbelief. MITCHELL STEPHENS is Professor of Journalism. His book Imagine There's No Heaven: How Atheism Helped Create the Modern World was recently published by Palgrave. He is also the author of, among other books, the rise of the image the fall of the word and A History of News . His articles on media issues, philosophy, anthropology, physics, and other subjects appeared in the New York Times , Washington Post , Los Angeles Times , and other publications. His current book project is on the future of journalism. Russia: The Rule of Law in Question FRSEM-UA 549 Instructor: Jane Burbank  syllabus Tuesday, 9:30 a.m.-noon Required cohort meeting: Thursday, 9:30-10:30 a.m. The   popular image of Russia has been shaped by Western and Russian   commentators who bemoan corruption, criminality, and lawlessness as   endemic to Russian life; in this view, the phrase \"Russian law\" would be   an oxymoron. However, in the Russian Federation, law is very much at   work: the legal profession is attracting many students, and the case   loads of Russian courts have grown yearly since the early 1990s. Even in   February 2014, when the Russian military began their invasion of   Crimea, the Russian president asked for the authority to use force. How   can we explain this adherence to legal procedures by Russia's leaders   and citizens, in the context of harsh critiques of Russia's supposed   lawlessness? In this seminar, we explore the history of law in Russia,   how law is used in Russia today; and theories of \"rule of law.\" Our   materials include studies by historians and legal scholars, Russian   literature in translation, media coverage of legal issues, and laws   themselves. Students write short commentaries on their readings, one   book review, and a research paper on one legal case or issue of their   choosing. JANE BURBANK is Collegiate Professor and Professor of   History and Russian and Slavic Studies. After an early focus on Russian   intellectuals' interpretations of the Revolution of 1917, the topic of   her monograph Intelligentsia and Revolution: Russian Views of   Bolshevism, 1917-1922 , she turned to Russian law and to how ordinary   people used it. Her book Russian Peasants Go to Court: Legal Culture in   the Countryside, 1905-1917 reveals that rural people, contrary to   received opinion, were avid litigators. For a glimpse at this study, see   her NYU website: http://www.nyu.edu/projects/burbank/. She is the   co-editor of Russian Empire: Space, People, Power, 1730-1930 , a   collective and international study of Russian empire. Her most recent   book, written with Frederick Cooper, is Empires in World History: Power   and the Politics of Difference . Hybrid Forms: Experiments in the Contemporary Novel FRSEM-UA 551 Instructor: Gabriel Heller  syllabus Monday, 2:00-4:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Wednesday, 3:30-4:30 p.m. This   course examines an emerging movement in contemporary literature that is   preoccupied with blurring the boundaries between fiction and   non-fiction. We read primarily texts published in the last few years,   originally in English as well as in translation, which, despite their   status as fiction, break into the territory of the memoir and the essay,   blending imagination, autobiography, and essayistic reflection in   challenging and innovative ways. These novels, diverse in both form and   content, share what the writer David Shields has called a \"reality   hunger\"; they seek to confront experience and consciousness more   directly than the conventional forms of the novel allow. As we   investigate this new mode of writing, we inquire deeply into the   relationship between truth and fiction. What kinds of truth do novels   make available to us? How does the novel have to change in order to   encompass our changing ideas of reality? What strategies do contemporary   writers use to get as close as possible to the real grain of   experience? GABRIEL HELLER is a Senior Lecturer in the   Expository Writing Program. His writing has appeared most recently in    Agni Online , Fence , and The Gettysburg Review . He is the recipient of   the 14th Annual Inkwell Short Story Award, as well as a Distinguished   Story Citation in Best American Mystery Stories 2013 . He has an MFA in   Fiction Writing from NYU and is currently at work on a novel.  Globalization and the Modern Novel in English FRSEM-UA 552 Instructor: Jeannie Im   syllabus Thursday, 12:30-3:00 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Tuesday, 12:30-1:30 p.m. Note: conflicts with Physics I (Tuesday and Thursday 12:30-1:45 p.m.) Over the last century, some of the most significant literature in English has been produced in former British colonies. This course uses key novels in English to explore crucial facets of contemporary globalization. Our novels provide a virtual literary map, moving from the Latin America of Joseph Conrad's Nostromo to the post-independence Nigeria of Ben Okri's and Wole Soyinka's stories; post-apartheid South Africa of Nadine Gordimer's The Pickup ; and South Asia of Amitav Ghosh's The Glass Palace . Our readings are informed by scholarship on issues such as migration and population displacement; urbanization and environmentalism; economic development and political transition; and cosmopolitanism and citizenship. While literature provides the foundation for the course, students are encouraged to develop final research papers relating to their academic interests, such as economics, political science, international relations, or environmental studies. JEANNIE IM is a Language Lecturer in the Expository Writing Program. Her research interests include British modernism, postcolonial fiction, globalization, and critical theory. Her work has appeared in Modern Fiction Studies , and she has given numerous conference papers on Virginia Woolf, Samuel Beckett, and Mulk Raj Anand, among others. She is currently at work on a book on supraterritoriality in 20th-century literature, looking at writers from Evelyn Waugh to Chinua Achebe. She has taught Advanced College Essay (Steinhardt) and consulted with Writing in the Disciplines in psychology and physics. She received her PhD in English and Comparative Literature from Columbia University. Sexuality and Style in Queer Literature FRSEM-UA 553 Instructor: Abigail Joseph Tues, 3:30-6:00 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Thursday, 3:30-4:30 p.m. We explore the development of gay and lesbian literary styles from around 1890 to 2010\u2014a century of major social and aesthetic shifts. From the secrecy and persecution of Oscar Wilde\u2019s fin-de-si\u00e8cle moment to the protest and celebration of our own more recent one, how have novelists and poets represented identities and desires which fall outside of the norm? What kinds of feelings and relationships, encompassing but moving beyond sex itself, circulate through queer narratives? What modes of aesthetic response and expression characterize what we might call \u201cqueer style\u201d? We will be especially interested not only in how these writers represent the pleasures and struggles of their contemporary social and psychological worlds, but also in how they imagine a set of richly textured relations to historical worlds, both recent and distant. Our authors will likely include Oscar Wilde, Henry James, Virginia Woolf, Christopher Isherwood, James Baldwin, Frank O\u2019Hara, John Rechy, Jeanette Winterson, David Wojnarowicz, and Alison Bechdel. We will supplement our literary texts with forays into the major ideas of queer theory.  ABIGAIL JOSEPH is a Lecturer in the Expository Writing Program. She holds a Ph.D. in English from Columbia University and is at work on a book about the relationship between gay male identity and material culture in nineteenth-century England. Her writing on fashion history appears in Public Books , Victorian Studies , and the edited collection Crossings in Text and Textile .  Artificial Intelligence in Film FRSEM-UA 554 Instructor: Megan Shea   syllabus Wednesday, 11:00 a.m.-1:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Friday, 11:00 a.m.-noon Note: conflicts with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00   a.m.-1:45 p.m.) and with Advanced Chemistry I recitation (Friday, 11:00   a.m.-12:15 p.m.). With IBM's development of Watson, the supercomputer that can beat most people at Jeopardy , we grow ever closer to living in a world where the deep learning capabilities of actual artificial intelligence match those that have been imagined by filmmakers for the past 100 years. This seminar delves into that filmic world wherein androids, cyborgs, and omniscient computers contribute to humankind's charged relationship with the mysterious other. With such movies as Metropolis , Blade Runner , and 2001: A Space Odyssey to document various understandings of this relationship, we also read historical and theoretical literature that explores the passion and violence surrounds these creatures. Students engage not only with the topic of artificial intelligence in film but also with the world of cinema by writing reviews, a short screenplay, and a final research paper. MEGAN SHEA is a Language Lecturer in NYU's Expository Writing Program. She received her PhD in Theater Arts from Cornell University, where she studied women's performance in ancient Greece and the contemporary West. While teaching at Cornell, she received the Gertrude Spencer Student Portfolio Award, and she has received several Excellence in Teaching awards while at NYU. Professor Shea has published articles in The Journal for Dramatic Theory and Criticism and TheatreForum . She recently premiered her translation of Euripides's Cyclops at Dixon Place.  The Self in/as Space FRSEM-UA 555 Instructor: Leeore Schnairsohn Tuesday 3:30-6:00 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Thursday, 3:30-4:30 p.m. This course examines the relational and spatial underpinnings of our sense of our \"self.\" In order to know ourselves and to act, we must imagine ourselves in space, physical and non-physical, constantly revising the line between \"inside\" and \"outside.\" This course takes us to the limits of our ability to conceive space, looking at literature, film, philosophy, and music that explore the manifold ways we invent, act in and upon, and make use of space to become, know and judge ourselves. Our wide-ranging texts situate us in the cosmos, both medieval and modern (Dante's Divine Comedy and Tarkovsky's Solaris ), the built environment (for example, the elegant Paris of Benjamin's Arcades Project ), and the depths of the unconscious (in the work of Freud and Lacan). LEEORE SCHNAIRSOHN holds a PhD in Comparative Literature from Princeton and is currently a Language Lecturer in the Expository Writing Program at NYU. His translations of the Russian poet Osip Mandelstam have appeared in Portals and Inventory ; he has also published review articles in the Slavic and East European Journal and in the Canadian-American Slavic Studies . He is at work on a vampire novel and on a non-vampire novel.  Spent Powers: The Culture of Credit and Subjectivities of Indebtedness FRSEM-UA 556 Instructor: Gerard O'Donoghue   syllabus Wednesday, 2:00-4:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Monday, 3:30-4:30 p.m. This class asks students to think about the specific ways in which personhood in the United States is defined by one's relationship to capital. How is an individual's political and economic power shaped by access to credit? How does indebtedness alter our sense of selfhood and obligation? We pose these complex questions against the backdrop of the central contradiction in in in American history: that a state whose political and economic foundation integrated chattel slavery also-in contract law-espoused the principle that citizens ought not have the power to contract themselves into peonage, or self-enslavement. We try to understand how credit and debt have been shaped by the legacy of slavery and how they intersect with race and class. As indebtedness becomes the norm, how are the basic assumptions of American democracy challenged? A core of literary texts is supplemented by readings from philosophy and social science. GERARD O'DONOGHUE is a Language Lecturer in NYU'S Expository Writing Program. His interests lie in the fields of 20th- and 21st-century American literature and Irish modernism. He earned his MS and PhD at the University of Oxford for his dissertation The Orphan's Kaddish , and has published in Notes and Queries and Philip Roth Studies . Prior to his current appointment he was a Lecturer in English Literature in the Claremont Consortium and an AHRC Kluge Fellow at the Library of Congress.  Legal Fictions: Storytelling &amp; the Law FRSEM-UA 557 Instructor: Lorraine Doran   syllabus Monday, 2:00-4:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Wednesday, 3:30-4:30 p.m. We tell ourselves stories about the law every day - in literature and film, journalistic accounts and internet debates. In this course, we consider the judgments and values beneath those stories, and what relationship they bear to the way stories are told and evaluated by lawyers and judges. We think about how fictional versions of legal ideals transcend the boundaries of the law itself, as well as how the law has evolved in its understanding of our rights and responsibilities. The narratives we examine involve, among other things, civil rights, criminal justice, and civil disobedience. Though these are issues we can (and should) become passionate about, we go beyond the opposing positions, and try to discern what our legal narratives tell us about ourselves and the times we live in. In other words: what do the ways in which we translate legal principles in literature and film, and debate them in the public sphere, tell us about the human condition? With the authors of these texts, we work toward our own definitions of what is just. LORRAINE DORAN is a Senior Language Lecturer in the Expository Writing Program. She holds a JD from NYU School of Law and an MFA in poetry from the NYU Creative Writing Program. As a Visiting Professor of Law at Seton Hall University, she taught a seminar on civil litigation, and supervised students in the Seton Hall Center for Social Justice. Her collection of poems, Phrasebook for the Pleiades , was published in 2014, and her recent poems and essays can be found in FIELD , Gulf Coast , American Poetry Journal , and Barn Owl Review . The Rise of the Visual FRSEM-UA 559 Instructor: Trevor Laurence Jockims  syllabus Tuesday, 9:30 a.m.-noon Required cohort meeting: Thursday, 11:00 a.m.-noon Though   Chinese artists were using the camera obscura\u2014or pinhole camera\u2014as   early as 400 BCE, photography did not emerge until the second half of   the 19th century. This course traces out the peculiar, fascinating,   delayed emergence of photography, and the subsequent explosion of film   and digital media, in an attempt to illuminate what, exactly, the desire   to capture images is, why it emerged when it did, and what it means to   our culture now \u2014 more replete in images than any moment previous. In   order to grasp the meanings of our visual culture, we explore the   literary culture that has challenged, championed, and in many cases   moved forward and made sense of visuality, reading widely in   literature\u2014from Homeric poetry to graphic novels\u2014theory, and philosophy.   TREVOR LAURENCE JOCKIMS teaches in the Expository Writing   Program, where he has won departmental teaching awards every semester.   His scholarly work centers on 20th-century American poetry and its   relationship to visual arts and culture. He has published articles and   book chapters on ekphrastic poetry, photography, the documentary film   essay, pastoral lyric, and representations of war in Eastern European   cinema. His essays and film reviews have appeared in many prominent   publications, including The Times Literary Supplement and the New York   Times ; his fiction has appeared in Descant , Mr. Beller's Neighborhood ,    The Journal of Experimental Fiction , and elsewhere. He received his PhD   in Comparative Literature from The Graduate Center of The City   University of New York. Writers, Notes, and Notebooks FRSEM-UA 562 Instructor: Elaine Freedgood  syllabus Tuesday 3:30-6:00 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Thursday, 3:30-4:30 p.m. How   do novelists and poets prepare to write? What is in notes and notebooks   that is not in novels and poems? We begin the term with the   idiosyncratic Preparation of the Novel, by the literary and cultural   critic Roland Barthes, who never wrote a novel, but prepared notes and   notation toward one. We then turn to the novels, poems and notebooks of   other writers, including but not limited to George Eliot, Lorraine   Hansberry, W.H. Auden, and John Ashberry. For some, we have the   opportunity to use collections in archives throughout New York (NYU's   Fales Library, the New York Public Library at 42nd Street, and the   Schomburg Library in Harlem). Students keep two notebooks to present to   the seminar weekly: one in which they annotate a passage of text (with   writing, drawing, collage and other media), and another in which they   record notes and notations toward poems and novels that they may or may   not write. They also write two papers and do one collaborative   presentation. This is a demanding seminar, for students interested in   archival research, very serious reading, and scholarly and creative   writing. ELAINE FREEDGOOD is Professor of English. She is the   author of Victorian Writing about Risk: Imagining a Safe England in a   Dangerous World and The Ideas in Things: Fugitive Meaning in the   Victorian Novel , and the editor of Factory Production in Victorian   Britain . She is currently working on a book about fictionality,   reference and metalepsis.  Colonizing Creatures: Humans and Other Animals, Past and Present FRSEM-UA 563 Instructor: Zeb Tortorici   syllabus Tuesday, 2:00-4:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Friday, 12:30-1:30 p.m. Note:   conflicts with Physics I (Tuesday and Thursday 12:30-1:45 p.m.),   General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m.-1:45 p.m.) and with   Advanced Chemistry I recitation (Friday, 11:00 a.m.-12:15 p.m.). This   course examines the fraught relations between humans and other animals   in the past and in the present, both locally and globally. Our readings   focus on the ways in which the \"human\" and the \"animal\" have been   defined over time and place, with significant ramifications for all   involved. Topics include medieval and early modern monstrosities;   religious rites; the commodification of animal parts; bestiality and   other violent intimacies; animal domestication and breeding; zoos and   circuses; animal experimentation; debates surrounding \"animal rights\";   museums and taxidermy; pests, rodents, and insects; the rise of animal   protection and anti-cruelty laws; and animal studies as an academic   discipline. In our attempt to engage \"real\" animals\u2014living, sentient   beings\u2014and their archived remnants, we take excursions to the Bronx Zoo,   the American Museum of Natural History, and (if possible) a New   York-based taxidermy studio. ZEB TORTORICI is Assistant   Professor in the Department of Spanish and Portuguese Languages and   Literatures at NYU. He received his PhD in History from UCLA. He has   published articles in Ethnohistory , Journal of the History of Sexuality ,   History Compass , e-misf\u00e9rica , and GLQ and chapters in Death and Dying   in Colonial Spanish America , The Human Tradition in Colonial Latin   America , Queer Youth Cultures , and Queer Sex Work . He also recently   co-edited Centering Animals in Latin American History and a special   issue of Radical History Review . He is currently completing a book   manuscript on the \"sins against nature\" ( pecados contra natura ) of   sodomy, bestiality, and autoeroticism in New Spain, from 1530 to 1821.  Sonic Art: Sound, Everyday Life, and Aesthetics FRSEM-UA 570 Instructor: Elizabeth Hoffman  syllabus Wednesday, 3:30-6:00 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Friday, 12:30-1:30 p.m. Note: conflicts with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m.-1:45 p.m.) Is   our culture increasingly becoming sound- and hearing-oriented and less   attuned to the visual? How would we assess this? And if the answer is   \"yes,\" what are some implications for the creation and appreciation of   music? At the turn of the 20th century, the Italian Futurists responded   to industrialization by valorizing the sounds of factories, machines,   and even war. Can we see a similar relationship in the response of   contemporary composers to internet culture? How are our artificial   musical worlds forging a continuum with sonic aestheticizations of our   everyday environment? Are the domains of musical and sonic aesthetics   intertwined or not; and what are some useful current working   definitions, for sonic art, of the term \"aesthetics\" in the first place?   ELIZABETH HOFFMAN is Professor of Music. She is an   internationally recognized composer of acoustic and computer music, both   fixed media and live processing, and has also published on issues of   representation; narrative; and space and timbre as sonic signifiers in   the Computer Music Journal , Organized Sound , and Perspectives of New   Music . She is a recipient of the Golden Dozen Teaching Award.  Globalism and the International Art Film FRSEM-UA 571 Instructor: Doug Dibbern  syllabus Tuesday, 2:00-4:30 p.m. Required recitation: Monday, 6:00-9:00 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Friday, 12:30-1:30 p.m. Note: conflicts with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m.-1:45 p.m.) This   class studies the contemporary international art film in relation to   debates about nationalism and globalization. These films, screened   mostly at festivals and at small cinemas, tend to be slow and difficult,   telling ugly, painful, and mysterious stories in an unconventional   style as an intentional rejoinder to Hollywood. We spend a lot of our   time analyzing the works of directors such as Bela Tarr, Michal Haneke,   Asghar Farhadi, and Jia Zhang-ke. We also study the history, structure,   and economics of the international film festival circuit, including the   strategies that nations and supranational bodies have embraced to   compete with the major film industries of the world; cultural policy in   the European Union; theories of nationalism and globalization; ideas of   cultural imperialism; and, of course, issues of aesthetics, especially   as they concern the development of a global style. Along the way, we   touch on contemporary politics in a few select countries, with an   emphasis on France, Romania, Iran, and China (including the mainland,   Hong Kong, and Taiwan). Students are required to attend one mandatory   film screening every week in addition to the 2 1/2-hour class. DOUG   DIBBERN earned his PhD in the Cinema Studies Department at NYU and   currently teaches in the Expository Writing Program. He writes film   criticism for The Daily Notebook and has recently published more   academic essays on the directors Fritz Lang and Howard Hawks. His first   book, Hollywood Riots: Violent Crowds and Progressive Politics in   American Film , examines leftist filmmakers working on the fringes of the   Hollywood film industry during the peak years of the Red Scare.  Monotheism and Empire: From Constantine the Great to Genghis Khan FRSEM-UA 574 Instructor: Robert Hoyland  Tuesday, 3:30-6:00 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Thursday, 3:30-4:30 p.m. Though   Jesus said that \"My kingdom is not of this world,\" from the reign of   Constantine the Great (306-37) onwards, Christian emperors portrayed   themselves as protectors and promoters of a very earthly Christian   realm. This had profound consequences: once emperors shared the same   faith as their subjects, it was inevitable that they would seek to shape   and control it, thus setting the stage for a struggle between religion   and politics that has lasted into our own time. We cover the period   between Constantine's reign and that of the Mongol emperor Genghis Khan   and his successors in the thirteenth century, who faced the difficult   decision of whether to give up their ancestral cult and adopt an alien   monotheist creed so as to become rulers in Constantine's mold. In   between these turning points, Muslim rulers (caliphs) and European   monarchs tried and eventually failed in their attempt to control   religion in their realms. We explore the links between monotheism and   empire in varied religious traditions: Christian, Muslim, Jewish, and   Zoroastrian. ROBERT HOYLAND is Professor of Late Antique and   Early Islamic Middle Eastern History at the Institute for the Study of   the Ancient World at NYU. Prior to coming to ISAW, he was Professor of   Islamic History at the University of Oxford, where he earned his DPhil   in 1994. His books include Seeing Islam as Others Saw It: A Survey and   Analysis of the Christian, Jewish, and Zoroastrian Writings on Islam ;   Arabia and the Arabs from the Bronze Age to the Coming of Islam ; and    Theophilus of Edessa's Chronicle and the Circulation of Historical   Knowledge in Late Antiquity and Early Islam . He is involved in the   Oxford excavation of Androna/al-Andarin in Syria. He was both a   Fulbright and Erasmus Scholar, at Princeton and Groningen, respectively.    The Art of Magic FRSEM-UA 575 Instructor: Christopher Stahl   syllabus Thursday, 11:00 a.m.-1:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Tuesday, 11:00 a.m.-noon Note: conflicts with Physics I (Tuesday and Thursday 12:30-1:45 p.m.) Jean   Eugene Robert-Houdin, the universally recognized father of modern stage   magic, once famously remarked that \"a magician is an actor playing the   part of a magician,\" suggesting that there is some sort of unique   cultural role that the magician might have to play. The topic of this   seminar is magic\u2014not as an anthropological or supernatural phenomenon,   but as an artistic stage practice with its own aesthetic history and   values. How do certain tricks and illusions stage the cultural and   philosophical issues of the day? Beginning with texts like Reginald   Scott's The Discoverie of Witchcraft (used by Shakespeare as a source   for many plays), students explore critical theories about wonder and   enchantment as well as read sources that range from books of magic   tricks to the memoirs of noted stage conjurors. We also examine stage   magic's relation to other art forms, including theatre, photography,   cinema, sculpture, and video and performance art. CHRISTOPHER   STAHL is a Senior Language Lecturer in the Expository Writing Program at   New York University, where he was recently recognized for a decade of   teaching service. He has been a longtime Faculty Affiliate with NYU's   Residential College, currently leading a student community interested in   exploring the link between the history of urban development in NYC and   social/cultural issues. He has published several essays on vaudeville   magic, and his work on turn-of-the-century Chinese conjuring was   published in the critical anthology Performing Magic on the Western   Stage . His writing has also appeared in The Village Voice , Theatre   Journal , and Women &amp; Performance , and in the anthology Bend Don't   Shatter: Poets on the Beginning of Desire . The Literature of Capitalism FRSEM-UA 576 Instructor: Thomas Easton  syllabus Thursday, 11:00 a.m.-1:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Friday, 12:30-1:30 p.m. Note: conflicts with Physics I (Tuesday and Thursday 12:30-1:45 p.m.) and with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m.-1:45 p.m.) This course explores how some of the most enduring themes in literature, such as greed, ambition, failure, innovation, prosperity, and opportunity, are reflected in literature about capitalism. Readings are likely to include works by eighteenth-century English essayist Samuel Johnson; children\u2019s book author Horatio Alger and novelist Mark Twain; and contemporary Chinese memoirist Aisling Juanjuan Shen. The nature of property rights, subtle distinctions between success and crime, and the relative value of diligence and luck are other themes we consider. Our discussions about characters and stories are informed by work in economics, ranging from Adam Smith\u2019s writings on productivity and ethics to Thomas Piketty\u2019s writings on income inequality. Weekly essays assigned. THOMAS EASTON is American finance editor at the Economist, where he previously worked as New York and Hong Kong bureau chief. Earlier in his career, he was the bureau chief for The Baltimore Sun in New York and Tokyo and a senior editor at Forbes.

Telling Their Own Stories: The Irish in New York City   FRSEM-UA 540   Instructor: Linda Dowling Almeida   Tuesday, 2:00-4:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note: conflicts with Principles of Biology RCT (Tuesday, 2:00 p.m.-4:45 p.m.) and Intro Experimental Physics I Lab (Tuesday, 2:00 p.m.-5:00 p.m.).   This interdisciplinary seminar focuses on oral history as a resource for understanding the 20th century history of the Irish in America, particularly in New York. Students will explore the discipline as it has progressed over the last twenty years, developing their own research, writing, and interviewing skills along the way and enjoying access to the 300+ interviews in Glucksman Ireland House's Oral History holdings in the Archives of Irish America. The course will demonstrate how oral history gives life to ethnic communities like those of the Irish longshoremen who worked Chelsea Piers in the West Village before it was an entertainment destination, personalizes dramatic events like 9/11, or provides insight into to why John Patrick Shanley wrote Doubt . In addition to traditional texts, we will listen to and conduct interviews, read Irish-American fiction, walk the streets of the communities we study, and screen films and documentaries exploring the lives of Irish Americans. This course will introduce students not only to oral history but to the history of the Irish in America.   LINDA DOWLING ALMEIDA, Adjunct Assistant Professor of Irish Studies at NYU\u2019s Glucksman Ireland House, teaches classes in the history and literature of Irish America. Her book Irish Immigrants in New York City, 1945-1995 compares the experience of the Irish who arrived in the 1950s with that of their counterparts thirty and forty years later. Professor Almeida has published chapters in The Irish World Wide , Ireland in the 1950s , and Making the Irish American , and has delivered papers on pedagogical approaches to oral history to both the Oral History Association and the International Oral History Association. Her latest project involves the production of podcasts on a variety of themes and issues drawn from the archives.   Propaganda Portraits: Royal Imagery in the Age of Absolutism   FRSEM-UA 488   Instructor: William Ambler   Wednesday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note: conflicts with Principles of Biology RCT  ( Wednesday, 2:00 p.m.- 4:45  p . m . ) and Physics I RCT ( Wednesda y, 2:00 p.m.-3:15p.m.).    This course studies the relationship between art and politics in European baroque state portraiture. In the 17th century, with few means to reach a broad populace, depictions of the king played a central part in convincing the people of a monarch\u2019s legitimate authority. The most talented artists of the age glorified their kings in ways that gave visual form to political theories that justified increasingly centralized royal rule. We set the portraits in the context of debates that preoccupied the European courts of the time: the Reformation; the dynastic ambitions of European royal houses; and political theories of legitimate government. We also consider the position of artists at a royal court and preexisting traditions of royal imagery.

Global Citizenship: Theory and Practice   FRSEM-UA 484   Instructor: Ulrich Baer   Wednesday, 2:00-4:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note: conflicts with Principles of Biology RCT (Wednesday, 2:00 p.m.-4:45 p.m.) and Physics I RCT (Wednesday, 2:00 p.m.-3:15p.m.).   This seminar explores the notion and practice of global citizenship\u2014the capacity and willingness to think across and beyond actual and imagined boundaries, and to develop skills that can solve problems and explore opportunities in unfamiliar contexts. The course examines globalization as a historical, economic, and cultural phenomenon. Topics include local resistance to global homogeneity; the notion of universal humanism; human rights; the role of language in global contexts; the idea of citizenship; the specificity of culture and arts; the idea of film or photography as universal languages; and an exploration of New York City as an international city that has turned its diversity into strength. The seminar brings in guest speakers who identify as global citizens, and asks students to consider how their own actions\u2014ranging from activism to business leadership\u2014may have an impact on those outside their immediate world.

Game Theory and the Humanities   FRSEM-UA 506   Instructor: Steven J. Brams   Wednesday, 4:55\u20137:25 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note: conflicts with Principles of Biology RCT (Wednesday, 5:00 p.m.-7:45 p.m.) and Physics I RCT (Wednesday, 5:00 p.m.-6:15p.m.).   Game theory is a mathematical theory of strategy that has been applied to the analysis of conflict and cooperation in such fields as economics, political science, and biology. In this seminar, we discuss more unusual applications\u2014to history, literature, philosophy, the Bible, theology, and law. We discuss Abraham\u2019s decision to offer his son Isaac for sacrifice; the choices made by accused witches and their persecutors in medieval witch trials; Lady Macbeth's incitement of her husband to murder King Duncan in Shakespeare\u2019s play; several strategic games played by presidents and their antagonists in domestic crises (e.g., the Civil War) and international crises (e.g., the Cuban missile crisis), and coping mechanisms used by characters in catch-22 games (including those in Joseph Heller's novel Catch-22 ).   Prerequisite: No mathematical background beyond high school mathematics is assumed, but a willingness to learn and apply sophisticated reasoning to analyze the interactions of players in games is essential. STEVEN J. BRAMS is Professor of Politics at NYU. He is the author of several books\u2014most recently, Mathematics and Democracy and Game Theory and the Humanities \u2014that apply game theory and social choice theory to voting and elections, bargaining and fairness, international relations, and the Bible, theology and literature.

How We See   FRSEM-UA 497   Instructor: Marisa Carrasco   Thursday, 9:30 a.m.\u201312:00 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note: conflicts with Principles of Biology RCT (Thursday, 9:30 a.m.-12:15 p.m. ).   Do we see the world the way we do because we are the way we are or because the world is the way it is? This course looks at what we know about vision from multiple scientific perspectives: perceptual psychology tells us about the process of seeing and provides important insights into the workings of visual mechanisms; neuropsychology shows us what happens to perception when these mechanisms malfunction; neuroscience tells us about processes at the level of cells and neural systems. At the same time, we discuss modes and techniques of scientific inquiry from these different perspectives. How do vision scientists learn? What kinds of experiments do they conduct? How has the development of new neuroimaging techniques (fMRI, for example) shaped the field?   MARISA CARRASCO is Collegiate Professor and Professor of Psychology and Neural Science, as well as a former Chairperson of the Department of Psychology. Born and raised in Mexico City, she received her licentiate in psychology from the National University of Mexico and her PhD in psychology (cognition and perception) from Princeton University.

Latin America at the Start of the 21st Century: Coming of Age or Continuing Chaos?   FRSEM-UA 306   Instructor: Jorge G. Casta\u00f1eda   Monday, 9:30 a.m.\u201312:00 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note: conflicts with Principles of Biology I Lecture ( Monday, 9:3 0 a.m.\u20131 0:45 a .m.) and Intro Experimental Physics I Lecture ( Monday , 11:00 a.m.\u201312:15 p.m.).   This seminar focuses on Latin America\u2019s longstanding problems and possible solutions to them. It takes up such topics as the absence of orderly, peaceful, and steady democratic governance following independence from colonial rule, and the consolidation of representative democracy today; the slowdown of economic growth in the last 20 years and prospects for a new economic takeoff; the phenomenon of widespread violence, and growing respect for human rights; and how the traditional weakness of civil society is being overcome. For each topic, there are readings dealing with its political, economic, and cultural dimensions in both past and present. JORGE D. CASTA\u00d1EDA is Global Distinguished Professor of Politics and Latin American and Caribbean Studies. Professor at the National Autonomous University of Mexico since 1979, he has also been a visiting professor at the University of California at Berkeley, Princeton, and Dartmouth.

Literature and Machines   FRSEM-UA 572   Instructor: Nicola Cipani   Thursday, 12:30 p.m.\u20133:00 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note: conflicts with Principles of Biology RCT (Thursday, 12:30 p.m.-4:45 p.m.), Physics I Lecture ( Thursday, 12:30 p.m.-1:45 p.m.), Physics I RCT (Thursday, 2:00 p.m.-3:15 p.m. ), and Advanced General Chem I Lab (Thursday, 2:30 p.m.-6:45 p.m.).    Machine metaphors play an important role in modern literature, conveying beliefs, anxieties, shifts, and reflections on key topics, including the nature of consciousness and creativity; the dynamics of desire and gratification; gender roles; the organization of society; the meaning of \u201cnature\u201d; and the function of technology. This course explores different manifestations of the machine theme, broadly clustered around the following categories: imaginary machines constituting the centerpiece of narrative plots; machine aesthetic as modernist ideal; and mechanization of the inventive process (text-generating machines). Students read and discuss a selection of works from different cultural contexts, primarily from the late 19 th and 20 th century (e.g., Belle \u00c9poque, Futurist, and postwar), representing a wide spectrum of attitudes toward the machine, from dreamy immersion in virtual realities to enlightened machine-assisted awakening, from the fear of dehumanization to the desire for man-machine fusion. NICOLA CIPANI is Assistant Clinical Professor at the Department of Italian Studies and has been working at NYU for ten years. His interests include reception of antiquity in medieval and early modern culture, Renaissance philosophy, the intersection of verbal/visual forms (such as the art of memory, emblem books, and representations of dreams), and 20 th -century experimental literature. At the Italian Department he has served in the capacity of Director of Language Programs (since 2005), Director of Summer Programs (2011-12), and Director of Undergraduate Studies (2011, 2013).   In Search of Lost Time   FRSEM-UA 503   Instructor: Marcelle Clements   Thursday, 2:00\u20134:45 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note: conflicts with Principles of Biology RCT (Thursday, 2:00 p.m.-4:45 p.m.), Physics I RCT (Thursday, 2:00 p.m.-3:15 p.m.), and Advanced General Chem I Lab (Thursday, 2:30 p.m.-6:45 p.m.).   We read Marcel Proust (350 pages per week, in translation) as he should be read: hedonistically\u2014with respect and admiration but also with delectation. At more than 4,000 pages, In Search of Lost Time is one of modern literature\u2019s most challenging and pleasurable reads, still unparalleled in how it combines finesse and wit with raw emotion, self-examination with social history, and psychological acuity with a portrait of the French beau monde at the outset of modernity. Though Proust (1871\u20131922) is often cited as France\u2019s greatest novelist, many readers never move past the first fifty pages of his novel, reading the same gorgeous sentences again and again. However, as its architecture cannot be appreciated until it has been read once in its entirety, we move at a brisk pace through all six volumes; when we read the final volume, we can begin to understand the extraordinarily intimate relationship Proust has created with his reader. In-class creative writing exercises are designed to help with the reading and to expand an expressive, personal response.   MARCELLE CLEMENTS is Collegiate Professor and Fellow of the New York Institute for the Humanities at NYU. She is the author of a collection of essays, The Dog Is Us and Other Observations , a book of nonfiction, The Improvised Woman , and two novels, Rock Me and, most recently, Midsummer . Her prizewinning articles and essays on the arts, culture, and politics have appeared in many national publications.   Political Theater   FRSEM-UA 476   Instructor: Eric Dickson   Monday, 2:00-4:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note: conflicts with Intro Experimental Physics I Lab (Monday, 12:30 p.m.-3:30 p.m.).      This interdisciplinary seminar offers a survey of political theater, and of the use of theatrical elements in practical politics, from the ancient Greeks to the present. How have dramatic depictions of politics changed over time? In what ways have political plays been used to advance political agendas, both by the powerful and by dissidents and protest movements? To what extent can we understand political speeches and political campaigns as essentially theatrical productions? In a typical week, students will read one full-length play, accompanied by appropriate readings from political science or social psychology. Through these readings, writing assignments, and class discussion, we address the development of different dramatic techniques and forms throughout the history of theater; the co-evolving relationship between politically-themed spectacles and changing ideas about citizenship and political legitimacy; and the political psychology of speeches and campaign techniques. ERIC S. DICKSON is Associate Professor of Politics and a faculty affiliate in the Department of Psychology. His research interests include political communication, election campaigning, political leadership, and identities in politics. His work, which uses both game theory and social-scientific experiments, focuses on the interface between political strategy and political psychology. He also has an extensive background in theater.   Political Cinema and Representation of the \u201cOther\u201d   FRSEM-UA 463   Instructor: Shimon Dotan   Friday, 9:30 a.m.\u201312:00 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note: conflicts with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m.\u2013 12:15 p.m.) and with Advanced Ch emistry I recitation (Friday, 9:30 a.m.\u201310:45 a .m.).   In contemporary war \u201cthe other\u201d is viewed not only as an enemy to be fought, but often as one to be eliminated. How do filmmakers fight against (or alternately, reinforce) such deadly representations? In exploring various cinematic and thematic elements we will primarily focus on films from one of the world\u2019s most conflict-ridden regions\u2014the Middle East. We will also explore films from Russia, Germany, France and the US. Through readings and film screenings, we will investigate how \u201cthe other\u201d is constructed politically, aesthetically and ethically. This class is designed for anyone interested in filmmaking and film criticism, contemporary politics and history, cinema of conflict and violence, and the ethical questions associated with them. SHIMON DOTAN, a Fellow of the New York Institute of the Humanities at NYU, is an award-winning filmmaker with thirteen feature films to his credit. His films have received the Silver Bear Award at the Berlin Film Festival ( The Smile of the Lamb ), numerous Israeli Academy Awards, including Best Film and Best Director ( Repeat Dive ; The Smile of the Lamb ), and Best Film at the Newport Beach Film Festival ( You Can Thank Me Later ). His film Hot House won the Special Jury Prize at Sundance in 2007. He has taught filmmaking and film studies at Tel Aviv University in Israel and at Concordia University in Montreal and is a member of the Directors and Writers Guilds of America (DGA, WGA).   The Literature of Capitalism   FRSEM-UA 576   Instructor: Thomas Easton   Thursday, 11:00 a.m.\u20141:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note: conflicts with Principles of Biology RCT (Thursday, 11:00 a.m.-1:45 p.m.) and Physics I Lecture (Thursday, 12:30 p.m.-1:45 p.m.).   This course explores how some of the most enduring themes in literature, such as greed, ambition, failure, innovation, prosperity, and opportunity, are reflected in literature about capitalism. Readings are likely to include works by eighteenth-century English essayist Samuel Johnson; children\u2019s book author Horatio Alger and novelist Mark Twain; and contemporary Chinese memoirist Aisling Juanjuan Shen. The nature of property rights, subtle distinctions between success and crime, and the relative value of diligence and luck are other themes we consider. Our discussions about characters and stories are informed by work in economics, ranging from Adam Smith\u2019s writings on productivity and ethics to Thomas Piketty\u2019s writings on income inequality. Weekly essays assigned.   THOMAS EASTON is American finance editor at the Economist , where he previously worked as New York and Hong Kong bureau chief. Earlier in his career, he was the bureau chief for The Baltimore Sun in New York and Tokyo and a senior editor at Forbes . He has taught business reporting and journalism at Columbia\u2019s Graduate School of Journalism. At the Economist , his purview also includes legal coverage. Mr. Easton holds an AB in literature from Brown, an MBA from Columbia Business School, and an MSL from Yale Law School.   Gender, Sexuality and the Law   FRSEM-UA 480   Instructor: Shelley Fischel   Wednesday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note: conflicts with Principles of Biology RCT (Wednesday, 2:00 p.m.-4:45 p.m.), and Physics I RCT (Wednesday, 2:00 p.m.-3:15 p.m).   What impact has law had on gender and sexuality inequalities? What impact could or should law have? This course explores gender and sexuality discrimination in American jurisprudence as it has developed under the Constitution as well as its consequences in the spheres of work, politics, and social life. We address such matters as marriage and divorce law, the Civil Rights Act and Title IX, and the unique, perhaps troubling ways that criminal law treats crimes associated with sexuality, rape, domestic abuse, and sexual orientation. We also address the intersection of these matters with issues of gender identity and sexual orientation. This course offers a history of US sex law and analyzes contemporary doctrinal, judicial, and legislative developments.   SHELLEY D. FISCHEL served as Executive Vice President at Home Box Office, Inc., where she was responsible for Human Resources, Facilities and Real Estate, and labor law matters until her retirement in December 2009. She oversaw all sexual discrimination claims in the company. She received her JD from Columbia University and her LLM from NYU.   Trials of the Century   FRSEM-UA 434   Instructor: Jack Ford    Monday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note: conflicts with Intro Experimental Physics I Lab (Monday, 12:30 p.m.-3:30 p.m.).   How does a trial become viewed as a \u201ctrial of the century\u201d? What does that designation say about the crime and the personalities involved, about the legal, social, and political implications of the case, and about the nature and extent of the attendant media coverage? Since the trial of Socrates, the public has been intrigued, galvanized, and even entertained by the real drama of real trials, which often act as a prism through which society\u2019s strengths and weaknesses are revealed. This course offers in-depth examinations of select \u201ctrials of the century\u201d in the US, approaching each case from a specific angle, from celebrity (the Lindbergh kidnapping case and the trial of O.J. Simpson) to race (the trials of the Scottsboro Boys), politics (the Chicago Seven), and religion (the Scopes Monkey Trial).   JACK FORD is an Emmy and Peabody Award-winning journalist, author, and nationally recognized trial attorney. Currently a CBS News Legal Analyst, he has had a distinguished career on network and cable television. As a litigator, he successfully handled a number of high-profile cases, such as the Northeast\u2019s first death-penalty trial; one of the nation\u2019s first corporate homicide cases; and the Wall Street insider-trading scandal of the late 1980s. He has also written articles for respected legal publications. The recipient of five honorary degrees in recognition of his professional accomplishments and his extensive public service, he has taught at, in addition to NYU, Yale College and Fordham Law School.   Wiseguys, Spies, and Private Eyes: Heroes and Villains in American Culture, Film, and Literature   FRSEM-UA 449   Instructor: Eddy Friedfeld   Thursday, 4:55\u20137:25 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note: conflicts with Advan ced General Chem I Lab (Thursday , 2:30 p.m.-6 :45 p.m.).   This seminar explores the ways in which specific American archetypes and themes are perceived and articulated\u2014from the rugged Old West individualist, to the persevering underdog who becomes a boxing champ, to the Cold War era superspy. We examine representations of heroes and villains in modern American popular culture and how the great films and novels of three particular genres, the Detective, the Gangster, and the Spy, influenced our understanding of these archetypes. From the early influences of Hamlet and Macbeth to Sherlock Holmes, Raymond Chandler\u2019s Philip Marlowe, Mario Puzo\u2019s (and Francis Ford Coppola\u2019s) The Godfather , James Bond, and Batman, we look at the mythology and evolution of heroes and villains through popular and high culture icons, the genesis of the genres and how they developed over time, and how great directors, actors, and writers influenced audiences worldwide and were themselves influenced by culture and history.   EDDY FRIEDFELD is a film and entertainment journalist and historian, as well as an attorney specializing in corporate restructuring. He is the co-author of Caesar\u2019s Hours with comedy legend Sid Caesar, and is working on a book on the history of comedy in America.

The New Worlds of Work and Care   FRSEM-UA 500   Instructor: Kathleen Gerson   Wednesday, 3:30\u20136:00 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note: conflicts with Principles of Biology I RCT (Wednesday, 3:30 p.m.-6:15 p.m.) and Physics I RCT (Wednesday, 5:00 p.m.-6:00 p.m.).   The early 21st century represents a period of immense social change in both the public world of work and the private world of family care. New technologies have blurred the boundary between home and work. New opportunities and pressures have sent more women into the workplace. The \u201cnew economy\u201d has created jobs with more short-term flexibility, but less long-term security. And new options in intimate relationships have created more diverse and voluntary, but less predictable, family bonds. These intertwined shifts are reshaping the daily lives and life pathways of American women and men. This seminar addresses several questions: What does an overview of changes in work, family, and gender patterns tell us about where we are now and where we are going? What are the major dilemmas created by these changes, and how are people coping with these conflicts? What are the implications for the future? And what can we do to enhance the opportunities and limit the insecurities of these new social arrangements?   KATHLEEN GERSON, Collegiate Professor and Professor of Sociology, is a recognized authority on the connections among gender, work, and family life in postindustrial societies. She has held visiting positions at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences at Stanford University, the Russell Sage Foundation in New York City, and the Center for the Study of Status Passages in the Life Course at Bremen University, Germany and has won numerous prestigious prizes for her scholarly work. Her books include The Unfinished Revolution: Coming of Age in a New Era of Gender, Work, and Family ; The Time Divide: Family, Work, and Gender Inequality (with Jerry A. Jacobs); No Man\u2019s Land: Men\u2019s Changing Commitments to Family and Work ; and Hard Choices: How Women Decide About Work, Career, and Motherhood .   \u201cLaboratories for Democracy\u201d: Making American Cities Better   FRSEM-UA 456   Instructor: Eric Gioia   Thursday, 4:55\u20137:25 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note: conflicts with Advanced General Chem I Lab (Thursday, 2:30 p.m.-6:45 p.m.).   Cities, states, and municipalities serve as what Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis called \u201clittle laboratories for democracy\u201d\u2014where ideas flourish and problems get solved. This course examines the intersection of ideas, politics, and action in cities in the US and around the world, particularly those related to improving the urban environment. We study best practices, evaluate their effectiveness, and determine whether and how successful policies and programs can be replicated. This course asks students to not only think critically about issues of public policy but also to think anew about the role they play in shaping it. Topics for student projects are drawn from current issues and problems facing decision-makers and elected officials in America today.   ERIC GIOIA is an attorney with extensive experience in business, law, and government. He joined J.P. Morgan in January 2010 after serving for eight years on the New York City Council. Prior to serving on City Council, he practiced law at Milbank, Tweed, Hadley &amp; McCloy LLP, and served in the White House under President Bill Clinton. Professor Gioia holds a BA from New York University and a JD from Georgetown University Law Center.   Is Karl Marx Still Relevant?   FRSEM-UA 413   Instructor: Jeff Goodwin   Tuesday, 3:30\u20136:10 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note: conflicts with Principles of Biology RCT (Tuesday, 3:30 p.m.-6:15 p.m.), Physics I RCT (Tuesday, 5:00 p.m.-6:15 p.m.), and Intro Experimental Physics I Lab (Tuesday, 2:00 p.m.-5:00 p.m.).   There was a time not so long ago when a critical engagement with the writings of Karl Marx was considered an obligatory intellectual and political rite of passage. No serious intellectual or political activist could not read Marx\u2014whether one ultimately accepted or rejected Marx\u2019s ideas, in whole or in part. Is this still true? Are Marx\u2019s ideas, or some of them, still relevant? Which of his ideas remain important or valuable for people who wish to understand\u2014and perhaps to change\u2014the contemporary world? Which of Marx\u2019s ideas are problematic or pass\u00e9? To address these questions, this seminar critically examines some of Marx\u2019s most important writings, including The Communist Manifesto , The German Ideology , The Civil War in France , and\u2014above all\u2014 Capital , Marx\u2019s magnum opus. In assessing the contemporary relevance of Marx\u2019s ideas, we also read several efforts by Marx\u2019s followers to understand a range of important phenomena, including the nature of the state, current US politics, and the ongoing economic crisis. JEFF GOODWIN is Professor of Sociology. He has written extensively about social movements, revolutions, and terrorism. His books include The Social Movements Reader ; Contention in Context ; Passionate Politics ; and No Other Way Out: States and Revolutionary Movements, 1945\u20131991 . He is currently writing a book about why states and rebels sometimes employ terrorism as a strategy. He is a winner of the College\u2019s Golden Dozen Award for Teaching Excellence.   What is College For?   FRSEM-UA 474   Instructor: Trace Jordan   Wednesday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note: conflicts with Principles of Biology I RCT (Wednesday, 2:00 p.m.-4:45 p.m.), and Physics I RCT (Wednesday, 2:00 p.m.-3:15 p.m.).   Why did you decide to attend college? To broaden your intellectual horizons and become a more open-minded person? To gain specialized knowledge? To achieve a more successful and financially rewarding career? To make new friends? To become an engaged participant in a democratic society? To satisfy your parents\u2019 plans for your future? Or perhaps some combination of these reasons that you are still figuring out? This seminar examines historical and contemporary discussions about the personal and social goals of higher education and studies issues that have the potential to profoundly transform the college experience in coming years. It also prompts students to be more reflective and purposeful about their own academic choices at NYU.   TRACE JORDAN is Clinical Professor and Associate Director of the College Core Curriculum. His research interests and publications include the role of science education in a liberal arts curriculum, the use of computer simulations for teaching and learning chemistry, and the impact of interest and motivation on educational engagement and achievement. Professor Jordan is a two-time winner of the College\u2019s Golden Dozen Award for Teaching Excellence.   Social Challenges of Climate Change   FRSEM-UA 212   Instructor: Eric Klinenberg   Wednesday, 2:00-4:40 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note: conflicts with Principles of Biology I I RCT (Wednesday, 2:00 p.m.-4:45 p.m.) and Physics I I RCT (Wednesday, 2:00 p.m.-3:15  p.m.).   Climate change is a \u201cwicked problem,\u201d so daunting, complex, and consequential that it\u2019s difficult to comprehend and analyze, let alone solve. It\u2019s also an urgent problem, because in all likelihood we have a limited time frame to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, lest we create irreversible and catastrophic changes to the ecosystem that sustains human life. This seminar examines whether and how the social sciences can help us understand the challenge of climate change. We will briefly overview climate science and learn about the rise of \u201cweird weather,\u201d but the core themes of the course concern questions about communication and cognition, cultural values and material consumption, politics and persuasion, mitigation and adaptation, economics and social justice, power and social movements, and the possibility of creating new, more sustainable ways of living on earth. We will dedicate several sessions to Superstorm Sandy and its aftermath, with a focus on the question of how to rebuild a more resilient city and region in anticipation of more extreme weather events.   ERIC KLINENBERG is Professor of Sociology and Director of the Institute of Public Knowledge at NYU, as well as Research Director for the federal government's Rebuild by Design competition. He's the author of the acclaimed books Heat Wave , Fighting for Air , Going Solo , and Modern Romance (with Aziz Ansari). In addition to his scholarship, Professor Klinenberg has contributed to The New Yorker, Rolling Stone, The New York Times Magazine, and This American Life .     Branding: People, Places, Things   FRSEM-UA 422   Instructor: Richard L. Lewis   Tuesday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note: conflicts with Principles of Biology RCT ( Tuesday , 2:00 p.m.-4:45 p.m.) , and Intro Experimental Physics I Lab (Tuesday, 2:00 p.m.- 5:00 p.m.).   Brands help us avoid making the same decisions over and over by building bridges of trust; it\u2019s reassuring that a visit to McDonald\u2019s is pretty much the same all around the world. Brands provide information, advice, smiles, and community, using a variety of rational and emotional tools to connect with us. Even brand owners are sometimes uncertain as to how their brand has cemented a relationship with an audience. This course analyzes what makes brands tick: how they\u2019re created, and how time, technology, distribution, competitors, and consumers force them to change. We also examine the dark side of brands\u2019 magnetism. Finally, we examine our budding, personal brands, or reputations, which is how our family, friends, enemies, teachers and bosses evaluate us.   RICHARD L. LEWIS is an independent marketing consultant who solves business, branding, and strategic problems for companies, professionals, and individuals. He was the longtime Managing Director at TBWA/Chiat/Day, and has written two bestselling books about advertising. He has also taught at Yale College.   The Doctor\u2019s Dilemma: Being Both Correct and Right   FRSEM-UA 379   Instructor: Michael E. Makover   Thursday, 6:20\u20138:50 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note: conflicts with Advanced General Chemistry I Lab ( Thursday, 2:30 p.m.\u20136:45 p.m.).   Dr. Saul Farber, former Dean of the NYU School of Medicine, frequently cautioned that just because an action or conclusion was correct did not mean that it was right . Ethics, laws, and religious and cultural beliefs intersect in every medical encounter and healthcare issue, affecting patients\u2019 options and care. The challenging issues to be studied and debated in this seminar include the following: Should doctors help terminal patients die to relieve intractable suffering? Should doctors participate in executions or in the interrogation of terrorists? Do we want to know so much about our genetic makeup that we are faced with terribly difficult consequences of that knowledge? Is \u201calternative medicine\u201d a reasonable alternative? What makes a good doctor good? Who should pay for your healthcare? The course aims to teach students how to address such questions by learning to think like doctors and scientists, to apply logic tempered by human values and experience, to analyze information critically, and to present ideas effectively and honestly.

Literary Theory and Its Applications   FRSEM-UA 355   Instructor: John Maynard   Tuesday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note: conflicts with Principles of Biology RCT (Tuesday, 2:00 p.m.-4:45 p.m.) and Intro Experimental Physics I Lab (Tuesday, 2:00 p.m.-5:00 p.m.).   Students in this seminar read a selection of essays from major thinkers about literature, mainly from the latter half of the twentieth century to the present, and learn to evaluate different approaches. They complete the course by preparing a discussion of a work of literature using one or more of the conceptual approaches they have studied. Emphasis is placed on learning how to analyze theoretical problems and how to improvise in applying them to new situations. The seminar is recommended for students interested in any area of the humanities.   JOHN MAYNARD is Professor of English at NYU. His interests include literary interpretation, readers and reading, literary theory, biography, and Victorian and modern literature. He has published books on a variety of subjects in Victorian literature and is editor of Victorian Literature and Culture . His most recent book is on readers and reading.

Great Science, Fabulous Science, and Voodoo Science   FRSEM-UA 457   Instructor: Allen Mincer   Wednesday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note: conflicts with Principles of Biology I RCT (Wednesday, 2:00 p.m.-4:45 p.m.) and Physics I RCT (Wednesday, 2:00 p.m.-3:15  p.m.).   Science is often portrayed as following a very clearly-defined set of procedures: start with a hypothesis, do an experiment and, based on the results, reject the hypothesis or adopt it as a working assumption. The actual process, however, is rarely so straightforward. In addition, the stories as usually told or recorded may differ from what really happened. For most of the semester, we study some famous, some lesser known, and some infamous experiments, mainly in the physical sciences, selected to illustrate intellectual tours de force, sloppiness, error, self-deception, and fraud, and the sometimes murky boundaries between them. Along the way, issues such as the discarding of \u201cfaulty data,\u201d theoretical bias, and probabilistic tools for hypothesis acceptance and rejection are discussed. In the latter part of the semester, we discuss how scientific ideas are evaluated by the media, in the courtroom, and in government.   Prerequisites: students must have taken high school chemistry, physics, and calculus.   ALLEN MINCER, Collegiate Professor and Professor of Physics, specializes in experimental particle physics and particle astrophysics. He is currently a member of the ATLAS collaboration, which is studying the nature of the elementary building blocks of matter at the CERN Large Hadron Collider in Geneva, Switzerland. His research at NYU has a long, continuous history of generous support by grants from the National Science Foundation. He is co-author of approximately 400 scientific publications, including the discovery of the top quark with the D-Zero collaboration and the discovery of a particle consistent with the Standard Model Higgs Boson with the ATLAS Collaboration. In addition to teaching in the Physics Department, he has taught in the Steinhardt School\u2019s Department of Teaching and Learning, been involved in research in physics education, and has twice been awarded the College\u2019s Golden Dozen Award for Teaching Excellence.   The Writer in New York   FRSEM-UA 367   Instructor: Vincent Passaro   Thursday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note: conflicts with Principles of Biology RCT (Thursday, 2:00 p.m.-4:45 p.m.) , Physics I RCT ( Thursday, 2:00 p.m.-3:15 p.m.), and Advanced General Chem I Lab (Thursday, 2:30 p.m.-6:45 p.m.).   This seminar presents New York as a kind of super-literary event, a vivid aesthetic and social organism that enlarges and tunes the artistic imagination and the writer\u2019s crucial powers of observation. We examine how a number of writers have negotiated\u2014and how the city has powerfully influenced\u2014the fragile construction of their literary art and their personal identities. We attend to the perennial difficulties of money and competition that preoccupies most writers living here, the stress that characterizes both life in New York and the life of the writer, and how those strained lives have helped to create a kind of literary tradition of their own. Through the readings\u2014from Whitman to James, from Crane to Millay to Fitzgerald, from the Beats to the Downtown writers to recent web postings\u2014we try to understand the New York writer\u2019s particular forms of misery and joy.   VINCENT PASSARO is the author of the New York novel Violence, Nudity, Adult Content . His widely anthologized short fiction, essays, criticism and reviews have appeared in GQ , Esquire , Harper\u2019s Magazine , The Nation , the New York Times Magazine , and the London Sunday Times Magazine , among other venues, and he has written online for Salon.com and Mr. Beller\u2019s Neighborhood , a site dedicated to stories from New York.   Xenophon of Athens\u2014Cavalry Commander and Socratic Philosopher   FRSEM-UA 514   Instructor: Vincent Renzi   Tuesday, 12:30-3:15 p.m.    Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note: conflicts with Principles of Biology II RCT (Tuesday, 12:3 0 p.m.-3:15 p.m.) and Physics I I Lecture (Tuesday  &amp; Thursday, 12:30 p.m.-1:45 p.m. ) .   The greatest ancient you\u2019ve never heard of, Xenophon of Athens (c. 425\u2013355 B.C.E.) was a brilliant general, student of Socrates, and renowned author. His heroism leading the army of the Ten Thousand inspired the conquests of Alexander the Great and Julius Caesar. His political philosophy informed the thought of Cicero, Machiavelli, Franklin, and Jefferson. When knowledge of Greek was still required for admission to college, his fame was ubiquitous, as his writings formed the basis of the pre-college curriculum. Readings, in English translation: Apology of Socrates, Symposium, Memorabilia, Cyropaedia, Cavalry Commander, Anabasis , and the film based on the latter, The Warriors (1979). VINCENT RENZI is Clinical Professor in the Foundations of Contemporary Culture and of Classics, and is a director of undergraduate studies for the College Core Curriculum. A scholar of ancient Greek philosophy, he also has interests in arts and aesthetics and in 19th and 20th century philosophy, and is a recipient of the College's Golden Dozen Award for Teaching Excellence.   The Image of Business in American Literature   FRSEM-UA 440   Instructor: Saul Rosenberg   Friday, 9:30 a.m.\u201312:00 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note: conflicts with General Ch emistry I recitations (Friday, 9:30 a.m.\u201312:1 5 p.m.) and with Advanced Ch emistry I recitation (Friday, 9:30 a.m.\u201310:45 a .m.).   What is the relationship between virtue, material success, and happiness? This course asks how some of the most engaging American writers and filmmakers have treated the central ideas of business from the nation\u2019s founding to the present. How did the idea of \u201cdoing well by doing good\u201d fare as the Republic grew? We examine classic mid-19th century writers\u2019 thoughts about \u201cgetting and spending\u201d and reactions to the moral collapse inherent in the \u201cbusiness\u201d of slavery. We observe how our theme fared with the emergence in the later 19th century of the \u201crobber barons,\u201d the rise of the corporation, and the enormous influx of immigrants. For the 20th century, we look at films Greed and Wall Street and novels such as The Great Gatsby and The Fountainhead . The course finishes with reflections on the recent financial crisis.   SAUL ROSENBERG earned a PhD in American Literature from Columbia and degrees from Berkeley and Cambridge. In addition to teaching at NYU, he has taught American literature at Columbia University and the 92nd Street Y, and served as associate editor of Commentary magazine. He is a consultant at McKinsey &amp; Company, the leading management consulting firm, where he manages publishing and knowledge management programs. He writes regularly on books for the Wall Street Journal .   History, Memory, and the Quest for Social Justice in the U.S.   FRSEM-UA 437   Instructor: Jack Salzman   Wednesday, 11:00 a.m.\u20131:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note: conflicts with Experimental Physics I Lab ( Wednesday 9:00 a.m.\u201312:00 p.m.)  and Principles of Biology I RCT (Wednesday, 11:00 a.m.-1:45 p.m.).   This course explores the relationship between history and memory in the United States from the mid-20th century to the present. One of its primary objectives is to address the ethics of memory. Do we remember events not as they are but as we are? Do we have an obligation to remember events from the past? If we do, which events must we remember, and how do we remember those we did not experience? Or, as Marc Aug\u00e9 argues, is it essential for the health of the individual and of society that we know how to forget? We consider such events and issues as the response to the Holocaust; internment camps for Japanese Americans; racial segregation; the bombing of Dresden and Hiroshima; anticommunism; the Civil Rights Movement; the destruction of the World Trade Center, and genocides in Rwanda and Darfur. We address the role that museums, photography, film, and popular culture have in defining our individual and collective memory.   JACK SALZMAN served as the Director of the Center for American Culture Studies at Columbia University and editor of Prospects: An Annual of American Cultural Studies . He is the Editor-in-Chief of the Encyclopedia of African American Culture and History . Much of his work has been devoted to the relationship between African Americans and American Jews, including Struggles in the Promised Land (with Cornel West) and Bridges and Boundaries , the catalog for an exhibition at the Jewish Museum in New York. He recently completed We Remember the Children , a collection of memoirs by Holocaust survivors. He is writing a book on the impact of the Holocaust on Jews and social justice in the US. Professor Salzman has received the Distinguished Teaching Award and two Fulbrights.   The Cultural Nature of Language   FRSEM-UA 496   Instructor: Bambi Schieffelin   Friday, 9:30 a.m.\u201312:00 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note: conflicts with General Chem I RCT (Friday, 9:30 a.m.-12:15 p.m.) and Advanced General Chem I RCT ( Friday , 9:30 a.m.-10:45 a .m.).   Whether it\u2019s accents, pronouns, swearing, or spelling, how one uses language is never value-free. In this seminar we examine language-using as a social practice, and analyze how speakers and their language(s) are evaluated and regulated across a range of contexts and cultures. Starting with how children learn to talk, or don\u2019t (e.g., feral children), we examine speech and silence across a range of societies. We look at popular attitudes toward language and the practices by which people regulate its use in the media (e.g., political correctness), in legal and educational institutions (e.g., \u201cEnglish Only\u201d), and in multilingual cities (e.g., Barcelona, Montreal) in order to understand how ideas about language are often recruited to non-linguistic concerns, such as who should be included and who excluded. In thinking about the cultural nature of language in this way, we critically explore issues of identity and authority. BAMBI SCHIEFFELIN is Collegiate Professor and Professor of Anthropology. A linguistic anthropologist, she is the author of The Give and Take of Everyday Life: Language Socialization of Kaluli Children and co-editor of, among other books, The Acquisition of Literacy: Ethnographic Perspectives ; Language Ideologies: Practice and Theory ; and Consequences of Contact . She has also published articles in the preeminent journals of her field. She is completing a book on the impact of Christianity on the language and social life of Bosavi people of Papua New Guinea over the past twenty-five years, and continues research on linguistic creativity and change as evidenced in computer-mediated communication such as IM. Professor Schieffelin received the College\u2019s Golden Dozen Award for Teaching Excellence in 2010.   The Supreme Court and the Religion Clauses: Religion and State in America   FRSEM-UA 218   Instructor: John E. Sexton   Wednesday, 6:30 p.m.\u20138:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note: conflicts with Principles of Biology I RCT ( Wednesday, 6:3 0 p.m.\u20137 :45 p.m.).   Should members of the Native American Church be allowed to smoke peyote at religious ceremonies? Can a public high school invite a rabbi to give a benediction and convocation at graduation? Should a state legislator rely on his or her religious convictions in forming a view about the legality of capital punishment or abortion? The course divides these questions into three subject areas: religious liberty; separation of church and state; and the role of religion in public and political life. It focuses on how the Supreme Court has dealt with these areas and, more important, invites students to construct anew a vision of the proper relationship between religion, state, and society in a twenty-first-century liberal constitutional democracy. Most students consider the workload for this course very heavy; please do not enroll unless you are willing and eager to perform at a high and demanding level.   JOHN E. SEXTON, President of New York University, was the Dean of the NYU Law School from 1988 to 2002. He has taught courses on the Constitution and the courts, and has led seminars on the intersection of religion and the law. Before he came to NYU, he served as law clerk for Chief Justice Warren Burger of the US Supreme Court, and has testified frequently before the US Congress. In addition to his law degree, he holds a doctorate in the history of American religion.   Computational Thought   FRSEM-UA 385   Instructor: Dennis E. Shasha    Monday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note : conflicts with Intro Experimental Physics I Lab (Monday, 12:30 p.m.-3:30 p.m.).   Prerequisites: AP calculus, discrete mathematics, or programming experience Computational technology and methods lie at the core of modern science, commerce, entertainment, and, regrettably, war. There are very powerful ideas underlying the field that have roots in mathematics, linguistics, engineering, and even philosophy. Some of its greatest inventions were born in caf\u00e9s or as responses to a puzzle. Some recent algorithmic methods come from studying ants and evolution. This course introduces computational thinking as it builds on logic, linguistics, heuristics, artificial intelligence, and biological computing. The learning style combines straight lecture, interactive discussions of puzzles and games, and short computer programs (in the programming language Python which you will learn). Students make a few presentations during the semester about topics such as the solutions to computationally motivated puzzles, the relative power of linguistic descriptions, and their very own simulations of either an auction or a multi-bank elevator. The goal is for students to learn to think about computation from multiple perspectives and to synthesize those perspectives when faced with unsolved challenges. DENNIS SHASHA is Professor of Computer Science at the Courant Institute of New York University where he works with biologists on pattern discovery for network inference; with computational chemists on algorithms for protein design; with physicists and financial specialists on algorithms for time series; on clocked computation for DNA computing; and on computational reproducibility. Other areas of interest include database tuning as well as tree and graph matching. Because he likes to type, he has written six books of puzzles about a mathematical detective named Dr. Ecco, a volume of the biographies of great computer scientists, and a book about the future of computing. He has also written five technical books about database tuning, biological pattern recognition, time series, DNA computing, statistics, and causal inference in molecular networks. He has co-authored over seventy journal papers, seventy conference papers, and twenty patents. Professor Shasha has also written the puzzle column for various publications including Scientific American .   America\u2019s Role in International Affairs since World War II   FRSEM-UA 405   Instructor: James B. Sitrick   Wednesday, 3:30\u20136:00 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note: conflicts with Principles of Biology I RCT ( Wednesday, 3:3 0 p.m.\u20136:15 p.m.) and Physics I RCT (Wednesday, 5:00 p.m.-6:15 p.m.).   This seminar explores America\u2019s role in international affairs since World War II, interweaving current foreign policy challenges into the conversation. To provide historical perspective, the class first reads George F. Kennan\u2019s classic book American Diplomacy, 1900\u20131950 . Subsequent topics include the creation of the UN during the late 1940s and some of its more recent activities, including possible reform; the CIA; the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962; US involvement in Vietnam in the 1960s and early 1970s; US involvement in the Middle East (particularly with respect to Israel, Iran, and Iraq); the imperial presidency (comparing Arthur Schlesinger Jr.\u2019s celebrated 1973 book on the subject with the actions of the Bush 43 administration); and the foreign policy challenges of the Obama administration.   JAMES B. SITRICK serves as Of Counsel to the international law firm of Baker &amp; McKenzie, which has offices in seventy cities in forty countries. He previously served as chairman and CEO of Coudert Brothers, the oldest international law firm in the United States. His government and NGO service includes extensive work for the Department of the Treasury in drafting international legislation and negotiating treaties with foreign countries. He has also served as secretary general of the World Federation of United Nations Associations. In addition, he serves as a trustee of many American and European cultural institutions, as well as on the Arts and Science Board of Overseers at NYU.   First Amendment Freedom of Expression   FRSEM-UA 235   Instructor: Stephen D. Solomon    Monday and Wednesday, 11:00 a.m.\u201312:15 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note: conflicts with Introductory Experimental Physics I Lecture (Monday , 11:00 a.m.\u201312:15 p.m .) ,  Intro Experimental Physics I Lab (Wednesday, 9:00 a.m.-12:00 p.m.), and Principles of Biology I RCT (Wednesday, 11:00 a.m.-12:15 p.m.).   Prerequisites: A score of 4 o r 5 in either AP U.S. History OR in AP U.S. Government and Politics (or equivalent international exam) ; both recommended.   Conflicts over freedom of speech and the press erupt into public debate almost every week. Congress passes a law to purge indecency from online communications. A judge issues an order shutting down a website that publishes secret documents. Reporters go to jail for refusing to reveal the identity of sources. Although the First Amendment appears on its face to prohibit any governmental restrictions on speech and the press, the Supreme Court in fact balances free and open expression against other vital social interests. The starting point of this course, which involves both history and law, is the robust debate that occurred in the early Republic over prosecutions for seditious libel (the crime of criticizing the government or public officials). We examine how the Supreme Court has interpreted freedom of expression by looking at a rich variety of contemporary conflicts, including libel of public and private persons, prior restraints against publication, flag burning, and restrictions on freedom of speech during wartime. STEPHEN D. SOLOMON is Associate Professor in NYU\u2019s Arthur L. Carter Journalism Institute. His book Ellery\u2019s Protest: How One Young Man Defied Tradition &amp; Sparked the Battle over School Prayer tells the story of the controversial Supreme Court decision in which the justices ruled that state-organized prayer and Bible reading in public schools violated the First Amendment. He is currently working on An American Invention: The Founding Generation and the Struggle for Freedom of Speech , to be published by Macmillan. Professor Solomon is a recipient of the College\u2019s Golden Dozen Award for Teaching Excellence. He earned a JD at Georgetown University Law Center.   The Problem of Beauty   FRSEM-UA 550   Instructor: G. Gabrielle Starr   Tuesday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note: conflicts with Principles of Biology I RCT (Tuesday, 2:00 p.m.-4:45 p.m.) and Intro Experimental Physics I Lab (Tuesday, 2:00 p.m.-5:00 p.m.).   What is beauty for? It is common in many circumstances to think of beauty as \u201cmerely\u201d beautiful\u2014something nice to have, but an unnecessary add-on to what really matters. This hasn\u2019t always been the case. Beauty has played an important part in philosophy, ethics and theology, and now it is playing an increasingly interesting role in biology, neuroscience, social policy, and design. But what is beauty, anyway? And why should we care? This course explores the role of beauty across a variety of disciplines and across \u201clong time\u201d (not just the period from the ancient world to the present, but even the long time of evolution).   G. GABRIELLE STARR is Professor of English and Seryl Kushner Dean of the College of Arts and Science. She has published widely on eighteenth-century British literature and the history of the aesthetic. With collaborators in NYU\u2019s Center for Neural Science, she has pursued research in the field of neuroaesthetics and published the results in Frontiers in Human Neuroscience . In addition, Dean Starr has just published a book entitled Feeling Beauty: Aesthetic Experience in the Brain and Across the Arts.   Welcome to College: The Novel   FRSEM-UA 371   Instructor: Carol Sternhell   Wednesday, 12:30 p.m.\u20133:00 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note: conflicts with Principles of Biology I RCT ( Wednesday, 12:30 p.m.\u20133:1 5 p.m.) and Physics I RCT ( Wednesday, 2:00 p.m.\u20133 :15 p.m.).   Starting college can be exhilarating\u2014and terrifying. A chance for intellectual enlightenment\u2014or intense loneliness. An escape from a stultifying small town of narrow-minded people\u2014or a riot of alcohol, sex, and drugs. In this class we read a selection of college novels from different historical periods, ranging from F. Scott Fitzgerald\u2019s This Side of Paradise to Tom Wolfe\u2019s I Am Charlotte Simmons . We discuss these novels from a variety of perspectives: literary, historical, and journalistic. In addition to presenting biographical and historical and cultural reports on at least two of the authors and their novels, students write about their own experiences as first-year students at NYU in several genres, including fiction and nonfiction. Together we explore this important life passage, examining life as we live it.   CAROL STERNHELL is Associate Professor of Journalism and a Director of the Arthur L. Carter Journalism Institute\u2019s Studio 20 graduate program. She created the department\u2019s study-away programs in London, Prague, and Accra and was also a founder of the Women\u2019s Studies major (now Gender and Sexuality Studies). She has written extensively about feminism, motherhood, and literature for a variety of publications. Before coming to NYU, she worked as an editor at Newsday , a general assignment reporter for the New York Post , and a freelance magazine writer. She received the College\u2019s Golden Dozen Award for Teaching Excellence in 2005.   School and Society: NYU in the Sixties and Seventies   FRSEM-UA 255   Instructor: Arthur Tannenbaum   Tuesday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note: conflicts with Intro Experimental Physics I Lab ( Tuesday, 2:00 p.m.-5 :00 p.m.) and Principles of Biology I RCT ( Tuesday, 2:00 p.m.-4:4 5 p.m.).   The 1960s and 1970s brought profound changes in American society, changes mirrored in the history of the nation, academe, and New York University. It was a time that witnessed the struggle for civil rights, assassinations, war abroad and riots at home, and a youth-led revolution in music, dress, and values. This course aims to develop an appreciation of those years by examining the events and the reactions as they affected campuses and students across America. Students prepare reports on different aspects of the era and work on group projects. In both cases, and in the spirit of the times, the topics are self-chosen with the approval of the group and the seminar leader.   ARTHUR TANNENBAUM is Associate Curator and Social Work Librarian in the Bobst Library, and has also taught in the English Department. First as a student and then as a faculty member, he has been at NYU for more than thirty years. In 1992 he received the University\u2019s Distinguished Teaching Medal in recognition for his work with students.   Language and Reality in Modern Science and Literature   FRSEM-UA 210   Instructor: Friedrich Ulfers   Tuesday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note: conflicts with Principles of Biology I RCT ( Tuesday, 2:00 p.m.\u20134:4 5 p.m.) and Intro Experimental Physics I Lab ( Tuesday, 2:00 p.m.\u20135:00 p.m.).   The course explores the possibility that there exists a common ground between the two cultures of science and the humanities. It posits the hypothesis of a correlation between postclassical science (e.g., quantum theory) and \u201cpostmodern\u201d literature and philosophy. Among the key notions examined are Heisenberg\u2019s \u201cuncertainty principle\u201d and the \u201cundecidability\u201d of deconstructive theory. The discussion of these notions and of their implications in literary works revolves around their effect on classical logic, the referential function of language, and the traditional goal of a complete explanation/description of reality. Readings include selections from the works of Virginia Woolf, Borges, Kundera, Pirsig, and Pynchon, and from non-technical texts on quantum and chaos theory.   FRIEDRICH ULFERS is Associate Professor of German. Winner of the College\u2019s Golden Dozen Award for Teaching Excellence, the University\u2019s Distinguished Teaching Medal, and NYU Alumni Association Great Teacher Award, he has taught not only in the German Department but also in the Draper Interdisciplinary Master\u2019s Program, offering courses on Nietzsche, Kafka, and other figures. He has written widely on 20th-century German authors and is at present preparing a study of Nietzsche as a postmodernist.   The Art and Architecture of Papal Rome 1490\u20131610: Two Michelangelos, Buonarroti and Merisi da Caravaggio   FRSEM-UA 366   Instructor: Guy Walton   Wednesday, 9:30 a.m.\u2013noon   Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note: conflicts with Principles of Biology I Lecture (Monday and Wednesday 9:30\u201310:45 a.m. ), Principles of Biology I RCT (Wednesday, 11:00 a.m-1:45 p.m.), and Introductory Experimental Physics I Lab ( Wednesday, 9:00 a.m.\u201312:00 p.m.)   Early and recent biographies and films about the lives of Michelangelo Buonarroti and Caravaggio provide the starting point for this course, which sets their art in the larger context of, first, papal patronage (the courts of Sixtus IV, Julius II, Leo X, Clement VII, Paul III, Sixtus V, and Paul V), and second, the culture of Renaissance and Counter Reformation Rome. Students develop a major research paper on the masterpieces of painting and sculpture the \u201ctwo Michelangelos\u201d produced.   GUY WALTON is Professor Emeritus of Art History at the College of Arts and Science. His degrees are from Wesleyan University and NYU\u2019s Institute of Fine Arts (MA, PhD). His research and publications have centered on the courts of Europe of the early modern period, including those of the popes in Rome, and on the artists and architects who worked for many rulers. His published works include scholarly articles, reviews, and exhibition catalogs. He is the author of Louis XIV\u2019s Versailles .   Reading The Dream of the Red Chamber   FRSEM-UA 461   Instructor: Jing Wang   Monday, 3:30\u20136:10 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note: conflicts with Introductory Experimental Physics I Lab ( Monday, 12:30 p.m.\u20133:30 p.m.) .   Cao Xueqin\u2019s mid-18th century literary epic The Dream of the Red Chamber is widely regarded as the culmination of the vernacular novel of imperial China. With a tragic love story between two aristocratic teenagers at its dramatic center, it covers a vast terrain of culture and social life\u2014the question of what is eternal and what is ephemeral; the nature of \u201cqing,\u201d as the heart of being that both animates and destroys life; individual talent and its fragility; the decadence of the elite; and growing, if hidden, social and class tensions. The novel\u2019s manifold structure and intricate plot development, coupled with its dazzling array of memorable characters, makes it one of the most complex and colorful of all time. Note: Both reading and discussions are conducted in English. No knowledge of Chinese culture, language, or history is required or assumed. Native Chinese speakers who wish to read and enjoy this masterpiece in the original language are advised to choose a different Freshman Seminar and take Reading The Dream of the Red Chamber (EAST-UA 228) as an elective course in the future. Consult the CAS Bulletin for prerequisites.   JING WANG is Assistant Research Scholar in the College of Arts and Science and the Department of East Asian Studies, where, from 1999 to 2006, she was Lecturer in Chinese. She is the editor and translator of Anthology of Short Stories by American Women Writers in the 1990\u2019s .

The aim was to offer freshmen, in their very   first semester, the opportunity to be in a small, intellectually   stimulating class taught by an expert professor. From the start, the   program proved to be highly popular with students and instructors alike.   The number of seminars has grown from a mere seven in the fall of 1992   to more than eighty in recent years (now offered in both fall and spring). The instructors have been   drawn not only from the College\u2019s faculty but also from NYU\u2019s   professional schools and from among New York\u2019s professional, cultural,   and governmental leaders. With the launching of the College Cohort   Program in fall 2012, every CAS freshman is required to take one of these seminars. Since 2005, the College has extended the principles behind these first-year seminars to the Advanced Honors Seminars program for sophomores, juniors, and (space permitting) seniors. The FRESHMAN SEMINARS    have as their goals to put new students into contact with leading   thinkers, to introduce them to important subjects, to challenge them   intellectually through rigorous standards of analysis and oral and   written argumentation, and to prepare them to conduct their own   research. To that end, they stress demanding readings and writing   assignments that introduce students to an essential research skill\u2014such   as a literature review, quantitative reasoning, critical use of primary   sources, the identification of a research problem, critical analysis of   texts, or confrontations with works or art. In addition to participating   actively in class discussions, students are expected to give oral   presentations in class. A final paper will typically, though not always,   have gone through one or more revisions, perhaps revised with the   benefit of in-class comments. In other seminars the focus may be on   individual or group projects.  Fall 2014  Language and Reality in Modern Science and Literature FRSEM-UA 210 Instructor: Friedrich Ulfers Tuesday, 2:00-4:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Thursday, 3:30-4:30 p.m. The course explores the possibility that there exists a common ground between the two cultures of science and the humanities. It posits the hypothesis of a correlation between postclassical science (e.g., quantum theory) and \"postmodern\" literature and philosophy. Among the key notions examined are Heisenberg's \"uncertainty principle\" and the \"undecidability\" of deconstructive theory. The discussion of these notions and of their implications in literary works revolves around their effect on classical logic, the referential function of language, and the traditional goal of a complete explanation/description of reality. Readings include selections from the works of Virginia Woolf, Borges, Kundera, Pirsig, and Pynchon, and from non-technical texts on quantum and chaos theory. FRIEDRICH ULFERS is Associate Professor of German. Winner of the College's Golden Dozen Award for Teaching Excellence, the University's Distinguished Teaching Medal, and NYU Alumni Association Great Teacher Award, he has taught not only in the German Department but also in the Draper Interdisciplinary Master's Program, offering courses on, among others, Nietzsche and Kafka. He has written widely on 20th-century German authors and is at present preparing a study of Nietzsche as a postmodernist.  The Supreme Court and the Religion Clauses: Religion and State in America FRSEM-UA 218 Instructor: John E. Sexton  syllabus Tuesday, 6:45-8:45 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Friday, 11:00 a.m.-noon Note: conflicts with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m.-1:45 p.m.) and with Advanced Chemistry I recitation (Friday, 11:00 a.m.-12:15 p.m.). Should members of the Native American Church be allowed to smoke peyote at religious ceremonies? Can a public high school invite a rabbi to give a benediction and convocation at graduation? Should a state legislator rely on his or her religious convictions in forming a view about the legality of capital punishment or abortion? The course divides these questions into three subject areas: religious liberty; separation of church and state; and the role of religion in public and political life. It focuses on how the Supreme Court has dealt with these areas and, more important, invites students to construct anew a vision of the proper relationship between religion, state, and society in a twenty-first-century liberal constitutional democracy. Most students consider the workload for this course very heavy; please do not enroll unless you are willing and eager to perform at that level. JOHN E. SEXTON, President of New York University, was the Dean of the NYU Law School from 1988 to 2002. He has taught courses on the Constitution and the courts, and has led seminars on the intersection of religion and the law. Before he came to NYU, he served as law clerk for Chief Justice Warren Burger of the US Supreme Court, and has testified frequently before the US Congress. In addition to his law degree, he holds a doctorate in the history of American religion.  First Amendment Freedom of Expression FRSEM-UA 235 Instructor: Stephen D. Solomon   syllabus Monday and Wednesday, 11:00 a.m.-12:15 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Friday, 11:00 a.m.-noon Note: conflicts with Introductory Experimental Physics I (Monday 11:00 a.m.\u201312:15 p.m.), General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m.\u20131:45 p.m.) and with Advanced Chemistry I recitation (Friday, 11:00 a.m.\u201312:15 p.m.). Prerequisites: A score of 4 or 5 in either AP U.S. History OR in AP U.S. Government and Politics (or equivalent international exam); both recommended. Conflicts over freedom of speech and the press erupt into public debate almost every week. Congress passes a law to purge indecency from online communications. A judge issues an order shutting down a website that publishes secret documents. Reporters go to jail for refusing to reveal the identity of sources. Although the First Amendment appears on its face to prohibit any governmental restrictions on speech and the press, the Supreme Court in fact balances free and open expression against other vital social interests. The starting point of this course, which involves both history and law, is the robust debate that occurred in the early Republic over prosecutions for seditious libel (the crime of criticizing the government or public officials). We examine how the Supreme Court has interpreted freedom of expression by looking at a rich variety of contemporary conflicts, including libel of public and private persons, prior restraints against publication, flag burning, and restrictions on freedom of speech during wartime. STEPHEN D. SOLOMON is Associate Professor in NYU's Arthur L. Carter Journalism Institute. His book Ellery's Protest: How One Young Man Defied Tradition &amp; Sparked the Battle over School Prayer tells the story of the controversial Supreme Court decision in which the justices ruled that state-organized prayer and Bible reading in public schools violated the First Amendment. He is currently working on An American Invention: The Founding Generation and the Struggle for Freedom of Speech , to be published by Macmillan. Solomon is a recipient of the College's Golden Dozen Award for Teaching Excellence. He earned a JD at Georgetown University Law Center.  School and Society: NYU in the Sixties and Seventies FRSEM-UA 255 Instructor: Arthur Tannenbaum Tuesday, 2:00-4:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Thursday, 2:00-3:00 p.m. The 1960s and 1970s brought profound changes in American society, changes mirrored in the history of the nation, academe, and New York University. It was a time that witnessed the struggle for civil rights, assassinations, war abroad and riots at home, and a youth-led revolution in music, dress, and values. This course aims to develop an appreciation of those years by examining the events and the reactions as they affected campuses and students across America. Students prepare reports on different aspects of the era and work on group projects. In both cases, and in the spirit of the times, the topics are self-chosen with the approval of the group and the seminar leader. ARTHUR TANNENBAUM is Associate Curator and Social Work Librarian in the Bobst Library, and has also taught in the English Department. First as a student and then as a faculty member, he has been at NYU for more than thirty years. In 1992 he received the University's Distinguished Teaching Medal in recognition for his work with students.  Disease in History: Epidemics and Pandemics from Antiquity to the Present FRSEM-UA 265 Instructor: Richard W. Hull   syllabus Wednesday 2:00-4:45 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Monday, 3:30-4:30 p.m. This seminar focuses on the historical dimensions of several major epidemics that profoundly affected human societies in Europe, Asia, Africa, and the Americas. Students identify each epidemic and explore its causes, origins, means of transmission, efforts at containment, and impacts on societies, particularly on their cultural development. They examine representations of the epidemic in the arts, media, and literature of the period, as well as assess the effects of each disease on demographics, religions, economies, and ways of life. To what extent did an epidemic, or plague, accelerate or slow fundamental changes in human relationships within societies and between them, and the ways people viewed themselves and their universe? RICHARD HULL is Professor of History. A specialist in African and European history, he is the author of numerous books, including African Cities and Towns ; Modern Africa ; and Munyakare: African Civilizations , as well as coauthor of the two-volume World Civilizations . He has received both the Great Teacher Award and three Golden Dozen Awards for Teaching Excellence at the College.  Latin America at the Start of the 21st Century: Coming of Age or Continuing Chaos? FRSEM-UA 306 Instructor: Jorge G. Casta\u00f1eda  syllabus Monday, 9:30 a.m.-noon Required cohort meeting: Friday, 11:00 a.m.-noon Note: conflicts with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m.-1:45 p.m.) and with Advanced Chemistry I recitation (Friday, 11:00 a.m.-12:15 p.m.). This seminar focuses on Latin America's longstanding problems and possible solutions to them. It takes up such topics as the absence of orderly, peaceful, and steady democratic governance following independence from colonial rule, and the consolidation of representative democracy today; the slowdown of economic growth in the last 20 years and prospects for a new economic takeoff; the phenomenon of widespread violence, and growing respect for human rights; and how the traditional weakness of civil society is being overcome. For each topic, there are readings dealing with its political, economic, and cultural dimensions in both past and present. JORGE D. CASTA\u00d1EDA is Global Distinguished Professor of Politics and Latin American and Caribbean Studies. Professor at the National Autonomous University of Mexico since 1979, he has also been a visiting professor at the University of California at Berkeley, Princeton, and Dartmouth. A principal strategist in the election campaign of President Vicente Fox in 2000, he served as Mexico's Foreign Minister from late 2000 until early 2003. He is the author of, among many other books, Utopia Unarmed: The Latin American Left after the Cold War ; Compa\u00f1ero: The Life and Death of Che Guevara ; Perpetuating Power ; Ex-Mex: From Migrants to Immigrants ; and Leftovers: Tales of the Latin American Left (with Marco Morales). He has also written articles for many newspapers and magazines in Mexico, the United States, and other countries.  The Operas of Gilbert and Sullivan FRSEM-UA 333 Instructor: Rena Charnin Mueller   syllabus Thursday, 9:45 a.m.-12:15 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Tuesday, 11:00 a.m.-noon The operas of Gilbert and Sullivan were composed during a period of intense change in the world of symphonic music and opera in the 19th century. This seminar examines the major works and their historical, cultural, and musical contexts, with particular attention to The Mikado , which will soon celebrate the 130th anniversary of its premiere in 1885, and which became, arguably, one of the most contentious compositions to reach the stage. It also examines the lives of the composer and the librettist and their respective milieu. In addition, we study the staging of light opera through a close look at the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company and its singers, scenic designers, choreographers, and costumers, drawing on the collections of the Morgan Library in New York, which houses the principal sources for the music and numerous artifacts from the productions. RENA CHARNIN MUELLER teaches historical musicology in the Music Department. She was the editor of the Journal of the American Liszt Society from 2001 to 2011 and won the Lizst Medal in 2011. Her research interests include Lizst, Wagner, operetta, and the Broadway musical, in particular its adaptation of elite musical forms. With M\u00e1ria Eckhardt, she is preparing a complete thematic catalogue of Liszt's music; their previous collaboration was on the Liszt \"List of Works\" for The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians 2001 . She is also editing The Gondoliers for the Gilbert &amp; Sullivan Complete Edition.  Literary Theory and Its Applications FRSEM-UA 355 Instructor: John Maynard   syllabus Tuesday, 2:00-4:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Thursday, 2:00-3:00 p.m. Students in this seminar read a selection of essays from major thinkers about literature, mainly from the latter half of the twentieth century to the present, and learn to evaluate different approaches. They complete the course by preparing a discussion of a work of literature using one or more of the conceptual approaches they have studied. Emphasis is placed on learning how to analyze theoretical problems and how to improvise in applying them to new situations. The seminar is recommended for students interested in any area of the humanities. JOHN MAYNARD is Professor of English at NYU. His interests include literary interpretation, readers and reading, literary theory, biography, and Victorian and modern literature. He has published books on a variety of subjects in Victorian literature and is editor of Victorian Literature and Culture . His most recent book is on readers and reading. From 1983 to 1989, he served as chair of the Department of English. He likes New York City, New York theater, and bicycling.  From Mind to Brain and Back Again FRSEM-UA 357 Instructor: Joseph LeDoux Monday, 2:00-4:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Wednesday, 3:30-4:30 p.m. One of the great debates in history is the nature of consciousness: to what extent we are \"hard-wired\" as opposed to shaped by experience? Several hundred years ago, this fundamental question would have been addressed by philosophers. In the late 19th century, the birth of psychology gave us ways of studying the mind scientifically rather than simply speculating about it. Modern neuroscience gives us a new approach, one in which we use discoveries about the brain to understand who we are and why we are that way. What have we learned? And does this approach enhance (or diminish) our sense of who we are? In this course we look at issues both historically and in terms of modern discoveries, using the topic of emotions, and their relation to the brain, as a window on the broader problem of mind and brain. JOSEPH LEDOUX, University Professor and Henry and Lucy Moses Professor of Science, is on the faculty of the Center for Neural Science and of the Department of Psychology at NYU. He received his PhD in psychology from the State University of New York at Stony Brook in 1977. Before coming to NYU in 1989, he was a postdoctoral fellow and then Assistant Professor in the Department of Neurology at Cornell University Medical College. In addition to articles in scholarly journals, he is author of The Emotional Brain: The Mysterious Underpinnings of Emotional Life and Synaptic Self: How Our Brains Become Who We Are . He is the recipient of the 2005 Fyssen International Prize in Cognitive Science. He is also a member of a rock band, The Amygdaloids, an all-NYU band that plays original music about mind and brain. They have two CDs: Heavy Mental and Theory of My Mind .  The Art and Architecture of Papal Rome 1490-1610: Two Michelangelos - Buonarroti and Merisi da Caravaggio FRSEM-UA 366 Instructor: Guy Walton   syllabus Wednesday, 9:30 a.m.-noon Required cohort meeting: Monday, 11:00 a.m.-noon Note: conflicts with Principles of Biology I (Monday and Wednesday 9:30-10:45 a.m.) and with Introductory Experimental Physics I (Monday 11:00 a.m.-12:15 p.m.) Early and recent biographies and films about the lives of Michelangelo Buonarroti and Caravaggio provide the starting point for this course, which sets their art in the larger context of, first, papal patronage (the courts of Sixtus IV, Julius II, Leo X, Clement VII, Paul III, Sixtus V, and Paul V), and second, the culture of Renaissance and Counter Reformation Rome. Students develop a major research paper on the masterpieces of painting and sculpture the \"two Michelangelos\" produced. GUY WALTON is Professor Emeritus of Art History at the College of Arts and Science. His degrees are from Wesleyan University and NYU's Institute of Fine Arts (MA, PhD). His research and publications have centered on the courts of Europe of the early modern period, including those of the popes in Rome, and on the artists and architects who worked for many rulers. His published works include scholarly articles, reviews, and exhibition catalogs. He is the author of Louis XIV's Versailles .  The Writer in New York FRSEM-UA 367 Instructor: Vincent Passaro Thursday, 2:00-4:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Tuesday, 2:00-3:00 p.m. This seminar presents New York as a kind of super-literary event, a vivid aesthetic and social organism that enlarges and tunes the artistic imagination and the writer's crucial powers of observation. We examine how a number of writers have negotiated-and how the city has powerfully influenced-the fragile construction of their literary art and their personal identities. We attend to the perennial difficulties of money and competition that preoccupies most writers living here, the stress that characterizes both life in New York and the life of the writer, and how those strained lives have helped to create a kind of literary tradition of their own. Through the readings'from Whitman to James, from Crane to Millay to Fitzgerald, from the Beats to the Downtown writers to recent web postings-we try to understand the New York writer's particular forms of misery and joy. VINCENT PASSARO is the author of the New York novel Violence, Nudity, Adult Content . His widely anthologized short fiction, essays, criticism and reviews have appeared in GQ , Esquire , Harper's Magazine , The Nation , the New York Times Magazine , and the London Sunday Times Magazine , among other venues, and he has written online for Salon.com and Mr. Beller's Neighborhood , a site dedicated to stories from New York.  Welcome to College: The Novel FRSEM-UA 371 Instructor: Carol Sternhell  syllabus Wednesday, 11:00 a.m.-1:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Friday, 11:00 a.m.-noon Note: conflicts with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m.-1:45 p.m.) and with Advanced Chemistry I recitation (Friday, 11:00 a.m.-12:15 p.m.). Starting college can be exhilarating-and terrifying. A chance for intellectual enlightenment-or intense loneliness. An escape from a stultifying small town of narrow-minded people-or a riot of alcohol, sex, and drugs. In this class we read a selection of college novels from different historical periods, ranging from F. Scott Fitzgerald's This Side of Paradise to Tom Wolfe's I Am Charlotte Simmons . We discuss these novels from a variety of perspectives: literary, historical, and journalistic. In addition to presenting biographical and historical and cultural reports on at least two of the authors and their novels, students write about their own experiences as first-year students at NYU in several genres, including fiction and nonfiction. Together we explore this important life passage, examining life as we live it. CAROL STERNHELL is Associate Professor of Journalism and a Director of the Arthur L. Carter Journalism Institute's Studio 20 graduate program. She created the department's study-away programs in London, Prague, and Accra and was also a founder of the Women's Studies major (now Gender and Sexuality Studies). She has written about extensively about feminism, motherhood, and literature for a variety of publications. Before coming to NYU, she worked as an editor at Newsday , a general assignment reporter for the New York Post , and a freelance magazine writer. She received the College's Golden Dozen Award for Teaching Excellence in 2005.  The Doctor's Dilemma: Being Both Correct and Right FRSEM-UA 379 Instructor: Michael E. Makover  syllabus Tuesday, 6:20-8:50 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Friday, 11:00-noon Note: conflicts with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m.-1:45 p.m.) and with Advanced Chemistry I recitation (Friday, 11:00 a.m.-12:15 p.m.). Dr. Saul Farber, former Dean of the NYU School of Medicine, frequently cautioned that just because an action or conclusion was correct, did not mean that it was right. Ethics, laws, and religious and cultural beliefs intersect in every medical encounter and healthcare issue, affecting patients' options and care. The challenging issues to be studied and debated in this seminar include the following: Should doctors help terminal patients die to relieve intractable suffering? Should doctors participate in executions or in the interrogation of terrorists? Do we want to know so much about our genetic makeup that we are faced with terribly difficult consequences of that knowledge? Is \"alternative medicine\" a reasonable alternative? What makes a good doctor good? Who should pay for your healthcare? The course aims to teach students how to address such questions by learning to think like doctors and scientists, to apply logic tempered by human values and experience, to analyze information critically, and to present ideas effectively and honestly. Approximately 50 pages of reading, and 750 words of writing, per week. MICHAEL E. MAKOVER is Clinical Assistant Professor of Medicine at the NYU School of Medicine and Attending Physician at the NYU Medical Center. He is also the Chief Medical Officer for a major union. An internist and rheumatologist, he is the author of Mismanaged Care , as well as articles on healthcare quality, ethics, and economics, and currently writing another book entitled 120 Years Young . He was an aide to Senator Robert F. Kennedy and a spokesman for the American Cancer Society and the New York Heart Association.  Suffering and Comfort: Explorations in Narrative Medicine and Other Sources FRSEM-UA 393 Instructor: Michele Shedlin  syllabus Wednesday, 4:55-7:25 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Monday, 3:30-4:30 p.m. This seminar explores the nature of suffering and comfort, coping and resilience, in a context where scientific advances have created heretofore unimaginable possibilities, choices, and dilemmas for all of us. How do people cope with the complexities that illness and the need for care bring into our lives? Readings in narrative medicine and other sources, including film, newspaper and magazine articles, novels, poetry and religious texts, guide our discussions about the different ways individuals and cultures view these important dimensions of the human experience. A goal of the course is to familiarize students with the conceptual frameworks that nurses, physicians, social workers, and clergy use as they assist patients. . MICHELE SHEDLIN, Professor at the NYU College of Nursing, is a medical anthropologist with extensive experience in reproductive health, substance abuse, and HIV/AIDS research in Africa, Latin America and the US. She has designed and implemented behavioral studies at the community, university and national levels, to inform and evaluate prevention and care, and is currently involved in NIH-funded research on HIV risk for Colombian refugees in Ecuador, medication adherence among US-Mexico border populations, and acculturation and HIV risk for sexual minority populations and post-Katrina Latino migrant workers in New Orleans.  America's Role in International Affairs since World War II FRSEM-UA 405 Instructor: James B. Sitrick   syllabus Wednesday, 3:30-6:00 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Monday, 3:30-4:30 p.m. This seminar explores America's role in international affairs since World War II, interweaving current foreign policy challenges into the conversation. To provide historical perspective, the class first reads George F. Kennan's classic book American Diplomacy, 1900-1950 . Subsequent topics include the creation of the UN during the late 1940s and some of its more recent activities, including possible reform; the CIA; the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962; US involvement in Vietnam in the 1960s and early 1970s; US involvement in the Middle East (particularly with respect to Israel, Iran, and Iraq); the imperial presidency (comparing Arthur Schlesinger Jr.'s celebrated 1973 book on the subject with the actions of the Bush 43 administration); and the foreign policy challenges of the Obama administration. JAMES B. SITRICK serves as Of Counsel to the international law firm of Baker &amp; McKenzie, which has offices in seventy cities in forty countries. He previously served as chairman and CEO of Coudert Brothers, the oldest international law firm in the United States. His government and NGO service includes extensive work for the Department of the Treasury in drafting international legislation and negotiating treaties with foreign countries. He has also served as secretary general of the World Federation of United Nations Associations. In addition, he serves as a trustee of many American and European cultural institutions, as well as on the Arts and Science Board of Overseers at NYU.  Is Karl Marx Still Relevant? FRSEM-UA 413 Instructor: Jeff Goodwin Wednesday, 3:30\u20136:10 p.m Required cohort meeting: Monday, 3:30\u20134:30 p.m. There was a time not so long ago when a critical engagement with the writings of Karl Marx was considered an obligatory intellectual and political rite of passage. No serious intellectual or political activist could not read Marx\u2014whether one ultimately accepted or rejected Marx\u2019s ideas, in whole or in part. Is this still true? Are Marx\u2019s ideas, or some of them, still relevant? Which of his ideas remain important or valuable for people who wish to understand\u2014and perhaps to change\u2014the contemporary world? Which of Marx\u2019s ideas are problematic or pass\u00e9? To address these questions, this seminar critically examines some of Marx\u2019s most important writings, including The Communist Manifesto , The German Ideology , The Civil War in France , and\u2014above all\u2014 Capital , Marx\u2019s magnum opus. In assessing the contemporary relevance of Marx\u2019s ideas, we also read several efforts by Marx\u2019s followers to understand a range of important phenomena, including the nature of the state, current US politics, and the ongoing economic crisis. JEFF GOODWIN is Professor of Sociology. He has written extensively about social movements, revolutions, and terrorism. His books include The Social Movements Reader ; Contention in Context ; Passionate Politics ; and No Other Way Out: States and Revolutionary Movements, 1945\u20131991 . He is currently writing a book about why states and rebels sometimes employ terrorism as a strategy. He is a winner of the College\u2019s Golden Dozen Award for Teaching Excellence.  Branding: People, Places, Things FRSEM-UA 422 Instructor: Richard L. Lewis Tuesday, 2:00-4:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Thursday, 3:30-4:30 p.m. Brands help us avoid making the same decisions over and over by building bridges of trust; it's reassuring that a visit to McDonald's is pretty much the same all around the world. Brands provide information, advice, smiles, and community, using a variety of rational and emotional tools to connect with us. Even brand owners are sometimes uncertain as to how their brand has cemented a relationship with an audience. This course analyzes what makes brands tick: how they're created, and how time, technology, distribution, competitors, and consumers force them to change. We also examine the dark side of brands' magnetism. Finally, we examine our budding, personal brands, or reputations, which is how our family, friends, enemies, teachers and bosses evaluate us. RICHARD L. LEWIS is an independent marketing consultant who solves business, branding, and strategic problems for companies, professionals, and individuals. He was the longtime Managing Director at TBWA/Chiat/Day, and has written two bestselling books about advertising. He has also taught at Yale College.  Trials of the Century FRSEM-UA 434 Instructor: Jack Ford  syllabus Monday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Wednesday, 3:30\u20134:30 p.m. How does a trial become viewed as a \u201ctrial of the century\u201d' What does that designation say about the crime and the personalities involved, about the legal, social, and political implications of the case, and about the nature and extent of the attendant media coverage? Since the trial of Socrates, the public has been intrigued, galvanized, and even entertained by the real drama of real trials, which often act as a prism through which society\u2019s strengths and weaknesses are revealed. This course offers in-depth examinations of select \u201ctrials of the century\u201d in the US, approaching each case from a specific angle, from celebrity (the Lindbergh kidnapping case and the trial of O.J. Simpson) to race (the trials of the Scottsboro Boys), politics (the Chicago Seven), and religion (the Scopes Monkey Trial). JACK FORD is an Emmy and Peabody Award-winning journalist, author, and nationally recognized trial attorney. Currently a CBS News Legal Analyst, he has had a distinguished career on network and cable television. As a litigator, he successfully handled a number of high-profile cases, such as the Northeast\u2019s first death-penalty trial; one of the nation\u2019s first corporate homicide cases; and the Wall Street insider-trading scandal of the late 1980s. He has also written articles for respected legal publications. The recipient of five honorary degrees in recognition of his professional accomplishments and his extensive public service, he has taught at, in addition to NYU, Yale College and Fordham Law School.  Frederick Douglass and the Transformative Life FRSEM-UA 435 Instructor: Philip Kunhardt  syllabus Thursday, 11:00 a.m.-1:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Tuesday, 11:00 a.m.-noon Note: conflicts with Physics I (Tuesday and Thursday 12:30-1:45 p.m.) Few figures in American history are as compelling or inspiring as the former-slave-turned-abolitionist-editor Frederick Douglass, whose eloquence and moral passion resonate still. A complex and at times conflicted figure, his life intersected with some of the most interesting and charged characters of his age, including Abraham Lincoln, Susan B. Anthony, William Lloyd Garrison, Harriet Tubman, John Brown, and many others. This seminar takes a deep and sustained look at the life and work of this American prophet. Students read a wide selection of his writings-now considered some of the most important and original of the 19th century-in addition to biographies and historical treatments, which open up vistas on the central issues of race and human freedom. We explore important questions in the light of Douglass's thinking: Is there a legitimate use of violence in the pursuit of noble ends? Does there exist, as Douglass believed, a force of progress in history? How do self-awareness, moral insight, and public eloquence undergird the effectiveness of a reformer? PHILIP KUNHARDT is Distinguished Scholar in Residence in the Humanities, and teaches history and biography in the College of Arts and Science. He focuses on the lives of transformative figures and has co-authored five books, including Looking for Lincoln , The American President , and P.T. Barnum: America's Greatest Showman .

History, Memory, and the Quest for Social Justice in the U.S. FRSEM-UA 437 Instructor: Jack Salzman   syllabus Monday, 11:00 a.m.-1:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Wednesday, 12:30-1:30 p.m. Note: conflicts with Experimental Physics I (Monday 11:00 a.m.-12:15 p.m.) This course explores the relationship between history and memory in the United States from the mid-20th century to the present. One of its primary objectives is to address the ethics of memory. Do we remember events not as they are but as we are? Do we have an obligation to remember events from the past? If we do, which events must we remember, and how do we remember those we did not experience? Or, as Marc Aug\u00e9 argues, is it essential for the health of the individual and of society that we know how to forget? Among the events, controversies, and We consider such events and issues as the response to the Holocaust; internment camps for Japanese Americans; racial segregation; the bombing of Dresden and Hiroshima; anticommunism; the Civil Rights Movement; the destruction of the World Trade Center, and genocides in Rwanda and Darfur. We address the role that museums, photography, film, and popular culture have in defining our individual and collective memory. JACK SALZMAN served as the Director of the Center for American Culture Studies at Columbia University and editor of Prospects: An Annual of American Cultural Studies . He is the Editor-in-Chief of the Encyclopedia of African American Culture and History . Much of his work has been devoted to the relationship between African Americans and American Jews, including Struggles in the Promised Land (with Cornel West) and Bridges and Boundaries , the catalog for an exhibition at the Jewish Museum in New York. He recently completed We Remember the Children , a collection of memoirs by Holocaust survivors. He is writing a book on the impact of the Holocaust on Jews and social justice in the US. Professor Salzman has received the Distinguished Teaching Award and two Fulbrights.  The Image of Business in American Literature FRSEM-UA 440 Instructor: Saul Rosenberg Monday, 4:55-7:25 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Friday, 12:30-1:30 p.m. Note: conflicts with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m.-1:45 p.m.). What is the relationship between virtue, material success, and happiness? This course asks how some of the most engaging American writers and filmmakers have treated the central ideas of business from the nation's founding to the present. How did the idea of \"doing well by doing good\" fare as the Republic grew? We examine classic mid-19th century writers' thoughts about \"getting and spending\" and reactions to the moral collapse inherent in the \"business\" of slavery. We observe how our theme fared with the emergence in the later 19th century of the \"robber barons,\" the rise of the corporation, and the enormous influx of immigrants. For the 20th century, we look at films Greed and Wall Street and novels such as The Great Gatsby and The Fountainhead . The course finishes with reflections on the recent financial crisis. SAUL ROSENBERG earned a PhD in American Literature from Columbia and degrees from Berkeley and Cambridge. In addition to teaching at NYU, he has taught American literature at Columbia University and the 92nd Street Y, and served as associate editor of Commentary magazine.

He writes regularly on books for the Wall Street Journal .  Wiseguys, Spies, and Private Eyes: Heroes and Villains in American Culture, Film, and Literature FRSEM-UA 449 Instructor: Eddy Friedfeld   syllabus Thursday, 4:55\u20137:25 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Tuesday, 3:30\u20134:30 p.m. This seminar explores the ways in which specific American archetypes and themes are perceived and articulated\u2014from the rugged Old West individualist, to the persevering underdog who becomes a boxing champ, to the Cold War\u2013era superspy. We examine representations of heroes and villains in modern American popular culture and how the great films and novels of three particular genres, the Detective, the Gangster, and the Spy, influenced our understanding of these archetypes. From the early influences of Hamlet and Macbeth to Sherlock Holmes, Raymond Chandler\u2019s Philip Marlowe, Mario Puzo\u2019s (and Francis Ford Coppola\u2019s) The Godfather , James Bond, and Batman, we look at the mythology and evolution of heroes and villains through popular and high culture icons, the genesis of the genres and how they developed over time, and how great directors, actors, and writers influenced audiences worldwide and were themselves influenced by culture and history. EDDY FRIEDFELD is a film and entertainment journalist and historian, as well as an attorney specializing in corporate restructuring. He is the co-author of Caesar\u2019s Hours with comedy legend Sid Caesar, and is working on a book on the history of comedy in America.

This course examines the intersection of ideas, politics, and action in cities in the US and around world, particularly those related to improving the urban environment. We study best practices, evaluate their effectiveness, and determine whether and how successful policies and programs can be replicated. This course asks students to not only think critically issues of public policy but also to think anew about the role they play in shaping it. Topics for student projects are drawn from current issues and problems facing decision-makers and elected officials in America today. ERIC GIOIA is an attorney with extensive experience in business, law, and government. He joined J.P. Morgan in January 2010 after serving for eight years on the New York City Council. Prior to serving on City Council, he practiced law at Milbank, Tweed, Hadley &amp; McCloy LLP, and served in the White House under President Bill Clinton. Professor Gioia holds a BA from New York University and a JD from Georgetown University Law Center.  Reading The Dream of the Red Chamber FRSEM-UA 461 Instructor: Jing Wang Monday, 3:30-6:10 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Wednesday, 3:30-4:30 p.m. Cao Xueqin's mid-18th century literary epic The Dream of the Red Chamber is widely regarded as the culmination of the vernacular novel of imperial China. With a tragic love story between two aristocratic teenagers at its dramatic center, it covers a vast terrain of culture and social life-the question of what is eternal and what is ephemeral; the nature of \"qing,\" as the heart of being that both animates and destroys life; individual talent and its fragility; and the decadence of the elite, as well as growing, if hidden, social and class tensions. The novel's manifold structure and intricate plot development, coupled with its dazzling array of memorable characters, makes it one of the most complex and colorful of all time. Note: Both reading and discussions are conducted in English. No knowledge of Chinese culture, language, or history is required or assumed. Native Chinese speakers who wish to read and enjoy this masterpiece in the original language are advised to choose a different Freshman Seminar and take Reading The Dream of the Red Chamber (EAST-UA 228) as an elective course in the future. Consult the CAS Bulletin for prerequisites. JING WANG is Assistant Research Scholar in the College of Arts and Science and the Department of East Asian Studies, where, from 1999 to 2006, she was Lecturer in Chinese. She is the editor and translator of Anthology of Short Stories by American Women Writers in the 1990's .

Political Cinema and Representation of the \"Other\" FRSEM-UA 463 Instructor: Shimon Dotan Friday, 9:30 a.m.-noon Required cohort meeting: Friday, 12:30-1:30 p.m. Note: conflicts with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m.-1:45 p.m.) and with Advanced Chemistry I recitation (Friday, 11:00 a.m.-12:15 p.m.). In contemporary war, \"the other\" is viewed not only as an enemy to be fought but often, as one to be eliminated. How do filmmakers fight against (or alternately, reinforce) such deadly representations? In exploring various cinematic and thematic elements we will primarily focus on films from one of the world's most conflict-ridden regions\u2014the Middle East. We will also explore films from Russia, Germany, France and the US. Through readings and film screenings, we will investigate how \"the other\" is constructed politically, aesthetically and ethically. This class is designed for anyone interested in filmmaking and film criticism, contemporary politics and history, cinema of conflict and violence, and the ethical questions associated with them. SHIMON DOTAN, a Fellow of the New York Institute of the Humanities at NYU, is an award-winning filmmaker with thirteen feature films to his credit. His films have received the Silver Bear Award at the Berlin Film Festival ( The Smile of the Lamb ), numerous Israeli Academy Awards, including Best Film and Best Director ( Repeat Dive; The Smile of the Lamb ), and Best Film at the Newport Beach Film Festival ( You Can Thank Me Later ). His film Hot House won the Special Jury Prize at Sundance in 2007.

New Media, Activism, and Social Change FRSEM-UA 465 Instructor: Arely Zimmerman Wednesday, 2:00-4:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Monday, 2:00-3:00 p.m. This class explores the uses of networked communication to mobilize civic, political, and social movement participation. Students explore the opportunities and limits of digital activism in transforming social inequalities, fostering social connectivity, and deepening democratic citizenship. We problematize how race, class, gender, generation, and other categories of difference shape digital media literacy and access, and how marginalized communities overcome barriers to online digital participation. While we focus primarily on immigrant rights and other social justice movements in the U.S., we also use comparative cases from across the globe to compare and contrast how new media is reshaping the way people engage in politics, form and express political and civic identities, organize across borders, and act collectively. ARELY ZIMMERMAN holds a PhD in Political Science from the University of California (Los Angeles), with specializations in political theory and race and ethnic politics. Her work examines social movements and immigrant rights activism through the lens of democratic theory. Her current book project, Contesting Citizenship: Central Americans and the Politics of Belonging Across Borders , outlines a framework of citizenship in contexts of transnational exclusion through a case study of US Central American communities and their struggles for legalization. She is concurrently working on new research in the areas of youth, second generation Latino/a civic engagement, and new media.  What is College For? FRSEM-UA 474 Instructor: Trace Jordan  syllabus Wednesday, 2:00-4:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Monday, 2:00-3:00 p.m. Why did you decide to attend college? To broaden your intellectual horizons and become a more open-minded person? To gain specialized knowledge? To achieve a more successful and financially rewarding career? To make new friends? To become an engaged participant in a democratic society? To satisfy your parents' plans for your future? Or perhaps some combination of these reasons that you are still figuring out? This seminar examines historical and contemporary discussions about the personal and social goals of higher education and studies issues that have the potential to profoundly transform the college experience in coming years. It also prompts students to be more reflective and purposeful about their own academic choices at NYU. TRACE JORDAN is Clinical Professor and Associate Director of the College Core Curriculum. His research interests and publications include the role of science education in a liberal arts curriculum, the use of computer simulations for teaching and learning chemistry, and the impact of interest and motivation on educational engagement and achievement.

Gender, Sexuality and the Law FRSEM-UA 480 Instructor: Shelley Fischel Monday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Wednesday, 3:30\u20134:30 p.m. What impact has law had on gender and sexuality inequalities? What impact could or should law have? This course explores gender and sexuality discrimination in American jurisprudence as it has developed under the Constitution as well as its consequences in spheres of work, politics, and social life. We address such matters as marriage and divorce law, the Civil Rights Act and Title IX, and the unique, perhaps troubling ways that criminal law treats crimes associated with sexuality, rape, domestic abuse, and sexuality orientation. We also address the intersection of these matters with issues of gender identity and sexual orientation. This course offers a history of US sex law and analyzes contemporary doctrinal, judicial and legislative developments. SHELLEY D. FISCHEL served as Executive Vice President of Home Box Office, Inc., responsible for Human Resources, Facilities and Real Estate, as well as labor law matters, until her retirement in December 2009. She oversaw all sexual discrimination claims in the company. She received her JD from Columbia University and her LLM from NYU.  Global Citizenship: Theory and Practice FRSEM-UA 484 Instructor: Ulrich Baer Monday, 2:00-4:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Wednesday, 3:30-4:30 p.m. The seminar explores the notion and practice of global citizenship-the capacity and willingness to think across and beyond actual and imagined boundaries, and to develop skills that can solve problems and explore opportunities in unfamiliar contexts. The course examines globalization as a historical, economic, and cultural phenomenon. Topics include local resistance to global homogeneity; the notion of universal humanism; human rights; the role of language in global contexts; the idea of citizenship; the specificity of culture and arts; the idea of film or photography as universal languages; and an exploration of New York City as an international city that has turned its diversity into strength. The seminar brings in guest speakers who identify as global citizens, and asks students to consider how their own actions-ranging from activism to business leadership-may have an impact on those outside their immediate world. ULRICH BAER, Vice Provost of Arts, Humanities and Multicultural Affairs and Professor of Comparative Literature and German, was awarded the College's Golden Dozen Award for Excellence in Teaching in 1998 and 2004.

He has also published widely on photography and has co-taught a seminar entitled \"Archive, Image, Text\" with Professor Shelley Rice from the Tisch School of the Ar ts.  Propaganda Portraits: Royal Imagery in the Age of Absolutism FRSEM-UA 488 Instructor: William Ambler Wednesday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m Required cohort meeting: Monday, 2:00\u20133:00 p.m. This course studies the relationship between art and politics in European baroque state portraiture. In the 17th century, with few means to reach a broad populace, depictions of the king played a central part in convincing the people of a monarch\u2019s legitimate authority. The most talented artists of the age glorified their kings in ways that gave visual form to political theories that justified increasingly centralized royal rule. We set the portraits in the context of debates that preoccupied the European courts of the time: the Reformation; the dynastic ambitions of European royal houses; and political theories of legitimate government. We also consider the position of artists at a royal court and preexisting traditions of royal imagery. WILLIAM AMBLER is an independent art historian with expertise in Spanish baroque art and eighteenth-century English architecture. He has been a curator at the Hispanic Society of America in New York City and has participated in exhibitions there, as well as at the Metropolitan Museum, Jewish Museum, and Federal Reserve in Washington, D.C.  The Cultural Nature of Language FRSEM-UA 496 Instructor: Bambi Schieffelin Wednesday, 2:00-4:45 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Monday, 2:00-3:00 p.m. From accents, pronouns, swearing, and spelling, how one uses language is never value-free. In this seminar we examine language-using as a social practice, and analyze how speakers and their language(s) are evaluated and regulated across a range of contexts and cultures. Starting with how children learn to talk, or don't (e.g., feral children), we examine speech and silence across a range of societies. We look at popular attitudes toward language and the practices by which people regulate its use in the media (e.g., political correctness), in legal and educational institutions (e.g., \"English Only\"), and in multilingual cities (e.g., Barcelona, Montreal) in order to understand how ideas about language are often recruited to non-linguistic concerns, such as who should be included and who excluded. In thinking about the cultural nature of language in this way, we critically explore issues of identity and authority. BAMBI SCHIEFFELIN is Collegiate Professor and Professor of Anthropology. A linguistic anthropologist, she is the author of The Give and Take of Everyday Life: Language Socialization of Kaluli Children and co-editor of, among other books, The Acquisition of Literacy: Ethnographic Perspectives ; Language Ideologies: Practice and Theory ; and Consequences of Contact . She has also published articles in the preeminent journals of her field. She is completing a book on the impact of Christianity on the language and social life of Bosavi people of Papua New Guinea over the past twenty-five years, and continues research on linguistic creativity and change as evidenced in computer-mediated communication such as IM. Professor Schieffelin received the College's Golden Dozen Award for Teaching Excellence in 2010.  How We See FRSEM-UA 497 Instructor: Marisa Carrasco  syllabus Thursday, 9:30 a.m.-noon Required cohort meeting: Tuesday, 11:00 a.m.-noon Do we see the world the way we do because we are the way we are or because the world is the way it is? This course looks at what we know about vision from multiple scientific perspectives: perceptual psychology tells us about the process of seeing, and provides important insights into the workings of visual mechanisms; neuropsychology shows us what happens to perception when these mechanisms malfunction; neuroscience tells us about processes at the level of cells and neural systems. At the same time, we discuss modes and techniques of scientific inquiry from these different perspectives. How do vision scientists learn? What kinds of experiments do they conduct? How has the development of new neuroimaging techniques (fMRI, for example) shaped the field? MARISA CARRASCO is Collegiate Professor and Professor of Psychology and Neural Science, as well as a former Chairperson of the Department of Psychology. Born and raised in Mexico City, she received her licentiate in psychology from the National University of Mexico and her PhD in psychology (cognition and perception) from Princeton University. She conducts research in cognitive neuroscience, exploring the relation between the psychological and neural mechanisms involved in visual perception and attention. Her papers have been published in the leading scientific journals in the field, and she has won numerous prestigious awards and fellowships throughout her career, such as an American Association of University Women Fellowship, a National Young Investigator Award from the National Science Foundation, a Cattell Fellowship, and a Guggenheim Fellowship.  The New Worlds of Work and Care FRSEM-UA 500 Instructor: Kathleen Gerson   syllabus Wednesday, 3:30\u20136:00 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Monday, 3:30\u20134:30 p.m. The early 21st century represents a period of immense social change in both the public world of work and the private world of family care. New technologies have blurred the boundary between home and work. New opportunities and pressures have sent more women into the workplace. The \u201cnew economy\u201d has created jobs with more short-term flexibility, but less long-term security. And new options in intimate relationships have created more diverse and voluntary, but less predictable, family bonds. These intertwined shifts are reshaping the daily lives and life pathways of American women and men. This seminar addresses several questions: What does an overview of changes in work, family, and gender patterns tell us about where we are now and where we are going? What are the major dilemmas created by these changes, and how are people coping with these conflicts? What are the implications for the future? And what can we do to enhance the opportunities and limit the insecurities of these new social arrangements? KATHLEEN GERSON, Collegiate Professor and Professor of Sociology, is a recognized authority on the connections among gender, work, and family life in postindustrial societies. She has held visiting positions at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences at Stanford University, the Russell Sage Foundation in New York City, and the Center for the Study of Status Passages in the Life Course at Bremen University, Germany and has won numerous prestigious prizes for her scholarly work. Her books include The Unfinished Revolution: Coming of Age in a New Era of Gender, Work, and Family ; The Time Divide: Family, Work, and Gender Inequality (with Jerry A. Jacobs); No Man\u2019s Land: Men\u2019s Changing Commitments to Family and Work ; and Hard Choices: How Women Decide About Work, Career, and Motherhood .  Frontiers of Biology FRSEM-UA 502 Instructor: Edo Kussell  syllabus Tuesday, 3:30-6:00 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Thursday, 3:30-4:30 p.m. Prerequisites: Both AP Biology 4 or 5 (or equivalent international credential) and at least one additional AP science (or mathematics) score of 4 or 5 (or equivalent international credential). This seminar focuses on the latest discoveries in biology and the technological innovations that enable them. Through a combination of readings, lectures, and discussions, the seminar leapfrogs classical textbook biology and mere memorization to present science at the forefront of biological research. Topics that may be covered (always in great depth and detail) include metagenomics, synthetic biology, quantitative immunology, microbial ecology, and biology at the single-molecule level. Emphasis is placed on understanding how the scientific research process works in today's world. Students contribute on a weekly basis to an on-line science blog: http://www.frontiersofbiology.org . This demanding course is geared towards highly motivated individuals, with a superlative high school background in science and a deep passion for scientific inquiry, but is open to students in all majors. EDO KUSSELL is Associate Professor of Biology and Physics, and a faculty member in the Center for Genomics and Systems Biology at NYU.

His research is on evolutionary dynamics in general, with a focus on microorganisms, and his lab studies bacterial adaptations to fluctuating environments, combining mathematical modeling, physics, and experimental biology.  In Search of Lost Time FRSEM-UA 503 Instructor: Marcelle Clements   syllabus Thursday, 2:00\u20134:45 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Tuesday, 2:00\u20133:00 p.m. We read Marcel Proust (in translation) as he should be read: hedonistically\u2014with respect and admiration but also with delectation. At more than 4,000 pages, In Search of Lost Time is one of modern literature\u2019s most challenging and pleasurable reads, still unparalleled in how it combines finesse and wit with raw emotion, self-examination with social history, and psychological acuity with a portrait of the French beau monde at the outset of modernity. Though Proust (1871\u20131922) is often cited as France\u2019s greatest novelist, many readers never move past the first fifty pages of his novel, reading the same gorgeous sentences again and again. However, as its architecture cannot be appreciated until it has been read once in its entirety, we move at a brisk pace through all six volumes; when we read the final volume, we can begin to understand the extraordinarily intimate relationship Proust has created with his reader. In-class creative writing exercises are designed to help with the reading and to expand an expressive, personal response. Reading assignments average 350 pages per week. MARCELLE CLEMENTS is Collegiate Professor and Fellow of the New York Institute for the Humanities at NYU. She is the author of a collection of essays, The Dog Is Us and Other Observations , a book of nonfiction, The Improvised Woman , and two novels, Rock Me and, most recently, Midsummer . Her prizewinning articles and essays on the arts, culture, and politics have appeared in many national publications.  American Wars, Past and Present: Vietnam, Iraq (I and II), Afghanistan FRSEM-UA 504 Instructor: Marilyn B. Young   syllabus Friday, 9:30 a.m.-noon Required cohort meeting: Tuesday, 3:30-4:30 p.m. Note: conflicts with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m.-1:45 p.m.) and with Advanced Chemistry I recitation (Friday, 11:00 a.m.-12:15 p.m.). This course considers the last two major wars of the 20th century and the first two wars of the 21st. It begins with the history and memory of the Vietnam War. We then move on to examine Gulf War I (Operation Desert Storm), which was shaped by how the administration of George H.W. Bush understood the Vietnam War. The subsequent war in Iraq (Operation Iraqi Freedom) can be understood in part in terms of what some policymakers believed to be the unfinished business of Gulf War I, yet it, too, was fought in the shadow of Vietnam analogies. Finally, in terms of tactics and goals, the war in Afghanistan, launched in response to 9/11, has been shaped by all three of the preceding wars. We examine these wars through primary documents and secondary sources as well as the documentary and fiction film in which they have been represented. The overarching concern of the seminar is the ongoing haunting of American politics\u2014military and civilian\u2014by a war fought over three decades ago. There are two connected questions: Can history teach? What does it teach? MARILYN B. YOUNG, Collegiate Professor and Professor of History, is a former Chair of the History Department. Her teaching and her writing focus on U.S. foreign policy. Her books include The Vietnam Wars, 1945-1990 and The Rhetoric of Empire: American China Policy, 1895-1901 .

She was Director of the Project on the Cold War as a Global Conflict at NYU's International Center for Advanced Study from 2001 to 2004 and served as President of the Society of Historians of American Foreign Relations in 2011. She has been the recipient of a Guggenheim Fellowship and of an American Council of Learned Societies Fellowship, and has won the College's Golden Dozen Award for Teaching Excellence twice. She is currently Co-Director of the Tamiment Center on the Cold War.  Helen of Troy and Her Ghosts FRSEM-UA 505 Instructor: Liana Theodoratou Tuesday, 3:30-6:00 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Thursday, 3:30-4:30 p.m. In Homer's Iliad , Helen, reflecting on her destiny, proclaims that her function is not primarily to be a woman, but to be first and foremost a story: \"On us the gods have set an evil destiny,\" she explains, \"that we should be a singer's theme / for generations to come\" (Il.6.357-58). Taking its point of departure from the Helen of ancient Greece-the daughter of Zeus and Leda-this course traces the various Helens whose stories have been told throughout the history of Western literature-from the Helen of Homer to that of Sappho, Aeschylus, Euripides, Pierre de Ronsard, Christopher Marlowe, J.G.W. Goethe, Jean Giraudoux, W.B.Yeats, Paul Val\u00e9ry, Yannis Ritsos, and beyond. Tracing this history will permit us to think about the survival of the past in the present, about the role and place of representation in the establishment of identity in general, and about the way in which the present is haunted by the phantoms of the past. LIANA THEODORATOU is Clinical Professor and Director of the Alexander S. Onassis Program in Hellenic Studies and Director of the NYU in Athens Program. She is a recipient of the College's Outstanding Teaching Award and of its Golden Dozen Award for Teaching Excellence. She has written widely on ancient and modern Greek poetry and has translated several works by, among others, Foucault, Althusser, and Derrida into Modern Greek. She is currently completing a book on the politics of mourning in contemporary Greek poetry, entitled Mourning Becomes Greece .  Game Theory and the Humanities FRSEM-UA 506 Instructor: Steven J. Brams   syllabus Wednesday, 4:55-7:25 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Monday, 3:30-4:30 p.m. Game theory is a mathematical theory of strategy that has been applied to the analysis of conflict and cooperation in such fields as economics, political science, and biology. In this seminar, we discuss more unusual applications-to history, literature, philosophy, the Bible, theology, and law. We discuss Abraham's decision to offer his son Isaac for sacrifice; the choices made by accused witches and their persecutors in medieval witch trials; Lady Macbeth's incitement of her husband to murder King Duncan in Shakespeare's play; several strategic games played by presidents and their antagonists in domestic crises (e.g., the Civil War) and international crises (e.g., the Cuban missile crisis), and coping mechanisms used by characters in catch-22 games (including those in Joseph Heller's novel Catch-22). Prerequisite: No mathematical background beyond high school mathematics is assumed, but a willingness to learn and apply sophisticated reasoning to analyze the interactions of players in games is essential . STEVEN J. BRAMS is Professor of Politics at NYU. He is the author of several books-most recently, Mathematics and Democracy and Game Theory and the Humanities -that apply game theory and social choice theory to voting and elections, bargaining and fairness, international relations, and the Bible, theology and literature. He holds two patents for fair-division algorithms and is Chairman of the Advisory Board of Fair Outcomes, Inc., and a former president of the Peace Science Society and of the Public Choice Society. He is an American Association for the Advancement of Science Fellow and was a Guggenheim Fellow and Visiting Scholar at the Russell Sage Foundation.  Writing the Self and New York FRSEM-UA 520 Instructor: David J. Dent Tuesday, 3:30\u20136:00 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Thursday, 3:30\u20134:30 p.m. Students begin the semester by dusting off their college admissions essay. In our first exercise, we push beyond the boundary of the personal essay to expand it into a piece of narrative nonfiction. For the rest of the semester, students explore New York through a series of writing assignments on urban life designed to sharpen their skills in social and cultural analysis and writing. Students read classic pieces of literary nonfiction, personal essays and fiction about life in New York. DAVID J. DENT is Associate Professor of Journalism and Social and Cultural Analysis at NYU. His book In Search of Black America was a New York Times Notable Book of 2000. He has written for the New York Times , Playboy , GQ , Salon , and the Washington Post among others, and blogs at www.bushobamaamerica.com (which he founded).

He and his wife Valerie are co-founders and directors of www.writeforthefuture.com, which uses the tools of journalism to help middle and high school students become better writers.  Race and Culture in Brazil FRSEM-UA 536 Instructor: Dylon Robbins Monday, 3:30-6:00 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Friday, 12:30-1:30 p.m. Note: conflicts with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m.-1:45 p.m). Brazil is often invoked in conversations about race and culture, held up as an example for its presumably more egalitarian race relations, considered the embodiment of an exceptional fusion of African, Indigenous, and European elements and a model for understanding heterogeneity and difference. And yet it is also a nation frequently cited for its incidence of violence and extreme economic inequality. This seminar explores some of the unique contradictions shaping Brazilian reality. We trace the history of race relations in the ongoing transformation of Brazilian culture, looking at key social, political, and economic factors such as slavery and the plantation economy, popular music, Carnival, populism, racial democracy, affirmative action, and urban and rural violence. How do race and culture coincide and diverge in Brazil? And what may we gather about these convergences and divergences from textual, musical, and cinematic examples? DYLON ROBBINS is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Spanish and Portuguese. He teaches courses on Brazil and the Caribbean, with particular emphasis on the cultural and theoretical production of these regions and their place in the African Diaspora. With support from a Fulbright-Hays Fellowship, he undertook research in Brazil at the Cinemateca Brasileira and the Instituto de Estudos Brasileiros and, in Cuba, at the ICAIC, the Biblioteca Nacional, and the Casa de las Am\u00e9ricas. Professor Robbins is currently completing his book manuscript on popular music and political subjectivity in Brazil.  Pirates, Privateers and Other Maritime Renegades of the Caribbean FRSEM-UA 538 Instructor: Edgardo Morales Tuesday, 9:30 a.m.-12:00 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Thursday, 9:30-10:30 a.m. Today,   the Jolly Roger\u2014the pirate flag\u2014is displayed on toys and makes for   compelling cinema. In real life, however, flying that flag was a   criminal act punishable with the death penalty. This course is about the   pirates, privateers and runaways of the early modern Caribbean, who   fought, stole, lied and killed in order to make a living and either to   collaborate with or oppose bosses and empires. We use the history of   maritime renegades as an opportunity to develop historical research and   writing skills, and to help us think critically about topics that might   otherwise escape scholarly inquiry, for while outsiders often described   them as mere villains, privateers like Francis Drake, pirates like Anne   Bonny, or runaway slaves like Tom King lived at the very center of the   important political questions of their age. Students read original   documents from the 16th, 17th, and 18th centuries as well as   contemporary historical scholarship. EDGARDO PEREZ MORALES   teaches at NYU's Center for Latin American and Caribbean Studies. He   graduated with a PhD in history from the University of Michigan and has   conducted research on privateers during the Age of Revolutions in   archives and libraries in Colombia, Cuba, France, Jamaica, Spain and the   United States.  Facing Fascism: The Spanish Civil War and U.S. Culture FRSEM-UA 539 Instructor: James D. Fernandez Monday, 11:00 a.m.-1:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Wednesday, 11:00 a.m.-noon Note: conflicts with Experimental Physics I (Monday 11:00 a.m.-12:15 p.m.) Prerequisites: 4 or 5 in AP Spanish or reported 4 or 5 in either AP U.S. History or AP World History (or international equivalent). The Great Depression. Liberal democracy in crisis. On the rise: a spectrum of ideologies ranging from anarchism to fascism, promising solutions to the afflictions of people all over the planet. July 1936: a right-wing military coup attempts to overthrow a democratically elected left-wing coalition government in Spain, and war begins. This course explores the place occupied by Spain and the Spanish Civil War in American culture from the 1930s forward; how journalists, writers, artists, and citizens reacted to the war; and how the legacy of the war has affected U.S. culture over the last 70 years. It also introduces students to research methods in history and culture, as they carry out a major archival research project based on unique sources in NYU's Abraham Lincoln Brigade Archives (ALBA), a vast collection of materials that chronicles the lives of the 2,800 Americans who, between 1936 and 1939, volunteered to fight fascism in Spain. JAMES D. FERN\u00c1NDEZ is Associate Professor in the Department of Spanish and Portuguese. His research interests include the literature, history, and culture of modern Spain; autobiography; cultural relations between Spain and Latin America; and visions of Spain in the United States. He served as the Director of NYU's King Juan Carlos I of Spain Center from 1995 to 2007 and as Chairperson of the Department of Spanish and Portuguese from 2003 to 2007. He is the Vice-Chairperson of the Board of Governors of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade Archives. He is the author of Apology to Apostrophe: Autobiography and the Rhetoric of Self-Representation in Spain and co-editor of the essay collection Facing Fascism: New York and the Spanish Civil War .  In Their Own Words: Oral History and Irish New York FRSEM-UA 540 Instructor: Linda Dowling Almeida  syllabus Tuesday, 9:30 a.m.\u2013noon Required cohort meeting: Thursday, 9:30\u201310:30 a.m. This interdisciplinary course focuses on oral history as a resource for understanding the 20th-century history of the Irish in America, particularly in New York. With access to the 300-plus interviews in Glucksman Ireland House's Oral History collection, students explore the discipline of oral history as it has progressed over the last twenty years and develop their own research, writing and interviewing skills. The course demonstrates how oral history gives life to ethnic communities like those of Irish longshoremen, personalizes dramatic events like 9/11, and provides insight into Irish American literature. In addition to reading traditional texts, we work with digital maps, walk the streets of the communities we study, and screen documentaries. LINDA DOWLING ALMEIDA, Adjunct Assistant Professor of Irish Studies at NYU\u2019s Glucksman Ireland House, teaches classes in the history and literature of Irish America. Her book Irish Immigrants in New York City, 1945-1995 (2001) compares the experience of the Irish who arrived in the 1950s with that of their counterparts thirty and forty years later. Professor Almeida has published chapters in The Irish World Wide (1992), Ireland in the 1950s (2004), and Making the Irish American (2006) and delivered papers on pedagogical approaches to oral history to both the Oral History Association and the International Oral History Association. Her latest project involves the production of podcasts on a variety of themes and issues drawn from the archives. Conspiracy Theories: Paranoid Fictions Before and After Freud FRSEM-UA 541 Instructor: Eliot Borenstein  syllabus Wednesday, 9:30 a.m.\u2013noon Required cohort meeting: Monday, 11:00 a.m.\u2013noon Note: conflicts with Principles of Biology I (Monday and Wednesday 9:30\u201310:45 a.m.) and with Introductory Experimental Physics I (Monday, 11:00 a.m.\u201312:15 p.m.). Conspiracy theories are intricate attempts to impose rational order on increasingly chaotic systems, all through the vehicle of narrative. They are explanatory myths but, unlike many creation stories, they deal with demiurges rather than full-fledged gods, seeking to show how dark forces have ruined a preexisting world, rather than inventing a world whole-cloth. In this course, we read narratives that both exemplify and explore the modernist and postmodernist paranoid mindset. Our readings consist primarily of novels and short stories, but also include works of literary and psychological theory, as well as case studies in the rise and fall of particular conspiracy theories. ELIOT BORENSTEIN, Collegiate Professor and Professor of Russian and Slavic Studies, has served as Chairperson of the Department of Russian &amp; Slavic Studies and as Director of the College Core Curriculum. Before coming to NYU in 1995, he directed the Fulbright Program in the Russian Federation and taught at the University of Virginia. His first book, Men without Women: Masculinity and Revolution in Russian Fiction, 1917-1919 , won the AATSEEL award for best work in literary scholarship in 2000. In 2007, he published Overkill: Sex and Violence in Contemporary Russian Popular Culture , which received the AWSS award for best book in Slavic Gender Studies in 2008. Recently, he was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship to finish the companion volume, Catastrophe of the Week: Apocalyptic Entertainment in Post-Soviet Russia . He is a two-time recipient of the College's Golden Dozen Award for Teaching Excellence.  Anthropology and Literature of the Other FRSEM-UA 542 Instructor: Thomas Beidelman Monday, 12:30\u20133:00 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Wednesday, 12:30\u20131:30 p.m. This course considers the central problem in social anthropology and history: the translation of the beliefs and practices of societies different from our own in place or time (or both) into words we can understand. How can we comprehend the world of the ancient Greeks through a translation of Homer? How can we be sure that we grasp what the King James Bible \u201creally\u201d means, when we are five centuries removed from its translation (in seventeenth-century monarchical England) from the even more remote Hebrew and Greek? We begin and end the course with translations in an African context: an anthropologist\u2019s account of her effort to translate Hamlet to the Ghanaians she was studying, and two interconnected novels by Chinua Achebe that raise profound questions of identity, meaning, and displacement. T. O. BEIDELMAN is Professor of Anthropology at NYU. He is the author of many books and articles on the anthropology and history of Africa, social theory, religion, symbolism and colonialism. His most recent books are The Culture of Colonialism (2012) and The Cool Knife (1997). He is presently working on a book on how Homer may be used to teach introductory anthropology. He is the recipient of the College\u2019s Golden Dozen Award for Teaching Excellence and the Herskovits Prize for the best American book on Africa published in the social sciences. He has a D. Phil. from Trinity College, Oxford University.  The Wild Child FRSEM-UA 543 Instructor: Patricia Crain   syllabus Thursday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Tuesday, 2:00\u20133:00 p.m. Childhood as Western culture has imagined it since the 18th century is full of paradoxes: sequestered, protected, and schooled, yet free, creative, and imaginative. As this child of modernity was being invented, another child came into being: the so-called \u201cwild\u201d or \u201cferal\u201d child, without parents or language, emerging on the margins of society, an object of fear and fascination, of scientific investigation and artistic imaginings. This seminar explores notable 19th-century feral child cases\u2014Victor of Aveyron and Kaspar Hauser\u2014and the contemporary documents that introduced them. We try to understand the cultural significance of the wild child and consider why this figure has drawn the attention of novelists, playwrights, and filmmakers, across historical and national borders. What does the wild child allow art to explore and reflect upon? What does the wild child have to say about constructions of modern childhood and of gender, race, and sexuality? PATRICIA CRAIN is Associate Professor of English. She is the award-winning author of The Story of A: The Alphabetization of America from The New England Primer to The Scarlet Letter , as well as of articles on the history of childhood and the history of literacy in America. Her current project is a study of the child reader in the 19thcentury US. She has also taught at Princeton University and at the University of Minnesota-Twin Cities  Harems and Court Cultures FRSEM-UA 544 Instructor: Leslie Peirce  syllabus Thursday, 3:30-6:00 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Tuesday, 3:30-4:30 p.m. Everyone knows the stereotype of harems, but this course studies them as an important historical phenomenon widespread in time and space. Although sometimes merely sexual objects or vehicles for biological reproduction, women living in harems and royal courts typically enjoyed a society of their own that was often highly developed culturally. They might, moreover, wield considerable power\u2014political, economic and artistic. While this course focuses principally on females, it is almost as much about males; for example, their own gendered spaces and cultures and their relationships with harem and court women. Studying harems informs us about social formations, expressions of political power, shifting conceptions of gender, and the ways in which women's separation and seclusion from males has been used in history to distinguish elites from ordinary people. The course focuses principally on the Near East, but includes extensive comparison with European and East Asian court and harem cultures. LESLIE PEIRCE, Silver Professor and Professor of History and Middle Eastern Studies, is an authority on the history and culture of the Ottoman Empire. She is the author of the prize-winning books Morality Tales: Law and Gender in the Ottoman Court of Aintab (2003) and The Imperial Harem: Women and Sovereignty in the Ottoman Empire (1993) and many scholarly articles. The focus of her current research is captivity and enslavement in the early-modern Eurasian region; she is writing a biography of a Russian slave who became concubine, then queen, of the sultan Suleyman the Magnificent.  Media and Communication in the Middle Ages FRSEM-UA 545 Instructor: Brigitte M. Bedos-Rezak   syllabus Tuesday, 2:00-4:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Thursday, 2:00-3:00 p.m. Medieval tools of communication and methods of transportation circulated news, rumors, propaganda, and revolutionary ideas; permitted contact with the supernatural; equipped governments with bureaucratic powers of local subjugation and global interaction; enabled people to travel far away from their homes on pilgrimages, diplomatic missions, entertainment tours (jongleurs, troubadours), commercial ventures, explorations, and conquests. With a focus on Western Europe, we consider modes and means of communication: languages, speech and writing, gestures, fashions, rituals, images, artifacts, and maps. Assessing the breadth of medieval mobility will elucidate a pre-modern world-system that extended across Eurasia, including the Mongol Empire, the Middle East, and China. BRIGITTE M. BEDOS-REZAK is Professor of History at NYU. Trained in France at the Sorbonne and at the \u00c9cole nationale des Chartes (Paris), her teaching and research interests cover medieval Europe, in particular its urban life and secular elites. She is particularly interested in the ways that increasingly material communicative practices shaped concepts of identity. Select publications include Les sceaux de villes (1980); When Ego was Imago: Signs of Identity in the Middle Ages (2010); \"Semiotic Anthropology: The Twelfth-Century Experiment,\" in European Transformations 950-1200 (2011); and \"Mutually Contextual: Materials, Bodies, and Objects,\" in Cultural Histories of the Material World (2013).  Travel and Communication in the Ancient World FRSEM-UA 546 Instructor: Raffaella Cribiore   syllabus Monday, 3:30-6:00 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Wednesday, 3:30\u20134:30 p.m This course explores traveling, communicating, and spreading news in antiquity. Unlike moderns, the ancients did not travel for leisure, and the notion of travel as \u201croutine\u201d would have been foreign to them; their journeys had mythic and epic significance and took place under precarious conditions. Likewise, whereas today we are able to communicate with each other in multiple convenient ways, sending letters and messages in the Greek and Roman worlds was cumbersome and time-intensive. Nonetheless, people did get in touch with each other and exchange news. Indeed, one of the goals of the course is to question what might be called a \u201cprogressive model\u201d of understanding communication(s) that automatically assumes the superiority of modern technology. RAFFAELLA CRIBIORE is Professor of Classics and an expert on education in antiquity. Her publications include Writing, Teachers and Students in Greco-Roman Egypt ; Gymnastics of the Mind: Greek Education in Hellenistic and Roman Egypt , which won the Goodwin Prize in 2003; and Women\u2019s Letters from Ancient Egypt, 300BC-AD 800 (with Roger Bagnall). Her most recent book, The School of Libanius in Late Antique Antioch , is the study of an elite school of rhetoric in Syria. Great Science, Fabulous Science, and Voodoo Science FRSEM-UA 547 Instructor: Allen Mincer   syllabus Wednesday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Monday, 2:00\u20133:00 p.m. Science is often portrayed as following a very clearly-defined set of procedures: start with a hypothesis, do an experiment and, based on the results, reject the hypothesis or adopt it as a working assumption. The actual process, however, is rarely so straightforward. In addition, the stories as usually told or recorded may differ from what really happened. For most of the semester, we study some famous, some lesser known, and some infamous experiments, mainly in the physical sciences, selected to illustrate intellectual tours de force, sloppiness, error, self-deception, and fraud, and the sometimes murky boundaries between them. Along the way, issues such as the discarding of \u201cfaulty data,\u201d theoretical bias, and probabilistic tools for hypothesis acceptance and rejection are discussed. In the latter part of the semester, we discuss how scientific ideas are evaluated by the media, in the courtroom, and in government. To take this course, students should have had high school chemistry, physics, and calculus. ALLEN MINCER, Collegiate Professor and Professor of Physics, specializes in experimental particle physics and particle astrophysics. He is currently a member of the ATLAS collaboration, which is studying the nature of the elementary building blocks of matter at the CERN Large Hadron Collider in Geneva, Switzerland. His research at NYU has a long, continuous history of generous support by grants from the National Science Foundation. He is co-author of approximately 400 scientific publications, including the discovery of the top quark with the D-Zero collaboration and the discovery of a particle consistent with the Standard Model Higgs Boson with the ATLAS Collaboration. In addition to teaching in the Physics Department, he has taught in the Steinhardt School\u2019s Department of Teaching and Learning, been involved in research in physics education, and has twice been awarded the College\u2019s Golden Dozen Award for Teaching Excellence. The Problem of Beauty FRSEM-UA 550 Instructor: G. Gabrielle Starr  syllabus Tuesday, 2:00-4:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Thursday, 3:30-4:30 p.m. What is beauty for? It is common in many circumstances to think of beauty as \"merely\" beautiful-something nice to have, but an unnecessary add-on to what really matters. This hasn't always been the case. Beauty has played an important part in philosophy, ethics and theology, and now it is playing an increasingly interesting role in biology, neuroscience, social policy and design. But what is beauty, anyway? And why should we care? This course explores the role of beauty across a variety of disciplines and across \"long time\" (not just the period from the ancient world to the present, but even the long time of evolution). G. GABRIELLE STARR is Professor of English and Seryl Kushner Dean of the College of Arts and Science. She has published widely on eighteenth-century British literature and the history of the aesthetic. With collaborators in NYU's Center for Neural Science, she has pursued research in the field of neuroaesthetics and published the results in Frontiers in Human Neuroscience . In addition, Dean Starr has just published a book entitled Feeling Beauty: Aesthetic Experience in the Brain and Across the Arts .  Renewal and Expansion in 12th-Century Europe FRSEM-UA 558 Instructor: Jill N. Claster   syllabus Thursday, 2:00-4:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Tuesday, 2:00-3:00 p.m. The 12th century in Europe was a period of astonishing change and creativity, as peace gradually replaced several centuries of invasions and chaos. The result was the growth of towns and trade; the expansion of literacy and the rise of universities; the rise in the position of women; the growth and expansion of technology; and an amazing amount of travel and adventure, of which the Crusades are only a part. These and more are part of our inheritance from this age. However, there was also an underside to the century, and we study that as well: the rise of anti-Semitism; the persecution of heretics; the harsh treatment of lepers and the poor. We contrast the sometimes terrible realities of what one historian has called a \"persecuting society\" with its exuberant accomplishments. JILL N. CLASTER is Professor of History Emerita. A medievalist, she has taught and studied the era of the Crusades extensively and is the author of the recently published book Sacred Violence: The European Crusades to the Middle East, 1096-1396 . She served as Dean of the College of Arts and Science and as Director of the Kevorkian Center for Near Eastern Studies. She was the recipient of a Fulbright Grant and was honored with the Distinguished Alumni Award by the Alumni Association of NYU.  Civil Rights and Civil Wrongs: The Fight for Equality in the United States FRSEM-UA 560 Instructor: K. Kevyne Baar   syllabus Thursday, 9:30 a.m.-noon Required cohort meeting: Tuesday, 11:00 a.m.-noon This course looks at the intersection of the three major movements for social justice and civil rights in the United States since 1850: the movements for African Americans' rights, women's rights, and gay rights. We pay particular attention to points of convergence and points of divergence, alliances and conflicts. For example, though some abolitionists and women's rights advocates found common cause in the 1850s, many abolitionists would feel their work was done with passage of the Fifteenth Amendment (which enfranchised formerly enslaved African American men). More recently, feminism in the 1970s had to contend with charges that it excluded women of color, lesbians, and working-class women. We set the dialogue on civil rights, including tensions over exclusions based on gender and sexuality, race, and class, in a world context and take a measure of where it stands today. KEVYNE BAAR is returning to NYU from a year spent teaching at Hacettepe University in Ankara, Turkey, on a Fulbright Award. A self-described non-traditional scholar, she entered academic life after a long career in theatre and union organizing, and spent ten years as an archivist at NYU's Tamiment Library and Robert F. Wagner Labor Archives, to which she attributes the important role that archives play in her courses. She is the recipient of the College's Outstanding Teaching Award for her course \"Women, the Entertainment Industry and the Blacklist Era.\"  Music and State Power 1948-1994: South Africa, Czechoslovakia, and the U.S. FRSEM-UA 561 Instructor: Michael Beckerman Wednesday, 12:30-3:00 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Friday, 12:30-1:30 p.m. Note: conflicts with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m.-1:45 p.m.) This course looks at the relationship between music, ethnic and racial difference, and state power under the communist regime in Czechoslovakia and the apartheid regime in South Africa between 1948 and 1994. We set the stage by exploring each country's unique historical context, then address such topics as State control of musical activity; the role of jazz and popular music in the struggle for equality and democracy; the symbolic power of national anthems in creating a national self-image; and finally, the role of sound in the revolutions that brought an end to communism in Czechoslovakia and apartheid in South Africa. We also look at the US in the same period. While there was no clear revolution in the US-either of a repressive or a liberating kind-we can ask questions about similar forces at work here. The culminating event of the course is an online video conference featuring presentations by class members and an international group of scholars. MICHAEL BECKERMAN is Collegiate Professor and Carroll and Milton Petrie Professor of Music at NYU and Distinguished Professor of History at Lancaster University. His wide range of scholarly expertise includes film scoring, the music of the Roma (Gypsies), Mozart, Brahms, exiled composers, and Czech music history. He is the author of, among other publications, Dvo\u0159\u00e1k and His World and Jan\u00e1\u010dek and His World . A pianist and composer, he has written the ballet Asolando Suite ; incidental music to The Tempest ; the Dark Woods Variations ; and the Hiawatha Melodrama . He has performed at Lincoln Center and the Bard Music Festival, among other venues, and lectures both nationally and internationally. Professor Beckerman is a recipient of the George M. Estabrook Alumni Award from Hofstra University and the College's Golden Dozen Award.  Modern Poetry: Craft and Revolution FRSEM-UA 564 Instructor: Matthew Rohrer  syllabus Monday 11:00 a.m.-1:45 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Wednesday, 11:00 a.m.-noon Note: conflicts with Experimental Physics I (Monday, 11:00 a.m.-12:15 p.m.). This course thrusts students headlong into the dark cobwebby interiors of the modern poem. We look at several revolutions in thinking about what poems are, beginning in England in 1798, coming to Walt Whitman's and Emily Dickinson's America in the 1850s, stopping in Harlem in the 1920s, and ending up online. We look at how modern poems are actually put together, considering such elemental concerns as image, voice, and structure. And we also write our own poems, sometimes with these examples as our models. Students leave this course with a deeper understanding of the lineage of the modern poem and what makes the modern poem go, as well as, thanks to the generous and critical attentions of the workshop, the same understanding of their own work. MATTHEW ROHRER is a Clinical Associate Professor in the Creative Writing Program, where he teaches undergraduates and graduate students. He is the author of seven books of poetry, was a founder of Fence Magazine and Fence Books, and has participated in residencies and performances at the Museum of Modern Art (NYC) and the Henry Museum (Seattle). His poems have been widely anthologized, and he has appeared on NPR's All Things Considered and The Next Big Thing .  Interpreting the City FRSEM-UA 565 Instructor: David Serlin Tuesday, 9:30 a.m.-noon Required cohort meeting: Friday, 11:00 a.m.-noon Note: conflicts with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m.-1:45 p.m.) and with Advanced Chemistry I recitation (Friday, 11:00 a.m.-12:15 p.m.). This course uses New York City as both a field site and laboratory in order to give students theoretical and methodological tools for interpreting urban culture. For the millions of people who live, work, and visit, the city may at times appear to be a vast impersonal metropolis, but one nonetheless made meaningful by the infinite number of interactions that take place in and through its streets, buildings, spaces, and objects. So how might we come to understand urban culture not as something fixed but as a process? Readings in history, anthropology, museum studies, and critical theory (such as sensory studies), inform students' exploration of the physical and cognitive impacts of the built environment in relation to the economic, ethnic, gendered, sexual, and subjective dimensions of urban experience. Students make site visits, analyzing objects through written and visual documentation, and execute multimedia presentations, such as a virtual museum exhibit. DAVID SERLIN is Associate Professor of Communication at the University of California, San Diego, where he teaches courses in historical methodology, museum studies, visual and material culture, and architecture as a medium of communication. He is the author or editor of numerous books and articles, including Replaceable You: Engineering the Body in Postwar America , and serves on the editorial collective for the Radical History Review . During 2014-15 he will be a Visiting Research Professor in the Department of Social and Cultural Analysis at NYU. Digging for Dragon Bones: Unearthing Ancient China FRSEM-UA 567 Instructor: Roderick Campbell   syllabus Tuesday, 2:00-4:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Thursday, 2:00-3:00 p.m. Despite being less than a century old, the practice of archaeology of China has challenged, verified or rewritten traditional Chinese history since its inception. Today, with decades of double-digit economic growth driving countless archaeological salvage projects, the rate of discovery is surpassing the ability of archaeologists to make sense of the changing picture of the Chinese past. In this course we explore the prehistory and early history of the land that would become China in light of the most recent discoveries, such as the lost Bronze Age civilization of Sanxingdui and the first emperor's terracotta army. Through archaeological reports, historical texts, images and film, we attempt to come to grips with the vast and varied landscape that gave birth to one of the world's great civilizations. RODERICK CAMPBELL is Assistant Professor of East Asian Archaeology and History at NYU's Institute for the Study of the Ancient World. His research interests are archaeological political theory, sacrifice, and Shang civilization. Professor Campbell is co-director of a bone working assemblage at Anyang and is broadening his research into a multi-sited investigation of the Shang economy. He has recently published an edited volume entitled Violence and Civilization: Studies of Social Violence in History and Prehistory , and his book Archaeology of the Chinese Bronze Age: From Erlitou to Anyang is forthcoming with Cotsen Institute Press. Current writing projects include articles on cattle traction, the introduction to wheeled vehicles to China, the nature of animals in Shang art and a synthetic book-length multi-disciplinary history of the Shang polity. Gotham Schools: Urban Education Policy and the Pursuit of Equity FRSEM-UA 568 Instructor: Jennifer Jennings   syllabus Thursday, 3:30\u20136:00 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Friday, 12:30\u20131:30 p.m. Note: conflicts with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m.\u20131:45 p.m.). Never before has there been a stronger policy effort to reform America\u2019s urban schools. This course explores urban education reforms by using New York City as a case study. Through considering policy changes around school accountability and standardized testing, teacher evaluation, school choice, and prekindergarten access in New York City, we think systematically about their effects on schools, teachers, and students. In doing so, we grapple with many of the challenges that researchers face in conducting sociological and educational research. Whether your future lies in classrooms, a non-profit organization, the statehouse, the courthouse, or elsewhere, this course supplies you with a sociological toolkit to become a thoughtful and rigorous consumer of social science research. JENNIFER JENNINGS is Assistant Professor of Sociology at New York University. Before attending graduate school, she taught high school English and Social Studies in urban schools in New Jersey. Jennings\u2019s research focuses on understanding the impact of a range of education policies, such as the No Child Left Behind Act, teacher evaluation reform, and school choice, on educators\u2019 behavior and on racial, socioeconomic, and gender stratification in educational outcomes. She is currently working on a book manuscript entitled Why Schools Matter: The Impact of Schools on Children\u2019s Life Chances .  The Other City: New York in Poetry FRSEM-UA 569 Instructor: Tom\u00e1s Urayo\u00e1n Noel   syllabus Tuesday, 3:30-6:00 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Thursday, 3:30-4:30 p.m. Beyond the touristy New York, there is another city, an immigrant, working-class, bohemian, peripheral, and sometimes even quiet city. This seminar explores this other New York as captured by generations of poets, from Walt Whitman to Garc\u00eda Lorca to Patti Smith and the Nuyorican Poets Cafe. We combine close reading and formal analysis of poetry with visits to specific neighborhoods, sites, and archives (including digital archives). Along the way, we examine the mechanics of writing critically about poetry; explore alternative research tools, such as the field note, the microblog, oral history, and digital humanities project; and use our surroundings as a laboratory to experiment with different kinds of literary observation and analysis. Supplemental readings drawn from history, anthropology, journalism, and literary and cultural studies guide us in our explorations. TOM\u00c1S URAYO\u00c1N NOEL is an Assistant Professor in the Department of English and the Department of Spanish and Portuguese. Before coming to NYU, he taught at SUNY Albany and was a 2011-2012 Ford Foundation Postdoctoral Fellow at the Center for Puerto Rican Studies at Hunter College. He is the author of In Visible Movement: Nuyorican Poetry from the Sixties to Slam , and of various books of poetry in English and Spanish, as well as a contributing editor of Mandorla: New Writing from the Americas . His essays, poetry, and translations have appeared in such journals as Contemporary Literature , Fence , Small Axe , Latino Studies , and La Noria (Cuba). Also a performance poet, Noel has been featured in New York City venues such as the Nuyorican Poets Cafe and the Poetry Project at St. Mark's Church, as well as nationally and internationally.  Literature and Machines FRSEM-UA 572 Instructor: Nicola Cipani   syllabus Wednesday, 2:15-4:45 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Monday, 2:00-3:00 p.m. Machine   metaphors play an important role in modern literature, conveying   beliefs, anxieties, shifts, and reflections on key topics, including the   nature of consciousness and creativity; the dynamics of desire and   gratification; gender roles; the organization of society; the meaning of   \"nature\"; and the function of technology. This course explores   different manifestations of the machine theme, broadly clustered around   the following categories: imaginary machines constituting the   centerpiece of narrative plots; machine aesthetic as modernist ideal;   and mechanization of the inventive process (text-generating machines).   Students read and discuss a selection of works from different cultural   contexts, primarily from the late 19th and 20th century (e.g., Belle   \u00c9poque, Futurist, and postwar), representing a wide spectrum of   attitudes toward the machine, from dreamy immersion in virtual realities   to enlightened machine-assisted awakening, from the fear of   dehumanization to the desire for man-machine fusion. NICOLA   CIPANI is Assistant Clinical Professor at the Department of Italian   Studies and has been working at NYU for ten years. His interests include   reception of antiquity in medieval and early modern culture,   Renaissance philosophy, the intersection of verbal/ visual forms (such   as the art of memory, emblem books, and representations of dreams), and   20th-century experimental literature. At the Italian Department he has   served in the capacity of Director of Language Programs (since 2005),   Director of Summer Programs (2011-12), and Director of Undergraduate   Studies (2011, 2013).  From Guant\u00e1namo to GITMO: Camps, the U.S., and Comparative Colonialisms in the 20th Century FRSEM-UA 573 Instructor: Monica Kim   syllabus Monday, 2:00-4:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Friday, 12:30-1:30 p.m. Note: conflicts with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m.-1:45 p.m.) The   concentration camp has become a symbol of 20th century conflicts. In   this seminar, we examine shifts in the global imperial landscape through   a close study of people's experiences of building, living in, and   surviving camps. Rather than approaching the \"camp\" as an exception to   the everyday, we ask: How did the concentration camp develop? When did   societies perceive the need for one? How has decolonization changed (or   not changed) the practices of making a camp? How can the workings of a   particular camp shed light on the contemporaneous political landscape?   And what role does the \"camp\" play in different societies historical   memories? Emphasizing historical connections between the camps we use as   case studies, which may include German camps in 1880s Namibia and   British camps in 1950s Kenya, we begin with the reconcentrado policy of   Spanish colonialism in Cuba in 1880s and end with reflections on the   implications of Guant\u00e1namo Bay in Cuba for US imperialism. Readings   include both historical scholarship and an array of primary sources   (memoirs, oral history interviews, military documents, legal cases and   film). MONICA KIM is Assistant Professor in the Department of   History. Her research and teaching focus on three key issues concerning   the United States vis-\u00e0-vis the world: the relationships between   liberalism and racial formations; global militarism and sovereignty; and   transnational social movements and international law. Her current book   project, Humanity Interrogated , examines mid-20th-century crises around   warfare through a history of military interrogation rooms during the   Korean War. She has been a Fellow at the Penn Humanities Forum at the   University of Pennsylvania and also the University of Chicago.  Spring 2015  The Making of an Iconic Image FRSEM-UA 392 Instructor: Deborah Willis  syllabus Tuesday, 9:30 a.m.-noon Required cohort meeting: Thursday, 9:30-10:30 a.m. Iconic   images are pictures that become rooted in our personal memory and are   stored away for future reference through our experiences with them.   Often, the power of an iconic image is such that it extends beyond its   original purpose and takes on another form socially and historically.   This seminar explores the range of ideas and methods used by   photographers, artists, historians, filmmakers, and critical thinkers in   addressing the notion of iconic images within photography, video, and   film. Combining historical, contemporary, and theoretical approaches to   identity politics and visual culture, it addresses how images are   constructed. Class discussions highlight the trends and transformations   that have characterized the evolution of the iconic image. We use a   series of case studies to explore the construction of beauty and style,   gendered images, race, and pop culture. We also consider issues of   representation, display, and reception, particularly in relation to the   wider social context in which art, music, and culture are experienced in   private and public spaces. In addition to classes held on campus, field   trips are taken to archives, museums and galleries. Each week students   discuss a photograph of their own choice. DEBORAH WILLIS is   University Professor and Chairperson of the Department of Photography   &amp; Imaging at the Tisch School of the Arts at NYU and has an   affiliated appointment with Africana Studies in the Faculty of Arts and   Science. She has pursued a dual professional career as an art   photographer and as one of the nation's leading historians of African   American photography and curator of African American culture. She was a   2005 Guggenheim Fellow and Fletcher Fellow, and a 2000 MacArthur Fellow,   as well as the 1996 recipient of the Anonymous Was a Woman Foundation   Award. Professor Willis has just received the Honored Educator Award at   the Society for Photographic Education. Reading The Dream of the Red Chamber FRSEM-UA 461 Instructor: Jing Wang Monday, 3:30-6:10 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Wednesday, 3:30-4:30 p.m. Cao Xueqin's mid-18th century literary epic The Dream of the Red Chamber    is widely regarded as the culmination of the vernacular novel of   imperial China. With a tragic love story between two aristocratic   teenagers at its dramatic center, it covers a vast terrain of culture   and social life-the question of what is eternal and what is ephemeral;   the nature of \"qing,\" as the heart of being that both animates and   destroys life; individual talent and its fragility; and the decadence of   the elite, as well as growing, if hidden, social and class tensions.   The novel's manifold structure and intricate plot development, coupled   with its dazzling array of memorable characters, makes it one of the   most complex and colorful of all time. Note: Both reading and   discussions are conducted in English. No knowledge of Chinese culture,   language, or history is required or assumed. Native Chinese speakers who   wish to read and enjoy this masterpiece in the original language are   advised to choose a different Freshman Seminar and take Reading The   Dream of the Red Chamber (EAST-UA 228) as an elective course in the   future. Consult the CAS Bulletin for prerequisites. JING   WANG is Assistant Research Scholar in the College of Arts and Science   and the Department of East Asian Studies, where, from 1999 to 2006, she   was Lecturer in Chinese.

Her teaching and research interests include women writers in China and   the West, literary translation, modern Chinese social thought, and   comparative studies of cities and urban culture. In addition to literary   translations, she also publishes personal essays.  Political Cinema and Representation of the \"Other\" FRSEM-UA 463 Instructor: Shimon Dotan Monday, 3:30-6:00 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Friday, 12:30-1:30 p.m. Note:   conflicts with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m.-1:45   p.m.)  In contemporary war, \"the other\" is viewed not only   as an enemy to be fought but often, as one to be eliminated. How do   filmmakers fight against (or alternately, reinforce) such deadly   representations? In exploring various cinematic and thematic elements we   will primarily focus on films from one of the world's most   conflict-ridden regions\u2014the Middle East. We will also explore films from   Russia, Germany, France and the US. Through readings and film   screenings, we will investigate how \"the other\" is constructed   politically, aesthetically and ethically. This class is designed for   anyone interested in filmmaking and film criticism, contemporary   politics and history, cinema of conflict and violence, and the ethical   questions associated with them. SHIMON DOTAN, a Fellow of the   New York Institute of the Humanities at NYU, is an award-winning   filmmaker with thirteen feature films to his credit. His films have   received the Silver Bear Award at the Berlin Film Festival ( The Smile of the Lamb ), numerous Israeli Academy Awards, including Best Film and Best Director ( Repeat Dive; The Smile of the Lamb ), and Best Film at the Newport Beach Film Festival ( You Can Thank Me Later ).

He has taught   filmmaking and film studies at Tel Aviv University in Israel and at   Concordia University in Montreal and is a member of the Directors and   Writers Guilds of America (DGA, WGA). Synesthesia: Intersections of the Visual and Literary Arts FRSEM-UA 490 Instructor: Amy Bonnaffons Tuesday, 11:00 a.m.-1:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Thursday, 11:00 a.m.\u2013noon Note: conflicts with Physics I (Tuesday and Thursday 12:30-1:45 p.m.) This course will ask students to engage in both creative and academic writing as they explore the intersections of the visual and literary arts. How have notable writers been influenced and inspired by visual art? How have artists and writers attempted to \u201ctranslate\u201d one art form into the other? What do the literary and visual creative processes have in common, and what can each teach us about the other? We examine these questions through academic study and creative practice. Students visit NYC museums and galleries (the Guggenheim, MoMA, Brooklyn Museum, etc); read work by Kurt Vonnegut, Allen Ginsberg, Frank O\u2019Hara, Anne Sexton, and more; and write poetry, fiction, and essays inspired by visual art. In fall 2013 the class blogged some of its creative writing exercises at http://nyusynesthesia.tumblr.com AMY BONNAFFONS is a language lecturer in the Expository Writing Program. Her writing has appeared in the Wall Street Journal , the New York Daily News , Kenyon Review , Anderbo , and elsewhere, and has won awards from Yale University and Open City Magazine .

Guggenheim Museum titled \u201cResponding to Art Through Creative Writing.\u201d She is a past recipient of NYU\u2019s Graduate Teaching Award for her Introduction to Fiction and Poetry class. She holds a B.A. from Yale and an M.F.A. in Fiction Writing from NYU. Women in Social Movements in Latin America FRSEM-UA 493 Instructor: Pamela Calla  syllabus Thursday, 2:00-4:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Friday, 12:30-1:30 p.m. Note: conflicts with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m.\u20131:45 p.m.) The overarching theme of this seminar is women\u2019s political agency, in terms of emancipatory thought and action, in social movements throughout Latin America. While we locate this agency in specific national contexts, we also look at the rising transnationalism of the movements under scrutiny. More concretely, we focus on indigenous and other popular sectors, as well as the middle class, concentrating on the ways in which women brought new meanings and vitality to diverse forms of struggle. One of our central considerations is the historical relationship between social movements and the state, and the gendered logics that enter into negotiations between the two. We seek to weave together women\u2019s individual and collective thought and action, based on their own notion of what constitutes political and democratic gain, and the struggle for economic, cultural, racial, and gender justice. PAMELA CALLA, an anthropologist, is a Visiting Associate Professor at the Center for Latin American and Caribbean Studies at NYU and Director of the Observatory on Racism of the Universidad de la Cordillera in La Paz, Bolivia. She co-coordinates the \u201cNetwork of Observatories on Racism in the Americas,\u201d a joint initiative of Universidad de la Cordillera and the Teresa Lozano Long Institute of Latin American Studies, University of Texas. Her research focuses on race, gender, ethnicity, and state formation in Bolivia. She coedited Antropolog\u00eda del Estado: Dominaci\u00f3n y pr\u00e1cticas contestatarias en America Latina and Observando el racismo: Racismo y regionalismo en el proceso constituyente boliviano (to which she also contributed), and was an associate researcher of the United Nations Development Project\u2019s \u201cThe State of the State in Bolivia.\u201d  Nuclear Energy FRSEM-UA 512 Instructor: Antoine Cerfon  syllabus Monday, 2:00-4:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Wednesday, 3:30-4:30 p.m. Nuclear   power currently provides 13% of the world's electricity and is expected   to play an important role in the diversified energy mix that countries   are developing to meet the world's growing energy needs. As a   carbon-free, continuous energy source, it is an attractive solution for   base-load electricity production, and a desirable complement to   intermittent sources such as solar and wind. However, it also faces   serious technological, economical and societal challenges that question   its development. In this seminar, we follow a multidisciplinary approach   to explore the different dimensions of the debate about nuclear power.   We look at the basic nuclear physics in the core of power plants, the   different power plant concepts and their engineering solutions, the   nuclear fuel cycle, the issues of waste, safety and proliferation,   nuclear power economics, and the place of nuclear energy in the global   energy landscape. ANTOINE CERFON is Assistant Professor of   Mathematics at the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences. He   obtained his PhD in the Department of Nuclear Science and Engineering at   MIT, and stayed there for two more years as a post-doctoral researcher   before joining NYU in 2012. His main area of study is in plasma physics   for particle accelerators and nuclear fusion applications.  Encountering Martin Luther King, Jr. FRSEM-UA 519 Instructor: Philip Kunhardt  syllabus Thursday, 11:00 a.m.-1:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Tuesday, 11:00 a.m.-noon Note: conflicts with Physics I (Tuesday and Thursday 12:30-1:45 p.m.) This   course seeks to remember the human being at the center of the civil   rights movement, which took up the unfinished legacy of the Civil War   and Reconstruction to demand social and racial justice. Students explore   Martin Luther King Jr's thought, oratory, character, and public actions   in a way that makes him unforgettable to them. We consider his   tenaciously held philosophy of nonviolent social change, and his growth   from a southern Baptist minister to a civil rights activist to a   visionary leader of global human rights and peace. In what ways can new   information about his inner conflicts and personal flaws change our   appreciation of his moral stature? And how do we understand him in the   context of his times, amidst fellow activists, adversaries, elected   leaders, and critics during one of the most volatile, freedom-advancing   periods of American history? We consider the lessons of King and his   times for our own vastly changed but still violence-prone and   violence-haunted world. PHILIP KUNHARDT is Distinguished Scholar in Residence in the Humanities,   and teaches history and biography in the College of Arts and Science.   He focuses on the lives of transformative figures and has co-authored   five books, including Looking for Lincoln , The American President , and P.T. Barnum: America's Greatest Showman .   He was also writer and co-producer of more than a dozen documentary   films for PBS, ABC, HBO, Discovery, and others, including the ten-part   PBS series The American President , and the sixteen-part Freedom: A History of US . Before coming to NYU he was a Bard Center Fellow at Bard College in Annandale-on-Hudson, New York. Into the Urban Wild: Nature Writing and the City FRSEM-UA 522 Instructor: Tara K. Parmiter  syllabus Tuesday, 9:30 a.m.-noon Required cohort meeting: Friday, 11:00 a.m.-noon Note: conflicts with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m.-1:45 p.m.) and with Advanced Chemistry I recitation (Friday, 11:00 a.m.-12:15 p.m.). Essayist Loren Eiseley asserts that \"even in New York City there are patches of wilderness,\" encouraging his readers to rethink the way they define and limit their use of this loaded word. In this course we examine both the idea and the manifestation of these wildernesses, questioning the assumptions and the rhetoric we use when talking about the existence, construction, representation, cultivation, or manipulation of nature in our urban environment. We immerse ourselves in classics of American nature writing and then venture into the city, using our texts as lenses for reading such spaces as Central Park, the High Line, the Brooklyn Botanic Garden, and the American Natural History Museum. Readings include selections by Henry David Thoreau, John Burroughs, Aldo Leopold, Rachel Carson, Loren Eiseley, Annie Dillard, Terry Tempest Williams, bell hooks, Wendell Berry, and William Cronon, among others. Students compose both critical analyses of the texts and their own nature writing based on their exploration of and research into their own \"patch\" of New York wilderness. TARA K. PARMITER is a Senior Language Lecturer in the Expository Writing Program and a Mentor in the Undergraduate Writing Tutors Program. Her research interests include literature and the environment, turn-of-the-twentieth century women's literature, children's literature, travel narratives, and popular culture. She has published on topics ranging from the imagined landscapes in L. M. Montgomery's Anne of Green Gables novels to summer vacationing in Kate Chopin's The Awakening to journey narratives in the Muppet movies. She received her BA from Cornell and her PhD in English and American Literature from NYU.  Cultures of Science and Belief FRSEM-UA 527 Instructor: Noelle J. Mol\u00e9   syllabus Wednesday, 2:00-4:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Monday, 3:30-4:30 p.m. We regularly take for granted that scientific knowledge is objective. At the same time, we also know that scientific knowledge is constantly in flux, and that what we \"knew\" to be true yesterday is not true today. This seminar positions science along a spectrum of worldviews-explanatory models that provide causal reasons and underlying logics for events and actions-that includes magic, occultism, witchcraft, science, spirituality, and religion. Within particular historical and cultural contexts, a hurricane might be explained as the result of a witch's curse, a moving cold front, or an angry god. This course questions our deeply held assumptions regarding the neutrality of science and the so-called backwardness of folk belief; as we learn, the threshold between the categories of \"knowledge\" and \"belief\" is actually more blurred than we might initially expect. We explore the social, economic, and political implications of these hierarchies of knowledge, and examine how they shape how we experience our own bodies, our own feelings, and even our own minds. NOELLE J. MOL\u00c9 is a cultural anthropologist and author of Labor Disorders in Neoliberal Italy: Mobbing, Well-being and the Workplace . She is currently investigating the rise of scientific skepticism and supernatural beliefs in Italy as twin responses to a millennial crisis in knowledge production. She is a Senior Lecturer in the Expository Writing Program.  Sensual Shifts: From Looking to Listening in Modernist Literature FRSEM-UA 529 Instructor: Angela Frattarola  syllabus Tuesday, 3:30-6:00 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Thursday, 3:30-4:30 p.m. From Greek philosophy to the Enlightenment, vision was the privileged sense. Traditionally associated with knowledge and rationality, vision encourages a subject to keep a distanced, analytical perspective of an object. But does this always have to be the case? Can the other senses allow new ways of conceiving of and experiencing the relationship between the self and the world? This seminar begins by examining the dominance of vision in modernity and turns to audition as a way of thinking about alternative perceptions of the self and the world. We accomplish this by closely reading modernist novels that suggest a growing skepticism toward vision and heightened attention to sound and listening. In order to think about why modernists brought sound to the forefront of their art, we attempt to gain a sense of the modernist soundscape and the new auditory technologies of the time. Readings for the course consist of essays from sound studies as well as novels by Virginia Woolf, Dorothy Richardson, Jean Rhys, and James Joyce. ANGELA FRATTAROLA is a Senior Lecturer and Writing Tutor Mentor in NYU's Expository Writing Program. Her essays on modernist literature have appeared in such journals as Modern Drama , Genre , Mosaic , Studies in the Novel , Journal of Modern Literature , and Woolf Studies Annual . She has nearly completed a manuscript entitled Auditory Narrative in the Modernist Novel: Early Twentieth-Century Soundscapes and Audio-Technologies , a study that examines how modernist literature was shaped by developing auditory technologies and changes in auditory perception at the turn of the century.  A History of Disbelief FRSEM-UA 548 Instructor: Mitchell Stephens   syllabus Thursday, 12:30-3:00 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Tuesday, 12:30-1:30 p.m. Note: conflicts with Physics I (Tuesday and Thursday 12:30-1:45 p.m.) This seminar takes up an extended history of atheism and doubt (in the context of a history of religion). It begins with references to anthropology, the Hebrews and India, before discussing the skeptics and the development of disbelief in Greece and Rome. The course then follows the uneven progress of this idea and its consequences in continental Europe during the Renaissance, the Scientific Revolution, the Enlightenment, and the Romantic period, and in 19th-century England and America, where disbelief was allied with radical politics. Finally, we move on to the connection between disbelief and realism, modernism and postmodernism. The main arguments for and against the existence of God are considered. However, the main purpose of this course is to force students to confront and grapple with some of the most sophisticated and profound human expressions of disbelief. MITCHELL STEPHENS is Professor of Journalism. His book Imagine There's No Heaven: How Atheism Helped Create the Modern World was recently published by Palgrave. He is also the author of, among other books, the rise of the image the fall of the word and A History of News . His articles on media issues, philosophy, anthropology, physics, and other subjects appeared in the New York Times , Washington Post , Los Angeles Times , and other publications. His current book project is on the future of journalism. Russia: The Rule of Law in Question FRSEM-UA 549 Instructor: Jane Burbank  syllabus Tuesday, 9:30 a.m.-noon Required cohort meeting: Thursday, 9:30-10:30 a.m. The   popular image of Russia has been shaped by Western and Russian   commentators who bemoan corruption, criminality, and lawlessness as   endemic to Russian life; in this view, the phrase \"Russian law\" would be   an oxymoron. However, in the Russian Federation, law is very much at   work: the legal profession is attracting many students, and the case   loads of Russian courts have grown yearly since the early 1990s. Even in   February 2014, when the Russian military began their invasion of   Crimea, the Russian president asked for the authority to use force. How   can we explain this adherence to legal procedures by Russia's leaders   and citizens, in the context of harsh critiques of Russia's supposed   lawlessness? In this seminar, we explore the history of law in Russia,   how law is used in Russia today; and theories of \"rule of law.\" Our   materials include studies by historians and legal scholars, Russian   literature in translation, media coverage of legal issues, and laws   themselves. Students write short commentaries on their readings, one   book review, and a research paper on one legal case or issue of their   choosing. JANE BURBANK is Collegiate Professor and Professor of   History and Russian and Slavic Studies. After an early focus on Russian   intellectuals' interpretations of the Revolution of 1917, the topic of   her monograph Intelligentsia and Revolution: Russian Views of   Bolshevism, 1917-1922 , she turned to Russian law and to how ordinary   people used it. Her book Russian Peasants Go to Court: Legal Culture in   the Countryside, 1905-1917 reveals that rural people, contrary to   received opinion, were avid litigators. For a glimpse at this study, see   her NYU website: http://www.nyu.edu/projects/burbank/. She is the   co-editor of Russian Empire: Space, People, Power, 1730-1930 , a   collective and international study of Russian empire. Her most recent   book, written with Frederick Cooper, is Empires in World History: Power   and the Politics of Difference . Hybrid Forms: Experiments in the Contemporary Novel FRSEM-UA 551 Instructor: Gabriel Heller  syllabus Monday, 2:00-4:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Wednesday, 3:30-4:30 p.m. This   course examines an emerging movement in contemporary literature that is   preoccupied with blurring the boundaries between fiction and   non-fiction. We read primarily texts published in the last few years,   originally in English as well as in translation, which, despite their   status as fiction, break into the territory of the memoir and the essay,   blending imagination, autobiography, and essayistic reflection in   challenging and innovative ways. These novels, diverse in both form and   content, share what the writer David Shields has called a \"reality   hunger\"; they seek to confront experience and consciousness more   directly than the conventional forms of the novel allow. As we   investigate this new mode of writing, we inquire deeply into the   relationship between truth and fiction. What kinds of truth do novels   make available to us? How does the novel have to change in order to   encompass our changing ideas of reality? What strategies do contemporary   writers use to get as close as possible to the real grain of   experience? GABRIEL HELLER is a Senior Lecturer in the   Expository Writing Program. His writing has appeared most recently in    Agni Online , Fence , and The Gettysburg Review . He is the recipient of   the 14th Annual Inkwell Short Story Award, as well as a Distinguished   Story Citation in Best American Mystery Stories 2013 . He has an MFA in   Fiction Writing from NYU and is currently at work on a novel.  Globalization and the Modern Novel in English FRSEM-UA 552 Instructor: Jeannie Im   syllabus Thursday, 12:30-3:00 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Tuesday, 12:30-1:30 p.m. Note: conflicts with Physics I (Tuesday and Thursday 12:30-1:45 p.m.) Over the last century, some of the most significant literature in English has been produced in former British colonies. This course uses key novels in English to explore crucial facets of contemporary globalization. Our novels provide a virtual literary map, moving from the Latin America of Joseph Conrad's Nostromo to the post-independence Nigeria of Ben Okri's and Wole Soyinka's stories; post-apartheid South Africa of Nadine Gordimer's The Pickup ; and South Asia of Amitav Ghosh's The Glass Palace . Our readings are informed by scholarship on issues such as migration and population displacement; urbanization and environmentalism; economic development and political transition; and cosmopolitanism and citizenship. While literature provides the foundation for the course, students are encouraged to develop final research papers relating to their academic interests, such as economics, political science, international relations, or environmental studies. JEANNIE IM is a Language Lecturer in the Expository Writing Program. Her research interests include British modernism, postcolonial fiction, globalization, and critical theory. Her work has appeared in Modern Fiction Studies , and she has given numerous conference papers on Virginia Woolf, Samuel Beckett, and Mulk Raj Anand, among others. She is currently at work on a book on supraterritoriality in 20th-century literature, looking at writers from Evelyn Waugh to Chinua Achebe. She has taught Advanced College Essay (Steinhardt) and consulted with Writing in the Disciplines in psychology and physics. She received her PhD in English and Comparative Literature from Columbia University. Sexuality and Style in Queer Literature FRSEM-UA 553 Instructor: Abigail Joseph Tues, 3:30-6:00 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Thursday, 3:30-4:30 p.m. We explore the development of gay and lesbian literary styles from around 1890 to 2010\u2014a century of major social and aesthetic shifts. From the secrecy and persecution of Oscar Wilde\u2019s fin-de-si\u00e8cle moment to the protest and celebration of our own more recent one, how have novelists and poets represented identities and desires which fall outside of the norm? What kinds of feelings and relationships, encompassing but moving beyond sex itself, circulate through queer narratives? What modes of aesthetic response and expression characterize what we might call \u201cqueer style\u201d? We will be especially interested not only in how these writers represent the pleasures and struggles of their contemporary social and psychological worlds, but also in how they imagine a set of richly textured relations to historical worlds, both recent and distant. Our authors will likely include Oscar Wilde, Henry James, Virginia Woolf, Christopher Isherwood, James Baldwin, Frank O\u2019Hara, John Rechy, Jeanette Winterson, David Wojnarowicz, and Alison Bechdel. We will supplement our literary texts with forays into the major ideas of queer theory.  ABIGAIL JOSEPH is a Lecturer in the Expository Writing Program. She holds a Ph.D. in English from Columbia University and is at work on a book about the relationship between gay male identity and material culture in nineteenth-century England. Her writing on fashion history appears in Public Books , Victorian Studies , and the edited collection Crossings in Text and Textile .  Artificial Intelligence in Film FRSEM-UA 554 Instructor: Megan Shea   syllabus Wednesday, 11:00 a.m.-1:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Friday, 11:00 a.m.-noon Note: conflicts with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00   a.m.-1:45 p.m.) and with Advanced Chemistry I recitation (Friday, 11:00   a.m.-12:15 p.m.). With IBM's development of Watson, the supercomputer that can beat most people at Jeopardy , we grow ever closer to living in a world where the deep learning capabilities of actual artificial intelligence match those that have been imagined by filmmakers for the past 100 years. This seminar delves into that filmic world wherein androids, cyborgs, and omniscient computers contribute to humankind's charged relationship with the mysterious other. With such movies as Metropolis , Blade Runner , and 2001: A Space Odyssey to document various understandings of this relationship, we also read historical and theoretical literature that explores the passion and violence surrounds these creatures. Students engage not only with the topic of artificial intelligence in film but also with the world of cinema by writing reviews, a short screenplay, and a final research paper. MEGAN SHEA is a Language Lecturer in NYU's Expository Writing Program. She received her PhD in Theater Arts from Cornell University, where she studied women's performance in ancient Greece and the contemporary West. While teaching at Cornell, she received the Gertrude Spencer Student Portfolio Award, and she has received several Excellence in Teaching awards while at NYU. Professor Shea has published articles in The Journal for Dramatic Theory and Criticism and TheatreForum . She recently premiered her translation of Euripides's Cyclops at Dixon Place.  The Self in/as Space FRSEM-UA 555 Instructor: Leeore Schnairsohn Tuesday 3:30-6:00 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Thursday, 3:30-4:30 p.m. This course examines the relational and spatial underpinnings of our sense of our \"self.\" In order to know ourselves and to act, we must imagine ourselves in space, physical and non-physical, constantly revising the line between \"inside\" and \"outside.\" This course takes us to the limits of our ability to conceive space, looking at literature, film, philosophy, and music that explore the manifold ways we invent, act in and upon, and make use of space to become, know and judge ourselves. Our wide-ranging texts situate us in the cosmos, both medieval and modern (Dante's Divine Comedy and Tarkovsky's Solaris ), the built environment (for example, the elegant Paris of Benjamin's Arcades Project ), and the depths of the unconscious (in the work of Freud and Lacan). LEEORE SCHNAIRSOHN holds a PhD in Comparative Literature from Princeton and is currently a Language Lecturer in the Expository Writing Program at NYU. His translations of the Russian poet Osip Mandelstam have appeared in Portals and Inventory ; he has also published review articles in the Slavic and East European Journal and in the Canadian-American Slavic Studies .

Spent Powers: The Culture of Credit and Subjectivities of Indebtedness FRSEM-UA 556 Instructor: Gerard O'Donoghue   syllabus Wednesday, 2:00-4:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Monday, 3:30-4:30 p.m. This class asks students to think about the specific ways in which personhood in the United States is defined by one's relationship to capital. How is an individual's political and economic power shaped by access to credit? How does indebtedness alter our sense of selfhood and obligation? We pose these complex questions against the backdrop of the central contradiction in in in American history: that a state whose political and economic foundation integrated chattel slavery also-in contract law-espoused the principle that citizens ought not have the power to contract themselves into peonage, or self-enslavement. We try to understand how credit and debt have been shaped by the legacy of slavery and how they intersect with race and class. As indebtedness becomes the norm, how are the basic assumptions of American democracy challenged? A core of literary texts is supplemented by readings from philosophy and social science. GERARD O'DONOGHUE is a Language Lecturer in NYU'S Expository Writing Program. His interests lie in the fields of 20th- and 21st-century American literature and Irish modernism. He earned his MS and PhD at the University of Oxford for his dissertation The Orphan's Kaddish , and has published in Notes and Queries and Philip Roth Studies . Prior to his current appointment he was a Lecturer in English Literature in the Claremont Consortium and an AHRC Kluge Fellow at the Library of Congress.  Legal Fictions: Storytelling &amp; the Law FRSEM-UA 557 Instructor: Lorraine Doran   syllabus Monday, 2:00-4:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Wednesday, 3:30-4:30 p.m. We tell ourselves stories about the law every day - in literature and film, journalistic accounts and internet debates. In this course, we consider the judgments and values beneath those stories, and what relationship they bear to the way stories are told and evaluated by lawyers and judges. We think about how fictional versions of legal ideals transcend the boundaries of the law itself, as well as how the law has evolved in its understanding of our rights and responsibilities. The narratives we examine involve, among other things, civil rights, criminal justice, and civil disobedience. Though these are issues we can (and should) become passionate about, we go beyond the opposing positions, and try to discern what our legal narratives tell us about ourselves and the times we live in. In other words: what do the ways in which we translate legal principles in literature and film, and debate them in the public sphere, tell us about the human condition? With the authors of these texts, we work toward our own definitions of what is just. LORRAINE DORAN is a Senior Language Lecturer in the Expository Writing Program. She holds a JD from NYU School of Law and an MFA in poetry from the NYU Creative Writing Program. As a Visiting Professor of Law at Seton Hall University, she taught a seminar on civil litigation, and supervised students in the Seton Hall Center for Social Justice.

The Rise of the Visual FRSEM-UA 559 Instructor: Trevor Laurence Jockims  syllabus Tuesday, 9:30 a.m.-noon Required cohort meeting: Thursday, 11:00 a.m.-noon Though   Chinese artists were using the camera obscura\u2014or pinhole camera\u2014as   early as 400 BCE, photography did not emerge until the second half of   the 19th century. This course traces out the peculiar, fascinating,   delayed emergence of photography, and the subsequent explosion of film   and digital media, in an attempt to illuminate what, exactly, the desire   to capture images is, why it emerged when it did, and what it means to   our culture now \u2014 more replete in images than any moment previous. In   order to grasp the meanings of our visual culture, we explore the   literary culture that has challenged, championed, and in many cases   moved forward and made sense of visuality, reading widely in   literature\u2014from Homeric poetry to graphic novels\u2014theory, and philosophy.   TREVOR LAURENCE JOCKIMS teaches in the Expository Writing   Program, where he has won departmental teaching awards every semester.   His scholarly work centers on 20th-century American poetry and its   relationship to visual arts and culture. He has published articles and   book chapters on ekphrastic poetry, photography, the documentary film   essay, pastoral lyric, and representations of war in Eastern European   cinema. His essays and film reviews have appeared in many prominent   publications, including The Times Literary Supplement and the New York   Times ; his fiction has appeared in Descant , Mr. Beller's Neighborhood ,    The Journal of Experimental Fiction , and elsewhere. He received his PhD   in Comparative Literature from The Graduate Center of The City   University of New York. Writers, Notes, and Notebooks FRSEM-UA 562 Instructor: Elaine Freedgood  syllabus Tuesday 3:30-6:00 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Thursday, 3:30-4:30 p.m. How   do novelists and poets prepare to write? What is in notes and notebooks   that is not in novels and poems? We begin the term with the   idiosyncratic Preparation of the Novel, by the literary and cultural   critic Roland Barthes, who never wrote a novel, but prepared notes and   notation toward one. We then turn to the novels, poems and notebooks of   other writers, including but not limited to George Eliot, Lorraine   Hansberry, W.H. Auden, and John Ashberry. For some, we have the   opportunity to use collections in archives throughout New York (NYU's   Fales Library, the New York Public Library at 42nd Street, and the   Schomburg Library in Harlem). Students keep two notebooks to present to   the seminar weekly: one in which they annotate a passage of text (with   writing, drawing, collage and other media), and another in which they   record notes and notations toward poems and novels that they may or may   not write. They also write two papers and do one collaborative   presentation. This is a demanding seminar, for students interested in   archival research, very serious reading, and scholarly and creative   writing. ELAINE FREEDGOOD is Professor of English. She is the   author of Victorian Writing about Risk: Imagining a Safe England in a   Dangerous World and The Ideas in Things: Fugitive Meaning in the   Victorian Novel , and the editor of Factory Production in Victorian   Britain .

Colonizing Creatures: Humans and Other Animals, Past and Present FRSEM-UA 563 Instructor: Zeb Tortorici   syllabus Tuesday, 2:00-4:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Friday, 12:30-1:30 p.m. Note:   conflicts with Physics I (Tuesday and Thursday 12:30-1:45 p.m.),   General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m.-1:45 p.m.) and with   Advanced Chemistry I recitation (Friday, 11:00 a.m.-12:15 p.m.). This   course examines the fraught relations between humans and other animals   in the past and in the present, both locally and globally. Our readings   focus on the ways in which the \"human\" and the \"animal\" have been   defined over time and place, with significant ramifications for all   involved. Topics include medieval and early modern monstrosities;   religious rites; the commodification of animal parts; bestiality and   other violent intimacies; animal domestication and breeding; zoos and   circuses; animal experimentation; debates surrounding \"animal rights\";   museums and taxidermy; pests, rodents, and insects; the rise of animal   protection and anti-cruelty laws; and animal studies as an academic   discipline. In our attempt to engage \"real\" animals\u2014living, sentient   beings\u2014and their archived remnants, we take excursions to the Bronx Zoo,   the American Museum of Natural History, and (if possible) a New   York-based taxidermy studio. ZEB TORTORICI is Assistant   Professor in the Department of Spanish and Portuguese Languages and   Literatures at NYU. He received his PhD in History from UCLA. He has   published articles in Ethnohistory , Journal of the History of Sexuality ,   History Compass , e-misf\u00e9rica , and GLQ and chapters in Death and Dying   in Colonial Spanish America , The Human Tradition in Colonial Latin   America , Queer Youth Cultures , and Queer Sex Work . He also recently   co-edited Centering Animals in Latin American History and a special   issue of Radical History Review . He is currently completing a book   manuscript on the \"sins against nature\" ( pecados contra natura ) of   sodomy, bestiality, and autoeroticism in New Spain, from 1530 to 1821.  Sonic Art: Sound, Everyday Life, and Aesthetics FRSEM-UA 570 Instructor: Elizabeth Hoffman  syllabus Wednesday, 3:30-6:00 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Friday, 12:30-1:30 p.m. Note: conflicts with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m.-1:45 p.m.) Is   our culture increasingly becoming sound- and hearing-oriented and less   attuned to the visual? How would we assess this? And if the answer is   \"yes,\" what are some implications for the creation and appreciation of   music? At the turn of the 20th century, the Italian Futurists responded   to industrialization by valorizing the sounds of factories, machines,   and even war. Can we see a similar relationship in the response of   contemporary composers to internet culture? How are our artificial   musical worlds forging a continuum with sonic aestheticizations of our   everyday environment? Are the domains of musical and sonic aesthetics   intertwined or not; and what are some useful current working   definitions, for sonic art, of the term \"aesthetics\" in the first place?   ELIZABETH HOFFMAN is Professor of Music. She is an   internationally recognized composer of acoustic and computer music, both   fixed media and live processing, and has also published on issues of   representation; narrative; and space and timbre as sonic signifiers in   the Computer Music Journal , Organized Sound , and Perspectives of New   Music . She is a recipient of the Golden Dozen Teaching Award.  Globalism and the International Art Film FRSEM-UA 571 Instructor: Doug Dibbern  syllabus Tuesday, 2:00-4:30 p.m. Required recitation: Monday, 6:00-9:00 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Friday, 12:30-1:30 p.m. Note: conflicts with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m.-1:45 p.m.) This   class studies the contemporary international art film in relation to   debates about nationalism and globalization. These films, screened   mostly at festivals and at small cinemas, tend to be slow and difficult,   telling ugly, painful, and mysterious stories in an unconventional   style as an intentional rejoinder to Hollywood. We spend a lot of our   time analyzing the works of directors such as Bela Tarr, Michal Haneke,   Asghar Farhadi, and Jia Zhang-ke. We also study the history, structure,   and economics of the international film festival circuit, including the   strategies that nations and supranational bodies have embraced to   compete with the major film industries of the world; cultural policy in   the European Union; theories of nationalism and globalization; ideas of   cultural imperialism; and, of course, issues of aesthetics, especially   as they concern the development of a global style. Along the way, we   touch on contemporary politics in a few select countries, with an   emphasis on France, Romania, Iran, and China (including the mainland,   Hong Kong, and Taiwan). Students are required to attend one mandatory   film screening every week in addition to the 2 1/2-hour class. DOUG   DIBBERN earned his PhD in the Cinema Studies Department at NYU and   currently teaches in the Expository Writing Program. He writes film   criticism for The Daily Notebook and has recently published more   academic essays on the directors Fritz Lang and Howard Hawks. His first   book, Hollywood Riots: Violent Crowds and Progressive Politics in   American Film , examines leftist filmmakers working on the fringes of the   Hollywood film industry during the peak years of the Red Scare.  Monotheism and Empire: From Constantine the Great to Genghis Khan FRSEM-UA 574 Instructor: Robert Hoyland  Tuesday, 3:30-6:00 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Thursday, 3:30-4:30 p.m. Though   Jesus said that \"My kingdom is not of this world,\" from the reign of   Constantine the Great (306-37) onwards, Christian emperors portrayed   themselves as protectors and promoters of a very earthly Christian   realm. This had profound consequences: once emperors shared the same   faith as their subjects, it was inevitable that they would seek to shape   and control it, thus setting the stage for a struggle between religion   and politics that has lasted into our own time. We cover the period   between Constantine's reign and that of the Mongol emperor Genghis Khan   and his successors in the thirteenth century, who faced the difficult   decision of whether to give up their ancestral cult and adopt an alien   monotheist creed so as to become rulers in Constantine's mold. In   between these turning points, Muslim rulers (caliphs) and European   monarchs tried and eventually failed in their attempt to control   religion in their realms. We explore the links between monotheism and   empire in varied religious traditions: Christian, Muslim, Jewish, and   Zoroastrian. ROBERT HOYLAND is Professor of Late Antique and   Early Islamic Middle Eastern History at the Institute for the Study of   the Ancient World at NYU. Prior to coming to ISAW, he was Professor of   Islamic History at the University of Oxford, where he earned his DPhil   in 1994. His books include Seeing Islam as Others Saw It: A Survey and   Analysis of the Christian, Jewish, and Zoroastrian Writings on Islam ;   Arabia and the Arabs from the Bronze Age to the Coming of Islam ; and    Theophilus of Edessa's Chronicle and the Circulation of Historical   Knowledge in Late Antiquity and Early Islam . He is involved in the   Oxford excavation of Androna/al-Andarin in Syria. He was both a   Fulbright and Erasmus Scholar, at Princeton and Groningen, respectively.    The Art of Magic FRSEM-UA 575 Instructor: Christopher Stahl   syllabus Thursday, 11:00 a.m.-1:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Tuesday, 11:00 a.m.-noon Note: conflicts with Physics I (Tuesday and Thursday 12:30-1:45 p.m.) Jean   Eugene Robert-Houdin, the universally recognized father of modern stage   magic, once famously remarked that \"a magician is an actor playing the   part of a magician,\" suggesting that there is some sort of unique   cultural role that the magician might have to play. The topic of this   seminar is magic\u2014not as an anthropological or supernatural phenomenon,   but as an artistic stage practice with its own aesthetic history and   values. How do certain tricks and illusions stage the cultural and   philosophical issues of the day? Beginning with texts like Reginald   Scott's The Discoverie of Witchcraft (used by Shakespeare as a source   for many plays), students explore critical theories about wonder and   enchantment as well as read sources that range from books of magic   tricks to the memoirs of noted stage conjurors. We also examine stage   magic's relation to other art forms, including theatre, photography,   cinema, sculpture, and video and performance art. CHRISTOPHER   STAHL is a Senior Language Lecturer in the Expository Writing Program at   New York University, where he was recently recognized for a decade of   teaching service. He has been a longtime Faculty Affiliate with NYU's   Residential College, currently leading a student community interested in   exploring the link between the history of urban development in NYC and   social/cultural issues. He has published several essays on vaudeville   magic, and his work on turn-of-the-century Chinese conjuring was   published in the critical anthology Performing Magic on the Western   Stage . His writing has also appeared in The Village Voice , Theatre   Journal , and Women &amp; Performance , and in the anthology Bend Don't   Shatter: Poets on the Beginning of Desire . The Literature of Capitalism FRSEM-UA 576 Instructor: Thomas Easton  syllabus Thursday, 11:00 a.m.-1:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Friday, 12:30-1:30 p.m. Note: conflicts with Physics I (Tuesday and Thursday 12:30-1:45 p.m.) and with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m.-1:45 p.m.) This course explores how some of the most enduring themes in literature, such as greed, ambition, failure, innovation, prosperity, and opportunity, are reflected in literature about capitalism. Readings are likely to include works by eighteenth-century English essayist Samuel Johnson; children\u2019s book author Horatio Alger and novelist Mark Twain; and contemporary Chinese memoirist Aisling Juanjuan Shen. The nature of property rights, subtle distinctions between success and crime, and the relative value of diligence and luck are other themes we consider. Our discussions about characters and stories are informed by work in economics, ranging from Adam Smith\u2019s writings on productivity and ethics to Thomas Piketty\u2019s writings on income inequality. Weekly essays assigned. THOMAS EASTON is American finance editor at the Economist, where he previously worked as New York and Hong Kong bureau chief. Earlier in his career, he was the bureau chief for The Baltimore Sun in New York and Tokyo and a senior editor at Forbes.

Countermajoritarian difficulty Basic premise is majority rule decisions as to which values among competing values shall prevail and how they should be implemented should be subject to control by persons accountable to the electorate Judicial review is a deviant institution b/c it permits unelected judges to overturn decisions of popularly accountable officials Court is justified in invalidating government decisions only when it is following values clearly state in the text or intended by framers Non-originalism Non-originalism noninterpretivism Ely: contrary view that courts should go beyond that set of references and enforce norms that cannot be discovered within the four corners of the document. Permissible for courts to interpret Constitution to protect rights that are not expressly stated or clearly intended. Constitutions meaning can evolve by amendment and interpretation.  Non-originalism describes what doesnt control interpretation; it does not specify what should be looked to in deciding meaning of constitution.  How to determine the role of tradition? Tradition in a general abstract sense or specific level of abstraction? Ely court is justified in being nonoriginalist when it follows a participation-oriented, representation reinforcing approach. Some nonoriginalists believe that Court should discern and implement natural law in interpreting constitution or follow moral consensus in society embrace majoritarian moral consensus. Arguments for non-originalism Rebuttal of Nature of document argument  Defining interpretation as requiring originalism and then concluding that only originalism is legitimate method is a tautology. Rebuttal of democratic society argument Definition of democracy is not necessarily a majority rule neither descriptively nor normatively is American democracy a majority rule. (public choice theory controlled by powerful, discrete minorities). Framers distrusted majority rule and so every govt institution had strong anti-majoritarian features constit shields some matters from easy change by political majorities Ely process-based theory consistent w/ democracy b/c judicial review enforces majority rule when it ensures fair representation and procedures. Perry consistent with majority rule so long as Congress retains power to restrict juris of SC If originalist, then wouldnt all judicial review be unconsitut? Originalist judicial review is democratic b/c people consented to it in consitit - > but only 5% of population participated in ratification process? Not one person alive today was involved in that process... Desirable to have constitution evolve by interpretation and not only by amendment Amendment is cumbersome and requires 2/3 approval by the House and of states constit needs to meet needs of changing society Equal protection framers approved practice of discrimination and segregation, but today unacceptable Equal protection not framed to cover women, but now it does.  There is NOT an unambiguous, knowable framers intent that can be found to resolve questions Deciding level of abstraction of provisions is difficult (was eq. prot. Meant to protect former slaves, racial minorities, all discrete and insular minorities, or everyone?)  This necessarily requires a value choice.  At highest level, framers desired liberty and equality, so wouldnt this prevail? Process of determining framers intent is process of interpretation that is inevitably infected by contemporary values. No single group of framers Drafters of provision included members who voted for it, drafters, members of state conventions and legislatures who ratified it. There is no unified intent many conflicting reasons for adopting provision. Dworkin there are very few collective intentions. Historical materials are too incomplete to support authoritative conclusions. Nonoriginalism is approach intended by framers The framers themselves didnt want the debates from the constitutional convention published, and they were only published years later this suggests they didnt want their personal intentions to control. Natural law in the courts Features of English Natural law tradition Judges did not make the common law, but rather derive it through the artificial reason of the law to discovered immutable legal principles. Revisionist history had transformed Magna Cart from partisan political document to declaration of natural rights of Englishmen, and subsequent documents (e.g. Bill of Rights) thought to declare preexisting principles.  John Lockes treatise said that when man went from pre-governmental State of nature to agree to a social compact of government he preserved certain rights. The supremacy of the legislature derived from the consent of the people to be governed and that functioned as limitation on its power. Three basic liberties were life, liberty, and estate property was an extension of the individual and social compact was designed to protect distribution of wealth that had come about naturally. Blackstones 3 rights Personal security legal and uninterrupted enjoyment of life, body, health, and reputation Personal liberty without restraint unless due process of law loco-motion and freedom of mobility Right to own property free use and enjoyment Judicial protection of vested rights A vested right inheres when there is something more than a mere expectation as may be based upon anticipated continuance of present general laws it must have become a title, legal or equitable, to the present or future enjoyment of property... Basic structure of entitlements was determined by the common law as modified by legislation these determined the procedures by which property interests were created an transferred. But once interest had vested it was immune from govt divestment.  Legislature may enjoin, permit, forbid, punish, they may declare new crimes, and establish rules of conduct...but they cannot change innocence into guilt, or punish innocence as a crime, or violate right of private contract, or the pright of private property those are vested rights coming from natural law that are immune from legis. interference.  Fletcher v. Peck reliance on natural law principles in declaring state law unconstit that retroactively affected contract rights Background GA statute rescinded earlier law granting land to certain individuals. 1795 members of GA legis had been bribed to convey land to private companies at very low price. 1796 GA legis rescinded grant of land, but then property had already been sold to innocent investors. Ruling Legis power is limited by both genral principles of pol instit and words of constit General principles involve natural law, which refrains from interference with vested rights and only punishes individuals for their own acts. Absolute rights had vested under the contract, which were immune and above acts of legis.  Article I 10 prohibits ex post facto laws, interference w/ contracts, and bills of attainder (legis finding that someone is guilty and punishing them for it) Ogden v. Saunders Marshalls dissent saying that natural law of contracts trumps prospective leg interference; bankruptcy statutes in existence when contract is made mean that statute becomes part of contract Individuals do not derive from govt their right to contract, but bring that right with them into society; that obligation is not conferred upon contracts by positive law, but is intrinsic, and is conferred by the act of the parties. Marshall says that states can construct contract remedies, but diff is that bankruptcy laws are not merely remedial, b/c what they do is to turn obligatory contracts into de facto conditional promises. Was the Court only free to use natural law (when federal common law still allowed for diversity cases) only when it had original juris under Sec 25 (diversity)? For appellate juris, it had to apply state law, and could only reverse state legis or action when it was repugnant to the constit.  Marshalls Methods of constitutional interpretation The Text Theory and structure of govt established by constitution inferences from the structures and relationships created by constitution Prof Black: Marshall does not place principal reliance on necessary and proper clause as ground of decision...before he reaches it he has already decided, on the basis of far more general implications, that Congress possess the power, not expressly named, of establishing a bank and chartering corporations...he addressees himself to the necessary and proper clause only in response to counsels arguing its restrictive force.  Marshall contrasts great outlines of Article I with prolixity of legal code in light of object and purpose Prudentialism what are the likely consequences of a decision and do they matter? Marshall refers to exigencies of nation and rejects construction that would render performance govt functions difficult, hazardous, and expensive. A type of administrative ease argument. Brandeis doctrine of separation of powers was adopted not to promote efficiency but to preclude exercise of arbitrary power. Purpose was not to avoid friction, but, by means of inevitable friction incident to distribution of govt powers among three departments, to save people from autocracy. Was this division also as necessary for vertical separation between state and national govts? History surrounding the adoption of the text Philadelphia Convention rejected proposal to auth Congress to charter corporations, but Marshall doesnt quote this. But judicial references to legis history were very rare in 18th cent. Anglo-Amer jurisprudence Precedent He involves incorporation of Congress in 1791 of first bank to support constitutionality of second bank. Why should precedent ever be relevant to constitutional decision-making? Or why not just one factor among many? Scalia in SC v. Gaithers:  Overruling prior precedent wont always shake citizens faith in Court. Overruling rarely occur w/o change in Court personnel, and can occur within short space of time. Freshness of error not only deprives it of respect to which long-established practice is entitled, but also counsels that opportunity of correction be seized at once, before state and federal laws and practices has been adjusted. In constitutional questions, where correction depends upon amendment and not upon legislative action, this Court throughout its history has freely exercised its power to reexamine basis of constit. decisions.  Rhenquist in Payne v. TN: Considerations of stare decisis are at acme in cases involving property and contract rights, where reliance interests are involved; the opposite is true in cases involving procedural and evidentiary rules. Decisions based on narrow margins are at greatest risk of being overturned.  Uncertainties of Meaning Issues Constitution is not an exact legal code with all questions addressed Marshall on interpretation in McCulloch v. Maryland Was not meant to have a prolixity of a legal code, but instead [i]ts nature...requires that only its great outlines should be marked, its important objects designated...[W]e must never forget that it is a constitution we are expounding...[A] constitution, intended to endure for ages to come, and consequently, to be adapted to the various crises of human affairs. Much of constitution written in open-textured language which vague phrases how should the court decide content and meaning of the broad clauses? But this has allowed the constitution to survive over the ages and adapt with time... What government justifications are sufficient to permit govt to interfere with fundamental right, or to discriminate? Types of Uncertainties Ambiguity if two or more rather different meanings are present E.g. what does natural born citizen mean? Born in the US, or a citizen at birth? Vagueness marginal indefiniteness in meaning and application of words Middle-aged: vague, since it applies to a wide range bounded areas of uncertainty Many things are described by confluence of number of attributes and you can never fully describe combinations of attributes necessary or sufficient for proper application of noun to particular thing Lemon a thing cannot lack all, or even very man y, of typical lemon properties and still be a lemon; but there is no one property, or group of two or three properties, which an object must have to be properly called a lemon. Nonliteral usage Article I 8 allows Congress by securing for limited times...the exclusive right to respective writings and discoveries Does writings include anything besides letters icnrebed on surface? Photos, three-dimensional objects, sculptures, etc. Literalness with which the word should be read  OED literal is relatively primary sense...as distinguished from any metaphorical or merely suggested meaning. How broadly or narrowly should be define words?  Language is a social practice the interpreter is not free to stipulate meanings of terms it has to be done in context of accepted usage.  Allocation of Judicial Power under the Constitution Article III Article III creation of federal judiciary system  the judicial power of the US shall be vested in one supreme court and in such inferior courts as Congress may from time to time ordain and establish. Dispute over whether inferior federal courts should be established Madison wanted lower courts to be established distrusted state courts as biased against fed law. Question of whether state courts are equal to federal courts in their willingness and ability to uphold federal law continues today. Proposal to create lower fed cts initially defeated, but then Madison proposed compromise to leave it up to Congress.  Federal Judiciary Act of 1789 established lower federal courts. Independence of federal judiciary All federal judges get lifetime tenure, during good behavior and salaries that cant be decreased State court judges have electoral accountability in 42 states Article III 2 defining cases and controversies of federal court Vindicating and enforcing powers of federal govt Fed courts have power to decide all cases arising under the Constitution, treaties, and laws of US All cases in which US is a party Govts power in area of foreign policy are protected by fed courts authority to hear all cases affecting ambassadors and other public ministers and consuls All cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction All cases between a state, or its citizens, and a foreign country, or its citizens Interstate Umpire  Resolving disputes between two or more states Between a state and citizens of another state Between citizens of different states Between citizens of same state claiming land in other states Allocation of judicial power between Supreme Court and lower federal courts Supreme court has original jurisdiction over cases affecting ambassadors, public ministers and consuls, and those in which state shall be a party. Congress can give lower federal courts concurrent juris, even over those matters where the Constitution specifies that the Supreme Court has original juris. Limited in practice between disputes between two or more states.  Supreme Court in all other cases is granted appellate jurisdiction, both to law and fact, subject to such Exceptions and under such regulations as Congress shall make. Trial of all crimes, except impeachment, shall be by jury Shall occur in state in which crime was committed Treason shall consist only in levying war against US or giving aid to enemy Marbury v. Madison and the establishment of Judicial Review of Acts of Congress and the Supremacy of the Constitution History Political struggle between John Adams and the Federalists, and TJ and Repubs Adams appointed new judges, including several justices of the Peace for DC Commissions for these justices had been signed by Adams, but not yet delivered (by mistake of Marshalls bro) TJ then refused to honor appointments which had not been delivered Federalists tried to entrench themselves through Marbury and Stuart v. Laird and by all of the last minute commissions. To give themselves lifetime tenure to their allies to lessen their own loss of power. Marshall himself was an actor in this power grab and then was entrusted with the duty of presiding over the judicial challenge of the power grab.  Congress also abolished the Supreme court for two terms a move that was also improper.  Marshalls own struggles Questions of bias and Marshalls assertion of judicial supremacy Marshall was Secretary of State under Adams, and was previously entrusted to deliver the commissions to the new circuit court judges. One would have expected Marshall to argue that it was proper, that the actual delivery was only a menial task the actual legal act was to seal and affirm the commissions.   To allow him to decide his institutions own power whether they could decide extent of judicial power to interpret constitution is worrisome legislature or other branch could better determine this.  Personal relations between Jefferson and Marshall were already poor.  Marshall is not in as much conflict as might be expected he has an interest in peacemaking, as well as in building power in the judiciary. His commitment to the court transcends his allegiance to the party.  Marshalls assertion of power Assertion of judicial supremacy paragraph 52, It is emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is.  Marshall was also worried about what would happen if he gave an order that was not followed what it would say about his own power. If he had granted the commission to Marbury, TJ most certainly would have ignored it, which would have undermined the courts power.  Marshalls relationship with the federalists How strongly was Marshall interested in aggrandizing power of judiciary vs. how much for power of Federalists?  Marshall was somewhat of a renegade of the Federalists deviated from the party line on a number of important issues.  He was not Adams first choice Jay decided that he didnt want it b/c circuit court riding was too onerous confirmation of Marshall took a while b/c he didnt have full Federalist support, but he got the support of all 15 Senate Republicans.  Marshall viewed himself as a consensus choice rather than a strong Federalist party choice.  Political reasons behind refusal to grant mandamus Has to be clean hands Marshall could have said that equity would not be the correct remedy, b/c the Federalist judges did not have clean hands.  Delivery was also not caused by malfeasance, it was caused by haste and last minute power grab delivering commissions could not be expected and it would be rewarding their shady power grab. Balance of harms would giving it cause more harms. Republicans had been voted into power so allowing judges to take power might thwart the will of the people.  If you were going to look at political situation in your inquiry whether men had acted in reliance on sealing of commissions. Had they moved to DC in expectation of the commissions, did they sell property, etc.  Balance the hardships giving effect to politically illegitimate move to people who were not genuinely injured, vs. not carrying out ministerial duties.  Legal issues Whether Marbury had a right to commission Delivery was a mere technicality and all procedures were followed seal was affixed. Legally recognized right to the commission attaches at some period before everything is done to bring it about.  In background of British common law, commissions for office were understood as a form of property, like land grants. Anything Marshall that would have said to have destabilized ordinary entitlement to the commission might have also destabilized the land grant system. He could have distinguished the situation by saying political commissions are always subject to the public interest, but he didnt.  Whether it was Remediable If there were no courts that had jurisdictions, then there would be no remedy. The essence of civil liberty consists in right of every individual to claim protection of the laws, whenever he receives an injury.  Only the courts are in the position to judge the actions of the executive one of the big questions under the 11th amendment. How much does sovereign immunity carry into this?  The Courts could provide remedies when there is a specific duty to a particular person, but not when it is a political matter left up to executive discretion (political question).  The logic is somewhat circular, since the judiciary is adjudging their own extent of power. Because I have declared that there is a vested right to the commission, even though the acts of the executive are generally circular, this question falls through and still has to be answered whether mandamus is the correct remedy.  Can court supply the remedy of mandamus? Sits in court of equity where official is ordered to do something.  Is judicial review available? Judicial review is only appropriate for ministerial acts where executive had a duty to perform, whereas in political acts, where the executive acts at his discretion, judicial review is not appropriate. Questions, in their nature political, can never be made in this court...[But where the head of department] is not perceived on what ground the courts of the country are further excused from the duty of giving judgment that right to be done to an injured individual. Does the court have jurisdiction over the case? The Judiciary Act of 1789 provided that the Supreme Court would have juris to issue writs of mandamus to persons holding office under the authority of the US. Judiciary Act explicitly allowed it. Does Mandamus on Original Jurisdiction Violate Article III? Section 13 of Judiciary Act at odds with constitution Article III enumerates original juris (only affecting Ambassadors, other public ministers, and consuls, and those in which a state shall be party). If Congress could expand original juris, then the enumerated list would be mere surplusage, entirely w/o meaning.  But what if Constit meant enumerated list only as the minimum that Congress could grant more? Establishes that federal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction, while state courts are courts of general juris.  Issuance of mandamus is not among types of cases as to which original juris is conferred, so Congressional statute was unconstit. Can Supreme Court Declare Laws unconstitutional? Constitution imposes limits on government powers and these limits are meaningless unless subject to judicial review Inherent to judicial role to decide the constitutionality of the laws that it applies it is emphatically the province of the judiciary to say what the law is. Courts authority to decide cases arising under the constitution implied the power to declare unconstitutional laws conflicting with the basic legal charter. Judges take an oath of office on grounds to uphold constitution, and the oath would be violated if they didnt perform judicial review.  Article VI makes Constitution the Supreme Law of the Land, so constitution should control over all other laws. Jurisdictional analysis Types of jurisdiction Statutory Constitutional Appellate jurisdiction Marbury argued for different meaning of appellate appearing in Federalist papers and elsewhere something is appellate anytime a tribunal reaches out to supervise or alter the decision or action taken by another tribunal over which it has authority. Appellate as supervision over lower entities in a body. We take judicial branch to be its own hierarchy, and it is b/c there are superior and inferior courts there are appeals. If the court had the power to grant mandamus, then not only was that court the superior tribunal to other courts, but it was superior to other inferior bodies outside the court. The case was appellate in its posture by virtue of the remedy being mandamus.  Marshall takes appellate as meaning now and says a case cannot be appellate if it originates in the Supreme court.  Original jurisdiction Only ambassadors or consuls made original jurisdiction. US public ministers did not fit this category.  Marshall reads this very strictly only in the context of foreign relations will the court have original jurisdiction.  But the rest of Article III allows for the Supreme Court shall have appellate Jurisdiction, both as to Law and Fact, with such Exceptions, and under such Regulations as the Congress shall make.  Congress could give the court original jurisdiction in cases involving public ministers.  If there is such a thing as exceptions, why cant Congress move from appellate jurisdiction to original? Why not this exception?  Marshall says that there is a distinction created between original and appellate jurisdiction in Article III and Congress cant change it.  Would seem to be one of milder exceptions to simply move something from appellate to original. Isnt less of an intrusion on judicial power to move things around rather than to oust the power of Congress completely? Why doesnt he instead say that Congress has the power to do this and then examine the statutory question of whether Congress has indeed done this.  Why not read the writs of mandamus language in the same way just as writ of prohibition is available to courts in maritime and admiralty, why not is it available in cases in which court is exercising appellate jurisdiction. If you want to accord the greatest possible deference to Congress in thinking that it is operating with an understanding of the Constitution.  Interpretation of meaning of Marbury Two interpretations of power of precedent set by Supreme Court.  Narrower interpretation - Retrospective If there is a real live plaintiff and case is probably in jurisdiction about constitutionality of statute, then Supreme court has responsibility to decide constitutionality of statute, and decision of Supreme court binds the two parties.  The authority of the courts to adjudge the constitution is bounded by the cases that come before the court. If there is an area of discretionary executive action and there is no basis for the court to rule on the case, then the executive would be free to come up with its own interpretation of the constitution that may differ from the Supreme courts interpretation. The court is deciding the case for the parties, not for all time.  Broader Prospective principles enunciated by the court will be applied to future cases So long as the question comes to the Supreme Court in the form of a justiciable case, so long as the court has the occasion to rule on the question of constitutionality, the Supreme Court has the duty to rule and can rule it unconstitutional, as a result of which the statute will be deemed void and unenforceable in any case. And the constitution will be taken to be called into question.  Once Court gets constitutional issue in its clutches, then court can declare meaning of constitution. If executive branch later has to decide what that interpretation of constitution means, then in the broader view, once the supreme court has spoken, the question has been answered unless court changes its mind. Then noone, constituent with this order, can act otherwise.  Two positions on constitutional role of courts in Marbury and judicial review Diffuse constitutionalism (also called departmental or popular) All actors in society, three branches, each individual actor, will have authority and duty to interpret constitution.  Power is not concentrated in Supreme Court, but is diffused out into society.  Judicial Supremacist Position The other Supreme Court, through cases which come through it on appeal, gets to say what the constitution is for all time the one who gets to call the issue and take it out of legitimate controversy.  This goes beyond just interpreting and applying the constitution to the particular case at hand. Evaluation of Marbury How Marshall could have avoided constitutionality of Judicial Act? Statute talks about writ of mandamus in terms of appellate juris from circuit courts could have read it to simply grant Court remedial powers when it has juris. Statute could also have been read to give Court authority to issue mandamus only where appropriate in cases properly within its juris.  Did Marbury need to claim judicial supremacy in order to win Marbury?  Pre-Marbury cases argued for departmental constitutional review prior to judicial review. B/c of that, there are certain cases where the court will get directly to the constitutional issues where legislation directly conflicts with the constitution and the court gets jurisdiction.  The role that courts played in being willing to embrace prosecution of republican leaders and journalists under Alien & Sedition Act made the courts much less popular. The courts became a target of public discontent.  Marbury was pitching judicial review precedent does not necessarily carry courts need to always perform judicial review.  Marshall claims a larger sphere of power for the court to protect the inner core departmental review First amendment having a core of political speech that first amendment protects, but going outside that core to protect other kinds of less politically important speech or prohibiting legislation that does not stop speech, but deters speech from taking place.  What the court is worried about is the chilling effect people worrying that they are safe in expressing themselves. But as the categories of protected speech have moved further and further from the core, peoples willingness to protect these has decreased.  If you make the larger claim, then you are putting it out there as a lightning rod people who may not object to your limited departmental constitution jurisdiction, then people may take you on when you assume larger power and challenge the core of your power.  Marbury and the Court has to go outside the departmental theory and claim more power in order to be sure that they can exercise the smaller power.  Departmental vs. supremacist Anyone can find isolated language in Marbury for either version of judicial review departmental or supremacist. Marbury then becomes a shopping mall where all versions of judicial review can be found. Marshall did not need to assert judicial supremacy, since it was in reviewing a specific statute and he would have departmental review.  To try to get everyone to view a more robust and diffuse view of constitutional politics and to raise the point that this view is legitimate.  Arguments for and against Judicial review under Marbury v. Madison Federalism Used to assert judicial review and supremacy VAWA 1994 Lopex 1995 (core commerce power) Seminole Tribe 1996 (Congress does not have power to abrogate state sovereign immunity when it legislates purely under commerce power) Boerne 1997  (Section 5 of 14th amendment) Arguments against judicial review Marshalls reference to history or text is lacking Marshall made no arguments based on history or legislative debates Marsh made no arguments based on democracy or representation of the people If the commissions had been for political positions like cabinet members then the non-deliverance would have been considered a political act and therefore non-reviewable by the court; Textualist - Nowhere is it written in the constitution that the court should have power of judicial review Imbalance of power thwarting the democratic system - if court has judicial review then that gives them too much power. It is a usurpation of power Gives a non-elected branch of govt ultimate say on constitutional issues binding other branches.  Madison didnt think it would be legitimate for the judiciary to have this power, thought not politically credible in a democracy. Marbury is a usurpation of power the founders never intended to give. Constitutional supremacy was to be over the states, not a coequal branch of federal govt. What about other branches? Judiciary not the only branch that can protect citizens. Allows room for officials to exercise judgments about the violations of human rights.  President has right and duty to exercise an indep view and veto legislation he doesnt agree with, not inconsistent with Marbury. Courts are defective in protecting human rights. (Thayer, Jefferson) Judicial humility to avoid usurping the power of the legislature and the power should only be used when there is a rights violation. Should only be used in a judicial role, no congressional negative, always avoid political questions. When have case in controversy, judicial standard of review should be the rule of clear mistake.   Judge should enforce act of legislature if there is any rational basis.  Would allow progressive legislation to proceed, leaves most controversial issues in the hands of legislatures and Pres, elected representatives. Does not respect popular constitutionalism or majoritarian decisions.  The structure of the govt federalism (both vertical and horizontal) will enforce this. States can represent themselves politically strong political actor - and dont need the Court to go to bat for them.  Restrained judiciary forces people to stand up for their rights.  Forces congress to take leadership positions, not just pandering to the polls and relying on court to do dirty work.  Keeps incentives in tact for legislature to act to resolve human rights abuses.  Popular protest could vote bad leaders out of office. Aggressive judiciary leads to reactionary politics, not democratic resolutions.  Changes may not take hold, increased level of resistance.  Judiciary needs help from congress and executive to enforce judgments. Arguments for judicial review Marshall - Judicial review is part and parcel of the nature of judicial power judicial supremacy It is emphatically the province of the judicial department to say what the law is (some supremacist courts stop the quote here) those who apply the rule of particular cases must of necessity expound and interpret that rule. If two laws conflict with each other, the court must decide on the operation of each.  There are different types of supremacy the supremacy of the constitution over ordinary law.  One way to tell if Congress is ignoring the constitution or considering it, is to look at the debates and see if Congress is putting the constitution first.  So this is not total judicial supremacy it is allowing for other branches of govt to be interpreting the constitution.  The Supreme Court is needed b/c of its expertise, ability to confer finality (need to have issue resolved), independence decision made by other entity rather than legislature.  Marshall - A written constitution is a kind of higher law that requires judicial interpretation Once you have written text, its interpretation becomes a fine art that lawyers and judges are better at interpreting than legislatures. Does a written constitution mean that it can conflict with legislation some form of disagreement would be expected?  There may be something different about having a written constitution assimilated constitutional law to ordinary law that might not have been what the colonial experience with constitutional interpretation may have warranted.  Courts have a unique role in preserving fundamental values and ensuring stability Bickel courts have ways of dealing with principles and enduring values that legislature dont have.  Legislatures are more subject to passing trends, immediate results, b/c they are subject to reelection. Courts will take a longer-term view of what is needed, rather than acting on expediency or just being results oriented. They are in a better position to balance stare decisis, need for stability and preservation of core values; with urgent pressing needs b/c they have a lifetime tenure immune from constant shifts of public opinion.  Courts can check vague and abstract statutes against real flesh and blood factual situations to test constitutionality in a way that the legislature cant. -> But what about congressional fact-finding? Courts can better supervise inter- and intra-governmental relations Supervises federal system relations between state govts and among states themselves Can serve a role of protecting state power from federal intrusion? But cant the states do that themselves? Is the judiciary needed to serve as an umpire vertically as well as horizontally?  Internal national system, involving allocation of powers among legis, exec, and judicial branches Prevents always having to go back to the people for recourse against constitutional transgressions.  Representation reinforcing process policing procedural mechanisms to ensure democracy a check against majoritarian politics (fed judges appointed for life so better insulated) Stone in Carolene Products When legislation restricts political processes which can ordinarily be expected to bring about repeal of undesirable legislation. To protect discrete and insular minorities from discrimination and to ensure their participation in the pol process Ely Ely when ins are choking off channels of political changes to ensure that they will stay in and the outs will stay out Court has special expertise in area of procedure and that judicial review is consistent with majority rule b/c it is perfecting democracy.  Though no one is actually denied a voice or vote, representatives beholden to an effective majority are systematically disadvantaging some minority out of simple hostility or prejudiced refusal to recognize commonalities of interest, and thereby denying that minority the protection afforded other groups by a representative system. (CITY OF BOERNE) Valid Interests protected (Ely) Protecting freedom of speech and freedom of press b/c they are critical to functioning of open and effective democ. Protects voting rights b/c franchise is central to participation in democratic process Protects minorities against defects of democratic process resulting from prejudice Judicial review will be limited to cases in which there are clear constitutional issues Like Chevron, Courts at that time made a point in stressing how clear constitutional issue was that if there was any possible doubt they would defer to legislature.  It was only when the conflict was clear enough that they suspected legislature was ignoring constitution and would not give deference.  Ratcheting up Katzenbach v. Morgan Congress can act by granting more rights, but they cant strip away more than we already have. Court needs to check against this case.  Boerne says the opposite.  Judicial Review of State Court Decisions and Legislation Background Judiciary Act of 1789 provided for SC review of state court judgments Sec 25 of the Act allowed SC to review state court decisions by writ of error to states highest court in many situations. Martin v. Hunters Lessee SC Auth to review state court decisions History Two conflicting claims to land in VA Martin claimed title based on inheritance from Lord Fairfax and Hunter claimed that VA had taken land before treaties in effect and hence Martin had no claim. US had signed treaty protecting rights of British citizens to own land in US. VA court ruled in favor of states authority to have taken and disposed of the land. Federal treaty was controlling and established Fairfaxs ownership. VA Court of Appeals said that SC lacked authority to review state court decisions VA court said that Courts of US, belonging to one sovereignty, cant be appellate Courts in relation to State Courts, which belong to a different sovereignty and of course, their commands or instructions impose no obligation. Storys ruling SC granted cert again and Story said that Court had authority to review state court judgments. If Congress hadnt create any lower federal courts, then how would SC have appellate ct juris? Constitution is based on recognition that state attachments, state prejudices, state jealousies, and state interests might sometimes obstruct, control, regular administration of justice. SC review is essential to ensure uniformity in interpretation of federal law. Very nature of constitution, contemporaneous understanding, and years of experience established SCs auth.  Cohens v. VA Cts power to take cases from state courts Facts Two brothers convicted in VA state court of selling lottery tix in violation of VA law. D sought review in SC b/c constitution prevented them from being prosecuted for selling tix auth by Congress. VA argued that SC had no auth to review state ct decisions in general, and in particular review not allowed in criminal cases and in cases where state was a party.  Ruling by Marshall Sec 25 of Judiciary Act was constit. and state courts couldnt be trusted to adequately protect fed rights b/c in many state judges are dependent for office and salary on will of legislature. Criminal Ds could seek SC review when conviction violated constit.  Cooper v. Aaron and the power to review constitutionality of state laws and actions of state officials Background Federal district court ordered desegregation of Little Rock, AK schools. State disobeyed order b/c of professed concern that compliance would lead to violence, and on claim that it was not bound to comply with judicial desegregation decrees. Ruling Signed by each judge Article VI of the Constit. makes the Constit. the Supreme law of the Land. Marbury v. Madison declared the basic principle that the federal judiciary is supreme in the exposition of the law of the Constitution, and that principle has ever since been respected by this Court and the Country as a permanent and indispensable feature of our constitutional system...Every state legislator and executive and judicial officer is solemnly committed by oath...to support this Constitution.  The Polity: Slaves, Women, and Indians Slavery Three elements of existing constitution that refer indirectly to slavery 1808 Statute to bar importation of slaves There was no public protest or talk of defiance There were large numbers of slaves dying with poor medical conditions and the climate, but there was a large and violent slave rebellion in Haiti that caused the independence of Haiti from France.  Successful slave insurrection Large black population increase Haiti suggested that there could be a large increase in the number of slaves There was significant political risk and prevalent racism and fear that the racial makeup would change. Continuing the slave trade would be dangerous. Also thought about how you could emancipate slaves without changing the fundamental nature of the country what to do with the idea of a free racially mixed population.  3/5 principle The origins of this was to measure wealth how much to tax each state to raise money for the Confederation. It was first drawn into the Articles of Confederation The South argued that slaves were not as productive as freemen, since they had no wealth did not generate as much wealth, and wanted a 2:1 ratio. The North was a 3:2 ratio, so they compromised on a 5:3 ratio.  When the Constitution was being debated, the Convention got to the idea of proportional representation of the Houses.  Many wanted it to be proportional to wealth and property and not people, since many people (women, indentured servants) did not represent wealth and could not vote (property qualifications).  The South then reversed its position and wanted them counted as one person each, while the North did not want it.  Wilson claimed that the 3/5 was difficult to support since it had no real basis.  But the 3/5 ratio had already been ratified by 11 of 13 states in 1783, so it had become the language of America.  Fugitive Slave Clause Came in at the Behest of South Carolina Was not initially thought that it would be a big issue Full Faith and Credit clause was already in effect and obligation to assist in protection of slaveholding property rights reasonable and not large extension of the way in the which the states under a federal system would have to respect the judgments of each others courts Deep belief that govt existed to protect private property fed govt had to protect private property, while state law created property interests Northerners got from this the confidence that the govt was going to protect all forms of property Commerce clause The South was very worried during the Convention that it would be sued to outlaw or limit slavery.  The slave trade clause would have banned Congressional regulation of the slave trade until 1808 a 20 year ban. This represented northern concessions to the south in order to pass the Commerce clause as being federal power.  Another part of it was that the clause could not be amended until 1808. Western Expansion Jefferson tried to get slavery banned in new Western states, but it failed.  Party that was stronger advocate for expansion was the South the Democratic party was aligning itself with Southern and slaveholding interests. The South wanted to expand slavery into the Western states.  Jay Treaty after the Revolution  Required compensation from Britain to pay slave owners in the south for the slaves that they had taken with them during the Revolution. The British didnt pay, and the Congress tried to get the money, but it didnt succeed, so this was a constant source of friction with the British.  Anti-slavery movement and the constitution How could you make the compromises that the constitution required wrt slavery? How could you live in a country that combined strong interests of slaveholders and those who were morally opposed to it?  Was the alternative to form two countries or to make concessions so that the Union survived?  How crazy was it for anti-slavery interests to believe that slavery would gradually disappear by itself? - How did the economic projections for slavery look in the 1700s? Tobacco was the more important export crop than cotton, but cotton and tobacco were both labor intensive crops that benefited from the institution of slavery.  But then the tobacco industry somewhat collapsed by the early 1800s and the cotton gin was invented in the early 1800s enabling mass production, so the cotton industry exploded and was no longer struggling. So in the late 1700s, it was not possible to see that cotton would be such an important crop dependent on slavery. Since the collapse of tobacco, along with expansion into the western states, it may have been believable to think that the economic foundations of slavery would collapse.  North South division -A lot of mercantile interest in the slave trade in the North Rhode Island had a significant slaving fleet New York had a lot of commercial interest in the trade it was not a pure North/South conflict.  Between 1700 - 1775, 1700 slaves were imported. By 1750, blacks made up 20% of the population of the city.  Slaves were used by the NY merchant population placed on crews of merchant ships as crew members and employed as dock workers. They were also used in artisan shops.  Half the households by 1775 held one or more slaves.  Slaves and freemen were competing for jobs, so this influenced the anti-slavery movement losing jobs to slaves. This led to years of racial violence between low-income white workers and black workers. Roediger has written much about this.  Slavery was abolished in 1827.  Revolutionary War and slavery Americans were deeply suspicious of using slaves as soldiers arming slaves with weapons and ideas. The talk of liberty, liberating American from the British, meant that Patriots wanted slaves away from the soldiers and the fight for liberty.  The People - the polity Property qualifications and other limitations on voting Many people who might have expressed themselves through mob activity or protests, but were not able to vote.  And these forms of popular protest were viewed as illegitimate since it was the poor people participating.  The white male property qualifications disappear in the 1830s.  Womens suffrage movement No action until womens suffrage for a very long time and very little action for Native Americans. 14th amendment and womens suffrage Natl Rep party opposed suffrage for women Francis and Minor tied citizenship to right to vote Privileges and immunities of citizens in 14th amendment national in character  Since feds had power to naturalize citizen, naturalized citizens right to vote was guaranteed by federal auth, otherwise state could make naturalized citizen second-class. A fortiori a state could not do this to natural born citizen.  If states could deny franchise to citizens, then they could extend franchise to noncitizens, which would be wrong.  Anthony was arrested when she was trying to vote  Taxation w/o representation, denial of right of jury of peers,  Minor v. Happesett (1874) Suffrage was never coextensive w/ citizenship of states Originalist when constit adopted, no states extended suffrage to women States still retain right to control franchise If suffrage right of citizenship, then why was 15th amendment necessary when 13th conferred citizenship? MS allows noncitizens right to vote if theyve declared that they will become citizens Modern Supreme Court does treat voting as embraced by 14th amendment privileges and immunities 19th amendment Gives the vote to women. There were no Giles like efforts to obstruct provision, but the only question that has arisen has arise in scholarly literature whether 19th amendment can function like a general protection for the rights of women outside of the areas of suffrage in the same way in which the 14th and 15th amendment was used as a broad rights protecting charter for all issues dealing with race.  Siebel has done the most work on this. Siegal argues that 19th amendment can be used to attack any of the reasons for discrimination that were previously used to deny women the vote.  Indians under the constitution What was the political legitimacy of the constitution or the colonization of North America.  The issue of Indian removal was from the Carolinas and Georgia tribal life was already disintegrating in the North warfare and disease spreading are not talked about as constitutional matters. The constitutional question was really more of a federalism question whether it was the States or the federal govt who have power to act on issues that affect the Indian tribes.  The constitution itself talks about federal power to conduct commerce with the Indian tribes. There were many early battles about who it was to remove and kill Native Americans the federal or states. Who was it that would remove the Indians to Oklahoma, with the feds eventually doing the job.  How can Indian tribes as sovereigns under federal law be reconciled with US treatment of the Indian tribes? In the Supreme Court under Marshall, there is quite a lot of respect for the Indians as sovereigns, but that has changed dramatically over time.  American Indians and birthright citizenship US v. Sandoval (1913) Still open question about whether Indians were citizens McKay v. Campbell (1871) Indian tribes are distinct and independent political communities, retaining right to self-govt, though subject to protecting power of US.  US v. Kagma (1886) Congress possessed plenary power over Indian tribes Power of Congress to organize territorial govts and make laws for inhabitants, arise not so much from constitution, as from ownership of country in which territories are, and rights of exclusive sovereignty which must exist in natl govt Indian tribes are wards of nations dependent on US for food, political rights; Power of US govt necessary for their protection and safety Owe no allegiance to states, who are often enemies Elk v. Wilkins (1884) SC rejected bid for right to vote b/c he had never surrendered citizenship of Indian tribe was not naturalized, taxed, or recognized as citizen of Us Indians owe allegiance to tribes over US, and alien and dependent condition of members of tribes could not be put off at their own will w/o assent of US Can only become citizens through naturalization or through treaty or statute 14th amendment was to settle citizenship of blacks, not Indians. Indians are not born in US subject to juris tribes are foreign nations. Section 2 excluding Indians not taxed b/c not citizens Harlan dissented and said that not taxed must mean that some Indians who are taxed can be citizens who live off of reservations and were unconnected with tribes 1924 Indians finally admitted as citizens through act of Congress Chinese Exclusion Case (1889) Background Chinese man left SF for China, but w/ cert from customs inspector entitling him to return.  When he returned, he was refused entrance his right to land and his cert had been annulled by Act of Congress approve October 1, 1888.  Act prohibited laborers from entering US who had departed before its passage w/ cert to return. The abrogation that began in the 1880s started a very long period of the legal exclusion of Chinese immigration.  Ruling Act is in contravention of treaty of 1868 and 1880, but is not invalid b/c treaties are of no greater legal obligation than act of congress. Treaties and Acts of congress are both supreme no hierarchy often treaties are not self-executing and require legislation to carry into force.  Self-executing treaties that relate to subject w/in power of congress are deemed equivalent of legislative act, to be repealed or modified at pleasure of congress. Last expression of sovereign will control. Court not invested with authority to pass judgment on determination of legisl department or their motivations. If legis. determines that foreigners are threat to US, SC is not one to pass judgment.  Sovereign powers of national govt: make war, make treaties, suppress insurrection, repel invasion, regulate foreign commerce, secure republican govts to states, admits subjects of other nations to citizenship - restricted only by constit need for maintenance of independence and security throughout territory.  Differences between European immigration and Chinese immigration The Chinese are seen as a threat foreigners of a different race who will not assimilate with us. It was over 95% male less immigration of intact families.  They lived in bunk houses with other Chinese people rather than taking on the normal patterns of US life not centered around the nuclear family.  People thought that this indicated something from Chinese culture Chinese women were discouraged from emigrating, because they had other obligations to other family members that prevented them from emigrating. Most men came under labor indenture contracts arranged between merchants in China and brokers in the US and the terms of the contracts didnt contain provisions allowing for immigration of families.  The legislation declared that all Chinese women were prostitutes, so when the wives or female family members did try to come to the US, they became aware that they might be thrown out for suspicion of being prostitutes.  Mormons and the Free Exercise clause Division between belief and action Reynolds v. US Congress was deprived of all legislative power of mere opinion, but was left free to reach actions. Upheld constitutionality of law forbidding polygamy even though Mormons claimed it was reqd by religion.  Cannot put doctrines of religious belief superior to the law and allow every citizen to become law unto himself. Govt couldnt exist in these circumstances.  Federal Legislative Power Overview What is scope of Congressional authority? The five big ones... Power under the Commerce Clause Enforcement under Section 5 of 14th amendment Spending power of Congress is it limited to enumerated items, or for the general welfare If Congress can do anything it wants, as long as it does it through money, what is the point in having limits through the Commerce power? Congress can then structure any program that it wants to deter what it wants to regulate, or bribes the states to do things that Congress would like to be able to require.  If you have a Supreme Court committed to aggressive federalism, then it will not be able to stop at the Commerce Clause, then it will have to have some power to limit Congress taxing and spending powers. What degree of deference will be afford to Congress? Underinclusiveness and overinclusiveness of statutes looking at a level of review that is not deferential. You dont hold Congress to the standard of having gotten it right. OConnor is not looking to give that degree of deference to Congress.  The more you think Congress is given wide latitude in spending powers, the more you agree with Breyer that Congress will be able to do what they cant do directly indirectly through the spending power.  If Congress is going to regulate under the spending power, they have to come up with money. The practical limitation is the ability to raise funds. But how much of a constraint is that really? As you approach the tax-bearing possibility of citizens through the feds, then what taxes would be left over for the states? Would this be unconstitutional?  Look at the spending power case in 8th circuit... Constraints (from South Dakota v. Dole 1987 feds can put limits on $ given to states w/o binding to enumerated powers) General welfare Hamiltonian constraint in the general welfare. Rhenquist says that general welfare determination has to be looked at with great deference to Congress.  Specific conditions When spending is conditioned on certain kinds of actions, the conditions have to be made very specific so the states can plainly chose. Related to fed interests The constraints have to be related to the federal interest at stake genuine relation to national programmatic interests Cant be otherwise unconstitutional What Congress is asking states to do when they are getting federal funds cant be something that is otherwise unconstitutional. No compulsion state has to be able to say no There cant be compulsion but compulsion defined how? Is it compulsion if by not accepting the conditions of spending you lose federal funds for important programs that all of your economic competitor states have? At what point does the threat of losing funds become coercive? The states have to be able to consent or refuse federal program.  Does it have to be coercive for all states or only for one to be unconstitutional?  Mild encouragement isnt compulsion Taxing Butler case instance in which Congress mechanism for dealing with problems in agricultural markets as a way of generating behavior that it wanted control of production.  Congress can tax, but its taxation has to be a genuine revenue raising measure rather than a regulatory measure in disguise. Raises questions about whether we are analyzing Congressional purposes, means/ends rationality. Question is whether revenue that is being produced bears a close enough relationship to the statute.  Historian Congress can tax and spend only within enumerated powers.  Hamilton taxing and spending for general welfare stands on its own, and powers wont be found in enumerated powers, but instead in growing and changing body of understanding what the general welfare and national interest is.  Treaty power Authority in realm of domestic policy doesnt have much case law.  Question is whether Congress can expand its own powers to regulate domestically by committing itself in treaties to perform acts that would not otherwise be within the power of Congress to perform.  What is Congress authority under specific constitutional provisions? Does state sovereignty limit congressional power? What limits, if any, exist on Congress ability to delegate legislative power? McCulloch v. Maryland and broad federal legislative power History Madison and his switch in position from Republican under TJ to Federalist Madison was the central actor in legal challenge he argued for a limited view of powers of Congress under Article II, Section 8. But when Madison wrote under Federalist #44 he took the opposite position supporting broad Congressional power.  It was not generally known who the author of each federalist paper at this point the rumor circulating about #44 was that it had been written by Hamilton, so Madison could stealthily change his position.  The notes on the debate about the constitutional convention were also not available at this point the framers understood that their specific intents ought not to be the center of importance the document itself was.  What this also meant was that there was a group of insiders and outsiders the outsiders had a disadvantage of not knowing what had happened some sources were tacitly part of the interpretation but were not available to others.  Madison did not have a plan of his own for a national economy, so strict constructionism was his ideological escape valve. Where was the energy for the new development supposed to come from the federal govt, private enterprise, the states?  Ideological debate about whether Congress had power to establish bank By 1819, it was only an ideological debate as to whether Congress had the power, since practicality dictated that there be a bank.  The War of 1812 showed that the absence of a central bank was detrimental to the govt , but there still remained many challenges to the idea of a bank, both in ability for govt to establish the bank and whether the bank was needed (many problems with the bank in 1816, 1817, and 1818 poor mgmt problems and flawed institution).  In Marbury, Marshall had ignored precedent and had derived judicial review from reason and the structure of the constitution, but in McCulloch he also ignores precedent his own of several years earlier with 5 years of broad Congressional power.  But his past case was somewhat trivial and realized that relying only on precedent would have weak way of deciding the case he knew that this big controversial case required a grand decision.  Facts of the case State govts angry at banks monetary policies for aggravating serious depression, especially b/c bank called in loans owed by the states.  Some states banned bank and others taxed it, like MD.  Bank of US refused to pay MD tax, and John James (Treasurer of MD) sued for himself and the State of MD for failure to pay tax.  Issues Federalism scope of Congressional power v. state power Role of the states and their governmental institutions as constitutional interpreters if there is a departmental theory of the constitution, how do states operate in interpreting the constitution? Is there a conflict between state and feds in interpreting, or do we view them as having a role in interpreting? Federal Legislative power analysis Does Congress have power to create bank? Historical practice established power of Congress to establish bank cant be unprejudiced by prior practice, has been recognized by many legislatures. ( This is a common practice in US SC to look to systematic, unbroken practices. But why should practice have normative significance when question had never before been posed?? First Congress enacted bank after great debate and deliberation. First Congress was more familiar with original intent behind constitution Approved by executive who was very intelligent Would be a bold statement to assert that the first adoption of the bank had been unconstit. Refutation of compact federalism - that states retain ultimate sovereignty b/c they ratified constit and ceded their power only in certain areas. Power of constit. comes from act of compact between sovereign and independent states. Powers of general govt should be delegated by the states, who alone possess supreme dominion. If states are sovereign, then they would possess veto power.  Compact federalism argues limited power for the govt, and it is not necessarily the case that in situations of conflict what the federal govt says ought to get any more credit than what the state govts said.  It was the people who ratified the constitution, and the people are sovereign, not the states. Govt proceeds directly from the people, is ordained and established in the name of the people...The assent of the States, in their sovereign capacity, is implied, in calling a convention...But the people were at perfect liberty to accept or reject it; and their act was final. It required not the affirmance, and could not be negatived, by the state govts But what of constit being ratified by the States, not the people?? If ratification is a revolutionary process, then you could think that states somehow dissolve. But it was very important that states have individual ratification votes the population was not pooled.  Marshall treats this as just administrative ease, but this is highly contested.  Does the idea of one American people predate ratification?  Popular sovereignty of the 18th century held that sovereignty rested only in one entity the federalists tried to reason that the power rested in the people to lessen the conflict between state and federal govt.  Marshall uses this to say that the People ratified the constitution and that they happened to be assembled in their states (easier), but that the power rests in the common mass, not in the independent states.  Congress is not limited only to those acts specified in the Constitution; Congress may choose any means, not prohibited by the Constitution, to carry out its lawful authority. (Para 17) Broad description of federal power even though bank is not among enumerated powers, is not dispositive as to Congress power to establish it. [a] constit, to contain an accurate detail of all the subdivisions of which its great powers will admit, and of all the means by which they may be carried into execution, would partake of the prolixity of a legal code... Once an enumerated power is given, Congress must have been given the power to facilitate the means to bring it about Congress should get to choose the most appropriate means, or should Congress compromise when it might cause conflict with the states Rejection of strict interpretation of Necessary and proper clause means/ends fit (Para 38) Let the ends be legitimate, let it be within the scope of the constitution, and all means which are appropriate, which are plainly adapted to that end, which are not prohibited, but consist with the letter and spirit of the constitution, are constitutional.  What about necessary meaning INDISPENSABLE? Marshall reads necessary as desirable or useful b/c the nature of a constitution is that it is to endure and to be adapted to crises of human affairs. Necessary and proper is placed within Article I 8, which expands Congress powers, instead of Article I 9, which limits Congress powers. The terms of Article I 8 purport to enlarge federal power, not diminish it.  30: Power to establish post offices and roads creates right to punish people who steal mail. Is it necessary that the same people who established post carry it out? Is it necessary that mail crimes are federal rather than states?  Marshall if there is something that is of strong interest to feds, it not ought to have to depend on states, it should function completely independently.  But a system could also be created that the states are closer to the people, more democratic, and the feds not ought be able to duplicate institutions and laws that exist in the states just to avoid dealing with the states.  What does a particular means being consistent with the letter and spirit of the constitution mean?  Does that limit the constitution or expand it?  Can there be things not within letter, but within spirit of constitution? When talking about adaptation, are we talking about Congressional intent or an analysis of means/ends fit apart from the question of intent?  32: when the govt would carry its powers into execution by means not vindictive in their nature?... Is the MD tax constitutional? Power to create bank included a power to preserve its existence. Power to tax is power to destroy power to destroy may render useless the power to create. So MD cant tax bank, b/c it could greatly impeded its operation and even destroy it. Marshall still allows states to impose property taxes on bank property, so he is not creating an absolutist views.  Marshall is looking for equal treatment MD is not in the position to uniquely press federal institutions. Federalism has to accommodate powers of federal and state, but he is avoiding explicit references to this.  State tax on bank was essentially tax that reached into sovereignty of other states, since bank operated in many states. Those other states had no say in tax, so they were being taxed without representation.  Other Issues  Marshall on deference to Congress (Paras 4&5) Not really an issue of civil liberties rather it involves the structure of govt The great principles of liberty are not at stake, so easier to defer to Congress Becomes foundation of New Deal settlement more deference on structural questions or economic questions than civil liberties questions Congress had expertise in this area in creating legislation around national institutions Many of the members of constitution were founders and engaged in serious debate on constitutional issues Difficulty of issue Was not a difficult, real constitutional issue Congress had reached agreement (most of Senate agreed) Already had had many many debates about the Act, the bank had been permitted to expire and then Congress revived it Congress had deliberated long and hard the bill had been fairly debated and the constitution already considered in their deliberations Popular constitutional and acquiescence to historical practice Expectation interest and economic reliance vested economic rights There has been acquiescence to the presence of the bank, so there is an expectation interest that has been created on which a great investment has been made.  The opponents of the bank have already lost in the political sphere shows ambivalence about bank, that there was never a quieting of protest.  Popular constitutionalism and acquiesence:  Although there was an acquiescence to the bank, there was still not an acquiescence to the constitutionality of the bank. But action was important in creating constitutional principle that those who were in opposition to the bank should have been influenced by the continuing existence of the bank.  Rule of recognition how do we recognize an act of constitutional lawmaking? Is there a difference? Does the win (the existence of the bank) mean: That the will of the people has been exerted to interpret the constitution an act of constitutional interpretation The people decided they needed a bank a pure act of pragmatism. If the country needs something to survive, then does the constitution always mean the right to go forward, to persevere rather than strictly interpret the document? Cooperative Federalism (Para 14) Para 14: How Supreme is the federal govt in its sphere of power? Do the spheres of power overlap? Can the power to regulate commerce have implications in the states in terms of its police power is there an area of overlap?  There could be a notion that in the area of overlap, neither entity can in a constitutionalist federalist structure be supreme in its own sphere each has to comport itself with due respect to the interests of the other cooperative federalism.  How would the Marshall court have reviewed Jeffersons decision on the LA purchase? Is our view of the constitution different under times of great national importance (the purchase, war) than under normal times?  Does the fact that one branch of the govt was allowed to exercise power under a particular exigent circumstance mean that they should continue to be allowed to do so through the principle of acquiescence and settled expectations?  How does the Court feel about the reliability of the political process in terms of legislating constitutional laws? Marshall felt that the first period was a particularly serious constitutional interpretative process the document was much fresher and many of the founders were still involved in the legislature.  Do the people who wrote the constitution see a great difference between legislating that and other statutes?  Are there clear lines between constitution-making and other legislation? How much of a political process was constitution-making. Federal Legislation under the Commerce Clause Overview Article I 8 18 clauses enumeration specific powers of Congress Congress shall have power to regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian tribes... Authority for broad range of fed legis focus of most SC decisions. Historical overview Gibbons broadest grant of commerce clause power; Court then never overturned Congress legis based on commerce clause 1937 struck down New Deal legis. (Schecter Poultry and Carter Coal) 1937 1995: No legis struck down based on commerce clause 1995: Lopez guns in schools 2000: Morrison VAWA struck down Questions Court is considering What is commerce? One stage of business, or all aspects of business? What does among several states mean; is it limited to direct effects or any effect? Does 10th amendment limit Congressional action in this area? Is object to be regulated typically subject to state control? Gibbons v. Ogden and Definition of Commerce Power Facts Two guys given monopoly over steamboats in NY waters by NY legis. Steamboats operated between NYC and NJ. Gibbons said that had right to operate ferry b/c he was licensed under federal law as vessels in the coasting trade. What Marshall was doing was beginning the conversation about the much more common situation when Congress has not enacted legislation pursuant to one of its constitutional powers. Congress really had not legislated many things they were not aggressively using all of the power that Marshall was assuming for it.  Field preemption - Most cases in the early 19th century were coming up under the dormant Commerce clause dormant Congress where the state was legislating and whether the existence of the power of Congress precluded the state from the legislating even in the absence of Congress never having taken action in the field.  Legal Issues What is commerce? Ogden limited to traffic, buying and selling or interchange of commodities SC: Commerce is traffic, but is something more: intercourse. The commercial intercourse between nations, and parts of nations, in all its branches,...and is regulated by prescribing rules for carrying on that intercourse. Includes all phases of business, including navigation.  Economic development involved both the movement of goods and the movement of people people looking for job opportunities or slaves. People were considered commodities in some ways during this period b/c there werent other areas of law to cover the areas welfare or employment law.  What influence do the objects being regulated have in the interpretation?  What is Among the Several states? Three possible choices -> court chooses intermediate intermingled with Limited expressly to interstate activities intrastate was beyond scope of power. Among means intermingled with. Commerce among the states cant stop at external boundary line of each state, but may be introduced into the interior. Among means concerning or affecting more than one state. Requires more line drawing and case-by-case inquiry into effects of particular activity, as well as consideration of level of impact direct or indirect, substantial or insubstantial.  In the midst of from dictionary definitions. Then everything could have been regd b/c in midst of US. Congress can regulate intrastate commerce if it had impact on interstate activities But, in regulating commerce with foreign nations, the power of Congress does not stop at juris lines of several States...The power of Congress, then, whatever it may be, must be exercised within the territorial juris of several states.  Does State sovereignty limit Congressional power? Congress has plenary power once its acted (Supremacy Clause) and its legislation preempts state legislation.  This power, like all others vested in Congress, is complete in itself, may be exercised to its utmost extent, and acknowledges no limitations, other than are prescribed in the constitution. If...the sovereignty of Congress, though limited to specified objects, is plenary as to those objects, the power over commerce with foreign nations, and among the several states, is vested in Congress as absolutely as it would be in a single govt. Congress has complete authority to regulate all commerce between states. When Congress is acting, it can regulate in the same way as it could if no state govts existed.  Sole check on Congress is thus political process states have some leverage w/ Congress through Senate.  How would the purposes of Congressional regulation limit commerce power? Inspection, quarantine, and health laws form a portion of that immense mass of legislation, which embraces everything within the territory of a state, not surrendered to the national govt...No direct general power over these objects is granted to congress and, consequently they remain subject to state legislation. If the legislative power of the Union can reach them, it must be for national purposes. Scope of national power may depend not only on substance of regulation, but also on the purposes for which the regulation was adopted the congruence between purposes underlying regulation and the constitutional grant of power.  Marshall in McCulloch if Congress passes laws on objects not entrusted to it, the court would have to strike them down. How is this at odds with the phrase in (a)? Dormant Commerce Clause - What are state powers if Congress has not acted? Are different depending on whether Congress has issued legislation of its own pursuant to commerce power on subject matter in question b/c you can answer questions about state/federal power w/o going through whole exposition of exclusivity of commerce power.  States and affirmative power Affirmative grant of power is not exclusive, but grant of full power is inconsistent and incompatible with the existence of right in another. Grant of power to one sovereign prevents action of all others that would perform the same operation on the same thing.  Exclusivity of the commerce power Gives Marshalls opening salvo on whether commerce power is exclusive does Article I, 8 implicitly say what it doesnt explicitly say Some powers enumerated are exclusive and others are not e.g. taxation is not exclusive, but establishing federal courts inferior to the Supreme Court is exclusive.  Any commercial regulation not expressly forbidden to which state had original power (prior to constitution) is allowed.  Article I, Section 8 says that Congress can legislate from the General Welfare of the people Marshall still reserves police powers to the state power for public health, well-being, and morals.  General welfare legislation was thought to belong to the States and if you took Article I, Section 8, then it would oust and exclude any state legislation in the area.  But you could also read it as just giving Congress the power to lay and collect taxes.  Types of exclusivity Purposes even if end is a legitimate one, state could achieve its purposes through means which infringe on Congress power.  Taxation distinction from commerce Indispensable to states existence Can reside in and be exercised in different authorities at the same time Is infinitely divisible Power to take in another what is necessary for certain purposes Marshall in Willson v. Black Bird Creek Marsh Unless state law comes in conflict with constitution or a law of US, is an affair between govt of DE and its citizens, of which this court can take no cognizance. If Congress had passed law to control state legis over small navigable creeks, then it would be unconstit. Counsel for D characterized dam as a health measure under control of the states.  The States Police Powers as a Constraint on the National Commerce Power Mayor of City of NY v. Miln Mayor of the City of New York v. Miln (1837) Development of dual federalism doctrine Historical Background Legislation that was aimed at the general health and welfare of the people, but it intervenes at the point of entry of ships from foreign nations or other states into New York.  At the time, there was no right recognized to freedom of movement and states often put up barriers to entry for paupers, slaves, free blacks (especially slave states), and vagabonds people with no obvious means of support.  At this time, foreign immigration was not the domain of the federal govt comprehensive immigration policies and legislation did not emerge until decades later.   The constitution only talks about the federal govt having naturalization power, but not explicit control over immigration. Many people wanted to go elsewhere, but had to stop in New York and work prior to going to their final destination.  Ruling As long as a state is using means to get to an ends that is allowed to them, then even if the means infringes on Congressional commerce power, the State is still allowed to employ it. Objects of state power that concern ordinary course of affairs, concern the lives, liberties, and properties of the people, internal order and prosperity of state.  Barbour also particularly justifies New Yorks action New York is uniquely Americas global city and has to deal with the high level of immigration.  How do the objects of commerce regulated relate to power of Congress? Federalist #45: Objects of state that which concern ordinary course of affairs, concern the lives, liberties and properties of the people, internal orders and prosperity of state, are reserved to the several states.  Person concerned was w/in territory of the state How does the delineation of power fall to the states? Jurisdiction w/in the limits of the states The location of the dispute was w/in state Benefits went directly to the states Purpose of the statute was the welfare of the state The means were directly related to the ends What is not specifically delegated to Congress is left to the states (10th amendment) State has same undeniable and unlimited juris over persons and things, within its territorial limits, as any foreign nation; where that juris is not surrendered or restrained by constit of US.  It is the right and duty of the state to look after the welfare of its people.  States had ability to close its borders to paupers and other vagabonds, since they would contribute to general moral decline. Dissent Treats Marshall as saying that once a power has been delineated, then Congress has exclusive power. NY is reaching out beyond its territorial limits.   Means too much withdrawn from the authority of the ends the power granted lose their power to be employed.  A much more nationalist view that the more power you give the states in the arena of commerce means that international and interstate conflicts will arise.  Interstate and Foreign Commerce and Personal Mobility Groves v. Slaughter (1841) Are slaves items of commerce? Historical Background MS didnt want to compete with the outside market for slaves wanted to protect its own market, so they prohibited importation of slaves in their territory.  There were strategic judgments to be made on broader principles some states, like OH, wanted Congress to abolish slavery. But that wasnt happening quickly, so they wanted to be able to adopt all possible stances to legislate against slavery.  So states rights becomes a rallying point for anti-slave states to abolish the slave trade and slavery.  If police powers couldnt cure state legislation that had an impact on interstate commerce, if Congress had exclusive power to regulate commerce, the anti-slave states didnt have much room to operate and the federal govt could force more cooperation from anti-slave states. Both sides are using states rights arguments to keep the federal govt out... Ruling Slaves were an item of commerce, and thus their entry could not be prohibited Is not a regulation of police power, it is aimed at introduction of slaves as merchandise, so its purpose is to prefent them from being subjects of intercourse with other states when introduced for purpose of sale.  McClean dilemma since he was from an abolitionist state If slaves were item of commerce, then Congress could prohibit interstate slave trade through commerce power. So slaves are not item of commerce, but instead are persons. Power of slavery then belongs to states to control or to prohibit entry Baldwin States have power to determine status of slaves, but if they determine that they are property, then they are subjects of commerce and traffic can be regulated by congress.  Being property, the owners are protected from violations of rights of property by congress under 5th amendment.  If slaves are transported through free states, the laws of that state cant take away vested property rights granted by another state.  Cooley v. Board of Wardens (1851) state govts retain control even where Congress has legis.  Background PA law required vessels entering and leaving harbor in Philly to engage local pilot to guide them through harbor. There was a penalty for noncompliance. Action was for retrieval of penalty for vessels engaged in coastwise trade between NY and Philly. Is the object of commerce under federal regulation? Navigation is a settled legitimate object. Is the purpose/ends within Congressional power? Regulation of qualifications of pilots, modes and times of rendering services, are regs of navigation and hence of commerce Did grant of power to congress deprive states of sovereignty is the entire field of navigation regulation preempted? When nature of power granted to congress preempts entire field, then subjects of that power are of such a nature as to require exclusive legislation by commerce. When subjects are in their nature national, or admit only of one uniform system or plan of reg, then they can by their nature require exclusive legis. by congress Commerce embraces a vast field with many objects; some demanding single uniform rule and others demanding diversity to meet local needs. Act of 1789 says that until congress acts, states can legis power is local and not national. Need different systems of regulation. Congress has regulated in the area, but has not manifested intent to regulate entire field and deprive states of any power. Historical consequence practice has been that states have regulated pilots for 60 years.  Exclusive federal power would deprive states of ability to change to fit needs of growing commercial reality.  The Commerce Clause in the Progressive Era History Progressive era despite Lochner being laissez faire, it would be a mistake to characterize this era as being laissez faire.  The administrative agency became the tool of choice for progressive leaders looking to bring scientific expertise to bear on different regulatory problems the beginning point of the regulatory state.  The big gap is the treatment of commerce clause cases between Lochner and the New Deal it is a broken up exposure to commerce clause doctrine in different periods.  General Structure What Congress can regulate under Commerce clause The regulation of things, objects, in commerce interstate. (Darby, Heart of Atlanta)  There can be Congressional regulation of things in Commerce. Upheld Champion v. Ames lottery tickets are moving and thus are objects of commerce that are being moved in interstate commercial traffic.  Regulation of the instrumentalities of commerce or persons or things in interstate commerce Highways, navigational channels, railroads (legislating width of gauge), sunken ships Congress can regulate things or processes that substantially affect interstate commerce or are related to it (Jones & Laughlin)  Hammer looks at directness, but seems a formalistic distinction rather than realistic distinction Lopez develops test for this category whether something substantially affects interstate commerce Examples extortionate credit transactions (Perez), restaurants using substantial interstate supplies (McClung), inns and hotels catering to interstate guests (Heart of Atlnata), production and consumption of homegrown wheat (Wickard). ( Where activity substantially affects interstate commerce, legislation regulating activity is allowed.  Champion v. Ames (1903) Lottery statute is being challenged prohibiting transportation of lottery tickets across state lines. The lottery company was centered in Paraguay. Analogy of placing lottery tickets in the stream of commerce and placing unhealthful objects (diseased cattle) in the stream of commerce.  The court really doesnt care so much what the methods are of the regulation as long as the regulation fits within the sphere of commerce.  Individual states arent squarely allowed to regulate within their sphere (states that dont want lotteries) will be forced into a certain position b/c of competition from other states people within the state will be importing lottery tickets. Hammer v. Dagenhart (1918) Child labor father was suing to strike down law that prevented objects built with child labor from being imported into other states. Goals of keeping children out of the workforce to put them in school  Legislation at the state level would be ineffective b/c of interstate commerce states will be more competitive who allow child labor b/c the labor costs are much lower. If the federal govt cant do this, then noone can.  But the stakes are much higher in this case. Holmes says to look at the methods used keeping impure items out of the flow of commerce. If the distinction just so happens to be that manufacturers no longer employ child labor, then those are just indirect effects. But we arent going to worry about the indirect effects and thus just allow Congress to legislate. He wants to give effect to a national majority sentiment against child labor to mask what is really going on.  The Commerce Clause under the New Deal Historical Background Mass unemployment Groups started competing downwards for jobs lower down on the foodchain that had traditionally been done by disfavored ethnic groups.  It meant that black men, women, and other ethnic groups had their jobs displaced by white men. The depression fell particularly hard on groups that were facing ethnic and gender prejudices.  Hobo phenomenon major issues with people migrating and looking for work whose responsibility was it going to be to take care of them.  Mass period of labor unrest With many strikes taking place and serious questions about socialist principles whether there was something inherently corrupt about capitalism.  Some of the labor unrest was left organized, but labor movement was massive influence during this period. There were unions of the unemployed.  The depression was a global phenomenon, so there was a major economic downturn in Europe as well so the US could look at other countries such as Germany, which had already established broad social safety nets.  There was also a debate about whether the changes should be long-term or short-term just a quick response to an emergency or a major change in the country.  FDR political history Hoover gets tossed out by Roosevelt in 1932 FDR drew on the Brain Trust from Columbia that he drew on (FDR was guvner of NY).  FDR did not have a coherent economic policy, but instead was improvising without a coherent strategy, and who were running off in many different directions and there was a lack of coordination between agencies.  Huge amount of legislation passed in a very short period of time within months of FDR coming into office. Lawyers were not a part of the legislative drafting process and not drafted with constitutional limits in mind. Then there was a change into a well-lawyered set of policies as the New Deal era went on.  Conventional Legal story Legal story is conventionally that you had a carry-over court from the Lochner era with 5-6 conservative judges insisting upon a laissez faire view of American economics that trumped the needs of the people in this emergency period and prevented the fed govt from using the Depression as an excuse for instituting centralized economic control.  It was only after FDR threatened to pack the court that the court succumbed to political pressure and agreed to uphold the legislation. This story clearly shows that the Lochner era was wrong and that the New Deal era was right.  The New Deal is a central part of American constitutional history and that those decisions become a part of con law despite the fact that there was considerable political influence in those courts decisions. Even if it takes political pressure, the important part is that the court got it right in the end.  Internalist v. Externalist views of the courts decisions Internalist: Cushman there are perfectly got internal (internal to law) that make it easy to avoid external explanation to look at political factors.  The shift was not as a result of court-packing or historical you have to find more legal doctrinal approaches. The fact that West Coast Hotel was voted on before the court-packing plan was announced is very strong evidence.  Does it put too much weight on the West Coast Hotel conference? There was already some court-packing discussion in the presses and some criticixm of the courts decisions.  Drafting of original statutes was so terrible no attention to constitutionality. Problems of constitutionality may have lead court to question whether FDR was even taking constitution in mind at all. The New Deals own policys shift from corporatist to more govt controlled and more attention to constitutionality may have influenced.  Also a shifting of where the constitutional power lies power to respond to changes of country with its needs. Nothing in Judges opinions to suggest that the shift was only relevant to this time period.  Courts opinion of constitutional thought going on in other institutional branches shifts with time.  Cushman was persuasive in stating that Court knew that FDRs court packing plan did not have popular support and would probably not succeed. People wanted to live in a country with a respect for the rule of law.  Externalist: you have to look at the political pressure and history to understand the rulings of the court.  Ackerman the Courts shift was as a response to politics court-packing, the 1936 election, the Congress. Should we view the New Deal as more cabined in its time not as projections towards the future.  The Court managed, through Schecter, to change the content of the New Deal content. So Ackerman sees it as very important to his story that the administration changed course. Knowing that you no longer have the choice to pursue NIRA means that you have to change your policy.  Evaluation  Whether branches can be trusted as co-equal institutional actors. Legal Realist Is there a realist approach Judge Van Devanteer was going to retire at the end of the term and that would provide him with his reliable fifth vote. Justices give up on points when they realize that theyre going to lose over the long time that very, very soon the votes were going to shift, and do you wait for the new vote or do you start formulating a new type of jurisprudence.  Sutherlands political career he was more a liberal in many issues than generally portrayed.  Lasting significance:  Are these shifts irreversible?  What sort of lasting significance do they have? Evaluation of Depression There is a strong consensus that the legislation alleviated human suffering, but the thing that got us out of the Depression was WWII and the upswing of industrial production that occurred.  It is too easy to just say that FDR solved it. It is not the courts job to decide the wisdom of the legislation, but rather just to judge its constitutionality.  But can you discuss the constitutionality of the legislation without looking to the wisdom of the legislation?  Members of the Supreme Court during the New Deal Conservatives  Swing   Liberals Sutherland      Roberts   Cardozo Van Devanter  Hughes   Brandeis McReynolds         Stone Butler Railroad Retirement Board v. Alton (1935) strikes down RR Retirement Act on grounds the economic security of retired RR workers is not about interstate commerce Background Older workers on RR industry and job shortages, so by through Railroad Retirement Act of 1934 created a compulsory retirement age and pension plan.  FDRs later court-packing plan was announced after Alton and the rationale was that the justices were too old. Roberts actually says that there isnt sufficient evidence about the inefficiency of older workers in the decision.  Commerce Clause applicability Would think that Commerce clause would be at work here, since RRs are very much instrumentalities of commerce and labor unrest can dramatically affect commerce. Reasoning  The Court rejected the plan, b/c it extended back to former RR workers already retired.  Was mechanism for shoring up income stream to past and present workers in RR industry.  So Roberts saw this as overreaching the means of applying it to retired workers meant that the end was not just to make sure that commerce was not interrupted.  Thought that there was not a close connection between means and ends this allows them to not just analyze the wisdom of the end, but instead to concentrate on the means/ends relationship.  Hughes dissent: RR companies have adopted pension plans on their own way ahead of the rest of the industry in terms of labor relations. Welfare capitalism to increase longevity and efficiency of the workforce.  Schecter Poultry (1935) Strikes down NIRA b/c of commerce clause + non-delegation problems Background of legislation Non-delegation side of Schecter not discussed in this excerpt.  NIRA (National Industrial Recovery Act) the first wave of legislation in the 100 day program.  It itself was an administrative agency, but involved a dual delegation.  Congress delegated to NRA power to then delegate to committees made up of industry, labor, and consumers to forge industrial codes for particular industries.  They would be self-regulating, and the codes would set terms of business competition among competitors to avoid ruthless competition cooperative rate scale process that would be patently illegal under antitrust act and also would set minimum wages and maximum hours and other elements of labor conditions applicable to industry.  After the boards set up the codes, the fed govt and NRA would approve them, evaluate them, and approve them, and then set up private groups from NRA to be code authority that would enforce codes on industry as a whole.  Court expedited hearing process so that they would decide this one very quickly right after it was passed.  What this case was doing more than others was putting the New Deal on the chopping block the NRA was the centerpiece of the New Deal, but there was already dissatisfaction with it.  Schecter was a unanimous decision, so Congress was not convincing anyone of its wisdom.  Facts This was about local chicken slaughter places the chickens came from New Jersey chicken farms and were sold in the local New York markets.  Schecter was a kosher chicken slaughter place.  Reasoning Commerce Clause applicability Commerce meant that objects were still in stream of commerce transported across lines.  Fugitive slaves if you pass through free territories then you are still in stream of commerce and not yet at rest.  Then when you come to stay the objects are at rest, and are no longer in the stream, then you are subject to local law.  The chickens in this case had come to roost and were no longer in stream of commerce was too local.  Nothing had close to this govt approved, industry-based regulation. Problems associated with this: Industry is not uniform in size or needs, and the code formation process was run by large corporations create barriers to smaller producers entering the market. There were fears that the Board would be dominated by large corporations and hence make rules favorable to themselves.  There are some unionized industries, but where there is no organized force speaking for labor there wasnt adequate representation. The consumer board was not effective in representing consumers.  Court on Direct v. Indirect affects on commerce You cannot distinguish between the two simply by looking at the magnitude of the problem.  Even if the labor strikes are very bad in the local markets, it still doesnt have a direct affect on commerce and is therefore not under control of Congress.  There cannot be any intervening third parties or actions necessary to complete the affect for it to be a direct affect.  Argument for realism rather than semantics of direct or indirect effects FDR The argument was that labor conditions in the distributorships had the possibility to affect interstate commerce.  If there are major labor unrest at every production site for chickens, then it is unpragmatic and unrealistic to say that there are no effects you can be certain then that the indirect affects are more direct.  Magnitude can eventually affect whether it is indirect or direct. Cardozos dissent in Carter coal A great principle of constitutional law is not capable of being expressed in an adjective you have to take a more realistic and more formalistic view on what is impacting commerce.  Yet Carter doesnt buy this argument in Schecter, so FDR clearly did not show what lines could be drawn between local and federal control to convince him.  Race to the bottom argument If one state raises labor standards in one state, then distributors will move out of that state and into another.  So you create this competitive environment between states such that states will not be able to raise labor standards.  Butler case (1934) agricultural production is not interstate commerce, ends has to still be legitimate under taxing and spending power Agricultural Adjustment Act (1933):  Statute was aimed at supporting prices paid to farmers for their crops by reduction of farmed acreage Tax set up on processors of food that produced excess commodities and money raised under federal funds was used to pay farmers not to produce on their lands.  Holding and the Commerce Clause  Agricultural production is not interstate commerce Rejects attempt to justify statute under taxing and spending powers, since end, not only means, must be w/in Congress enumerated powers.  Evaluation Question should the money go to the owners of the land rather than those who worked the land? What about sharecroppers and lessees. The property owner or the source of the labor for the land? Whether taxing and spending for general welfare is out of enumerated powers of Congress or whether there is no limit.  10th amendment any powers that are not enumerated to Congress are left to the people and the states.  Court specifically does not take this question on. Carter Coal (1936) Bituminous Coal Conservation Act of 1935 first statute in series of cases that are enacted after Schecter.  Establishes coal boards to set minimum prices and permit employee collective bargaining Holding (Sullivan) Price-fixing provisions are not severable from the general statute, so he strikes down the whole statute.  Reasoning Commerce Power Doesnt production of coal have a big impact on interstate commerce generating fuel for all industry?  Court does not think that the line is being drawn well here extraction for mining, agriculture, and manufacture are thought to be local in nature and regulating labor conditions is too indirect.  Cardozos dissent in Carter coal A great principle of constitutional law is not capable of being expressed in an adjective you have to take a more realistic and more formalistic view on what is impacting commerce.  Yet Carter doesnt buy this argument in Schecter, so FDR clearly did not show what lines could be drawn between local and federal control to convince him.  Jones & Laughlin (1937) Allowing labor relations and manufacturing to be objects of commerce clause power Wagner Act Wagner Act is the statute that establishes the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) it was aimed to convince court that effects that widespread labor unrest would have on commerce would put labor relations under the power of Congress.  Legal strategies of the New Deal cases In the NRA, the litigation went on chaotically there was no thought to how cases could be well-designed so that the Court would not overrule it.  So for NLRB, the test case was a large national steel producer b/c it was thought it might be easier to show the effects on commerce. But it shouldnt have mattered, since the NLRB applied to all companies, big and small.  Great example of particular company as interstate for test case as could possibly be. But how much does outcome of case depend on that on having a case about a single integrated company? Test cases Bring up case with tangled web of interstate connections, but you might be worried that a case as strong as Jones & Laughlin would be limited to its facts and not be as generally applicable.  Jones & Laughlin was not the only case brought as a test case three courts of Appeals had struck down parts of the NLRA with different defendants. One of them was a small mens clothing manufacturer which operated in VA - the court sided with the administration and cited the size, importance, and character of clothing industry and the interstate importance of a strike.  The court in this cases emphasizes the interstate nature of the industry rather than the company. With Jones, the nature of the company itself would have brought it within the interstate umbrella.  They were selecting a set of cases, each of which was going to add a different dimension to the decision. The existence of other cases help explain the courts comfort level with NLRB.  Commerce Clause applicability Was the steel industry in general an integrated industry that automatically affected interstate commerce? Presumption of good behavior on part of NLRB The Court was going to assume that the NLRB will pay attention to statutory language and to the Courts cases and will not be unduly influenced by Congress findings and legislative history. That the Board will do its job and consider each case individually, which could then be judicially reviewed.  NLRB presumes coverage for the industry and so sets up exceptions certain industries dont have a large enough volume of trade for coverage. So the regulations do list exceptions.  The Courts was expecting factual analysis of each industry, but it didnt happen. Economists would have had to do a detailed analysis. The opinions of the Court about the NLRB changed very rapidly accused of being communists in the 1950s.  Ruling Commerce power trying to synch with prior opinions The fundamental principle is that the power to regulate commerce is the power to enact all appropriate legislation for its protection and advancement; to adopt measures to promote its growth and insure its safety; to foster, protect, control and restrain.  The power is plenary and may be exerted to protect interstate commerce no matter what the source of the dangers which threaten it. (Schecter).  Adopting legal realist position espoused by Cardozo rather than straight formalistic direct/indirect approach Giving into practical rather than pure legal indirect/direct framework We have often said that interstate commerce itself is a practical conception. It is equally true that interferences with that commerce must be appraised by a judgment that does not ignore actual experience.  Still going with indirect/direct, but considering degree Experience has abundantly demonstrated that recognition of the right of employees to self-organization and to have representatives of their own choosing for the purpose of collective bargaining is often an essential condition of industrial peace. Refusal to confer and negotiate has been one of the most prolific causes of strife...  In view of respondents far-flung activities, it is idle to say that the effect would be indirect or remote. It is obvious that it would be immediate and might be catastrophic. We are asked to shut our eyes to the plainest facts of our national life and to deal with the question of direct and indirect effects in an intellectual vacuum. Because there may be but indirect and remote effects upon interstate commerce in connection with a host of local enterprises throughout the country...When industries organize themselves on a national scale, making their relation to interstate commerce the dominant factor in their activities, how can it be maintained that their industrial relations constitute a forbidden field into which Congress may not enter... Doctrine Foundation in Jones & Laughlin being made for Darby, where the race to the bottom argument is used. Congress does not want to see interstate commerce as a method for destroying progressive state legislation.  It puts labor practices in manufacturing squarely within the powers of Congress and eliminates the two major arguments against its regulation: Labor relations is not commerce Manufacturing is not commerce United States v. Darby Much more deference to Congress, race to the bottom accepted as valid argument Background Arising under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, which prescribed minimum wage and maximum hours for employees engaged in the production of goods related to interstate commerce.  Regulation of wages and hours, not collective bargaining/labor relations like in Jones & Laughlin. Congress is still regulating problems breakdowns in the market economy due to the race to the bottom argument,  Reasoning  Commerce clause power Extensive refutation of idea that its the courts job to make sure that Congress had fundamental motive to regulate commerce.  There can be overlapping methods and purposes of Congress and state police powers. Continue to ground statute in desire not to have interstate commerce used to taint competition between states for race to the bottom.  Court is still claiming that Congress motives are for commerce even if there were no prohibition on shipment, it would still be regulation of the channels of commerce.  Deference to Congress Congress no longer needs to mask its purposes can be freer in declaring its purposes. Court overturns Hammer v Dagenhart and limits part of Kohl. No longer open to question that fixing of minimum wage is w/in legis. power and is not prima facie viol. of 5th of 14th Statute is not objectionable b/c applied to both men and women Congress and severability clauses Congress is now drafting statutes with severability clauses that the Court can just overturn clauses that are unconstitutional.  By being careful in this way, Congress included clause which would prohibit shipment and transportation of goods under unfair labor conditions, as well as manufacture.  The Court thanks Congress for the severability clauses, but says that they are not necessary.  Race to the bottom The evils are the race to the bottom, and once that is the purpose, Congress can go about achieving that purpose in whatever it deems to be the best way.  Does not need to cast this as a prohibition on shipment, can just outright say that the conditions are what it seeks to regulate.  10th amendment not applicable Calls the 10th amendment a truism that all is retained which has not been surrendered.  There is nothing in the history of its adoption to suggest that it was more than declaratory of the relationship between the national and state governments...or that its purpose was other than to allay fears that the new national government might seek to exercise fully their reserved powers... Wickard v. Filburn broad interpretation of the objects of commerce; aggregating affect of activity qualifies it even though underlying activity is really on intrastate affects Background Limited agricultural production and penalized farmers for overproduction paid them to eat their surplus Commerce clause objects If there is anything that can truly thought to be local, agricultural production growing crops for your own consumption would be it. Not grown with expectation of being shipped elsewhere.  All of these statutes had exemptions in them for purely local industries domestic labor and agricultural labor. These exemptions were understood as a concession to Southern democrats for the South being able to impose different standards on its black workers. Reasoning Producing for your consumption is a large stretch, but the theory was that producing for your own consumption you are lessening your demand for agricultural products in the stream of commerce. Case stands for how far the New Deal court really went.  Even local activity that is not commerce can be regulated if it has an impact on commerce, irrespective of direct or indirect distinction.  Modern commerce clause cases and Courts new federalism jurisprudence Does federalism really protect liberty? Do we need two equally strong govts to achieve this?  If you lose some of the structural provisions (1913 17th amendment that allows for state Senators to be elected directly by the people rather than the state legislatures) Should the court say go ahead and change the constitution if the states want more power? Or does the Court generally try to limit the amount of constitutional change necessary? To allow the needs to the country to be met how much agreement does there need to be about the crisis in the country before the Court can act?  What is the crisis that the Court is reacting against? Holmes congress is the right body to respond to crisis.  What are the interests of states at the federal level? Getting incumbents reelected so they know how to play the political game of tradeoffs.  How does federalism protect liberty when the same federalism is used to deprive an individual of his federally created rights? If he has rights, then shouldnt the system provide him a remedy (Marshall)? Are govts truly sovereign when they violate the law? Arent they inviting an attack to the dignity of the sovereign that makes them immune?  If a state violates the law, doesnt it violate due process of the law? If so, why does Congress lack Reconstruction power to say that States must remedy violations and make victims whole? Is every state action entitled to immunity? If, like Garcia says, they will not look to the nature of the act in determining 10th amendment preemption, then what about FSIA? This says that states immunity is abrogated when acts are commercial in nature... What place does sovereign immunity have in a govt defined through popular sovereignty?  Reciprocity State law can give someone standing to sue feds for takings.. Is there a theory of reciprocity that fed sovereign immunity from constit torts should be reciprocated to states... New Federalism jurisprudence Between South Dakota v. Dole and Boerne comes first as indicators of courts new federalism jurisprudence. Important earlier precedent Testa v. Katt (1947) Established that if Congress is passing statute that creates cause of action, and it wants to give both state and federal courts right to adjudicate, then state court of general jurisdiction must accept federal question cases that are permitted by Congress to be allowed in state courts.   Isnt this commandeering?  New York v. US OConnor deals with this in New York v. United States by saying that the Supremacy clause really deals directly with state courts but doesnt it refer to the relationship between federal and state law, not the relationship between federal and state courts?  Somehow it is worse to press state officials, b/c state courts are passive they already have their arms open. This is different from forcing legislatures to pass laws legislatures are less passive. But what if the states have to appropriate more funds to fund federal questions on the state dockets? More judges? Etc. Using 10th amendment legislation to resist application of legislation that NY had previously supported.  Is state estopped by previous consent to legis? No... They can still resist application of fed legislation.  Alden v. Maine Fair Labor Standards Act case: Applies to the states, but cant get most of the remedies that you could get from private parties. Individual given federal rights, but cannot sue state to obtain remedy.  Could have been an occasion for the court to revisit Garcia and decide that it was wrongly decided. It could be that the Court is going incrementally and still hasnt decided how far it wants to go.  10th v. 11th amendment 11th amendment sovereign immunity from suit. 10th amendment picks up everything else about sovereignty in that these are cases that are going to determine the extent to which Congress by mandatory legislation can make the states act in ways that Congress wants them to act.  What is motivating the new federalism jurisprudence? Has something of value been lost since the New Deal with Congress? Notion of states as laboratories for new types of laws. Congress can completely preempt state law, or allow states to experiment with more protective laws but less protective ones. But even if there is no preemption, you may lose states as laboratories for non-regulation. Local-ness of states cuts both ways (gay marriage in MA) Atrophy problem We now have the wrong boundaries? Should it be regional instead of state? Cities banding together w/o rural areas? Anti-alienation/cynicism participation is more meaningful at the local level  Arguments against letting states have their way.. Didnt states already have their moment? They blew it with discrimination in the South.  Interesting and important coalitions of states getting together to pass laws and enforce existing laws. They can actually do better than we think theyre doing - Elliot Spitzer in NY. Where the action is global, international is not a problem for the federal govt to take charge.  What about environmental law in CA?  What about federal power with more respect for localness? More exceptions rules tailored to communities.  What about looking at other democracies to see what is happening?  Issue: Full faith and credit clause how and to what extent state law rules can be acknowledged by other states.  McConnel evaluating founders design. Why shift in federalism balance Founders were skewed in favor of natl power ( federal preemption doctrine 17th amendment eliminated direct state rep Technological and social change; as market expanded, so did Congress power Intellectual case for federalism ( protecting individual rights, not fed or state Why do we forbid natl measures when they advance the liberty of the people, but infringe upon the states? Why do we care about federalism? What were the original objectives/ Secure the public good Protect private rights Preserve spirit and form of popular govt Why decentralized decision making is better Reflects diversity of interests and preference of individuals in different parts of the nation (but isnt our nation no longer defined this way? That interests cut across states more than they are represented inside of them? Due to increased mobility fo workforce...) Collective action problems, externalities, or absence of economies of scale may prevent action at fed level Allocation of decision making authority to a level of govt no larger than necessary will prevent mutually disadvantageous attempts by communities to take advantage of their neighbors Nationalized decision making may adversely affect discrete minorities place burdens solely on a few states for the benefit of all Nobel laureate centralized decision making about projects of localized impact will result in excessive spending that communities would freely choose Allows for innovation and competition in govt states as laboratory for new policies State and local govts are better protectors of private rights ( but isnt factional tyranny more likely in state legislatures than in Congress?  Public choice theory Madison underestimated dangers of minority rule and defensive resources issue-oriented conjunction of fed agencies and committee staffs especially vulnerable to special interests  Liberty through mobility people can always move to different states (gays to SF) Self-interested govt self-interested rep best tackled at local level b/c popular control stronger Diffusion of power two govts will control each other and create a space of liberty Small govt inherently better Enforcement of laws folklore of small town says that social norms reinforce voluntary cooperation w/ law and overcome prisoners dilemma Nature of rep closer to people, each citizens influence is larger, reps spend more time with constituents Public spiritedness depended on willingness of citizen to sacrifice for the greater good, and substitute coercion or compulsion by large natl govt was not as good.  Rubenfeld Court is embarking on an anti-antidiscrimination agenda Like Lochner court, Court today is afraid that traditional morality is being threatened and that the country is moving towards same type of pro-labor redistributive ideology a radical reordering of social hierarchy. Definition Liberal antidiscrimination movement had taken off in direction threatening fundamental American freedoms and values erosion of meritocracy, creation of sense of entitlement among undeserving people, insistence that gays be protected instead of condemned, fomenting of victimization culture... E.g. not paying $$$$ for readers for blind people is discriminating, domestic violence is sex disc, affirmative action is disc but justified in name of promoting diversity. Hostile to extension to more radical areas that seek to protect traditionally unprotected groups, contexts, or beyond formal definition of equality to rectifying social wrongs or reordering social status hierarchy. B/c there is no constit reasons to allow traditional but not nontraditional antidisc, court has to look to other constit theories to support their hidden agenda Pseudo - Federalism - wrong way to explain decisions Lochner era federalism was really only sensible as a whole - the laissez-faire, antiredistributive agenda that was driving them apart from considerations of constit language, history, doctrine or principle Current cases many pretend to be textualist federalism decisions, but others are astonishingly rewriting 11th amendment doctrine (diversity becomes non-diversity, fed court juris becomes state court juris) Marbury v. Madison the very essence of civil liberty certainly consists in the right of every individual to claim protection of the laws, whenever he receives an injury. But what about Garrett? ( This is like the intl law regime, where only states have standing to sue diplomatic protection on behalf of their citizens. Does this mean that the feds could sue the state? What about under NAFTA? Wouldnt that be a way of effectively initiating private action and then getting feds to sue the state like Loewen? Except that its only available to foreigners...Strangely perverse.  Court is pursuing a new type of judicial sovereignty Other branches are no longer coequal interpreters of constitution Originalism is not the answer Why wouldnt the court rely on the fact that Congress passed the Civil Rights laws in 1866 then as a determinant of what they thought the 14th amendment allowed? Wouldnt this shed light on affirmative action?  Congress also passed law specifically giving $ to poor and destitute blacks in 1867 The Court no longer treats suspect class as a trigger for strict scrutiny, but instead uses suspect classification (Adarand) Color-blindness...Since whites brought the action, whites are being treated as a suspect class being disc against Isnt this just prejudicing blacks? The same benefits denied blacks under Adarand can be given to environmentalists or corporations...The Court makes this argument based on inability to detect benign/malignant line Doesnt this guarantee that treatment of blacks must be worse than other minorities? Even though 14th amendment specifically for blacks... If the justices are using inadvertent fostering of racial stereotypes as a justification for striking down affirmative action, then what about Washington v. Davis, which says that inadvertent harm (disparate impact) is not enough to allow to remedy state disc? That some sort of disc intent or purpose is needed? Why is disparate impact enough to disallow affirmative action, but not enough to remedy state disc? Is it the difference between action and omission?  (In evaluating where the court is needed, it is important not just to look at the constitution, but also to look at other institutions in American life. DM  What about lack of honesty in New Deal and Civil rights cases about whether there are any limits anymore... Dissenting justices never seemed to be able to come up with any limits.  Justices who think theyre dealing with a constitution that fundamentally limits federal power. Some of them at least think that the high road with integrity is at least doing something to make them matter.  Whose job is it to police this?  Judicial review and judicial supremacy goes back to Garcia question.  Can the states protect themselves through the political process from federal overreaching or do the courts need to play the policing role?  Kramer in his article surveys political science literature was Blackmun right in saying that the constitutional structure protects them. Political scientists cant get protection out of weak structural protection, especially now that state legislators dont elect Senators.  Other reasons that states can protect themselves: Political parties are organized on national level, but state party involvement is very important.  Administrative process anti-commandeering notwithstanding, there is not much of anything that fed agencies do w/o state admin help and state officials.  US v. Lopez (1995); Commerce clause power has to be limited to commercial behavior; Has to be some rational end to Congressional power when intruding on states rights; Federalism reinstalled; Jones & Laughlin substantial affects cant allows steady aggregation loose causal cnx to put it under category 3 of regs  Facts Gun-Free School Zones Act made it federal crime to possess firearm in school zone. Child who was caught with concealed handgun was charged and brought suit. Separation and independence of fed govt serve to prevent accumulation of excessive power in one branch healthy balance of power between States and Feds will reduce tyranny and abuse from either front. Wickard and Jones & Laughlin ushered in new era of activism under commerce clause Channels of interstate commerce (Darby, Heart of Atlanta) Instrumentalities of interstate commerce, or persons or things in interstate commerce Power to regulate activities having substantial relationship to interstate commerce (Jones & Laughlin) substantially affect interstate commerce Holding In third category of commerce regulation, proper test requires analysis of whether regulated activity substantially affects interstate commerce Reasoning Act is criminal statute that by its own terms has nothing to do with commerce or economic enterprise Not an essential part of larger regulation of economic activity (Wickard) in which regulatory scheme could be undercut unless intrastate activity regulated.  ( Cannot be sustained under cases upholding regs that arise out of or are connected with commercial transaction, which viewed in the aggregate, substantially affects interstate commerce. Act contains no jurisdictional element which would ensure, through case-by-case inquiry, that firearm possession in question affects interstate commerce  Neither statute nor legis history contains express congressional findings regarding effects upon interstate commerce of gun possession in school zone Extent that legis findings would enable Ct to evaluate legis judgment that activity substat affects commerce Govts reasoning in making cnx is too attenuated Allowing this would allow Congress too much power If it can regulate this, then it could regulate educational process directly, since reasoning is based on handicapping of education and thus affects on commerce. Congress could mandate educational regime Any activity could thus be termed commercial b/c of attenuated reasoning Kennedys concurrence Ct is committed to practical conception of commerce power Ct realizes that Congress is reg based on single natl economy and unified purpose to build stable natl economy Ct not arguing for return to 19th century economy- Ct uses workable standards  Federalism works as a double security govts control each other and themselves and the tension between the two creates a zone of liberty and a diffusion of sovereign power Two lines of political accountability Federal citizens Citizens of states, greater federal power would obscure state political responsibility States are in best position to test different responses to problems ( as a kind of test case for legis Congressional action forecloses state action where states typically had responded and had already enacted extensive legis Thomas Thomas said that a revolution occurred in the New Deal and the Civil Rights and he thinks we need another revolution to get back to where they were.  The majority views this earlier era as an ideal. How do you keep any of the values of federalism in place if there are no limits on the commerce power.  Evaluation Was it too close to matters of state concern? (education, Morrison criminalizing violence).  Court is prepared to say that Heart of Atlanta was decided correctly it doesnt matter that Congress viewed behavior that was impeding commerce as social and moral wrong as well.  It doesnt seem to be a problem if Congress purpose is to do something that the states could also do under their police power Darby (regulating child labor).  What if Congress has asserted control in this area through regulating spending power? Probably not an argument that the Court would want to make. There is pervasive control of schools through funding related requirements.  Congress has also legislated around guns Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms. (ATF) Does this matter at all if the Court doesnt tighten up the spending power? South Dakota v. Dole Court left spending power intact.   Are states begging for help?  40 states had already legislated gun control it would help to be able to say that the states are failing at being able to solve this problem.  States are failing New Rhenquist court argument - Or maybe states have atrophied in long Congressional period of overreaching so they have lost some capacity that they would otherwise have had take Congressional federal fix away.  What about the race to the bottom argument?  Stare decisis Is something different happening here that we have to draw the boundaries more carefully? Jurisdictional hook Gun-free schools act did not have a jurisdictional hook a provision in the statute that says that it only applies in which relevant person or thing has moved in interstate commerce.  Congress repassed the act with the jurisdictional hook.  Was it Rationality review or heightened scrutiny? Commerce clause doesnt have to use this language of level of scrutiny It is more of a deference stance towards Congress that doesnt need factual findings in support of some rationale. It requires courts to use a post hoc reasoning what could the Court say post hoc about what was on Congress mind?  Court can think hypothetically ti doesnt need to prove what Congress was actually thinking about, but what could Congress have been thinking about. There is also a fairly substantial presumption of constitutionality.  This is not the same as rationality review under the 14th amendment, but if its about deference to the legislature, then this is what rationality review under the commerce clause looks like.  Definition Whether a rational basis existed for thinking that a regulation affected interstate commerce.  Maybe this is just a kind of rationality basis with sharp teeth?  Court is saying that they would be willing to conceded that fear of gun violence is keeping kids out of school education is a foundation of a modern economy, etc. Rhenquist is not disputing the factual basis, but even with findings, this is a logic that in an integrated national economy seems to have no limits.  Are the principles of federalism embodied in the constitution principles that are supposed to outlive the full integration of the American economy Congress powers are supposed to be enumerated and limited places where Congress cant go.  Given where the economy is in the 1990s, any efforts to keep this in bound that may have worked in the 1960s or 1930s will no longer work.  An existential statement we have to clear some space for federalism. Court is suspicious of Congress wants to teach them a lesson. But what about Congress as a co-determinor of constitutional interpretation? Does Congress only get to interpret the constitution when it agrees with the Court?  Souter the power to interpret the commerce clause is within the province of Congress.  But Marshall did spend a lot of time in Gibbons v. Ogden determining what type of navigation fit within the commerce power.  The Court is still struggling with Marbury, Gibbons, etc. what are the powers. Souter is still right to say that there are some activities that Congress should be able to engage in without strict scrutiny.  Rhenquist - Hes allowing Wicker v. Filburn still a basic structure in which there should be space for the states.  The question is what do you do with those later constitutional moments?  If you take the most extreme of our constitutional moments and then use them as a baseline where ordinary lawmaking can take place, you lose the basic structure.  Rhenquist is trying to say that those earlier cases - those extremes dont simply mean that under ordinary circumstance Congress can go as far as it wants lets not let the extraordinary moments create a jurisprudence in which its assumed that thats always the case.  This Court has decided that it will tell Congress what the business of the federal Court should be is this a violation of separation of powers?  That Courts should not lobby for keeping federal district court judges as elevated and lofty as they want to be.  If the problem with lack of findings means that the Court cannot evince Congress intent, then is it valid? Is this what the Court is looking for?  It disappears completely at the point in which Breyer does the legwork which he does. United States v. Morrison (2000) Background Anti-discrimination statute where the expansion in the 1960s was not new territory. Not criminalizing all violence against women it is merely creating a civil right of action.  There was also lots of findings VAWA had a substantial factual backing that violence and fear of violence massively affects the ability of women to participate in the economy.  The same way Jones and Laughlin was crafted detailed findings.  But what the Rhenquist seemed to say in Lopez that it wasnt a factual failure, but instead a failure of limits.  It was exactly b/c Congress did such a good job in showing what the chain of causation was that there was no limits you could develop these factual findings for anything.  That kind of accrual of effects for noncommercial behavior means that there will be no boundaries. Reasoning Intrastate activity regulation being regulated has to itself be some sort of economic endeavor.  Underlying activity violence against women is not understood intuitively as an economic activity. Bottom of page 27 Doesnt give exactly what would be considered economic activity In both cases Court noted that statute did not have jurisdictional hooks kind of provision that says that statute applies only if persons or goods have moved in interstate commerce.  With Lopez you could easily invent something like that trade in guns is interstate, but the Court never really tells us that if you had that hook if you went from category three (substantially affects commerce) to category 2 (persons or things in commerce).  Page 28 uses word may... Morrison how would you put fists as interstate commerce? Lacking in proportionality and congruence and Congressional findings that would allow for narrow tailoring It is not located in a particular region with a particular focus. The legislation is not limited to those areas like the voting rights act.  No race to the bottom kind of issue women not moving state to state due to violence. This was a big part of the New Deal cases and regulation.  Link between violence against women and substantial effect on interstate commerce is too attenuated means Congressional power unlimited Govt arguments; Costs of violent crime are substantial insurance spreads costs throughout population National productivity - Violent crimes reduces willingness of individuals to travel to areas w/in country that are unsafe If national productivity was enough, then no limits family law, custody, divorce could then all be subjected to congressional regulation (what about GAY MARRIAGE!!!!) If allow aggregation of economic effects of noneconomic activities, then it would include all violence. Crime interferes with steady employment, then that will be true of all crime. Very difficult to see where the boundaries are families would be included too. ( congress may have seen this since it specifically limited impact on family law Seeks to follow but-for causal chain from initial occurrence of violent crime to every attenuated effect upon interstate commerce ( would then allow Congress to regulate any crime as long as the nationwide, aggregated impact of that crime has substantial effects on employment, production, transit, or consumption. Then it could reg any violent crime Dissent:  There is no line at all that can then be drawn b/c congress did then provide so much evidence Is the majority right is that the constitutional structure there is a feel of Congressional power being more limited than state power?  Any interpretation of the commerce power that makes it impossible to draw those lines is an interpretation that we cant abide.  Evaluation This is the Court saying that Congress cant regulate either under Section 5 or Commerce Clause. Differences between Morrison and Lopez VAWA was passed before Lopez rules, but Congress had done extensive work detailing how violence affected commerce. The precedent of the civil rights cases would seem more appropriate. But the ways in which Morrison was similar to Lopez won out. National League of Cities (1976); Congress limited by 10th amendment for imposing regs on states that would impair ability to function effectively in federal system functions essential to separate and independent existence Background 1974 Congress extended minimum wage and maximum hour regs to state and muni employees. Holding First decision since 1930s to strike down act of Congress on federalism grounds and court overruled Maryland v. Wirtz Reasoning When Congress seeks to reg directly activities of states as public employers, it transgresses an affirmative limitation contained in in the constit. Congressional enactments w/in commerce power scope may be invalid b/c offends following other limitations Sixth amendment right to trial by jury 5th amendment due process 10th amendment state sovereignty Fry the 10th amendment is not just a truism, it expressly declares constit policy that Congress may not exercise power in fashion that impairs states integrity or their ability to function effectively in federal system Congress can reg business affected by dual sovereignty of state and feds, but not states directly State sovereignty encompasses determination of wages, which are functions essential to separate and independent existence Significant impact cost of statute Displaces state policies regarding manner in which they will structure delivery of govt services (pay people less for less skills, volunteer firemen) or govern employer-employee relationships Services impaired are those which states have traditionally afforded citizens State is not merely a factor in the shifting economic arrangements of private sector, but is itself a coordinate element in system established by framers for governing federal union Dissent Congressional commerce clause power is not limited by 10th amendment, only limited by indiv. Liberties in 5th & 6th Congress could traditionally preempt state legislation under 10th amendment, so why not state wages? Isnt legis an element of state which is required in fully functioning federal system? Why allow preemption of legis but not internal administrative ordering?  (Is it about reaching inside the body of the sovereign, rather than affecting the external power of the sovereign?  Garcia v. San Antonio Transit (1985); rejection of Natl League predicating immunity on integral or tradl nature of govt function; state sovereign interests more properly protected by procedural safeguards in constit than by judicially create limits Facts Dept. of Labor determined that San Antonio mass-transit system dint fall under rule in Natl League of Cities, and thus was reuqied to abide by fed minimum wage laws. Court ordered parties to brief whether or not principles of 10th amendment as set forth in Natl League of cities should be reconsidered.  Holding Rejection of National League insofar as state immunity from federal regulation turns on judicial appraisal of whether particular govt function is integral or traditional.  Reasoning Structure of fed govt itself ensured limitation of fed power States given role in selection of executive and legis branches Vested w/ indirect influence over house of reps and presidency control of electoral qualifications Old rule about Senate and equal rep in senate Special restraints on Congress enumerated powers checked its power ( state sovereign interests are more properly protected by procedural safeguards than by judicially created limitations on fed power States adequately represented in fed system natl political process protects states ( especially formation and funding of political parties ( alliances that have to be forged at local and fed level to get legis passed & supported Dissent No explanation of exactly how states are protected thru political process from congressional commerce power Congress much less sensitive to local concerns judicial review of power still necessary Federal legis cant be judge of their own power Bill of Rights reflects anti-federal power concerns, and a balance was struck that this overturns Power to address natl problems v. diffusion of power between federal and state branches Local participation better approximates citizen participation Evaluation Changes in balance of power Darby & Jones & Laughlin expanded scope of commerce clause power Direct election of senators (17th amendment) ( But arent state citizens votes going to approximate state govts concerns? Or does the govt itself as a sovereign body have separate interests from its polity? How is this reconciled?  Expanded influence of natl interest groups Garcia is still good law, so Congress is not limited by the 10th amendment in its ability to apply statutes like the Fair Labor Standards Act against the states.  The main reason Blackmun changes his mind is that he becomes convinced that National League required a kind of formalism that didnt work - the drawing of a distinction between things that a state do that are traditional or core govt functions and some things that arent.  What about functions that a state participates in that are outside traditional govt functions setting up manufacturing plants and paying workers nothing?  Just b/c a state is performing a function doesnt mean its one of its sovereign functions. So once you put in a rule that is merely formalistic there will be areas in which it doesnt work.  You can either deregulate the area or regulate it more heavily could say that govts get to decide what are important functions through the process.  Public choice theory.. Do you need to apply some sort of special protection to protect the states or can the states protect themselves through the normal political process?  This was taken to the states rather than through different private actors.  Application of public choice theory to states that they are not discrete insular minorities and can use the political process like anyone else.  Printz and the Commandeering cases Facts Congress using the states as implementers of federal policy (e.g. using sheriffs to implement the Brady Bill). Brady was injured during a Regan assassination case.  Sheriffs have to conduct background checks on handgun purchasers prior to national background check system Requires law enforcement of each jurisdiction to do something to enact Brady bill. The people required to do this are local sheriffs, not state legislatures that could distinguish it from New York since New York appeared to make the commandeering of state legislatures especially egregious (made states put in requirement for handling radioactive waste).  Background Starts applying it to important political statutes the major federal gun control statutes.  Ruling The court says that commandeering of state executive the same way as the legislature the judicial branch is the only branch that can then be commandeered.  Number of statutes compelling state judicial action far outweigh those compelling state executive action ( this implies assumed absence of power Only federal law in the past was the Extradition Act of 1793 Early federalists argued that use of state officials would be necessary employing state magistrate to execute fed laws ( But no indication that these would be imposed w/o the consent of the states The out that OConnor leaves in Printz is that some state actions might be so ministerial that feds requiring state and local officials to do them is not going to be a problem (considerable level of state/federal cooperation in many areas, especially law enforcement) e.g. Meghans law/Amber Alert. Allowed:  Use of statute implies condition on federal funding Only requires provision of information to feds Dual sovereignty system established to preserve liberty Prohibition on involuntary reduction of state territory, Art. 4 Sec 3 Judicial Power Clause, Art. 3 Sec. 2 Privileges and immunities clause speaking of Citizens of states, Article 4 Sec. 2 Amendment provision for constit, Art. 5 Guarantee Clause presupposing continued existence of states and means and instrumentalities which are creation of their sovereign and reserved rights, Art. 4 Sec. 4 10th amendment 11th amendment US v. NY Constit allows Congress to regulate individuals, not states Federal control of state officers would also have effect on separation and equilibrium of powers between three branches of Fed Govt itself.  By forcing state govts to absorb financial burden of fed reg program, Congress can take credit for solving problem w/o having to get taxes; states put in responsibility to receive blame for program ( Cannot compel state executive to act either directly or indirectly to enforce fed program (what about spending powers?) Scalia Compelling diffuse state law enforcement to enforce would violate the unitary executive principle ( But doesnt voluntary enforcement breach this idea as well?  Dissent Articles of Confederation allowed for control of states, and constit allowed for control of individuals b/c deemed more powerful and effective Before, state judges performed many tasks today performed by state administration, so forcing them to act would have been tantamount to forcing executive today Where text is silent, historical record favors the understanding had by Congress Garcia power to ensure states rights lies in structure of govt itself ( states are powerful political actors Better off leaving protection of federalism to political process rather than to unelected judiciary Burden that is imposed by law very small would it be constit if burden were similarly inflicted on private parties w/ access to info? New York, Garcia... Language in NY relied on by court (to administer fed reg program) was dicta and hence not binding Federalism is better served by cooperation between the sovereigns Souter look to European system states will implement portions of federal programs b/c system interferes less, not more, with independent auth of state. (Coasean rationale does this merely mean that feds have to bid for administrative functions of states? Does Printz merely establish a baseline entitlement as starting point for Coasean bargaining?  Souter Congress has a kind of eminent domain right to commandeer state administrative bodies  Evaluation Isnt this Marbury and formalism?  There doesnt seem to be any way for the Court to breathe life into long-lost parts of the constitution without drawing highly formalistic lines that arent clear enough to be workable.  What is our concept of sovereignty and how its injured.  Is the 10th amendment just about the states and its instrumentalities (like 11th amendment) or is it about the entirety of the public sphere at the state level? We have to take Printz at its word to apply to both state and municipal officials.  Any commandeering would cause problems whether it be state or local. The Commerce Clause and Anti-Discrimination; Civil Rights Acts of 1965;  Civil Rights Act of 1965 Prohibits private employment discrimination based on race, gender, or religion and which forbids discrimination by places of public accommodation such as hotels and restaurants. Enacted based on commerce clause power. Heart of Atlanta Motel (1964) p. 472 upheld Title II of Civil Rights Act; established effects on interstate commerce of disc; can use look to totality of effects rather than just individual case Background Heart of Atlanta Motel was in downtown Atlanta and had 216 rooms and most visitors from out-of-state. Hotel had policy of refusing accommodation to blacks. It was not picked by the DOJ. This was a little easier, since there was a lot of business from travelers and people going to conventions. So there was more of a connection to interstate commerce. Holding Upheld Title II of Civil Rights Act, which prohibited discrimination in public accommodation. Reasoning Whether Congress had a rational basis for finding that racial discrimination by motels affected commerce Voluminous evidence presented shows discrimination by hotels and motels impedes interstate travel Did not matter that Congress motive may also have been moral; many federal laws, like Lottery case, had been adopted under commerce power to remedy moral wrongs. Did not matter that motel may have been purely local, if it is interstate commerce that feels the pinch, it does not matter how local the operation which applies the squeeze. If it had such a basis, whether the means it selected to eliminate that evil are reasonable and appropriate Katzenbach v. McClung (1964) p. 473; Congress commerce power broad and sweeping, small impact on interstate commerce still can mean subject to power Background Ollies BBQ was a little different, being in Birmingham in a very segregated area.  This was not clearly interstate case 11 blocks from the highway, with only half of meat bought from local supplier who bought it outside the state Hormel meat products.  Recitation of facts affirmed interstate connections of restaurant 46% of meat purchased came from out of state Holding Congress rationally had concluded that discrimination by restaurants cumulatively had an impact on interstate commerce. Testimony afforded ample basis for the conclusion that established restaurants in such areas sold less interstate goods b/c of discrimination, that interstate travel was obstructed directly by it, that business in general suffered and that many new busineses refrained from establishing there as a result of it. Congress power under the commerce clause is broad and sweeping.  Was the South economically stagnating b/c it couldnt attract Northern businesses b/c of segregation and the fact that blacks could not have productive businesses with all of the traveling restrictions not very many hotels that would allow blacks.  None of these cases went quite as far as Wickard in seeing interstate commerce in arguably actions with very local effects.  Lassiter (1959) (handout) 14th, 15th, 17th but dont conflict b/c facially neutral Congress sought to overturn Lassiter in Voting Rights Act.  The Lassiter case (1959) and the court says in Lassiter that there is nothing intrinsically unconstitutional about literacy requirements in voting the state has interests in making sure that its electorate is literate.  Ruling Douglas the states have long been held to have broad powers to determine the conditions under which the right of suffrage may be exercised, absent of course discrimination which the constitution condemns. Ability to read and write is relevant to ability to exercise franchise intelligently.  Newspapers, periodicals, books and other printed matter canvass and debate campaign issues, a state may conclude that only those who are literate should exercise the franchise.  Evaluation Assumptions Literacy tests are race neutral in purpose and effect Generally were motivated by desire to exclude blacks from voting and that was their impact Literacy tests meet strict scrutiny In an era of television and radio, even illiterate voters could be well informed.  Other forms of assistance could allow illiterate voters to participate Did not set up any obstacles for allowing court to validate 4(e) of the Voting Rights Act.  Slavery and the Civil War Pre-Civil War and Civil War History MS Compromise History In 1819, major national controversy surrounded admission of MS as a state and whether it, and other areas in LA purchase, would be free or slave.  In a compromise that was intended to resolve issue, Congress admitted MS as a slave state, but prohibited slavery in territories north of certain latitude. Territories below the line could decide if slave or not. Issues Does the federal govt and the Supreme Court have the right to outlaw slavery on federal property? What is the power of the federal govt to control territories that were annexed prior to the ratification of the constitution? Even though noone in those territories had officially ratified the Constitution? We dont want to think of ourselves as colonizers of the territories and you dont want to think that the feds can do whatever they want in those territories, since it will offend the dignity of the people who settle there and eventually become citizens of a State and the Union. Slaveholders ought to have the right to move their family and property to the new territories as the Northerners did,  McClean the federal govt is entitled to reach its own judgment about whether slavery is good or bad for the social conditions for the new territories diseased cattle could be outlawed. The property right is not immune. If you allow slavery in the territories, then anti-slavery people may not come. And there are more anti-slavery people than slaveowners, so the North clearly needs more land than the South.  The deed is done the country is split, and they cannot exist together. There is nothing wrong with the feds dividing the territory in order to get the territory settled.  There was the possibility for States to determine when they enter the Union whether they want to be slave or not(moment of statehood) this is the only point that Taney concedes not any sort of legislative determination prior to Statehood.  Pre-Civil War Escalation Tariff controversies Cotton was exported from the South to England and England finished into textiles.  Congress had imposed a large tariff on British textiles, which hurt the cotton industry in the South.  There was an argument that the reason that the South was backward was because of slavery the North thought that this was the link between the problems in the South and the richer more industrial North.  The South filtered the economic disparity between the two through slavery that the South had to continue to use slavery in order to survive and protect their way of life.   Lincoln and the secession crisis of his Presidency Secession crisis arises under Buchanan and Lincolns election has only made it worse. Buchanan takes the position that secession is unconstitutional, but it does not have the right to prevent it by force. It only has the power to protect federal property.  Seven states announced secession from Union upon Lincolns inauguration. Lincoln is conciliatory when he first takes office, but South Carolinians threaten Fort Sumter, and Lincoln moves to protect it.  South Carolina feels that only by exacerbating the conflict will the other States join them, and the last States only join when Lincoln. Arguments against secession Perpetuity is implied, if not expressed, in fundamental law of all national govts No govt has organic law for its own termination If Union is compact/contract of all states, how can it be made except for unanimous consensus? No state can unilaterally withdraw Contract Law Party to contract cant introduce evidence that contradicts written words secessionist arguments essentially ignored text Arguments for constitutionality of secession Constitution is compact between states, and if many states violate clauses of contracts, other states have right to withdraw Thomas argument in Term Limits Consent is not individual, but is each individual state 10th amendment based on sovereignty of states, and popular sovereignty track state boundaries (electoral colleges, Senator representing and elected by state legislators) Constitution doesnt speak of powers to the people as an undifferentiated whole Presumption should be that state action is legal unless expressly preempted by federal constitution How can secession be reconciled with the constitution? What kind of community can you sustain in a world with no exit? Was it the consent of the people in the States or the States themselves that gave power and authority to the Union? The right to secede could significantly distort the balance of power states could play that trump card.  Slavery could have been the issue that should have been resolved at the formation of the Union and that there was no solution to the problem. So b/c there was no resolution, then secession was the only possibility.  Was it so clear that secession was legally prohibited?  Lincolns Executive Actions during the Civil War Actions of questionable legality Suspension of habeas corpus Constitution, Article I, Sec. 9 allows for suspension when public safety endangered through rebellion or invasion.  Lincoln suspends habeas corpus between PA and DC for suspected confederate sympathizers, b/c MD are resisting troop movements through Baltimore. Lincoln bases it on the fact that his duty was to enforce the laws, and since the South was flagrantly disobeying the laws, he had a right to suspend habeaus corpus. Are all the laws but one to go unexecuted and the govt go to pieces, lest that one be violated? Would the official oath be broken by letting the govt fall apart? Framers could not have intended for danger to run its course until Congress was convened he had to act in the face of danger.  Taney immediately overturns it, and Taney loves the lawlessness of this.  Cant delegate suspension of writ to military officer for arrest Writ has to be suspended through act of Congress no reference in constit. to it being a power of the Exec. No mention of it in Article II, where powers of Executive outlined.  Congress passes law in 1863 authorizing President to suspend habeaus.  Suspension of right to jury trial Lincoln also uses military tribunals to try civilians.  Use of military power with declaration of war Lincoln still continues and starts a blockade of the Southern ports, which is a de facto declaration of war, even though only Congress only has this right. Freedom of speech federal power over mails He closes the mails to seditious materials.  Right to tax and spend money He borrows money for the war right to tax is Congress. He recruits volunteers and pays them.  He is paying federal funds to individuals instead of Bank of US to pay for war.  Deprivation of due process of law property Lincoln issues the emancipation proclamation using it as seizing enemy property during wartime, but this is generally only used for military reasons.  Infringement on federalism and usurpation of legis authority Emancipation proclamation repealed state law as punishment for criminal acts by majority of populace Power to abolish slavery was given to the states, not the national govt.  Executive can only enforce, not make, laws. Justice Black in Steel Seizure cases Slavery and the Law Prigg v. Pennsylvania (1842) Federal Field Preemption, only Congress has right to legislate in field Facts Issue Case not about their being freed. Slaveowner had already gone into PA and recaptured slaves and brought them back to MD. The slaves claimed that the owner had informally set them free prior to her birth she married and moved to PA.  Case was about whether Prigg and his cohorts could be criminally prosecuted for violating Pennsylvanias no-self-help law. Right of recapture In colonial background, there was a common law right of recapture permitted self-help as long as it didnt involve violence or disturbing the peace. So recapture was a common process. Northern states (PA in particular) included in state laws a provision allowing recapture to show other states that a Union was really desired. (PA 1780) Generally, it would be an agent of the slave owner, or professional, who would seize the slave and convey him back into slave territory Fugitive Slave Clause 1793 Congress approves Fugitive Slave Act, requiring that judges return escaped slaves. Fugitive Slave clause says instead of may be reclaimed and conveyed, it says shall be delivered up Difference in language from something close in time Process created by which a slave seized by self-help would have to be taken to a judge (state or fed) who would evaluate claim that person was fugitive slave, and only upon judges certification of that fact could slave be removed. Doesnt say who will do they conveying.  PA Slave Recapture Clause PA 1826 statute was designed to prevent self-help designed to limit violence in recapture of slaves. The slave was entitled to a hearing to determine his rights.  Story and the Fugitive Slave Act Story as a nationalist The Fugitive Slave Act is very ambiguous in terms of who is supposed to enforce it.  Story was a nationalist fighting for federal power, but there was a conflict b/c if you are outcome oriented in this instance, then the feds were not going to eliminate the Fugitive Slave Act and it would be better to let the anti-slave states chip away at it.  How far should the judge work the positive law to be outcome oriented? Is there something in Storys position that would make him think that he was bound by positive law rather than being able to exercise his own moral judgment? Storys interpretation of the Fugitive Slave Act in constitutional history We wouldnt have a union without it. Story sees this as a great compromise between the North and the South that there was great debate an acquiescence to a compromise. But there wasnt great debate it was slipped in at the last moment without great debate and the lack of deliberation meant that the delegates did not examine its full implications.  With this sort of collision, we have to interpret the Fugitive Slave Act so that its true purposes will be met.  What was the interpretive intent of the framers? They closed the debates, so they did not want their legislative history to be examined they wanted the document to be the final product.  Should Story be bound by the intent of the framers or only by the document itself? Is there a conflict between PA statute and Fugitive Slave Act? What does shall be delivered up mean? Who delivers up the slave? This doesnt necessarily suggest self-help, rather it suggests some sort of constitutionally mandated process.  This power is not enumerated in Article I, Section 8, so it doesnt appear to give Congress the explicit power to legislate related to this.  The PA statute bars self-help and mandates that the person has to go to a magistrate.  Is there room for states to legislate when it doesnt directly conflict with the Act? Ruling He consigned enforcement of the Fugitive Slave Act to self-help that states were not compelled to enforce it, but could not pass legislation that impaired it. The statute was self-executiong.  McLeans Opinion narrower grounds. Fugitive Slave Act requires certification of slave for removal. Morgan was taken back to MD w/o certification process. Tried to get certification from justice of the peace, who determined that under PA law, he didnt have jurisdiction  ( McLean said no conflict with statute, the behavior violates the state and fed statute Story:  the PA statute didnt just prohibit self-help to remove a slave; it prohibited self-help across the board ( so it prohibits stuff that is presumed lawful, maybe even explicitly: that someone would use self-help to seize the slave in the first place So PA goes further than prohibiting what Fugitive Slave Act prohibited PAs burden of proof: statute constit under FSC PA argued that Clause is silent as to how status is to be determined, how delivered up, who will enforce and that in the face of this silence 2 possibilities: Only the states have the power to act in this area, rendering the Fugitive Slave Act unconstitutional (and PA statute constitutional) States and Fed govt have concurrent jurisdiction each can legislate, so long as there is no conflict between state and fed statute (b/c then Supremacy Clause says Fed statute wins) AND that there is no conflict here Problems  Could defend statute only if you limit it to barring self-help on removal  Storys response:  Congress occupied the entire field here, its silence is meaningful if Cong didnt provide penalty for those removing slaves w/o the process, not having a remedy is what Cong wanted.  By adding a remedy, state is violating the purposes of Congress so there is a conflict in the face of silence. this argument is made in modern federal preemption law But case comes out: Only Federal govt can legislate in this area-So Priggs conviction must be overturned What was Story up to? Objective legal craftsman Story considered one of greatest legal minds of his time Wanted to go antislavery BUT believed himself to be so constrained by legal authority that he couldnt go that way Wanted to go nationalist (Story was very much in the Marshall school) BUT had to find ways to assuage his guilt so said constraining legal arguments were more constraining than they actually were Maybe to say: this isnt about the judiciary imposing this requirement on the states to cooperate w/ slavery Congress did it. Issues of democratic legitimacy. Northern states interfering w/ slave recapture through legal process might have thought that would be destructive to the Union. Then, federal law was taking an accomodationist position. Maybe later it could be convinced to take a less accomodationist stance. Was Story signaling Congress to pass federal legislation? Or signaling the states to be more careful in interfering? Dred Scott (1857) p. 183; blacks are not citizens History In this period, each side became more extreme, further from each other There were freedom suits, juries decide if slave or free Broad-based resistance to return of fugitive slaves Heightening of abolitionist rhetoric, obnoxious to Southerners attacking morality of Southern culture viewing everything as built on this rotten foundation of slavery offensive to honor of Southern culture Justice Taney had slaves. But not reliant on them to continue his line of work. He had more of a stake in Southern culture and against the angry rhetoric impugning Southern culture, than slavery itself. Background of case 2 different suits, only 1 of which got to SupCt When Dred Scott initiates suit for freedom, there was strong Missouri SupCt precedent on his side (on whether being brought to live in free territory, he had become free, notwithstanding being brought back to Missouri). Missouri was not entirely proslavery.  Dred Scotts master died after Dred Scott had been taken into IL. Dred Scott sues administrator of his masters estate for freedom, since he was now resident of IL. Juris. was based on diversity.  Within the life of Dred Scotts litigation at Missouri stage during the delay - Missouri SupCt changed its mind on that question, recognized that it was going against the weight of the authority States are allowed to be concerned w/ their own self-preservation Dont want large population of free blacks in Missouri This is a silly argument, b/c probably the free state is able to resist the taking-back to Missouri of that person. So the large free black population would be in the free state. ( The delay affected the outcome. Holding Dred Scott did not have standing to sue, since he was not a citizen of the United States, but was instead property.  Diversity refers to citizens (Art. III 2) States could recognize blacks for their own purposes, but not as national citizens.  Supreme Court declared MS compromise unconstit. even after it decided that it did not have juris. to hear the case.  Congress could not grant citizenship to their slaves or descendants would be taking of property from slave owners w/o due process.  Right of property of slave is distinctly and expressly affirmed in constit.  Originalist opinion Even in the now free states, at the time of the Const (originalist opinion) it couldnt be the case that a change in beliefs since Const was enacted could change our fundamental laws. Barriers had been set up to equality for blacks perpetual and impassable barrier intended to be erected between white and black races.  One couldnt possibly believe that citizens of the U.S. could have contemplated that blacks could be citizens of the U.S. The extent to which blacks were enslaved, unequal, was fixed in time? Or more aspirational language that is freedom or equality-friendly? How do we view the concept of citizenship? Property: bundle of rights. Citizenship could be viewed that way too. A notion like citizenship is not 1 totality of elements inseparable from another but could be viewed as a collection of rights, responsibilities Originalist argument that citizenship was in fact viewed this way: Women denied the franchise, etc One element of full equality that Taney keeps noting the absence of where free blacks are concerned: intermarriage (miscegenation) Marriage and personhood close together But same statutes prohibited intermarriage w/ Indians, and they were allowed to become citizens Anti-miscegenation and segregation were 2 of the last things to fall ( Black were nowhere accepted as fully equal. No opinion that racial difference didnt matter. Arguments against the bundle of rights theories Why would a large part of the bundle (voting or marriage) be relevant to who has the right to sue? Is that one of the most powerful and symbolic of the rights of citizenship? No ( Might be anachronistic to have the view in 1857 that founding generation meant all or nothing citizenship Lots of citizens didnt have all the rights that others had. Being a slave was not a barrier to suit in state courts They did have disabilities in their rights during the suit But many states w/ antimiscengation laws also accorded to free blacks many rights such as voting. So, denying right to intermarry doesnt mean you have to go all the way to the other side and deny all rights. Was it for the Supreme Court to decide the constitutionality of the MS Compromise? Was he justified in think that the institution that would solve the problem was the Court? Could the Court be a catalyst for public opinion to exercise leadership in this way? Taney was very much a judicial supremacist an exercise of power than finally ends the discussion.  The debate was so deeply ingrained in morals and religion, which limits the possible extent of debate. The process of mutual more-extreme-making was a response to Roe conservatives became exceedingly better organized and polarized after this decision it motivated and organized an opposition. States-rights growing in opposition to the idea that the Court could decide these deeply moral issues.  Congress had tried multiple times to reaches compromises in the territories, and it wasnt working. What does the Court do when the structure of the govt cannot reach a compromise?  It could have been that no solution would have been right that still would have allowed slavery to exist.  Taney and the Territory Clause of Article IV Section 3 Confers on Congress the power to dispose of and make all needful rules and regulations respecting the territory or other property belonging to US. Taney believed referred only to territory which at that time belonged to US and was w/in boundaries settled with UK New territory should be governed and admitted as a state as soon as possible not governed by Congress w/ absolute auth Federal govt is acting as trustee for people of the state, but doesnt have power over persons or property of citizens never discretionary power Noone would debate that Congress could not make laws restricting freedom of religion or speech of citizens in terr all Bill of Rights still apply, so rights of private property have to be guarded as against feds. No distinction between slaves as property and real property, so Congress would be infringing 5th amendment by legislating slavery.  Evaluation of opinion Not a very textualist opinion - The only constitutional language is through the Diversity clause citizens of a state.  Taney wanted to get in and get out solve the problem once and for all and try to diffuse the conflict.  But Dred Scott actually exacerbated the problem rather than solving it.  Why didnt Taney adopt one of the alternate views of citizenship, get Scott through the door by diversity jurisdiction, and then declare the Missouri Compromise unconstitutional? Taney did not want to give abolitionist forces any ground by granting blacks the right to legal redress or partial citizenship.  He couldnt see any way out of not declaring them citizens too many repercussions to be able to get to the MS Compromise.  Once he found that the court didnt have jurisdiction, then he should have just closed the case, rather than reaching the MS Compromise. He tried to justify this by saying that the lower Court had made substantive rulings, so he had to respond to it. But of course with modern jurisprudence, if the higher court finds that the lower court did not have jurisdiction, then their whole decision is vacated.  Why didnt Taney compromise by saying that blacks could be recognized as citizens of their states, and that the fed govt could then recognize them as citizens in terms of rights that citizens of a state has, but that states that didnt want to grant blacks citizenship could continue to block their citizenship.  Avoids the question as to whether people declared citizens of their own states had the right to have federal law which turns on state citizenship have the right to have those rights enforced within the borders of the states in which they reside. The Supremacy clause would mean that that the body of law (fed laws applying to state citizens) would then have to be enforced.  Article VI Section 2 The Citizens of each State shall be entitled to all Privileges and Immunities of Citizens in the several States.  Taney thought that the Privileges and Immunities clause could potentially then be employed to make them citizens in each state.  Prize Cases (1863) Dealing with blockade that Lincoln ordered Background Lincoln delayed congress coming back into session so he could call out troops. Congress then validated Presidential action in Acts of August 6 can violation of separation of powers be negated if institutional victim acquiesces? Do ordinary citizens derive a private right to liberty ensured by separation of powers?  Holding President had right to impose blockade without a congressional declaration of war. Acts of Congress of 1795 and 1807 allowed to use militia in case of invasion or to suppress insurrection.  The 14th Amendment Reconstruction  History of the 14th amendment 13th amendment 38th Congress ratified 13th amendment in 1865 before close of Civil War. North made ratification conditioned upon rejoining Union. (what did it mean to welcome states back if Lincoln said they had never left?)  Black Codes adopted by South States threatened to reestablish slavery applied unequal penalties to blacks, prohibited them from keeping weapons or selling booze. Restricted right to acquire property and restrict rights to contract for personal service provisions of capture and indentured servitude contracts.  Civil Rights Act of 1865 all citizens of every race and color shall have right to make and enforce contracts, sue and be sued, give evidence, inherit, convey real property.... 14th amendment text Congress Rejected versions that would have explicitly mandated color-blindness no discrimination shall be made on account of race and color. -- how does that bear on modern-day interpretation or was it not a clear rejection?  Worked fundamental transformation in balance of power between fed and state govt gave vast new powers to feds to enforce against the states 14th amendment procedural history Article V requirements Proposed by 2/3 of each House  of states needed to ratify or proposed by Convention called by Congress upon petition of 2/3 of states) Republican majority exercised Article I Sec. 5 power to judge Qualifications of its own members to exclude Congressmen from former Confederacy b/c they couldnt get anything amended Dems could block. South states would have lots of new polit members w/ addition of slaves Southern exclusion was a necessary political condition for Repubs to get 2/3 for proposed amendment Congressional phase of Reconstruction Congress passed First and Second Reconstruction Acts in 1867 dissolved the old state govts of the south and put it under authority of military commanders. Federal military and civilian auths supervised creation of new state govts which were required to accept black suffrage. Military oversaw registration of black and white voters Reps of new govts allowed to be members to House and Senate only if the State ratified the 14th amendment, and only after amendment gained support of of states.  Johnson attempted to fire Sec. of War, but House started impeachment proceedings and Johnson agree to stop interfering.  Legitimacy of the 14th amendment Arguments for the legality of the adoption of the 14th amendment Southern States left and forfeited right to representation in Congress until they were brought back in. Doesnt explain consent to 13th amendment or Lincolns assertion that they had no right in the first place to leave the Union South govts no longer republican b/c majority of free males was denied right to participate in state constitutional conventions. Congress had no duty to respect nonrepublican govts... Southern states were in grasp of war until they accepted Norths demands and therefore victor got the spoils. It could count them for 13th amendment purposes and then change mind to gain whatever political advantage it wanted. 14th is act of political and military power. 14th amendment is so central to Nations sense of itself and it guarantees of justice, civil rights and liberties that it must be accepted as legitimate. By end of 1870s, so many people accepted 14th amendment that no further explanation of legitimacy is needed. Illegitimacy Would ERA have been an Article V amendment if Congress had threatened to withhold federal funding? What about Article V No State, without its consent, shall be deprived of its equal Suffrage in the Senate.  Whether history means that we can have a narrower or broader reading of 14th amendment what role should history play?  Not let the South interfere with getting some measure of equality in deal which would keep the peace.  Dont worry so much about consent of the defeated when youre dealing with a revolution.  Distinguish from original framing of Constitution where everyone was at the table (but it was adopted in violation of the Articles of Confederation), whereas in this case, some were deliberately excluded and the process was circumvented the States were forced to ratify it in order to get their Representatives back in Congress.  Was the Fourteenth Amendment a huge change in terms of shifting the balance of power to the States? Was Southern exclusion a necessary political condition for the Republicans to gain two-thirds vote required by Article Five for constitutional amendment.  Political Question evasion Court dropped juris of Georgia v. Stanton (for destruction of original state govt during Congressional Reconstruction), but Supreme Court said it was a political question and that they didnt have juris.  Ct. said case involved rights of sovereignty, political jurisdiction, of govt, of corporate existence as a state, with all constitutional powers and privilege. Ct. said private rights or private property were not main question, even though property of state was at issue. Ex Part McCardle individual rights affected by Reconstruction Acts Congress removed Cts juris.  Add in Reconstruction and Post-Reconstruction history from Foner *** Civil Rights Act and its aftermath Enactment of the 14th amendment (1866) Congress had questions about what power it had under 13th to legislate, so it added 14th amendment.  The questions relate to power to control contracts and property, since those had traditionally been governed under state common law how well Congress could control labor contracts to completely eliminate servitude.  1873 Slaughter House cases and economic rights under the 14th amendment Four years after the 14th amendment and three years after Southern states govts returned, but before the Democrats regain control of the House.  Right after the major waves of Klan violence and legislation to control the Klan.  1883 Both houses of Congress controlled by Democrats.  The Compromise of 1877 was Rutherford Hayes (Republican) running against Tilden (Democrat) after the disastrous administration of Grant (corruption and fraud) , but there were contested votes in the electoral college.  Congress set up a special electoral commission with equal Democrats and Republicans to decide the vote challenges, and declared Hayes the winner by one electoral vote.  The commission reported to the Congress, but the Democrats threatened to filibuster the report results, so a deal had to be struck to prevent the Dems from filibustering.  The deal was the withdrawal of federal troops from the South, the appointment of one Southerner to Hayes cabinet, and some economic aid for the South. The withdrawal of troops meant the end of Reconstruction.  Civil Rights cases were effort to strike down Civil Rights Act of 1875 (That all persons within the juris of the US shall be entitled to the full and equal enjoyment of the accommodations....of inns, public conveyances on land...) This was the last gasp of radical Republicanism, prior to the Compromise.  Civil Rights Act was concerned more with social rights rather than political rights.  Inns - Restriction of Freedom of movement impedes your ability to earn a living bringing agricultural products to markets capacity to earn a living and own your own labor is the core of the 13th amendment.  Early 14th Amendment cases and meaning of Equal Protection Strauder (1880) equal protection extends to jury service p. 259 Holding Established the right to have your race represented in the jury pool, but not in the jury itself.  Could still keep blacks from being on juries by property tests, literacy tests, etc.  What has symbolic significance here?  Making sure that equality of protection does not extend fully to all civil or political rights for all people Equality of protection does not require that all persons shall be permitted to participate in the govt and administration of laws, to hold offices, or to be clothed with public trusts. Yet no one will contend that equal protection to women, to children, to the aged, to aliens, can only be secured by allowing persons of the class to which they belong to act as jurors in cases affecting their interests.  Guardianship or wardship was still appropriate for women and children, but not for black men. Maleness is the reason all the arguments about male privilege have to be extended to black men as well. It was no longer proper to see black men as other than free for economic reasons as well, although many of the contracts in place after slavery ended really were still onerous contracts.  Children and women were still seen to be in positions of economic subordination. But the condition of economic subordination slavery, was lifted for men and so the argument for denying them political rights by being economically subordinate was no longer true.  Badge of inferiority By singling out blacks from serving on juries b/c of their color, is a brand upon them, an assertion of their inferiority, a stimulant to race prejudice which is an impediment to securing to individuals equal justice which the law aims to secure to all others.  Does cost state govt more to do exclusions on a race-neutral basis, if someone makes sure that restrictions are enforced on a race-neutral basis. But this was not the case they were always enforced unevenly against Blacks.  But the conflicts taking place in the South are not just black/white, but also of class keeping political control for white wealthy Southern planters and excluding poor whites or carpetbaggers.  Political vs. Social Rights Uses the word political, even though there were strong beliefs that the 14th amendment didnt reach political rights.  Says that amendment allows for exclusion based on property, education, de facto is ok effectively painting an evasive path for the Southern States showing them how to legally discriminate.  Paints them as ignorant and children inferior in social status. The case could have been kinder towards blacks did not need to go so far as to depict them as inferior.  Serving on juries was a civil right derivate of a political right is this more properly a civil or political right?  Even among the Republicans, there were radicals and conservatives some who pushed for the black vote and others who didnt.  Some of the debate was about federalism whether war required a whole new look at federalism...some Northerners would have had problems with having the 14th amendment read broadly to open up a whole new field of political rights, which the States had traditionally regulated.  Equality of protection extends only to political rights leaves social rights as they stood before. Political rights enumerated are opening courts for blacks, prevention and redress of wrongs, enforcement of contracts, same rules of evidence and procedure, no impediments to property and pursuit of happiness. Difference between de facto and de jure discrimination intact De facto discrimination on the basis of property laws, age, educational qualifications De jure discrimination on its face discrimination, as was the case in Strauder.  Plessy (1896) p. 272 Social Equality as Distinguished from Political Background Plessy was an octoroon he was 1/8 black.  Was brought by group of blacks and lawyers who thought they could defeat the law by claiming that Plessy was denied his property right of being considered white by being forced to sit in the black compartment of the train.  Ruling 13th amendment only deals with slavery or servitude and making people ride in separate cars is not a form of servitude.  14th amendment enforces absolute equality of the two races before the law, but in the nature of things it could not have been intended to abolish distinctions based upon color, or to enforce social, as distinguished from political equality, or a enforce a commingling of the two races upon terms unsatisfactory to either. He refers to school separation, specifically segregated schools in Northern abolitionist states where political rights have been generally supported, to show that the 14th amendment could not have meant to prohibit segregation.  If the 14th amendment were to be read that way, then it would go against custom and practices.  Draws distinction between social and political rights says that the Constitution cannot put them upon the same plane socially and that legislation is powerless to eradicate racial instincts or abolish distinctions based upon physical differences. Says that extent of State police power extends only to that which is reasonable only to laws which are enacted for the public good in good faith.  Says underlying fallacy of Ps argument is that enforced separation stamps blacks with badge of inferiority.  Current doctrine:  Gives Congress much more power to legislate under 13th amendment to abolish all badges or incidences of slavery.  Can any legislation predicated under a theory of black inferiority be unconstitutional under the 13th amendment.  Harlan dissent 13th amendment prevents imposition of any burdens or disabilities which constitute badges of slavery.  If the intent was to abolish practices which made blacks inferior (a broad reading), then there might be a good argument under the 13th amendment.  If the Court had abolished segregation and taken a leadership role, would it have helped or hurt the civil rights movement?  Can separate practical significance of a law from its symbolic significance where symbolic significance is more harmful that it had to be. Giles (1903) separate handout; circularity of reasoning; voting discrimination best addressed by legislature court can provide no remedy Background Under section 187 of article 8 of the Alabama constitution persons registered before January 1, 1903, remain electors for life unless they become disqualified by certain crimes, etc., while after that date severer tests come into play which would exclude, perhaps, a large part of the black race.  Therefore, by the refusal, the plaintiff and the other negroes excluded were deprived not only of their votes at an election which has taken place since the bill was filed, but of the permanent advantage incident to registration before 1903.  The white men generally are registered for good under the easy test and the black men are likely to be kept out in the future as in the past. This refusal to register the blacks was part of a general scheme to disfranchise them, to which the defendants and the State itself, according to the bill, were parties. Rising tide of white supremacy and violence.  Ruling Administration defeating intent cannot cure initial invalidity If the instrument truly is void, then his registration would also be invalid how would the court become party to an invalid instrument and add another voter to its lists.  The fraud would not be cured through registration of all blacks frauds or unconstitutionality in the AL constitution cannot be cured by administration that defeated intent to exclude blacks. Court of equity jurisdictional determination political question should be left up to legis.  Needs to determine ability to enforce decision circuit court has no constitutional power to control action by direct means. Court has little practical power over people in the state. If conspiracy and intent on the part of the white population exist, then simply registering blacks is not going to cure the problem unless court is prepared to supervise voting, then all P could get is empty form. Relief from great political wrong has to be given by legislative and political dept. of US.  What about applied challenges and affirmative injunctions?  Is it about the distinction between equitable and legal relief?  Brewers dissent Wiley v. Sinkler got relief recovered damages of election board for rejecting his vote.  Evaluation and aftermath Signaled that SC would not intervene in state efforts to disenfranchise blacks Holmes indicated that Congress and President should intervene by sending troops, etc.  Giles filed an action in state court for damages and a writ of mandamus ordering him to be registered  Court ruled that if provisions of AL constit violated 14th and 15th amendments, then it followed that registrars had no right to register him, and refusal to do so cant mean damages If registrars did have auth, then decisions about who was qualified were judicial acts for which registrars were legally immune SC affirmed the ruling Congress then said that the proper forum (in debating disenfranchisement in election of South House member) was not the legislature not ideal body to pass constitutional judgment on acts of other bodies the citizen deprive of his vote in SC should go through the SC courts system.  Congress could have used Section 2 of 14th amendment to reduce reps of Southern states in Congress Was this Holmes signaling that if majority rule dictated something, there was nothing that should be done by the court? Electoral majorities as unanswerable military victors... Or does it reflect that that adjudication must be results-oriented? If no remedy, no ruling.. Was Holmes using realism to escape courts cowardice or to justify his own racist feelings? Pildes: Political context of disenfranchisement was more fluid was not unstoppable. Disenfranchising constit passed with slim majorities a negative court decision could have easily influenced the tide.  Or that law is impotent before history?  Some later court cases (Guinn) which struck down OK registration-date statutes (picking date before 14th amendment) as unconstit. Distinguished claim from Giles in that P was making legal claim, not equitable.  False Start: Slaughter House cases : The Privileges and Immunities clause in 14th amendment application of the Bill of Rights to the States 14th Amendment and Privileges and Immunities Issues What does the 14th amendment have to say about the economic side of social rights? Privileges and immunities of citizenship as a concept, life, liberty and property.  The 13th amendment places economic rights at the center free labor and the belief that so long as nothing is interfering with the right of black people to earn a living through their labor, then everything else will take care of itself.  Allowing free labor is the foundation of civil society and the most important thing that Congress can do is to protect that foundation.  Story lines of the civil war deprivation of civil liberties, secession and slavery.   If it was about secession and slavery, then as long as there are laws to prevent slavery, then it was enough.  But if it was more civil liberties, then it encompasses much more than economic rights to include civil rights, and federal legislation is needed to grant civil rights. Historical interpretations - there were different ideas about what 13th and 14th amendment were supposed to do Do you construe 14th amendment narrowly only about slavery, or taken more generally to any other population that finds itself enslaved.  Does it just apply to economic rights to the right to own your own labor and the other things that were part of a system of free labor. Is it narrowly about the conditions of slaves, or were the Black Codes a kind of tyranny that exists when States legislate to put burdens on particular classes of individuals?  And rather than seeing the whole history of emancipation followed by restrictive legislation as just problems of the slaves, you could see it rather as a problem of class legislation being able to be instituted without any checks on it.  There were other kinds of restrictions against whites as well banning freedom of the presses, Klan action against them.  What does privileges and immunities mean? Does it mean that the 14th amendment applies the Bill of Rights (the basic privileges and immunities) to the states?  Article IV Sec. 2: prevents state from denying citizens of other states the privileges and immunities it accords its own citizens.  Washington protected rights, which are in their nature, fundamental; which belong, of right, to the citizens of all free govts. Congressional debate over 14th amendment Protect basic rights from state interference To privileges and immunities in Article IV should be added person rights guaranteed and secured by first eight amendments of constit. first eight amendments define privileges and immunities. Historical record found no recognition of congress or state legislatures of defining first eight amendments to be privileges and immunities protected.  How do our institutions and courts do in managing the crisis of the period? Are cases like the civil rights cases and Plessy correctly decided? If it was defeated for 100 years for including economic rights under the 14th amendment, then what does it say about the system?  Will majorities always win out and there is nothing you can do to stop them? Holmes and Kramer: Majorities will win out if there is a strong majority that wants its view to prevail, then there is nothing the courts nor constitution can do about it.  Giles is an example of Holmes reasoning in this area.  Then how do you protect minorities? Had the court done something, then it may have bolstered the will of the real majority to express itself, or slowed down the disenfranchisement to see what the will of the real majority was.  Some apparent majorities are not real majorities, but can be strengthened by court decisions.  What heroes can you find in this era? The heroes were still incredibly ignorant of what it meant to be black in this era. Do the ends always justify the means? Would we have a more coherent body of 14th amendment law if we could use the privileges and immunities clause rather than the equal protection clause? Are we hobbled by the intellectual coherence the one place in the 14th amendment where there seems to be substantive rights. Slaughter House cases (1873) neutralization of privileges and immunities clause of 14th amendment Background LA legislature gave monopoly in livestock landing and slaughterhouses to one company law reqd all butchers to butcher there. Several butchers brought suit challenging monopoly, arguing that law violated right to practice trade.  Argued that restrictions created involuntary servitude, deprived them of property w/o due process, denied equal protection, and abridged privileges and immunities as citizens.  Why is the Supreme Court addressing itself to this statute whether it is within States police power to create a slaughter house monopoly? Commerce Clause question have to figure out whether a particular kind of regulation should be viewed as police power of state or whether it should be viewed as a regulation of commerce.  New York City v. Miln is licensing of navigation regulation of commerce or is it valid exercise of police power.  Isnt it up to a state to decide whether the regulation is something they have the power to enact? The regulation in this case does not seem to affect commerce seems to be squarely in the health sphere of regulation.  Are the majority and dissenting opinions in agreement about the facts of this case? They characterize differently the effect of the regulation on the butchers. Majority the company has to let anyone work within the slaughter house, otherwise they are fined. So there isnt a real restriction they just have to butcher and slaughter in the facilities of the corporation.  Dissenting should be able to work wherever they please. It is ruining their livelihood.  Is it a legitimate public purpose? Majority McCulloch if something is within the proper purposes of the govt, then the legislature can use any means which advance the ends.  Butchering is obnoxious to public health odors and waste.  Dissent Grant to a corporation for which no public purpose is served. Naked case where a right to pursue a lawful and necessary calling is infringed Very clear that legislation is bad burdens a particular unpopular group. Naked is usually used to label legislation bad. The motivating purpose was to hurt this group.  What are the views of privileges and immunities Miller: Narrow view restricts anyone from reading 14th amendment as strongly protective of rights of blacks or anyone.  Privileges and immunities refers to citizens of the United States, not of the State. 14th amendment rights, as constitutional rights, will then be understood to be narrow. The states can regulate in many areas as part of the police power, so fundamental rights have to be balanced against state regulation. Rights against govt that Miller asserts (which already existed and were applied prior to 14th amendment): To come to the seat of govt to assert any claim he may have upon that govt, to transact any business he may have with it, to seek its protection, share its offices, engage in administering its functions. Free access to the seaports Courts of justice in several states Demand the care and protection of the govt over his life, liberty and property when on the high seas or within the jurisdiction of a foreign govt Right to peaceably assemble and petition for redress of grievances Writ of habeas corpus Most of the fundamental rights cases under Article IV those are basic rights of contract, legal protection, are state rights.  It doesnt really matter than what the facts of the case are even if it is an absolute monopoly w/o public good then it still doesnt fit under privileges and immunities of 14th amendment.  14th amendment was just about slavery, it was not about extending the Bill of Rights to the states. Bradleys dissent goes for a broad view of rights For the preservation, exercise, and enjoyment of these rights the individual citizen...must be left free to adopt such calling, profession, or trade as may seem to him most conducive to that end. Without this right he cannot be a freeman. This right to choose ones calling is an essential part of that liberty which is the object of govt to protect; and a calling, when chosen, is a mans property and right.  Occupational freedom was part and parcel of the most very important freedoms that must be protected. Links two conceptions of free labor and the right to pursue trade or profession and the right to be free of unequal legislation. Ties them together.  Due Process - If being able to slaughter anywhere is a kind of property, then an economic due process claim could be made. Miller Due process will never be relevant under no construction of that provision that we have ever seen, or any that we deem admissible, can the restraint imposed by the State of Louisiana upon the exercise of their trade...be held to be a deprivation of property within the meaning of that provision.  Yet by late 19th century and early 20th, due process clause was found to protect economic rights. Then in 20th century, extended to safeguard privacy and autonomy rights like right to marry, custody of ones children, right to purchase and use contraceptives, and right to abortion.  Equal protection Miller Equal protection is not applied to any laws which single out a class of people for injustice leaves equal protection somewhat open, but not to this case. Only was meant for blacks, not anyone else.  But he was wrong on this account equal protection has been extended to gender, alienage, and legitimacy. Bradleys dissent The civil war was also about national disunity. Spirit and disloyalty to the National govt which had troubled the country for so many years in some of the States, and that intolerance of free speech and free discussion...and led to much unequal legislation. In which American citizenship should be a sure guaranty of safety, and in which every citizen of the United States might stand erect on every portion of its soil, in the full enjoyment of every right and privilege belonging to a freeman, without fear of violence or molestation... Talks about unequal legislation protecting the minority from the tyranny of the majority. He paints a picture of tyranny.  Thread of slaughter house cases to civil rights cases Whatever fundamental rights are protected by 14th amendment, they are not broad enough to include economic rights to a livelihood. Despite the experience of secession and reincorporation of Southern states and the reasons one might have to distrust states, that is not going to be the principle that emerges as the guiding interpretation of the 14th amendment.  When it is private discrimination, the recourse is to go through state govt and courts the 14th amendment is not so suspicious of states that the federal govt has to protect individual rights. The civil rights, those not in the exclusive jurisdiction of the feds, are still in the hands of the states to protect, at least so long as the state is acting within the range of its proper police power and so long as the burden that is being placed on individuals is not extraordinary.  Lochner protection of economic rights arises as a due process claim substantive due process. It is the same clause used to protect privacy has room for economic protection.  The State Action Requirement and Limitations on Congresss Section 5 Enforcement Power Why is there a state action requirement? Text of constitution Limits application to just govt nor shall any state; First amendment- Congress Historical Explanation Blackstone - Individuals possessed natural rights and the common law protected from infringement. Cover Blackstone almost uniformly found coincidence of common law and natural law. Originalist this was the theory when the constitution was created....Bill of Rights completed safeguards by protecting rights from federal encroachment. But what about constitutional freedoms that have no protection at common law? Freedom of speech...Court has recognized rights outside of constit, so congruence between common law and constit. rights has decreased, making state action more troubling. Policy justifications Zone of private autonomy Preserves an area of individual freedom by limiting the reach of federal law and federal judicial power. Private actors have freedom to ignore constit. Also sacrifices individual freedom b/c it permits violations of rights some have advocated that Ct employ balancing test (Goodman, Black, Horowitz) balance competing claims of freedom rather than always rule for non-govt D. Some scholars claim that SC already employs balancing test w/o admitting it. Enhances federalism by preserving zone of state sovereignty Fed. Constit. rights do not govern individual behavior and that Congress lacks auth to apply them to private conduct. Structuring legal relationship of private citizens was zone for the state, not federal govt. But federal govt has come to regulate private legal relationships more and more in past century. Does federalism justify intrusion into rights? Civil Rights cases (1883) - State Action Requirement as a Limit on the 14th Amendment Holding of case: Developed state action doctrine, which is quite alive today.  The provisions of the 14th amendment have reference to State action exclusively and not to any action of private individuals.  Declared the Civil Rights Act of 1875 unconstitutional b/c 14th amendment does not apply to private conduct.  Congress could not adopt the law pursuant to its auth under Sec. 2 of 13th amendment b/c refusal to serve a person was no more than an ordinary civil injury and not a badge of slavery.  If sanctioned in some way by the state, or done under state authority, private action could be reached. Could it be used to create federal anti-lynching law and federal troops? Everyone understood in 1883 that there was a long and significant history of private lynchings in the South used during Reconstruction against blacks and whites who tried to assert new rights under the laws.  Question of whether it was private could it have occurred without the silent complicity of law enforcement and local govt and this was why it was necessary to have federal troops present.  So this battle was about whether federal legislation would be able to be used to protect against private violence in the South without explicitly acknowledging state participation in the violence. Then lynching could be a federal offense and create a body of federal law enforcement officials. Whether Congress was given the power to enforce these amendments... So then whether claims could proceed under the 13th amendment for this... 14th Amendment Does the 14th amendment cover state action (enforce any law) or state inaction (deny to any person)? Section 1: No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the US; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.  Harlans dissent: The states police power in areas in which states routinely exercise that power, and that failure to exercise their power is meaningful the absence of action is meaningful in the context in which the state can usually be expected to act.  US v. Hall denying rights includes inaction as well as action, the omission to protect, as well as the omission to pass laws to protect.  Corrective power of Congress enforcement power Section 5: Congress shall have the power to enforce, by appropriate legislation, the provisions of this amendment. Bradley believes the 14th amendment to be only corrective in nature only to correct state laws that are passed (action).  Was Congress free to enforce, even if no conduct had actually occurred which was violative of the amendment prophylactic legislation.  Came up that all Congress was free to do was correct actual violations, although could legislate if it knew a violation was about to happen.  Does inaction in the context of where there should be action essentially the same as action?  What recourses could the individual have?  What other recourses could victims have: To petition the state legislature to change or make law. Common law a private cause of action to sue the proprietor. To petition the state to revoke the proprietors license to operate.  Is this inaction of the state meaningful since there are other recourses? But there are no actual recourses, since the threat of private violence deters these recourses. The court may not have understood this to be a situation in which without federal action blacks would have been entirely without recourse.  Harlan says that if there is a line between state action and something that is not, then there is at least state action when talking about these kinds of public infused private places they are quasi-public. Inaction wrt to these places is meaningful inaction against a background of expected state regulation of these places.  Can private individuals destroy rights without the official support of the State? The wrongful act of an individual, unsupported by any such authority, is simply a private wrong...but if not sanctioned in some way by the State...his rights remain in full force, and may presumably be vindicated by resort to the laws of the State for redress.  If you eliminate the distinction between action and inaction, then you dont have to worry about state/private distinction, since the state would be violating the 14th amendment by not passing laws to protect people in public or private.  13th amendment Restriction of freedom of movement was not a badge slavery Free blacks would not be prevented from exercising their rights if Northern abolitionist states prohibited free blacks from entering their states during slavery, then our sense of what is a badge of slavery has to be historically informed by what distinctions were drawn between the slave and the free among blacks in the period.  The rights that free blacks didnt have either couldnt have been badges or incidences of slavery.  Restriction of freedom of movement could be seen as a badge of slavery But you cant separate the history of belief of blacks racial inferiority from the institution of slavery.  The origins of the interferences of free movement of blacks were all from slavery it would make it too easy for blacks to escape slave conditions.  They are part and parcel of a slave society.  Do blacks still need special protection or can blacks be treated as ordinary citizens? In the context of inns, what are the possibilities? Build your own inns or turn to the states and utilize the standard political process lobby the legislature, go to court, etc.  When you look at these cases as a whole, then there are various recourses that the Court points to which then subsequently get taken away relation to Giles.  Harlan still relies on publicness to make the badges of slavery arguments.  Shelly v. Kraemer diluting the state action requirement; court enforcement of racially restricted covenants can be state action Historical Background In the 1920s, the Supreme Court had struck done racially discriminatory zoning ordinances even where ordinance had enforced existing zones.   Shelley was still surprising, even though the DOJ was supporting it, b/c of the breadth of the State action theory that was being articulated here.  There was a lot of international disapproval of US racial policies that the US was preaching democracy but enforcing segregation. There were also a lot of cases in which the Supreme Court had already struck down discriminatory housing and property clauses. In the post-WWII period, there is massive suburbanization and if you have developers developing new suburbs it would be very easy for developers to put restrictive covenants in the housing developments like Levittown. The court is seeing the massive potential for expansion of restrictive covenants if the court doesnt act.  Issue was court enforcement of private covenants state action? Or was it simply implementing private choices? Zoning ordinances are easy state action, since the state is specifically acting to enact an ordinance.   But the state action here is simply the state courts being open for the enforcement of private agreements - covenant.  There are questions of privity and substantive law that can determine whether contract is enforceable, but the idea that you can go to court to enforce a private contract or private property agreement was always considered not to be public law. Government enforcement is necessary to reinforce the private right to contract, but it was not seen as state action.  Holding Court enforcement has the govt, through its judicial branch, facilitating discrimination. The participation of the state consists in the enforcement of the restrictions. Action of state courts and judicial officers in their official capacities is to be regarded as action of the state within the meaning of the 14th amendment. New York Times v. Sullivan the test is not the form in which state power has been applied but, whatever the form, whether such power has in fact been exercised.  How far has Shelly gone? So Shelley has not generally established that court enforcement of private contracts are state action and court has rarely applied it no articulated limiting principles in majority opinion. Here, is the state action providing a forum for enforcement of the private contract? Or, is it that states play a more active role in upholding restrictive covenants providing an attractive forum? If Shelley holds, then anyone who believes that his or her rights have been violated can sue in state courts if the state doesnt forbid violation, then hasnt there been state action? What about a balancing test for private action balancing rights of property owners against discrimination. Discrimination would win in cases where property is open to public, but not where it isnt.  Roses theory: Line of cases that led to Shelley was litigated in a very sophisticated way in the way in which it used property law and in the development of these cases, advocates did a very good job of explaining why racially restrictive covenants conflicted with core and important principles of property law as to when they were enforceable and when they were not. Courts were not merely being neutral wrt covenants, but instead were bending over backwards to enforce them by ignoring restrictions on when you can impose restrictive covenants that existed in the common law or statutory law of their own states. They often pointed to technical insufficiencies in the covenants.  The doctrine of changed circumstances had already lowered property values in cities that the large influx of blacks to certain cities made it so that highest economic value you could get out of a sale was to sell it to blacks. Many sellers were arguing changed circumstances to challenge covenants that they should not longer be enforced. The Supreme Court had a property law based intuition, that had the law been neutrally enforced by state courts, they could not have struck it down. Bell v. MD (1964); lunch counter sit-in; SC avoided deciding whether there is state action as a result of criminal trespass; reaching private vs. state conduct  Background This consolidated a bunch of trespass convictions for lunch counter sit-ins.  The court heard arguments in October, 1963, but doesnt issue a decision until after the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  The court does this very elegant and bizarre job of explaining why these convictions disappear as a matter of state law and why the question is not before them anymore.  Holding Dissent Douglas argued that private property was being used for a public purpose and that it should be line w/ Shelley in holding 14th amendment requires same from restrictive covenant cases as it does for restaurants. MD enforced its segregation policies through police, prosecutors, courts, so there was state action.  Black, White, and Harlan disagree saying that the issue is of national importance and that they should answer it by overturning the convictions and saying, that like in Shelley v. Kramer, that there is state action through a supposedly neutral law being used for discrimination.  They want to revisit the question of whether private entities are really more public through the fact that they have to obtain state licenses to operate.  Majority Black Shelley was ruled state action more b/c of the fact that it had deprived property owners of rights that should have been vested narrowly applying where buyer and seller both want to conduct transaction. Sit-in was different b/c restaurant did not want business, so mere judicial enforcement is not enough.  Court ducking real issues Even at the height of civil rights unrest, the court is still not coming out with bold statements, but still using the moment to say that Congress and the courts have a broad mandate to address civil rights issues.  Should the court have used this and the other sit-in cases to make law saying that this counted as state action and prior housing plans constituted state action, then it would have been much harder for a conservative majority to shift the other way.  Was the step back that Congress took a step away from obliterating all state and local distinctions in favor of an all powerful federal force. How can state and local and federalism concerns ever trump equality and other liberties.  Connection between Bell v. MD and state action doctrine The Republicans in Congress wanted to base it on 14th amendment rather than Commerce Clause, b/c on a political level the 14th amendment was still theirs since it was drafted and passed by Republicans.  The Democrats had used the Commerce Clause to their advantage in the New Deal legislation, but what convinced them was an essay by a Harvard law professor saying that an expansion of the state action doctrine would go much further to expand federal power did not have a logical stopping point.  So the commerce clause was an easier case the court would more logically find it constitutional b/c there was a rational stopping point for the expansion of federal power.  Katzenbach v. Morgan (1966) p. 489 Congress can only ratchet up; Congress has power to determine meaning of 14th amendment Background This is a little different involves the NY law saying that voters had to speak English and literacy requirements.  New York is viewed as a successful case of integration of immigrants, so New York was not viewed as the court as a state whose literacy cases should be red flagged. But there was bipartisan support in the legislature at the point to make sure that Puerto Ricans in American flag schools were allowed to vote, b/c there were so many Puerto Ricans in New York.  The distinction gets draw in the Voting Rights act b/c these were people who were educated in American schools, there was a large community of Spanish speakers in new york with their own newspapers and TV stations, so that new york could not make those assumptions about a literacy requirement in English for this population in terms of having an educated electorate.  Holding: SC held Voting Rights Act as proper exercise of the powers granted to Congress by Sec. 5 of 14th Congress could have concluded that granting Puerto Ricans the right to vote would empower them and help them eliminate discrimination against them. Could find that the literacy test denied equal protection, even though SC said no in Lassiter. Gives Congress the right to define meaning of 14th amendment. Rejected the view that legislative power is confined to the insignificant role of abrogating only those state laws that the judicial branch was prepared to adjudge unconstitutional By holding Sec 5 the draftsmen sought to grant to Congress, by a specific provision applicable to the 14th amendment, the same broad powers expressed in the Necessary and Proper Clause. What is the relationship between court and cong. when both are active in civil rights  Dissent:  If Congress can use its power under Sec. 5 to interpret the constitution, it conceivable use auth to dilute or negate constitutional rights. Brennan: Contrary to the suggestion of the dissent, Sec. 5 does not grant Congress power to exercise discretion in the other direction and to enact statutes so as in effect to dilute equal protection and due process decisions of the Court. We emphasize that Congresss power under Sec. 5 is limited to adopting measures to enforce the guarantees of the Amendment; Sec. grants Congress no power to restrict, abrogate, or dilute these guarantees.  DM: She does not see why this case needed to be written in such a complicated way, since Lassiter should not have prevented validation of 4(e). Within the academic community, it was not clear what this case meant, so it did not have as large of an influence as it could have had.  Two different theories on what Cong. doing when it adopts Voting Rights Act under the 14th Amdt.  Assume Lassiter is rightly decided, literacy tests are facially acceptable, so issue is can Cong. act in this situation if a court w/n find this test problematic (b/c of Lassiter) Creating area where Cong. can act even where prior cases seem to have defined 14th Amdt. inconsistent w/Cong. Definition.  Like the aggrieved went to the Cong. instead of the S.C. Cong. acting like courtssee evid. of discrimination and fashioning a remedy If Lassiter means literacy requirements are acceptable, and c/n challenge on the facts of this case, but Cong. is striking down, must be doing on some theory of relationship between literacy requirement and 14th Amdt. that court w/n find Under what authority is Cong. doing this?  Finding that discrimination exists in provision of public services Perceived violation of 14th Amdt. rights is discriminating against this community in the provision of public services Cong. can find this community ill-served in numerous ways And using its 14th Amdt. enforcement power, can (notwithstanding Lassiter) fashion a remedy of exemption from literacy requirement Not making judgment on literacy requirement, but just saying that there is a violation of the 14th amendment Cong. not making a judgment as to whether use of literacy requirement is itself a violation of the 14th Amdt.  Just saying something else is a violation of the 14th Amdt., and the remedy can suspend the literacy requirement Even though c/n claim the 14th Amdt. gives this group the remedy as a matter of law Can Cong. give people remedies that would violate 14th Amdt.?  Sometimes court is allowed to do something as a remedy that parties c/n otherwise E.g. in Swann could do race-conscious school assignments School c/n do this action alone (at least w/o any proof of prior discrimination) But should they be free to single-out a subgroup for protection? What if there was a similar group Spanish-speaking group that w/n protected? Ftnt by Brennan Cong. c/n disregard actual or likely interp. of what the 14th Amdt. requires But can promulgate legis. based on more expansive and protective vision of the 14th Amdt.  City of Boerne v. Flores (1997) p. 535; Congruence and proportionality test for determining whether Congress is acting w/in Sec. 5 remedial limitation; clarifies Katzenbach by stating that Congress doesnt have power to determine its own Sec. 5 power; Congress is trying to regulate impacts and not intent; what kind of judicial fact-finding necessary for passing proportionality test?  Facts Decision of local zoning authorities to deny church a building permit was challenged under Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) Smith eliminated heightened standard for facially neutral govt practices that burdened religion. It was a 5-4 decision on an issue in which there were neither briefs nor arguments the parties assumed that the prior cases would apply and it was only a matter of where it fell. The court spontaneously overrules the prior cases sua spontenae like Washington v. Davis and asserts judicial supremacy.  Congress enacted RFRA in direct response to Smith (which allowed for arrest of Indian peyote user) and said that they were overruling Smith and restoring cases prior to it. Congress wanted to reinstate heightened scrutiny. RFRA restricts govt from substantially burdening persons exercise of religion unless govt can demonstrate that burden: Is in furtherance of a compelling govt interest The least restrictive means of further compelling governmental interest Govts argument Congress is protecting one of liberties guaranteed by 14th amendment due process clause free exercise of religion Congressional decision to dispense with proof of deliberate or overt discrimination and instead concentrate on laws effects accords w/ settled understanding of Sec. 5 power. Congresss Sec. 5 power is not limited to remedial or preventative legis Katzenbach says that it is a positive grant of power.  What Congress has the power to do only remedial in nature Legislation which deters or remedies constitutional violations can intrude into state conduct or prohibit conduct which is not in itself unconstitutional. Remedial power is broad... What Congress cant do Congress does not have the power to decree the substance of the 14th amendment Court has primary authority for interpreting constit. anything else would upset the balance. Constitution functions best when all branches respect each other and are separate Legislation which alters the meaning of the free exercise clause cant be said to be enforcing the clause. Congress cant enforce a right by changing what the right is. 14th amendment says that power is not plenary, and is limiting to enforcing 14th amendment this represented compromise between states rights advocates and framers. Intruding too much would upset balance of federalism. Only corrective action was allowed, not general legis. for welfare.  If Congress could define its own powers by altering the 14th amendments meaning, no longer would the Constitution by superior and paramount law, unchangeable by ordinary means. It would be on a level with ordinary legis acts, and like other acts,...alterable when the legislature shall please to alter it. (Marbury v. Madison)  Congruence and proportionality test to determine what the line is (between injury and means) impact or intent, effects; state action; level of scrutiny Congruence: Appropriateness of remedial measures must be considered in light of the evil presented (nature of violation determines scope of remedy). RFRAs record lacks any showing of religious bigotry emphasis on laws was rather generally applicable laws placing incidental burdens on religion.  When exercise of religion has been burdened in incidental way by law of general application, it does not follow that persons affected have been burdened any more than other citizens, let alone burdened b/c of religious beliefs Proportionality: Very out of proportion to supposed remedial or preventative object cant be understood as response to unconstitutional behavior.  Very broad coverage at all levels of govt displaces laws and prohibits actions of almost every description & subject matter.  Reach and scope are different from other measures voting rights was limited to states that had violated; provisions banning literacy tests was aimed at one particular invidious qualification;  Congress is effectively adopting strict scrutiny test would require opening prospect of constitutionally required religious exemptions from civic obligations of almost every kind. Many laws will not meet the compelling interest test.  Substantial cost imposed. What limits are placed on Congress w/ this test? Does Congress have to limit its remedy to only states which are in violation how narrowly tailored?  What kind of fact finding does Congress have to make?  To the extent that the Court requires Congress to do a type of judicial fact-finding discovery process and evidence rules you are moving in a direction where Congress will not be able to act.  If you impose more and more judicial evidence rules, then Congress will be less able to act and the Court will become the only institution capable of remedying the discrimination.  Prior case law and supremacy Washington v. Davis disparate impact standard not in the place to review every piece of legislation just about anything Congress does could have disparate impacts on protected groups. It is unpredictable to say what kinds of govt actions can place burdens on groups.  Cooper v. Aaron - the court is not only arguing for respect, but is also making an argument that it is deserving of respect on this argument. If you are trying to persuade the people to act with the court, you may have to do a little persuading. (Court is saying that even when there is a 5-4 decision, they still have to treat it as the law this is the closest that Congress ever came to specifically overruling a Supreme Court decision. There still arent any dissents from the courts 5 analysis.  Defining Remedial side of Katzenbach triggers no dissents Questions What is Congress allowed to do? Katzenbach this was not anything that Congress relied on in its statutes came after Congress made the decision to predicate its civil rights legislation on the Commerce Clause.  You would think that there would be new cases refining the powers but it is more remarkable that all of the civil rights cases had so little to do with 5 power in order to use 14th amendment it was going to have to come up against Civil Rights cases and the state action requirement.  If the state action requirement were eliminated, then Congress power would know no bounds Congress not wanting to put the 14th amendment to the test makes it difficult for us when they come up now.  Congruence and proportionality test captures the idea that what Congress should be trying to remedy or prevent is a constitutional violation.  State action Is the conduct that Congress worried about state action? It cant be prohibited under 14th amendment unless it is state action. Morrison it cant be valid legislation unless it is only directed at state actors.  Regulating impacts or regulating intents Specific types of Congress acts regulating facially neutral conduct Congress has to reach conclusion that there is bad conduct through the specific level of scrutiny to examine the conduct they want to punish. If Congress is saying that there is discrimination against mentally retarded, then the Court would run an index to find what type of scrutiny applies. If the conduct to be remedied is conduct involving a rationality review classification and the conduct does not flunk rationality review, then Congress doesnt get to act. If Congress sees gender discrimination, it is not enough to say that there are things being done by state actors, Congress must show that the state actions flunk intermediate review.  Congress has more freedom of motion under Sec. 5 for legislating for race and other strict scrutiny categories than it does for gender, and than it does for other statuses (gay, age, mentally retarded).  Freedom of Congress to regulate an action v. the freedom state actors have to engage in a type of discrimination (only subject to lower levels of scrutiny).  If in order for there to be legislation state conduct has to flunk rationality review, then it gives Congress very little latitude to operate in this area and state actors will be able to discriminate.  US v. Morrison (2000) Supp 55; Congress only has remedial power; must be congruent and proportional Facts Violence Against Women Act was enacted by Congress in response to pervasive bias in various state justice systems against victims of gender-motivated violence. Many participants in state justice systems are perpetuating stereotypes that result in insufficient investigation and prosecution of gender-motivated crime, inappropriate focus on behavior and credibility of victims, and unacceptably lenient punishments. Bias denies victims equal protection of the laws and therefore Congress acted reasonably in establishing private remedy. Petitioner was raped and sued state under civil rights remedy.  Limitations on 14th amendment power Prohibits only state action; erects no shield against private conduct Harris and Civil Rights Congress cant regulate private conduct w/o reference to state laws Adherence to state action requirement preserves an area of individual freedom by limiting the reach of federal law and federal judicial power (Lugar) Congress only has power where enumerated; only remedial power Where subject has not submitted to general legislative power of Congress, but is only submitted thereto for the purpose of rendering effective some prohibition against particular state legislation, the power given is limited by its object, any legislation by Congress in the matter must necessarily be corrective in character, adapted to counteract and redress the operation of such prohibited state laws or proceedings. (Civil Rights cases) Must be congruent and proportional between injury and means Congress could only enact laws, but not act against administration of the laws unless remedy was called for Remedy here is not corrective in character or preventative Not narrowly tailored Voting Rights act was only at states that were violating it This is against all states, even though many are not committing violations Evaluation Pincer movement when Court cuts back simultaneously on Commerce power and Sec. 5 power Civil Rights laws that directly concern economic activity or regulate instrumentalities of interstate commerce not affected, but cant reach other activities that are noneconomic by nature. Most obvious are hate crime laws.. Harris and the Ku Klux Klan act Struck down criminal provisions of Klan Act, but still allowed civil cause of action.  Distinguished Harris by saying that Congresss authority for Klan Act stemmed from Sec. 2 of 13th amend. More important interest here the right of citizens to vote, directly affects integrity of govt School desegregation and the Courts Brown and aftermath History Cases leading up to Brown In 1952-53 SC granted review in five cases challenging separate but euql doctrine. 17 states and DC had segregated public schools. The five cases involved schools that were totally unequal SC; white students had 1 teacher/29 students; blacks had 1 teacher/47 students. White schools were bricks and stucco; blacks were rotting wood. White schools had indoor plumbing; blacks schools had outhouses 1952-53 term justices couldnt agree, but if they had ruled they probably would have affirmed separate but equal doctrine in Plessy. Vinson died in between terms, and Eisenhower appointed Warren to the court. Warren persuaded all of the justices to sign a unanimous decision that separate but equal was impermissible in educ. Brown v. Board of Education (1954) Brown Background Involved challenge to Topeka, KS public schools. Holding Sound rejection of originalism Constitutionality of segregation could not be resolved based on framers intent Historical sources of 14th amendment are at best...inconclusive and that enormous changes in the nature of education made history of little use in resolving issue. in approaching this problem, we cant turn the clock back to 1868 when the Amendment was adopted, or even to 1896 when Plessy was written. We must consider public education in the light of its full development and its present place in American life throughout the Nation.  Cannot turn simply on equality of facilities Cannot turn merely on a comparison of tangible factors in the schools must look at the effects itself of segregation. State-mandated segregation inherently stamps black children as inferior and impairs their education opportunities. To separate them from others of similar age and qualifications solely because of their race generates a feeling of inferiority as to their status in the community that may affect their hearts and minds in a way unlikely ever to be undone. Psychology segregation causes black children to feel inferior and interferes with their learning.  Criticisms of Brown From 96 Southern congressmen Too much jducial activism encroaching upon rights reserved to states and the people Originalist constitution doesnt mention education, nor does 14th amendment  No constitutional amendment changing established legal principle Not far enough Too much reliance on social science data should have just pronounced it morally wrong Studies were methodologically unsound, could affect future cases Focused exclusively on education and failed to provide for desegregation in other contexts Brown II Decided remedy for desegregation Remanded case to lower courts to use traditional equity principles to fashion remedies to admit public schools on a racially nondiscriminatory basis with all deliberate speed. Per Curium Decisions after Brown Definition and Procedure Per curiam opinions after Brown were short opinions not laying out substances in cases that had been on the Supreme Courts docket for deciding whether to take the case or not. They had come onto the docket after the court had decided to hear Brown.  If there are cases, the resolution of which might be affected by other cases already granted cert, the court will hold onto those cases until the court decides the related case and then will look at them again.  What it means is that when the decisions of the court come down, at the next conference, a list will be prepared of cases that will be held for Brown and the court then makes decisions about what to do about these held cases.  The court doesnt have to do anything at all, or it can do a GVR cert is Granted, the opinion below is Vacated, and the case is then Remanded to the court it came up from with instructions to reconsider the original decision in light of the original case.  The per curiams in aftermath of Brown were GVRd and sent back.  If the court GVRs, then it is doing it b/c there is a reasonable possibility that the Court of Appeals will think it has to come out differently given the Courts recent decision. Its a quick way to find other cases which the court thinks are similar.  The GVRd cases after Brown were usually decided on whether facts of the case meant equal, but separate. The court then GVRd saying that these should be decided on a Brown analysis, not a separate but equal.  Sometimes the case comes back to the Supreme Court after GVR and comes back with the same decision, and sometimes the court takes cert to show the Appeals Court the error of their reasoning and sometimes it doesnt.  Decisions Mayor and City Council of Baltimore City v. Dawson (public beaches and bathhouses) Holmes v. City of Atlanta (municipal golf courses) Gayle v. Browder (municipal bus system) Johnson v Virginia (courtroom seating) Turner v. City of Memphis (public restaurants) Results after Brown Ten years after Brown, less than 1% of black children attended schools with whites. Almost all enforcement of Brown was being done by the NAACP, which was very lengthy and difficult litigation. The one advantage that since they were running the show, they could pick the order in which they wanted to bring the cases.  Why was there a delay?  Why wasnt the DOJ involved to enforce the court order?  Section 1983 is part of the old Reconstruction that the DOJ also could have used. Brown II may also have produced a certain kind of tone that produced a wait and see attitude by setting the pacing of the cases to be determined by fact-specific issues decided by district courts.  The Supreme Court itself doesnt get involved again until 1968 even though there were cases in the Court of Appeals in south. The Court was waiting until it saw fact patterns that indicated that things were not being done.  The Court may also have been waiting for the legislative branch to act, so that they are not acting alone. Finally the govt is united behind a Civil Rights platform.  Civil Rights Act of 1964 was passed because of a number of reasons: JFK was assassinated and Johnson decided that he would define the JFK legacy as a civil rights legacy pass the Civil Rights Act since it was JFKs issue. Reformed Southerns played key roles in this era.  Even with Johnsons help, Title VII is passed after the longest filibuster in history.  The southern civil rights leadership under MLK are staging nonviolent protests that are being responded to with increasing violence by the Southern govts turns water cannons on young children the process of the North being fed up with what is happening in the South. In K-12 education, many districts did not do anything until suit a strategy of defiance.  The strategies of defiance didnt involve just leaving the status quo, but there were districts that abandoned public schools, or established white academies, desegregating one year at a time. Other strategies used were voluntary transfer plans (freedom of choice), one grade a year desegregation. Cooper v. Aaron (1958) Background Little Rock school district ordered desegregated during 1957-58 school year, but governor called out AK national guard to keep blacks out. Blacks students began attending white schools only after the President sent out federal troops to protect them. Little Rock then asked for stay of integration plan.  Ruling As this case reaches us it raises questions of the highest importance to the maintenance of our federal system of govt. It necessarily involves a claim by the Governor and Legislature of a State that there is no duty on state officials to obey federal court orders resting on the Courts considered interpretation of the Constitution. Marbury declared the basic princniple that the judiciary is supreme in the exposition of the law of the constitution, and that principle has ever since been respected by this Court and the Country as a permanent and indispensable feature of our constitutional system. An interpretation of the 14th amendment by the Court is the supreme law of the land no state legislator or executive can war against the constitution without violating his undertaking to support it.  Brown could not be nullified either openly or directly by state legislators or state executive or judicial officers... Griffin v. County School Br. (1964) unconstitutional for school systems to close rather than deseg.  Closing schools solely on basis of race is not constitutional option.  Greene v. New Kent County School Board (1968) Establishes difference between de facto and de jure segregation; freedom of choice plans were not constitutional Dual v. Unitary school system Dual where there is still the segregated system.  Unitary - The segregation isnt just a matter of pupil assignment, since it isnt just a matter of repealing laws that enforced segregation . The district has moved away from having racially identified schools.  De facto v. de jure segregation De jure There is some state or school district action that is causing the discrimination a purpose and intent on the part of the district to segregate.  De facto There has been some private choice involved, that whites have fled to the suburbs, withdrawn their students from schools some non-state forces involved in enforcing segregation.  You cannot tell on its face whether the segregation is as a result of discrimination in the past or just private choices.  When the district was a scofflaw district and put in place a practice like freedom of choice, then the court is much more likely to take a harder look at the policies.  Intent/Effect Court struggles with questions of intent and effect. Holding Pattern of separate white and black schools in system established under compulsion of state law was the pattern of segregation that Brown addressed. Freedom of choice plans could never work in a dual school district doesnt hold that all freedom of choice unconstit., but only in dual district. As long as schools are still racially identified as black or white through past state action, freedom of choice cant work. If they become identified as such through private choices economic, demographic factors, this would seem to be ok.  Availability of other more promising courses of action may indicate lack of goods faith; and at the least it places a heavy burden upon the board to explain its preference for a less effective method.  School boards have affirmative duty to take whatever steps necessary to convert to unitary system.  Ruling  Private choice v. state action If Brown was decided on sociological/psychological factor, then the dual system using freedom of choice would not solve the problem.  The conflict is that the Court has traditionally not allowed Congress commerce or 14th amendment legislation over private choice, as opposed to regulation of state action. Clarks dolls showing that black children tended to want to play with white dolls rather than black dolls, didnt go beyond effects of legal separation.  The impact is greater when it has the sanction of law segregation with the sanction of law has a tendency to have back effects. The finding of harm seemed to only be pertaining to segregation that was by law. The Brown opinion itself doesnt move beyond that.  What line to draw when examining settlement patterns perhaps caused by past state discrimination? Yet when you try to distinguish between dual and unitary systems, the evidentiary patterns on the ground need to be examined to see if anything has really changed.  This creates a problem when the Court thinks that it has gone too far in examining the patterns and isnt insisting enough that the segregation be casually tied to prior de jure state action discrimination.  Can we look only a school-related policies, or can we extend that to look at the local govts segregated public housing policies or the state govt? Is this the kind of state action that Brown is going to govern? How narrowly or broadly Brown will affect education systems will depend on this.  Why are freedom of choice plans a problem? Black parents may have been afraid to send their children to white schools, that they would be the target of violence.  Black schools were never equal to white schools, so white parents would never send their parents there.  There could easily be defense of no rooms available for black children. There would have to be a gradual change even in the absence of coercion.  It is state action or omission to not protect black children from violence or taunts?  The first step in this school district was not taken until 11 years after Brown a long delay. Deliberate delay could have only perpetuated the harm.  NAACP position That freedom of choice plans were facially unconstitutional The Court doesnt address this doesnt say that they would always be illegal b/c they may not totally want to cut off private choice.   Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education (1971); Court has power to fashion remedial remedy that involves busing; nature of violation determines remedy Background This was not a case in which zero progress has been made 50% of black students were attending integrated schools. This was a district that was structured so that the district wasnt limited to the city limits it included the surrounding county, some of which was suburban and some of which was urban. This meant that if you wanted a district only remedy, you had both whites and blacks in the districts in a way in which you would not have had it in many cities.  There were patterns of suburbanization taking place all over lots of new housing opportunities were cropping up, but many were under restricted covenants. So there was already a shift of where whites and blacks would be found.  There was extensive busing so that no elementary school would have fewer than 9% blacks and greater than 38% blacks.  Circuit Court of Appeals vacated the plan b/c they said that it would put an undue burden on board and systems pupils.  Holding Court has power to fashion remedy If school authorities fail in affirmative obligations, judicial authority may be invoked once a right and violation have been shown, scope of district courts equitable powers to remedy past wrongs is broad. Nature of violation determines remedy there can only be a remedy if there is a wrong. Upheld limited use of racial goals in remedial orders Use of ratios within equitable remedy is permitted, but only as a starting point, not as a requisite racial mix If Court had required as substantive right some particular racial mix, that would be unconstitutional Plan for unitary system could retain some one-race schools One-race schools are ok, but the burden is on the school to show that its practices are not discriminatory The system can be deemed to be unitary even if there are virtually one-race schools in the district.  The question for unitariness is not if a martian landing would see one school as black and another as white, but instead to look at the patterns of population of the schools and examine if there is segregation as a result of past discriminatory action.  This raises the question of action action on whose part? District Court possessed power to order pupil reassignments on basis of race Loaded game board (due to past segregation) justified affirmative action in form of remedial altering of attendance zones Pairings and groups of noncontiguous school zones is permissible Can use busing as judicial tool Desegregation cannot be limited to walk-in schools can use busing. Can be some valid objections to lengthy transportation reconciliation of competing values in a desegregation case is a difficult task w/ many sensitive facets, but no fundamentally more than courts of equity have traditionally employed. Limits of judicial intervention At some time system would be unitary as required by Greene Neither school authorities nor district courts are constitutionally required to make year-by-year adjustments of racial composition of student bodies once affirmative duty to desegregate has been accomplished and racial discrimination through official action is eliminated. In absence of showing deliberate attempt to alter demographic patterns to affect schools, further intervention not nec.  Housing patterns were thought to be de facto rather than de jure discrimination. As with any violation case, the nature of the violation determines the scope of the remedy.  This is eventually used against schools that are trying to use as a remedy participation by localities that had not been involved in creating the pattern of segregation in the first place.  This means that inter-district remedies would not be required.  Keyes case Rhenquist makes it clear in that any case in which challengers were able to show some de jure discrimination going on, then the burden would shift to the school district to show that any segregation was not de jure. The presumption would then be that there was de jure discrimination at work.  Interdistrict Relief and Desegregation private choice theory eroding desegregation and an era of retrenchment Introduction Middle 1970s, and Nixons appointments, as well as changing political mood of country, began to have effect. 1974 Congress passed Equal Education Opportunities Act prohibited busing to school that wasnt closest to residence. Decline in judicial methodology Brown, Cooper, are all examples of good judicial methodology. Only in the 1970s do we start to have poorly crafted opinions.  Desegregation v. Busing; Busing as a political lightning rod When you start dealing with districts without de jure segregation, there is language in Brown, Swann, to take the courts in a more conservative direction where interest of desegregation is only one of a number of interests that the court has to balance.  There is nothing in Brown or Brown II the way Greene lays out what full compliance would look like. Greene doesnt try to put the constitutional words of Brown in play, it just lays out an implementation strategy. Even in Brown II, there is good faith.  As the action shifts away from hot spots like Little Rock, it is not surprising that the court would start to look towards limiting language towards countervailing concerns balancing the costs of busing against desegregation.  The court never said that they were going to clearly restate Brown. When Powell says that busing is a problem, Powell is getting the politics right Congress had passed a statute outlawing busing. Attaching whole desegregation process to busing, Powell was right in guessing how Northern communities reacted to busing it was busing that was the lightning rod.  Difference between de facto segregation and private choice Brown was unclear on telling the difference between de facto segregation and private choice.  School desegregation is not the only area that is trimmed back, but is also occurring in other areas, such as employment discrimination.  In 1972, the highpoint of employment discrimination is Briggs it is no longer willing to say that in cases of factual uncertainty, we should put the thumb on the scale in the direction of intentional discrimination assume, that unless there is strong evidence, that the reason is intentional discrimination.  Timespan was too short The problem is that the timespan was so short only about 57 years of real desegregation before the court said that it had been enough time and that the intensive desegregation was no longer needed.  Milliken v. Bradley (1974) p. 783 de facto discrimination has to be proved in drawing boundary lines before radical busing (from suburbs) is employed Facts District court, having found that de jure segregation existed in Detroit, entered decree that included 53 surrounding suburban districts. Although city was predominantly black and suburbs white, there was no evidence of race-dependent action (such as boundary manipulation) for segregation. Holding Scope of remedy is determined by nature and extent of constitutional violation. Before busing is done and boundaries of separate and autonomous school districts set aside, has to be shown that racially discriminatory acts of state or local school districts has been a substantial cause of inter-district segregation. Without de facto segregation boundary lines draw due to segregationist intent, no constitutional wrong. Dissent (White) local govts entities shouldnt be immune from inter-district remedies; not sovereign entities Constitutional violations were committed by govt in the past. Configuration of local govt units is not immune from alteration when necessary to redress constituitional violations...court has elsewhere required public bodies of state to restructure states political subdivision.  Reynolds v. Sims: political subdivisions of states never were and never have been considered as sovereign entities. Rather, they have been traditionally regarded as subordinate govt instrumentalities created by the state to assist in the carrying out of state govt functions. Dissent (Marshall) States creation through de jure acts of segregation of growin core of all-black schools acted as magnet to attract blacks to areas served by schools and to deter them from settling in suburbs. Rippling effects on residential patterns caused by purposeful acts of segregation do not automatically subside at the school district border. State must be blamed for white flight to suburbs from issuing busing only within Detroit limits state is responsible for drawing initial boundary lines.  Missouri v. Jenkins (1995) p. 788 no need for interdistrict remedy, continued disparity in test scores didnt justify continuance of desegregation order Background MS law was for segregated public schools in Kansas City, MS. Not until 1977 that federal court ordered desegregation of public schools. In 1983, 24 schools in district had black pop of 90%; By 1993 no elementary-level student attended a school an an enrollment that was 90% of more black; middle school, percentage of students attending schools w/ black enrollment of 90% or more declines from about 45% to 22% Rhenquist Holding Ruled in favor of state on every issue SC ordered end to school desegregation Reasoning District Courts order that attempted to attract nonminority students from outside the district was impermissible b/c there was no proof of an interdistrict violation. Social reality is that inner city schools are primarily black, while suburban schools are primarily white. Effect desegregation required interdistrict remedy. Rhenquist applied Milliken v. Bradley to conclude that interdistrict remedy was impermissible b/c there was only proof of intradistriction violation. District court lacked authority to order increase in teacher salaries. Across the board salary increase was essential to attract teachers for desegregation, but not necessary as remedy. Continued disparity in student test scores didnt justify continuance of federal courts desegregation order. Constitutional requires equal opportunity and not any result, so disparities in test scores were not sufficient basis for concluding that desegregation had not been complied with.  US v. Fordice (1992) p. 794 desegregation at the university level MI operated 2 black regional colleges, 3 white universities, 2 white regional colleges; & 1 black university. 99% of whites were enrolled in white schools, 71% of black students attended black schools. SC ordered MI to end dual system college education they had responsibility to remedy segregation that resulted from its actions. State constitutional duty to end segregation continues until it eradicates policies and practices traceable to its prior de jure dual system that continues to foster segregation. Keyes v. School District #1 in CO (1973) Absent specific laws, Ps have burden to prove intentional segregative acts affecting substantial part of school system, but once equal protection violation established, burden shifts to school to prove that it did not result in segregation; for de facto discrimination proof of discriminatory intent required discriminatory impact not enough.  Background Schools were not segregated by statute, but still segregated. Ruling Where Ps prove that school auths have carried out a systematic program of segregation affecting a substantial portion of the students, schools, teachers, and facilities w/in the school system, it is only common sense to conclude that there exists a predicate for finding of the existence of a dual school system.  Once it is proved that there were segregative actions affect a significant number of students, an equal protection violation is demonstrated that justifies a systemwide federal court remedy b/c common sense dictates the conclusion that racially inspired school board actions have an impact beyond the particular schools that are the subjects of those actions. Finding of segregation board action creates presumption that other segregated schooling effects is not by chance.  Drew distinction between de jure and de facto discrimination.  When no de jure laws exist, proof of discriminatory purpose is necessary for equal protection violation; discriminatory impact is not enough.  In the North, most segregation was due to residential patterns rather than laws, so this created an obstacle to desegregation.  Powell wrote dissent urging elimination between de jure and de facto discrimination.  Suspect Classification Doctrine What is a racial classification (neutrality, intent, colorblindness, antisubordination, legal definition of race) Framework Analysis What is the Classification? Have to show that it is impermissible on its face facially discriminatory (de jure) Or else show that facially neutral law has discriminatory impact (de facto) and discriminatory purpose.  What is the appropriate level of scrutiny? Race, alienage, and national origin strict scrutiny. Truly compelling govt interest and cannot achieve objectives through less discriminatory alternative now SC has generally ruled that has to be remedial and narrowly tailored in order to survive. Has to be necessary to achieve purpose almost always fails. Govt has burden of proof. Reason for heightened scrutiny govt classification more likely to reflect prejudice rather than permissible govt purpose.  Gender, bastards intermediate scrutiny Has to be substantially related to important govt purpose. Does not have to be compelling interest, but imp. Has to have substantial relationship to end being sought. Govt has burden of proof. Not clear whether less restrictive analysis used or not. B/c of biological differences, there are likely to be instances where gender classification relevant.  Rational basis test Law will be upheld if it is rationally related to legitimate govt purpose. Govts objective need not be compelling or important, but just something that a govt legitimately may do. Means chosen only need be rational way to accomplish goal.  Does the govt action meet the level of scrunity? Evaluation of laws ends and means to determine fit. Degree to which law is underinclusive or overinclusive. Compelling, important, or legitimate purpose depending on standard. Goals of equality Elimination of facial classifications presence or absence of racial classification Elimination of Status hierarchy leading to social stratification (system of super & subordination) based on those traits Work the statute or govt action does in fostering or reproducing unjust social structure Goal of equality law is to combat unjust forms of social stratification forms of group inequality that occur in many different areas of social life and persist over time.  Status hierarchy is sustained by system of social meanings in which one group receives relatively positive associations and another correspondingly negative associations. As a result, their identities are not freestanding identity of one is defined in part by its relationship to the other, and a change of meanings attributed to one will affect not only its own social identify, but the identity of the other group. Many characteristics can serve group immutable or mutable. But immutable characteristic is not enough you have to examine the social and cultural meaning behind the trait to see if it is supporting system of social stratification.  The question is not racial classification, but instead classification within a social hierarchy.  System of subordination would not be stable if it were easy to exit, so that is why it is most likely tied to biological traits which guarantee its stability and reproduction of hierarchy over time.  So-called immutable characteristics have to be buttressed by legal rules (Jim crow anti-miscegenation, hypodescent rules) to define who was black and white. So the hierarchy was preserved through rules of marriage and descent (black illegitimate slave children of the master were defined in terms of their mother, not father).  Law is inherently caught up in the system of racial hierarchy and racial meanings, even when it tries to regulate them.  Antidiscrimination principle Paul Brest General principle disfavoring classifications and other decisions and practices that depend on race of parties. Guards against defects in the process by which race-dependent decisions are made and also against harmful results. Defects in the Process Race-dependent decisions can be ration, in that they are generally supported by statistics, but history shows that most race-dependent decisions are based on assumptions of differential worth of races.  Can come from desire to enhance our own power and esteem by enhacing that of other members of our group. Harmful Results Decisions based on assumptions of intrinsic worth and selective indifference inflict psychological injury stigmatizing victims as inferior. Strauder prevention of blacks serving on jury was implying inferiority Harlan in Plessy segregation of railway cars was brand upon them...assertion of their inferiority. Brown segregation generates feeling of inferior as to their status in the community that may affect their hearts & minds... Generalizations based on immutable characteristics especially frustrating, since based on supposed correlation between inherited characteristic and voluntary behavior of those who possess the characteristic Justifications for treatment of racial classifications as suspect  First degree prejudice - Ely Treating a group worse for the sake of disadvantaging its members, so set of classifications that should be suspect are those which disadvantage groups which are object of widespread vilification.  Second degree prejudice - Ely Generalization whose incidence of counterexample is significantly higher than the legislative authority appears to have thought it was Choice between classifying on the basis of a comparative generalization and attempting to come up with more discriminating formula always involves balancing the increase in fairness that greater individualization will produce against the added costs it will entail.  Discrimination based on immutable characteristics is always wrong b/c burdens should bear some relationship to individual responsibility or wrongdoing. - Brennan in Bakke Immutability is not the key, the historical creation of it as a status hierarchy around skin color that helps to dominate and oppress people makes it wrong Jack Balkin When status distinctions are internalized in a culture, status hierarchies make traits morally relevant. They become signs of positive and negative associations. Permissible proxies for inferences about character, honesty, ability, and judgment. In Pre-Revolutionary America, high birth was associated with other attributes intelligence, honesty, sagacity, etc. A characteristic becomes morally irrelevant when we understand the status hierarchy it is based on to be unjust. Only then is it socially unacceptable to use the trait as a proxy for positive or negative associations. Difference between anti-differentiation (color-blind approach) and anti-subordination (Colker)  Anti-differentiation: Inappropriate to treat individuals differently on basis of particular normative view about race or sex.  Focuses on motivation of individual institution w/o attention to larger societal context in which institution operates.  Focuses on specific effect of alleged discrimination on discrete individuals, rather than on groups.  Argue for a color-blindness approach or sex-blindness, b/c it is equally invidious to treat white men differently from black women as it is to treat black women from the white men.  Anti-subordination: Inappropriate for certain groups to have subordinated status b/c of their lack of power in society as a whole. Seeks to eliminate power disparity between men and women, and whites a non-whites, through the development of laws and policies that directly redress those disparities. Facially differentiating and facially neutral policies are invidious only if they perpetuate racial or sexual hierarchy.  Group-based perspective focuses on societys role in creating subordination and way in which it affects groups of people. More invidious for women to be treated poorly than men b/c of differing histories and contexts of subordination of these groups. Proponents advocate use of race- or sex-specific policies, such as affirmative action, when they redress subordination. But who would make these normative decisions about what will redress subordination and what will flatten out society? Judges, legislature? What kind of evidence would be needed to prove that the process hadnt been unfair? What kind of distinctions arent irrational? Intelligence? Isnt our system based on a (racially motivated) conception of a unitary form of intelligence?  Four Concepts of Race the social and legal construction of race Status-race Traditional notion of race as an indicator of social status; black as inferior and white as superior Deeply connected with anti-subordination approach.  Example: When people argue that the death penalty is unfair b/c it punishes blacks who kill whites more than whites who kill blacks, creating a notion of racial-status.  Formal-race unnconnectedness with social meaning Formal race can be determined through other devices, like a persons ancestry combined w/ legal rule that defines race  Formal race is unconnected with social attributes like cultural, education, or language. Deeply connected with color-blindness.  Example: When courts argue that it is demeaning to assume that blacks think alike b/c of their race or that race is morally irrelevant to govt decision-making.  Historical-race Does assign substance to racial categories the history and continuing racial subordination It is the meaning of race that the Court contemplates when applying strict scrutiny b/c of past history of racially disadvantaging govt conduct.  States use of racial categories is so closely linked to illegitimate racial subordination that it is automatically judicially suspect. Example: When courts argue that racial distinctions are odious b/c they breed interracial hostilities and stigmatize minorities.  Culture-race Identifies Black with African-American culture, community, and consciousness.  Refers broadly to shared beliefs and social practices; both to physical and spiritual senses of the term; refers to Black Nationalist and other traditions of self-awareness and to action based on that self-awareness.  This is used when speaking of cultural diversity; affirmative action programs would use this definition, as well as historical-race in saying that there has been a history of oppression. But the court only allows culture-race diversity in educational experience as the only valid interest in an educational setting.  Example: When courts argue that it is permissible for police officers to consider race in developing drug courier profiles, or when they argue that blackness is a proxy for a distinctive life experience.  Race defined through the negative through others cultural attitudes towards it and through legal rules Socially produced regulatory regime that constructs people as being of a certain race and possessing racial characteristics while purporting merely to represent the world.  The woman who couldnt change what race was represented on her birth certificate b/c of hypodescent rule.  Racial segregation of public spaces produces racially identified spaces that reinforce what it means to be black & white.   Races can be determined by their relation to anti-discrimination law have to frame your identity into rigid categories if you seek legal protection.  But maybe law can only shape social understandings, but not surgically alter them (e.g. pronouncing black as white) Also large disputes about census categories, since some states still stick to the hypodescent rule (LA & VA). This has nothing to do with science, but everything to do with socio-political decisions.  What affect does being multiracial have on affirmative action and remedial discrimination programs? If a mixed-race person (black and white) applied, would they be denied if they listed themselves as multi-racial?  Would it work something like Native Americans, where each tribe makes up their own rules to govern membership? Commentaries on the intent standard of race-dependent or motivate decisionmaking Social Cognitive theory that cognitive structures and processes involved in categorization and information processing can in and of themselves result in stereotyping and other forms of biased intergroup judgment (Krieger) Stereotyping is simply form of categorization cognitive mechanism used to simplify task of processing information. It is essential to normal human functioning.  Stereotypes bias intergroup judgment and decisionmaking they are cognitive, not motivational absent a clear intent Stereotypes operate beyond the realm of decisionmakers self-awareness, often unintentional and unself-conscious. ( Therefore laws that rely on intent to discriminate will inherently fail, since decisions made are often beyond awareness ( The laws themselves can act to reinforce categorization; Title VII makes protected classifications salient (try not to think of a polar bear and it will come to mind every minute)  ( Color-blind approach will always fail b/c it will not eliminate category-based judgment errors  ( P should simply have to prove that group status played a role in causing employers action causation would not longer be equated with intentionality. Cultural meaning of racially disproportionate practices (Lawrence) Reasons that intent is not a factor To guard against guilt, the mind rejects racism from its consciousness Racism is learned through tacit understanding Requiring proof of conscious or intentional motivation disregards both the irrationality of racism and the profound effect of history on the individual and collective consciousness.  ( The cultural meaning of an act is a better trigger than the intent b/c of the collective unconsciousness of racism Actions which have racial meaning w/in the culture are those actions that carry a stigma special concern Eliminate need to find blameworth perpetrator and instead focus on outcome, not intent of decisions If blacks are at the bottom, it must be b/c they are inferior now that racism has been eliminated. Focus on intent has driven most of resistance to affirmative action plans that an intentional act of discrimination must have been performed to remedy it with affirmative action If these definitions of intent are applied, what are the problems? What kind of expert testimony as to cognitive meaning of act should apply? What social and cultural meaning of an act should prevail? Govt violates establishment clause when its action have purpose of effect of promoting one religion over another (OConnor in Wallace)  Sends a message that some are favored insiders and others outsiders.  Is this a test of cultural meaning then?  OConnor qualifies that with a reasonable test that the meaning be reasonable and the P not hypersensitive.  Were the framers of the 14th amendment color-blind? Freedmens Acts and many other pieces of legislation specifically granted benefits to people based on previous condition of servitude. bank established for slaves. Moreno but this was like modern-day remedial action, intended directly to help slaves Freedmens Bureau Act freedmen and refugees Since the 14th amendment binds the states, not the feds, why are feds limited when enacting race-based class? What about the civil/social distinction? Does this mean that Congress can use class. in social legis. like education but not for civil like govt contracts?  Framers chose to speak of privileges and immunities and equal protection rather than colorblindness b/c worried that an open-ended promise of colorblindness would give blacks the vote = was added b/c proponents meant less, not more, than rule of nondisc that was rejected radical alternative.  If the political/civil/social distinction was paramount for framers, why should it not be for modern day originalists? Why should we not permit disc against blacks under 14th as long as its not in civil area? Should we only respect just intentions and not unjust? Isnt that just a benign/malicious determination? Harlans dissent in Plessy made color-blind constitution one of available meanings of 14th amendment If the Court is effectively allowing blacks to remain socially unequal (Croson, Adarand, Feeney, Davis), then isnt the practical result consistent with the framers original intention?  Ways in which originalist interpretation undermines current affirmative action doctrine Framers offered welfare relief to blacks whether or not victims of past disc didnt require proof of past disc. Body that created race-conscious program (Congress) was not govt unit that had previously disc. against recipients Congress didnt make detailed findings of its previous disc acts against blacks (Current Courts rejection of program that remedy general societal disc. is unsupported by original intention. Carolene products (1938) origin of difference between levels of scrutiny Footnote 4 What is famous about this case is footnote 4 There may be a narrower scope for operation of the presumption of constitutionality when legislation appears on its face to be within a specific prohibition of the Constitution, such as those of the first 10 amendments, which are deemed equally specific when held to be embraced with the Fourteenth. Indicates that other types of classification used by legislatures should be subject to stricter scrutiny: Restrictions on the right to vote Restraints upon dissemination of info Interferences with political organizations Prohibition of peaceable assembly Review of discriminatory statutes directed at discrete minority groups will be stricter: Religious groups National groups Racial minorities Relaxation of certain types of judicial review Congress is illustrating the types of due process claims which it will really examine that economic due process infringement claims that hurts certain enumerated classes will be examined. But that legislation that benefited certain industrial groups will not be subjected to the same type of strict judicial review.  Notable b/c doctrine prior had been that economic due process had been the main substance of prior claims the right to earn a living w/o legislative interference.  Development of modern day equal protection doctrine with different levels of protection for different classes whether prejudice against discrete and insular minorities may be a special condition, which tends seriously to curtail the operation of those political processes ordinarily to be relied upon to protect minorities, and which may call for a correspondingly more searching judicial inquiry.  Loving v. Virginia (1967) modern origin of strict scrutiny Background VA statute was to prevent marriages between persons solely on basis of racial classification whether it violates equal protection and due process clauses of 14th amendment. Statute also automatically voided marriages between races w/o judicial proceedings. There were 16 other states which had statutes like this.  Two residents of VA were married in DC and then returned to VA to establish marital abode. SC of VA upheld anti-miscegenation statutes and convictions were sustained. States arguments Preserve racial integrity of citizens, prevent corruption of blood, mongrel breed of citizens, obliteration racial pride. Marriage has traditionally been subject to state regulation w/o federal intervention and regulation should be left to states under 10th amendment. Meaning of 14th amendment only requires that blacks and whites be punished in same degree laws apply equally to both. If Equal protection does not outlaw miscegenation b/c of reliance on racial classifications, then basis would be rational basis review. Scientific evidence is in doubt, so SC should defer to wisdom of state legislature. Originalist framers did not intend to invalidate anti-miscegenation statutes. SCs ruling Mere equal application of a statute containing racial classifications is not enough to remove statute from 14th amendments proscription of all invidious racial discriminations.  14th amendment requires much heavier burden for racial classifications.  Nonoriginalist although historical sources cast some light they are not sufficient to resolve the problem.  Pace v. AL (upholding anti-mixed-race-fornication statute) represents limited view of equal protection which has not withstood analysis in subsequent decisions of the court.  Need to examine whether classifications draw by statute constitute arbitrary and invidious discrimination.  If racial classifications used, they must be shown to be necessary to the accomplishment of some permissible state objective; independent of rthe racial discrimination which it was the object of the 14th amendment to eliminate. Court cannot conceive of any criminal offense for which the test of criminality of conduct was merely color of skin Due Process Also deprive them of due process of law - freedom to marry long recognized as one of vital personal rights essential to pursuit of happiness. Marriage is a basic civil right of man.  Facial Racial Classification cases struck down after Loving MacLaughlin v. FL (1964) SC struck down statute that punished interracial cohabitation more severely than cohabitation of persons of the same sex (racial classifications constitutionally suspect) Anderson v. Martin (1964) Invalidated LA statute requiring ballots in all elections to list race of candidate. By directing citizens attention to the single consideration of race or color, the state indicates that a candidates race or color is an important perhaps paramount consideration in the vote. Vice lies in placing power of state behind racial classification that induces racial prejudice. Tancil v. Wools (1964) SC invalidated VA laws requiring officials to keep voting and property-owner records on racially segregated basis, but sustained divorce decree requiring race listing.  Lee v. Washington (1968) SC affirmed order directing desegregation of AL prison system, but noting that nothing in order precluded allowance for necessities of prison security and discipline.  Prison auths have right to take into account racial tensions in maintaining security.  Hernandez (1954) What is Race for the Purposes of Equal Protection?; Development of community attitudes test for determining separateness of class or race Facts D (convicted murderer) alleged that persons of Mexican descent were systematically excluded from service as jury commissioners and that exclusion deprived him of equal protection of laws.  Holding Was prima facie evidence of discrimination in jury pool selection.  Ruling There are not just two races (two-class system) for the purposes of equal protection white and black but there are other groups.  Community prejudices are not static, other differences determine which groups need protection. Methods of demonstrating separateness of class (Justices dont use race to describe being Mexican) Attitude of community residents distinguished between white and Mexican. Participation of Mexicans in business was slight. Mexican children were required to attend a segregated school until recently, and restaurants had signs with no Mexicans served. Toilet at courthouse was marked Hombres Aqui, separate from colored and unmarked. Population of county v. population of people serving on juries: 14% was Mexican, but for last 25 years noone of Mexican descent has served on a jury.  Prima facie case demonstrated, now state has the burden of proving that it didnt discriminate. Testimony alone that says that they didnt discriminate is not enough mere general assertion of performance of their duty would mean that the constitutional provision is an illusory requirement. Evaluation Is the community attitude provision an example of relying on social recognition or meaning of immutable characteristics?  Is race a question of social belief rather than a biological distinction? Is the determination always a question to be answered in reference to local attitudes?  Does discrimination against an identifiable group sharing certain characteristics then mean it is a race? Defined by negative attitude instead of social or cultural characteristics? A negative rather than positive definition?  Twist on the issuejury selection officer was Mex. Should this be taken into account? Marshall says no, b/c status hierarchies are so pervasive that group members may have absorbed them Do groups graduate out of the status hierarchy? And if they do, when does this happen? Do advancements neutralize the history? Particularly issue when dealing w/distributive remedies How do you fashion them so they come at the cost of the top group and not just the next-to-bottom group? Palmore v. Sidoti (1984) color-blind approach in custody case Facts SC invalidated judgment of FL court assigning custody to father b/c of remarriage of mother to black man.  Counselors conclusion that mother had chosen lifestyle unacceptable to herself and to the childs mother. Inevitable than child will be vulnerable to social stigmatization as a result of parents mixed-race marriage Ruling Strict scrutiny applied, since decision was based on race. Color-blind approach: the effects of racial prejudice and reality of private bias cannot justify racial classification removing child from custody of mother.  Evaluation Only rules that there has to be equality under the law, not social equality.  What about race-matching in adoption?  How does racial preference for adoption facilitate redress of past racial injustice? They could harm children by significantly hindering trans-racial adoption even in cases in which in-race placement is not an option.  They are deeply in conflict with other equal protection law there are so many fewer qualified black families than white families, so that there is a huge number of black children in foster care rather than permanent adoptive homes.  Is family the line that most people draw in terms of integration? Is this the last frontier of racism or is it justified in the name of preserving cultural norms and shared values?  Wasnt Palmore saying that the goal of maintaining racial purity was invalid? What is the difference between adoption and marriage?  Adoption agencies often act in facilitative accommodation in determining what race of child to place w/ the parents Yick Wo v. Hopkins (1886) Facially neutral laws, if administered unequally, are violations; statistical evidence can be used to shift burden to govt Facts Chinese laundry permits not granted to Chinese, court reverses conviction against Chinese for operating laundries w/o permits.  Ruling Thought law is facially neutral, if it is applied and administrated by public auth with unequal hand, violates eq prot Statistical evidence used to demonstrate discrimination w/o de jure discrimination shown - burden then shifts to govt to prove non-discriminatory motivation Ho Ah Kwan v. Nunan (1879) Facially neutral law, if based on race-dependent decision, violates equal protection Background SF ordinance required all men imprisoned to have hair cut or clipped to uniform length of 1 inc. from scalp. P defaulted on fine for housing code violation and was imprisoned and shorn.  Deprivation of queue is regarded as mark of disgrace and from religious faith is mark of misfortune and suffering Ruling Cutting of hair was not maintained as measure of discipline or sanitary regulation.  If it were sanitary regulation, it would have been applied to women as well as men and to people awaiting trial. Decision was race-dependent, race-motivated Evidence that supervisors called it the Queue Ordinance designed to reach Chinese and provoke fear. Only enforced against Chinese people.  Gaston County v. US (1969) transferred de jure discrimination; disparate impact used to determine eq. prot. violation Facts Voting Rights prohibits state or local govt from using literacy test for purpose or with effect of denying or abridging the right to vote on account of race or color. Issue: Whether act permitted country to use literacy test that disproportionately disfranchised blacks.  Holding Non-race based practice may still disproportionately affect disadvantaged minorities as a result of causally linked de jure discrimination Impartial administration of the literacy test would serve only to perpetuate inequalities, since blacks for a long time educated in inferior and segregated schools.  Griggs v. Duke Power (1971) p. 851 Articulates business necessity test for employment criteria and testing; discriminatory intent need not be shown for prima facie case disparate impact may be enough  Holding  Construed Title VII of Civil Rights Act of 1964 to prevent an employer from requiring high school diplomas of applicants and subjecting them to general intelligence test, where effect was to disadvantage black applicants where the criteria had not been demonstrated to impact job performance.  Reasoning Practices that are neutral on their face cant be maintained if they freeze the status quo of prior discriminatory employment practices. What is required by Congress is the removal of artificial, arbitrary, and unnecessary barriers to employment when the barriers operate invidiously to discriminate on the basis of racial or other impermissible classification.  Business necessity: if an employment practice which operates to exclude blacks cant be shown to be related to job performance, practice is prohibited.  Good intent or absence of discriminatory intent does not redeem employment procedures or testing mechanisms that operate as built-in headwinds for minority groups and are unrelated to measuring job capabilities.  Evaluation But what about Title VII specifically making it a requirement for P to show that disc was because of race?  Doesnt this argue against merely showing disparate impact?  Is the Court using a cultural or historical conception of race to prove that it is b/c of race? Looking to how race has been used historically for purposes of subordination rather than a formal conception. But isnt this required for all facially neutral laws? To look at what the actual impact of them is in the context of social status and hierarchy, as well as historical and cultural meaning?  But what about the fact that legislative history provides no support for claim that disparate impact can alone support an employment discrimination claim?  Washington v. Davis (1976) p. 851 Disparate impact cant be sole touchstone; Title VII rigid standard of business necessity (burden shifting to D after disparate impact shown) not adopted for purposes of 5th or 14th amendment employment disc. cases Facts Respondents were blacks whose application for police officers in DC had been rejected b/c they had failed written personnel test (Test 21), used widely by Civil Service Commission. Tried to invalidate the suit on the grounds that it was violation of 5th amendment (Title VII not applied yet to municipal employees) Court of Appeals invalidated test on ground that it disproportionately excluded minorities and that D had not proved it was related to job performance incorporated 5th & 14th amendments into SCs interp of Title VII in Griggs.  Ruling Cases have not embraced idea that law or other official act, w/o regard to whether it reflects a racially discriminatory purpose, is unconstitutional solely b/c of disproportionate impact.  Strauder if pattern of discrimination in jury selection, then not ok; but if one particular jury doesnt have minorities, then ok.  School desegregation invidious quality of facially neutral law must ultimately be traced to racially discriminatory purpose or race-dependent decision.  Difference between de jure and de facto intent or purpose to discriminate.  Disparate impact is not the sole touchstone for the determination.  Facially neutral Statutes that can be shown to operate or be applied in an invidious manner arent ok. Akins v. Texas: Prima facie case provide by absence of blacks on particular jury combined w/ failure of jury commissioners to be informed of eligible black jurors in community with racially neutral selection procedures. Must be inferred from totality of relevant facts, including disparate impact.  Substantially disproportionate racial impact of statute suffices to prove racial discrimination absent some other justification - but those cases didnt rest on only disproportionate impact.  Test 21 has related impact on job performance Govt can seek to improve communications skills (relevant to police) Title VII: Can be establish that tests are related to job performance by ascertaining minimum skill, ability, or potential necessary for applicant. Establishes more rigorous standard for proving no racial impact.  Court is not adopteing more rigorous standard for purposes of 5th and 14th amendment cases.  What if they had linked failure of blacks to history of past de jure practices (as in Griggs)?  Feeney (1954) p. 856 Foreseeable discriminatory impact was not enough to prove discriminatory intent; govt can act w/o regard to possible impact Facts Sex discrimination suit against MA statute that provided civil service preference for veterans which would exclude women.  P argued that legislature could have easily foreseen the effect of statute. Ruling Discriminatory purpose implied more than intent as volition or intent as awareness of consequences. It implies that decisionmaker, selected or reaffirmed a particular course of action at least in part because of not merely in spite of its adverse effects upon identifiable group.  What is the meaning of intent under the law? Intentional tort intention to perform the act that violates the legally protected interest. Tort law often assumes that tortfeasors intend foreseeable consequences of actions person firing bullet at close range intends it to hit someone. MPC intent: purposeful, knowing, reckless, negligent, strict liability. Wouldnt this fall under knowingly rather than purposefully?  Why wouldnt acting with full knowledge of the consequences to a disadvantaged group be sufficient? Shouldnt knowledge of consequences at least be sufficient to raise a rebuttable presumption?  Feeney as limiting reach of 14th amendments equality norm Brown and Loving demonstrated the Court had repudiated distinction between civil and social rights, so no longer basis for defending constitutionality of overtly race-based regulation.  Collapse of civil/social distinction led to de jure/de facto conflict and the need to prove a discriminatory purpose became the new touchstone.  Means that most race-dependent govt decision-making will elude equal protection scrutiny.  Doctrines of heightened scrutiny w/o relation to social meaning/disparate impact of measures acting as check on affirmative action Doctrines of heightened scrutiny do not apply to racial neutral laws, like sentencing guidelines, education and zoning laws, spousal assault and child support; who incidence falls primarily on minorities or women.  Court assumes that these policies were enacted in good faith, even against centuries of past discrimination and unequal impact. Affirmative action cannot rectify societal discrimination or promote proportional representation or social engineering. Equal protection framework identifies race- and gender-conscious remedies as pernicious discrimination, while deflecting attention from the many ways that state continues to regulate social status of minorities and women social position of minorities and women appears to be legacy of past discrimination (or private choice), while states role disappears. It does not address myriad forms of state action that reinforce social stratification that affirmative action addresses.  What about a regulatory necessity law where govt would be required to show necessity in the face of laws that would have disparate impact? Like Title VII for regulation? Govts would have to openly confront racial impacts of decisions, rather than allowing courts to defer to judgments as ordinary social and economic regulation.  Govts prepare environmental impact statements, why not racial impact statements?  Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan House (1977) p. 867; Judicial Review of Covert Race-Dependent Decisions: Inquiry into Motivation; Factors to consider Facts Court considered challenge to citys refusal to rezone 15-acre parcel from single-family to multiple-family housing. MHDC planned to build 190 townhouses for low and moderate-income tenants.  Holding Disparate impact on minorities was not enough to show discriminatory intent.  Reasoning Mere discriminatory effect was not sufficient; P had to show that intent to discriminate was a motivating factor, even if not sole, dominant, or primary factor.  Factors to consider: Impact of official action, including whether a clear pattern, unexplainable on grounds other than race, emerges from effect of state action when law is facially neutral Historical background of decision...particularly if it reveals series of official actions taken for invidious purposes Specific sequence of events leading up to challenged decision Departures from the normal procedural sequences Substantive departures where the factors usually considered important by the decisionmaker strongly favor a decision contrary to the one reached Legislative or administrative history...esp. where there are contemporary statements by members of decisionmaking body Hunter v. Underwood (1985) p. 868; But for motivation Facts AL constitution disenfranchised people convicted of enumerated felonies, including any crime involving moral turpitude One black and one white appellee were disenfranchised after passing bad checks. Lower court found that Although provision was neutral on its face, had racially discriminatory impact on blacks.  Holding Once racial discrimination is shown to have been a substantial or motivating factor behind enactment of law, burden shifts to govt to demonstrate that law would have been enacted without this factor. Racial animus was motivating factor for the provision and [it would not have been adopted...in absence of the racially discriminatory motivation.  Additional purpose to discriminate against poor whites would not render nugatory ther purpose to discriminate against blacks...the latter was a but-for motivation for the enactment.  Palmer v. Thompson (1971) p. 869; disallows disc. Intent to prove eq. prot. viol.  Facts City of Jackson MS closed swimming pools b/c it said that they would be economically infeasible on integrated basis. Reasoning Black in no case in this Court has held that a legislative act may violate equal protection solely b/c of the motivations of the men who voted for it.  Extremely difficult to ascertain motivation or collective intent of legislative actions impossible for court to determine sole or dominant motivation behind legislative choices.  Judiciary should not invalidate law solely b/c of bad intent, since it would presumably be ok if legis. repassed with good intent.  Evaluation Is Palmer overruled by Washington and Arlington Heights?  Isnt the question of intent more like specific intent to harm a minority group? Hernandez v. NY (1991) p. 881; disc. Impact not enough, has to be intent Facts Spanish-speaking bilingual jurors were excluded from jury selection b/c prosecutor said that they wouldnt rely on official translation. Holding Unless a govt actor adopted a criterion with the intent of causing the impact asserted, that impact itself does not violate principle of race neutrality. Determination of motivation was a question of fact, and the trial judges conclusion was entitled to deference.  Does allow that speaking a given language can be proxy for race dependent decision in certain circumstances. Dissent: Explanation of race-neutrality on its face is unacceptable if it is proxy for discriminatory practice. Prosecutor could just have easily accommodated his concern thfu other less drastic means.  Brown v. City of Oneota (1999) Supp 135; racial profiling Facts Woman was attacked by knife-wielding man who broke into her apartment and attacked her.  She said he was black and young, and police traced his trail to SUCO, where very few blacks. Police conducted a sweep in which they stopped all non-white individuals and inspected their hands for cuts.  Court of appeals argued that it was not impermissible racial profiling and that it was based on suspect description. Not just race, but also age, gender, and possible cuts on hand.  Ruling Suspect description originated with private party and not the state.  Only extends to govt action that has disparate impact w/ discriminatory intent. Were the situation reversed with a largely black town and a white perpetrator, the police would have done the same thing.  Why would this matter, given that the state was the one conducting the sweep? Description was not solely based on race Croson and Adarand were struck down even though race was only one factor in decision-making.  Why should govt actors be subjected to higher level of scrutiny in affirmative action than in police raids? Affirmative action too considers many factors, of which race is only one.  Differences between regular Racial profiling and 9-11 racial profiling Offenses and harms that racial profiling might be used for are much more serious and pose a greater threat to the country.  Post 9/11 race profiling is based on alienage, dangerous foreign other.  Doesnt it just rob them of their Americanness the same as it does to blacks and Latinos? Racial profiling of Arab men is different b/c it presents two different situations constitutionally based on country of origin as well as race. But this is unconstitutional violation of equal protection as well... Castaneda v. Partida (1977) p. 916; governing majority theory cant defeat prima facie case of disc.  Facts D in criminal prosecution claimed that Mexicans were systematically excluded from juries. District court said that prima facie case was rebutted by fact that Mexican Americans constituted governing majority and that Mexicans held spots in govt and 3 out of 5 jury commissioners were Mexican.  Ruling Unwise to presume as a matter of law that human beings of one definable group will not discriminate against other members of their group --> doesnt this blow the theory in Bakke out of the water? Maybe whites will enact discriminatory legislation against themselves.  Relevance of governing majority to jury selection process is questionable.  Affirmative Action in employment and government contracts United Steelworkers v. Weber (1979) p. 921 Title VII enacted pursuant to commerce power, so doesnt incorporate 14th or 5th amendments; reverse disc ok in private temporary plan voluntarily agreed upon by union and employer to eliminate manifest racial imbalance Holding Upheld a private employers voluntary affirmative action plan under Title VII, without addressing any constitutional issues. Facts White employee challenged a plan- collectively bargained by the union and Kaiser Aluminum, that reserved 50% of opening in an in-plant craft training program for blacks until the % of black craft workers in plant was commensurate with % of blacks in local labor force. Reasoning Brennan since Kaiser plan doesnt involve state action, this case doesnt present an alleged violation of Equal Protection Clause. In contrast to Title VI, which the majority in Bakke held to be coextensive with Equal Protection, Title VII was enacted pursuant to commerce power to regulate purely private decisionmaking and wasnt intended to incorporate and particularize the commands of 5th and 14th amendments.  Since the plan was adopted voluntarily, we arent concerned w/ what Title VII requires or w/ what a court might order to remedy a past proven violation of the Act. Only question before us is narrow statutory issue of whether Title VII forbids private employers and unions from voluntarily agreeing upon bona fide affirmative action plans that accord racial preferences.  Purposes of plan mirror those of statute. Both were designed to break patterns of racial segregation and hierarchy and open employment opportunities for blacks in occupations formerly closed to them. Plan doesnt unnecessarily trammel interests of whites doesnt requires their discharge or replacement or absolute bar to advancement half of those trained will be white. Plan is temporary, not intended to maintain racial balance, but simply to eliminate imbalance. Rhenquist dissent Title VII was supposed to eliminate racial discrimination in employment not even preferential treatment is permissible.  Johnson v. Transportation Agency (1987) p.921 Title VII only requires showing of manifest imbalance rather than strict eq. protection standard of firm basis in evidence Holding Court upholds voluntary affirmative action program benefiting women. Reasoning Title VII requires only showing of manifest imbalance between percentage of minorities employed and percentage of minorities in population, rather than stricter equal protection standard of a firm basis in the evidence. Fullilove v. Klutznick (1980) p. 921 MBE program upheld; No majority; Burger Congress d/nt have to be color blind in remedial programs; Powell - Congress has special competence in fact-finding, no need to limit facts to just this law can use whole history, Congress doesnt have to choose least intrusive remedy; Marshall use Bakke test; Rhenquist govt always has to be color-blind; Stevens no narrow tailoring Facts Public Works Employment Act of 1977 required that 10% of federal funds granted for local public works projects must be used to procure services or supplies from business owned by minority group members. In passing statute, concern was that past difficulties facing minority contractors were result of past disc.  MBE program awarded contracts to MBEs even if they were not lowest bidders where bids are inflated as result of past disc. Allowed waiver of 10% requirement on swhoing that it couldnt reasonably be met.  Holding Court upheld minority business enterprise of Public Works Employment Act of 1977. No majority opinion Burger Objectives of MBE are within power of Congress under Sec. 5 to enforce by appropriate legislation equal protection guarantees of 14th amendment. Act recites no preambulary findings on subject, but satisfied that Congress had abundant historical basis from which it could conclude that traditional procurement practices, when applied to minority businesses, could perpetuate the effects of prior discrimination.  Congress reasonably determined that prospective elimination of barriers was appropriate to ensure that businesses werent denied equal opportunity to participate in federal grants to state and local govts one aspect of eq. prot. Congress could use racial and ethnic criteria as means to accomplish plainly constitutional objectives limited and remedial nature of program. Courts desegregation cases rejects the contention that in remedial context Congress must act in wholly color-blind fashion (no standard of judicial review articulated) injury to complainant was relative light and when effectuating limited and properly tailored remedy to cure effects of prior discrimination such a sharing of the burden by innocent parties isnt impermissible.  Opinion doesnt adopt analysis in Bakke, but MBE provision would survive judicial scrutiny under either test articulated in several Bakke opinion. Powell Congress competence to make findings of unlawful disc was beyond question and that legislative history demonstrates that Congress reasonably concluded that private and govt disc had contributed to negligible % of public contracts awarded minority contractors. Because govt interest in redressing disc was compelling, this left only question of whether means were necessary. Congress had authority to select reasonable remedies in enforcing Civil War amendments. Courts must be sensitive to possibility that less intrusive means might serve compelling state interests equally as well...Congress choice of remedy should be upheld, however, if the means selected are equitable and reasonably necessary to redress of identifiable discrimination.  Congress acquires information and expertise in consideration and enactment of earlier legislation. After Congress has legislated repeatedly in area of national concern, its Members gain experience that may reduce need for fresh hearings or prolonged debate when Congress again considers action in area.  Petitioners contention that Court should treat debates as complete record of decisionmaking would force Congress to make specific factual findings wrt each legislation action. Such a requirement would mark an unprecedented imposition of adjudicatory procedures upon coordinate branch of govt.  Not confined to legislative history for this law alone can look to total contemporary record of congressional action dealing with racial disc.  Marshall, Brennan, Blackmun Concurred based on Bakke proper inquiry is whether racial classifications designed to further remedial purposes serve important govt objects and are substantially related to achievement of those objectives & under this is constit. Stewart, Rhenquist Govt may never act to detriment of person solely b/c that persons race, whether or not person is member of racial minority. Congress has no great authority than court to impose detriments on basis of race and judicial decree that imposes burdens on basis of race can be upheld only where its sole purpose is to eradicate actual effects of past illegal disc. MBE went beyond this b/c it sought to racial balance as a goal in and of itself and may have been enacted to compensate for effects of social, education, and economic disadvantage.  Stevens Not narrowly tailored and raises too many serious questions that Congress failed to answer or address. Risk is that habitual attitudes toward classes of persons, rather than analysis of relevant characteristics of that class, will serve as basis for legis. class. In past, traditional attitudes provided only explanation for disc and now there is danger that awareness of past injustice will lead to automatic acceptance of new class that arent justified by attributes characteristic of class as a whole.  When Congress creates special preference it should ID characteristic justifying special treatment. Only two conceivable bases for differentiating: Victims of unfair treatment in past Less able to compete in future Statute is not remedy for past disc.  Wygant v. Jackson Board of Education (1986); defeats role model theory as state interest b/c no logical stopping point; layoffs not appropriate means to achieve even compelling purpose Facts School system planned to lay off more white teachers w/ seniority instead of black teachers w/ less seniority Powell, Burger, Rehnquist, OConnor Role model theory allows Board to engage in discriminatory hiring and layoff practices long past the point required by legitimate remedial purposes...Moreover, b/c the role model theory does not necessarily bear a relationship to the harm caused by past discriminatory hiring practices, it actually could be used to escape obligation to remedy such practices by justifying the small % of black teachers to black students. Not sufficiently narrowly tailored. Other less intrusive means of accomplishing similar purposes, such as the adoption of hiring goals, are available. Before it embarks on affirmative action program, public employer must have convincing evidence that remedial action is warranted, sufficient evidence ot justify program. Layoff program would never be legally appropriate means of achieving even compelling purpose Burden of preferential layoff schemes imposed on innocent parties is very high For hiring goals, burden is diffused among society generally dont impose same intrusive injury. Denial of future employment opportunity is not as intrusive as loss of existing job. Rights and expectations surrounding seniority make up what is probably most valuable capital asset that the workers owns...layoffs disrupt these settled expectations in a way hiring goals dont White Layoffs are impermissible way to integrate workforce Marshall (dissenting) Looked at history of racial violence at school and districts need to integrate schools, layoffs nec. to preserve int. Stevens Finding of prior disc not necessary to justify affirmative action Role model theory could be allowed school board could conclude that integrated faculty will be able to provide benefits to students that couldnt be provided by whites; inclusion of minority teachers dispels belief of differences Croson v. City of Richmond (1989) p. 927 strict scrutiny applied to racial classifications by local govts; Congress possesses special remedial power than state or local under 14th  Issues Compelling interest and narrow tailoring of the governments program to that compelling interest v. the power of legislature.  When the question of 14th amendment is compelling interest, it should be distinguished from a different question the power of the legislature to act in the anti-discrimination field of remedying private discrimination at all.  Part II of the opinion in Croson is dealing with the question of power.  When youre dealing with a state or local government, you are not dealing with a government with only enumerated power, but rather a plenary power of police power which allows them to enact legislation on a broad range of topics.  There isnt a problem with city legislative authority to enact legislation to combat private discrimination they do have this power under police powers.  The question is whether for 14th amendment purposes, the desire of the city to remedy past discrimination an interest deemed compelling enough to allow the city to use remedies that would otherwise themselves be violations of the 14th amendment.  Congress as a privileged actor broadening of remedial authority that is not broadening of Congress power to enact legislation in the first place. When Congress uses Section 5 powers to enact legislation that looks like it would be violating 14th amendment, how do you decide when they have an interest so compelling that it allows them to try to remedy private discrimination?  You can see Section 5 as atmospheric. Court: whatever power Congress uses to enact Civil Rights legislation, the general message of Section 5 and Reconstruction is that we ought to view Congress as a privileged actor in the area of Civil Rights. If it doesnt mean to overturn the Civil Rights Cases, Congress being privileged should mean that when Congress has the power to enact legislation separate from the 14th amendment, they can fashion remedies that may on its face violate the 14th amendment. How can legislatures make the type of findings that the court requires? A prima facie case is a judicial construct evidence needed to be rebutted.  Stevens legislatures wont be able to enact affirmative action plans that will withstand strict scrutiny they are not in a position to be able to make the required findings.  If you are going to find adjudicative findings necessary for legislatures, then it will always be fatal in fact Comparison required Focuses on the validity of the comparison looks at comparisons that are allowed.  Doesnt take into account that discrimination has impeded minorities from becoming owners of qualified businesses.  As Title VII develops, there is a question about the right baseline cant look at present %. When past discrimination has been found to be great enough, courts can look to other data.  Croson as a separation of powers case Moves ability to fashion remedies from legislatures to courts Ruling Congress has special constitutional powers to enforce 14th amendment, and the power includes the power to define when to adopt preventative rules Katzenbach v. Morgan. Section 1 of 14th amendment is a constraint on state power. There is no way to determine what classifications are benign or remedial and what classifications are in fact motivated by illegitimate notions of racial inferiority or simple racial politics.  Racial classifications have to be restricted to remedial settings to avoid racial inferiority and hostility.  Private discrimination Unfairness: Imposes same burden on white population regardless of past discrimination not linked to personal responsibility or guilt.  Section 5 does not extend to remedy private discrimination, so why are we told that Congress has power to remedy private discrimination. Isnt this ignoring the civil rights cases that are still on the books? Private discrimination is not able to be reached according to the Civil Rights cases.  Congress passed the Civil Rights Acts in 1964 under power of the Commerce Clause, rather than Section 5 of 14th amendment, so how would Congress under Title VI even have power to remedy private discrimination?  14th amendment establishes personal private rights against discrimination . Legislation is defective Cant see if the Richmond legislation will remedy discrimination since it is not linked to a study or identified discrimination. No consideration of other alternatives that would have been race neutral. The 30% quota not tied to any goal except race balancing OConnor sees this as a kind of social engineering  Plessy legislation is powerless to eradicate racial instincts or to abolish distinctions based upon physical differences, and the attempt to do so can only result in accentuating the difficulties of the present situation. Can we just substitute cultural in here for physical and we would get OConnors opinion?  Congress plan had waiver provisions, Richmond didnt.  Need evidence of significant statistical disparity between number of qualified contracts who are minority and number who have been hired by the city.  Wygant need a strong basis that remedial action is needed.  Three important aspects No claim that public interest will be served by preference Judicial system rather than legislature is better able to fashion remedial remedies More constructive to identify characteristics of advantage and disadvantage classes that will justify disparate treatment Metro Broadcasting v. FCC (1990) p. 951 Diversity as Justification for Affirmative Action Facts Minority Owned businesses would be given preferences for new station licenses. The other was a distress-sale policy it allowed broadcasters whose licenses were subject to renewal or revocation hearings to transfer them to minority-owned businesses.  Holding Upheld the FCC minority preference policies. Ruling - Lesson of Fullilove v. Klutznick (1980): Upheld federal statute that created the minority business preferences Brennan:  Race conscious classifications adopted by Congress to address racial and ethnic discrimination are subject to a different standard than such classifications prescribed by state and local govts. Benign race-conscious measures mandated by Congress even if those measures are no remedial in the sense of being designed to compensate victims of past governmental or societal discrimination are constitutionally permissible to the extent that they serve important governmental objectives within the power of Congress and are substantially related to achievement of those objectives. Analogous to affirmative action in schools: Just as a diverse student body contributing to a robust exchange of ideas is a constitutionally permissible goal on which a race-conscious university admissions program may be predicated, the diversity of views and information on the airwaves serves important First Amendment values. FCC policies were substantially related to achievement of broadcast diversity, they were not based on inappropriate stereotyping, and they did not impose impermissible burdens on non-minorities. Govt objective was important. ( Isnt this intermediate scrutiny? OConnor dissent Congresss Sec 5 power allowed it to pass special kinds of remedial legislation.  But the Constitutions guarantee of equal protection binds the Federal Government as it does the States, and no lower level of scrutiny applies to the Federal Govt use of race classifications (cite to Bolling v. Sharpe) FCCs policy embodies cultural notion of race particular viewpoint inheres in certain racial groups, and that a particular applicant, by virtue of race or ethnicity alone, is more valued that other applicants b/c of distinct viewpoint.  Kennedys dissent Compared majoritys opinion to the Courts use of a reasonableness standard in Plessy Although the majority is confident that it can tell when racial discrimination is benign, it offers no explanation of how it will do so.  Demeaning to ascribe way of thinking to minority groups minority views stereotypical thinking stigmatizes disadv class What about the dispreferred groups? Puts blame and stigma on the dispreferred class. Says that majority abandoned strict scrutiny.  Evaluation ( Does this establish intermediate scrutiny for federal govt benign discrimination, as opposed to strict scrutiny for states in Croson? Adarand Constructors v. Pena (1995) strict scrutiny applies to feds as well as state for all race classifications; rejection of benign disc. deference/intermediate scrutiny Facts Small Business Act establishes govt wide goal for participation by small business concerns owned and controlled by minorities not less than 5% of the total value of all prime contract and subcontract awards for each year.  8(a) program is for socially and economically disadvantaged; 8(d) presumes social disadvantage through membership in a minority group. Presumption of disadvantage is rebuttable if third party comes forward with differing evidence DOT awarded construction contract to contractor, who then put out bids for subs.  Contract said that contractor would receive additional compensation if it hired subcontractors certified as small businesses controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals.  Gonzales was certified and Adarand was not, so Gonzales got the job even though Adarand had the low bid and the contractor said that Adarand would have gotten the bid except for the additional payment. Holding Case remanded to be evaluated under strict scrutiny Equal Protection analysis established through Croson ( protect individuals, not groups Skepticism any preference based on race must receive a most searching examination. (strict scrutiny) Consistency of treatment the standard of review under Equal protection clause is not dependent on the race of those burdened or benefited by a particular classification. Congruence Equal protection analysis in the Fifth Amendment area is the same as that under the 14th amendment.  Metro Broadcasting divergence from normal standard of review Intermediate scrutiny meant that Court was no longer looking at reasons for strict scrutiny in race classifications No way of determining what classifications are benign or remedial or what are motivated by illegitimate notions of racial inferiority or racial politics. Purpose of strict scrutiny is to smoke out illegitimate uses of race by assuring that legis. body is pursuing a goal important enough to warrant use of a highly suspect tool.  Also ensures that means chosen fit this compelling goal so closely that there is no possibility that motive was illegit.  Rejected congruence standard, and so undermined the other two (skepticism and consistency)  Holding All racial classifications, whether imposed by state or fed govt, must be analyzed by a reviewing court under strict scrutiny.  Such classifications are only constitutional if they are narrowly tailored measures that further compel govt interests. Overrules inconsistencies in Metro Broadcasting. Overrules Fullilove to the extent that it didnt require strict scrutiny.  Stare decisis overrules past decision Countervailing considerations: engendered reliance; consequences Real question is whether a principle shall prevail over its later misapplication  Scalia govt can never have compelling interest in discriminating on the basis of race No such thing as a creditor or debtor race Constitution focuses upon the individual; in the eyes of the govt we should be one race (Scalia advocates for a completely color-blind approach  Thomas paternalism at war with principle of inherent equality Conflict with Croson How can a power that is essentially derivative. Congress has no special powers to legislate race-conscious remedies. This is in contradiction with what the majority said in Croson.  The affirmative action program in Adarand is very similar to Fullilove and was very narrowly tailored. The reversing of Metro Broadcasting and saying that Congress has no special authority definitely contradicted Croson.  Stevens in Fullilove Good intentions are not enough to sustain supposedly benign racial classification b/c of the stigma imposed those receiving the preference will be perceived as less qualified Will only delay time when race will become irrelevant or insignificant factor Argues for strict scrutiny in Fullilove ( When did Stevens change his mind??? Stevens dissent Consistency assumes that there is no difference between decision by majority to impose special burden on minority and decision by majority to provide benefit to minority notwithstanding incidental burden on some members of majority (Majority should be able to protect themselves through legislative process, so Congress entitled to deference No moral equivalence, since invidious discrimination is engine of oppression, whereas remedial race-based preferences reflect desire to foster equality.  Exclusionary programs are fundamentally different in nature from subsidies People can tell the difference between good and bad intentions Affirmative action is generally understood to be good intention Standard to be applied in invidious discrimination is based on discriminatory intent, not impact. So the Court is already making the distinction in intent  Consistency actually undermined by decision Will mean that govt can more easily employ affirmative action for women or other groups than for blacks Congruence assumes there is no difference between decision by Congress to adopt affirmative action and decision by state or municipality Congress (in Metro) has special institutional competence to enact legislation.  Scalia in Croson specifically refers to powers of Congress under Section 5 as being enhanced. sound distinction between federal and state action based on race rests not only upon the substance of the Civil War amendments, but upon social reality and governmental theory.  Congress represents whole country, while state or local govt decisions may unfairly burden third parties who they dont represent (out-of-state businesses or individuals) Congruence current program more narrowly tailored and fitted than 1977 Program in Fullilove Race is not a necessary factor can be economically disadvantaged too Race if not a sufficient qualification presumptions of social and economic disadvantages can be rebutted. Provides for periodic review of firms such that they will graduate into status where they will no longer need preferences.  Does not create numerical set-aside or require contractors to higher DBEs. Much more extensive debate and deliberations in SBA lots of data to support Congress decision. Should have deference.  Evaluation Rhetoric about affirmative action unfairly burdening whites has disappeared...now they Court talks more about burdens to blacks through stigmatization or failing to treat them as individuals  Thomas has developed his racial paternalism argument...but how is it paternalism when blacks themselves have lobbied for affirmative action?

Is admission to medical school an appropriate way of redistributing wealth? Educational education is enriched by diversity of viewpoints University of CA v. Bakke (1978) p. 899 have to consider each applicant individually; legislative or judicial body can only address remedial disc; diversity only compelling university interest Facts Special admissions program is designed to assure admission of specified number of students from certain minority groups. Had special admissions committee considering minority applications separate from other students. 2.5 GPA cutoff didnt apply to applicants in this pool; prescribed number of 16 special admissions students Bakke was rejected, even though his scores were significantly higher than those in special admissions program.  Equal protection under 14th amendment is individual right, and applies equally to all Requisite of injured group being member of discrete and insular minority was never part of deciding when to apply strict scrutiny strict scrutiny applied to all classifications based on race.  14th amendment was not based on a two-class theory of white/black Minorities and majorities are temporal distinctions and no basis on which to distinguish what groups would merit heightened judicial solicitude and which would not ( This seems to go against the benign discrimination theory Problems of justice with idea of preference Cant distinguish between benign and invidious disc Not clear that a so-called preference is in fact benign -> Nothing in constitution requires individuals to suffer impermissible burdens in order to enhance the societal standing of their ethnic groups Stigma theory Preferential treatment programs only reinforce common stereotypes holding that groups unable to achieve success w/o special protection based on a factor unrelated to individual worth Inequity of placing burdens on individuals who were not directly responsible for the harm Strict scrutiny standard has to remain constant Minority groups change over time ( Constitution is supposed to endure as lasting principle, not change w/ the times Political judgments regarding necessity of classification may be weighed in constitutional balance, but standard of strict scrutiny remains constant.  Differences between current case and other remedial programs No legislative findings of discrimination not done to remedy past disc (but didnt CA delegate some legislative functions to Regents wrt education?) Operation of remedial program is very different has a distinct set-aside that doesnt compare students w/ others Purpose of program doesnt fit reducing historic deficit of minorities  Racial quotas are facially invalid countering effects of societal disc  Has to be legislative findings in order to support countering effects of societal disc. Interest has to be remedial and least effects on others. Mission of school is educational, not making legislative policy increasing # of physicians who will practice in communities underserved  Has not met burden to show that it must prefer minorities in order to promote better health-care to deprived citizens obtaining educational benefits of diverse student body  Diverse student body goal is constitutionally permissible.  Having fixed number of spots is not necessary means towards end.  Race can be a plus factor, but only when reviewed with other diversity factors Have to consider each applicant individually ( fatal flaw is disregard of individual rights Dissent: Title VI prohibits only uses of racial criteria that would violate 14th amendment if applied by state; does not bar preferential treatment of minorities as a remedial means to counter effects of past disc. if action consist. w/ 14th  Racial classifications are not per se invalid under 14th amendment has always allowed for overriding statutory purpose Still strict scrutiny, but not fatal in fact confusing... Intermediate scrutiny is more appropriate in benign or reverse discrimination cases ( doesnt this contradict his strict scrutiny decision? He says must serve important govt purposes and substantially related thats intermediate... No fundamental rights at issue here, so strict scrutiny should not be applied whites are not a suspect class States can adopt race conscious programs where object is to remedy past disparate impact its actions might otherwise have and if there is reason to believe that the disparate impact is itself the product of past discrimination Public bodies which have been found to have engaged in past disc. have to employ remedial means, not just adopt a neutral stance and end unlawful acts Race-conscious remedies have also been employed in absence of judicial findings not a requirement Congress can authorize preferential treatment and such legis. has been authorized even w/o findings of disc.  So states may also adopt remedial programs to overcome substantial minority underrepresentation where there is reason to believe that the evil addressed is a past product of racial disc.  CA has delegated this legislative authority to the school so the school has the right under this reasoning Stigmatization Program doesnt stigmatize or single out any discrete and insular nonminority group.  Use of racial preferences for remedial purposes does not inflict pervasive injury upon individual whites in the sense that wherever they go there is likelihood that they will be treated as second-class citizen.  No evidence that it disc. against minority group does not establish ceiling for minorities, does not stigmatize beneficiaries as inferior. It only compensates applicants who are qualified, but for educational disadvantages which were state-sponsored.  Was not unreasonable in light of objectives Were no practical means by which it could achieve ends in foreseeable future w/o race-conscious means Does not equate being a minority w/ being disadvantaged looks at individuals personal history to determine disadvantage Nothing inherently unconstitutional in quota system Aftermath The construction cases bear on education cases in undermining Powells opinion in Bakke it certainly cant stand as the law of the land after Croson and Adarand. The Court of Appeals in other cases and in Wygant rejected any basis for affirmative action other than remedying past discrimination rejected some of the other interests outlined in Bakke.  How do you figure out what the law is when you have fragmented opinions? This plagues the lower courts in the are of affirmative action.  It was in dispute as to whether Powell in upholding the Harvard plan whether he was engaging in intermediate scrutiny rather than strict scrutiny. If he was engaging in intermediate scrutiny then his opinion cant be good law b/c Croson and ADarand mandate strict scrutiny. If he was engaging in strict scrutiny, then it is consistent with Corson and Adarand by saying that the diversity interest is a valid interest.  In the end the court never decides whether Bakke was ever law in MI, but says that they will accept Powells reasoning. They say that it was good persuasive authority many universities had tailored their admissions policies on this and on Harvards plan.  Hopwood v. Texas (5th Circuit 1996) p. 973 race could not be a factor at all in educ. admissions Facts Involved challenge to UT Law Schools affirmative action program designed to encourage admission of blacks born in US and Mexican-Americans, but no other groups. Index was based on LSAT score and classified candidates as presumptively admitted, presumptively rejected, or middle discretionary zone. Range of Index scores was placed lower for blacks and Mexicans and reevaluated every year to meet aspiration of admitting class of 10% Mexicans and 5% blacks, proportional to % of races graduating from Texas colleges.  White score was 199 or higher for presumptively admitted and 192 for denied, while 189 and 179 for blacks & Mex. Reasoning Violates eq protection and said that goal of obtaining educational benefits that flow from diverse students was not compelling interest = Adarand said that only compelling justification was remedying past discrimination and non-remedial state interests will never justify racial clas.  Metro Broadcasting (diversity rationale) was overruled in Adarand, so this wasnt constit and Powells opinion only had his one vote in Bakke.  Problems with diversity Fosters rather than minimizes use of race treats them as a group rather than individuals It simply achieves student body that looks different race doesnt mean you think differently. Even using race as a plus factor would allow it to be potential factor - cant be enough of a compelling interest to meet steep standard of strict scrutiny.  Remedying past disc as interest No limiting point could then allow broad-based preferences in hiring, govt contracts, licensing, and any other state activity that in some way is affected by educational attainment of applicants.  Can only be implemented by body that has engaged in disc if law school itself had discriminated Could not justify by looking at past disc in primary and secondary schools b/c not enough info to judge & b/c law school accepts out-of-staters who would benefit from program, but who had not been burdened from past disc Grutter v. Bollinger (2003) Supp. 139 Facts The law school had long been committed to racial and ethnic diversity, especially to the inclusion of students from groups that, historically, had been discriminated against.  Rather than imposing quotas, the law school admissions program focused on academic ability and a flexible assessment of applicants' talents, experiences, and potential to contribute to the learning of those around them. It did not define diversity solely in terms of race and ethnicity but considered these as \"plus\" factors affecting diversity. Holding The Court found that the Equal Protection Clause did not prohibit this narrowly tailored use of race in admissions decisions to further the school's compelling interest in obtaining the educational benefits that flow from diversity.  The goal of attaining a \"critical mass\" of underrepresented minority students did not transform the program into a quota.  Because the law school engaged in a highly individualized, holistic review of each applicant, giving serious consideration to all the ways the applicant might contribute to a diverse educational environment, it ensured that all factors that could contribute to diversity were meaningfully considered alongside race. Reasoning Diverse student body is compelling state interest The United States Supreme Court endorses Justice Powell's view in Bakke that student body diversity is a compelling state interest that can justify the use of race in university admissions. The United States Supreme Court long recognized that, given the important purpose of public education and the expansive freedoms of speech and thought associated with the university environment, universities occupy a special niche in our constitutional tradition.  The freedom of a university to make its own judgments as to education includes the selection of its student body. By claiming the right to select those students who will contribute the most to the robust exchange of ideas, a university seeks to achieve a goal that is of paramount importance in the fulfillment of its mission. The Court's conclusion that a law school has a compelling interest in a diverse student body is informed by the view that attaining a diverse student body is at the heart of a law school's proper institutional mission, and that \"good faith\" on the part of a university is \"presumed\" absent a showing to the contrary. Strict scrutiny shall be applied to all racial classifications The Equal Protection Clause provides that no state shall deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws. U.S. Const. amend. 14, 2.  Because the Fourteenth Amendment protects persons, not groups, all governmental action based on race -- a group classification long recognized as in most circumstances irrelevant and therefore prohibited -- should be subjected to detailed judicial inquiry to ensure that the personal right to equal protection of the laws has not been infringed.  We are a free people whose institutions are founded upon the doctrine of equality. It follows from that principle that government may treat people differently because of their race only for the most compelling reasons. The United States Supreme Court has held that all racial classifications imposed by government must be analyzed by a reviewing court under strict scrutiny.  This means that such classifications are constitutional only if they are narrowly tailored to further compelling governmental interests.  Absent searching judicial inquiry into the justification for such race-based measures, the Court has no way to determine what classifications are \"benign\" or \"remedial\" and what classifications are in fact motivated by illegitimate notions of racial inferiority or simple racial politics.  The Court applies strict scrutiny to all racial classifications to \"smoke out\" illegitimate uses of race by assuring that government is pursuing a goal important enough to warrant use of a highly suspect tool. Strict scrutiny is not strict in theory, but fatal in fact.  Although all governmental uses of race are subject to strict scrutiny, not all are invalidated by it. As the United States Supreme Court has explained, whenever the government treats any person unequally because of his or her race, that person has suffered an injury that falls squarely within the language and spirit of the Constitution's guarantee of equal protection.  But that observation says nothing about the ultimate validity of any particular law; that determination is the job of the court applying strict scrutiny. When race-based action is necessary to further a compelling governmental interest, such action does not violate the constitutional guarantee of equal protection so long as the narrow-tailoring requirement is also satisfied. Context matters when reviewing race-based governmental action under the Equal Protection Clause.  In dealing with claims under broad provisions of the Constitution, which derive content by an interpretive process of inclusion and exclusion, it is imperative that generalizations, based on and qualified by the concrete situations that gave rise to them, must not be applied out of context in disregard of variant controlling facts.  According to the United States Supreme Court, strict scrutiny must take \"relevant differences\" into account. Indeed, that is its \"fundamental purpose.\"  Not every decision influenced by race is equally objectionable and strict scrutiny is designed to provide a framework for carefully examining the importance and the sincerity of the reasons advanced by the governmental decisionmaker for the use of race in that particular context. Producing superior class of leaders that mirrors diversity present in society In order to cultivate a set of leaders with legitimacy in the eyes of the citizenry, it is necessary that the path to leadership be visibly open to talented and qualified individuals of every race and ethnicity.  All members of our heterogeneous society must have confidence in the openness and integrity of the educational institutions that provide this training. As the United States Supreme Court has recognized, law schools cannot be effective in isolation from the individuals and institutions with which the law interacts.  Access to legal education (and thus the legal profession) must be inclusive of talented and qualified individuals of every race and ethnicity, so that all members of our heterogeneous society may participate in the educational institutions that provide the training and education necessary to succeed in America. The United States Supreme Court has repeatedly acknowledged the overriding importance of preparing students for work and citizenship, describing education as pivotal to sustaining our political and cultural heritage with a fundamental role in maintaining the fabric of society.  The Court has long recognized that education is the very foundation of good citizenship. For this reason, the diffusion of knowledge and opportunity through public institutions of higher education must be accessible to all individuals regardless of race or ethnicity. Ensuring that public institutions are open and available to all segments of American society, including people of all races and ethnicities, represents a paramount government objective.  And, nowhere is the importance of such openness more acute than in the context of higher education. Effective participation by members of all racial and ethnic groups in the civic life of our nation is essential if the dream of one nation, indivisible, is to be realized. What is the diversity justification for affirmative action as it appears in OConnors opinion in Grutter? Is it the same as Powells and what MI is espousing? Makes for better classroom interaction the intellectual elitist argument OConnor talks a lot about deferring to academic judgments.  OConnor makes sure that there cannot be a viewpoint of minorities there is no minority viewpoint that instead it is experience diversity. Because it is such a racialized society, there is a difference between being white and being black, and that the best atmosphere is to have so many different versions of that life experience.  What would Thomas want diversity to look like? Thomas is rebelling against the aesthetic appeal of having a diverse population.  Race has strong socio-economic correlation members of minority groups are disproportionately poor. Affirmative action is often used without a socio-economic component they are setting some qualified groups and then some level of minimum qualifications. It is quite likely that members of minority groups who are qualified are members who are socio-economically best off, since SAT scores and GPAs correlate greatly with socio-economic status. So schools will be choosing disproportionately members of minority groups who are wealthy. So is this really diverse?  In Gratz, you only get points for being a minority there is nothing associated with socio-economic status.  The reason why they adopted minimum qualifications is that minorities were failing, and their failure was stigmatizing. They also dont want huge gaps between their white and minority candidates race can only be used as a plus factor it cant be the overriding factor.  What kind of diversity are they talking about? Experience Viewpoint OConnor rejects this in saying that it is demeaning to assume that they will all have the same viewpoint.  What is the distinction between the compelling interest requirement and the narrow tailoring requirements? They are talked about as if two separate things, but in many ways the are the same. Narrow tailoring: If it is achieve its objective, but if its not succeeding how can it be narrowly tailored? So this is more about whether it is actually successful... Compelling: Desirability of goal The academic community is entitled to deference when they claim that diversity is a valid goal. Why do they get this? There is a presumption of good faith, but isnt this just the benign/malignant distinction?  When good faith is used, the compelling interest of the university of diversity is considered to be the INTEREST, a purity of reasoning and a really big leap Is she really granting deference to the academic community, or it she relying more on military and corp briefs more the idea of a diverse elite.  The goals that the employers and military are espousing are not valid under Title VII Role model theory was already defeated in Wygant... But if diversity were really a compelling interest, then couldnt the university just relax their admissions standards would this be a better way of achieving it? (Thomas) Obviously elite status is higher goal than diversity...so can diversity really be said to be compelling? Can there be multiple compelling interests?  If there is no good line between benign and malignant discrimination, then why is academic deference of defense in the name of federalism appropriate?  Is OConnor adapting strict scrutiny to a situation with 1st amendment overtones? Protecting diversity of viewpoints... Other justifications Davis Need minorities trained in medicine so they will go back and practice in their communities where they are needed. MI - Diversity is necessary to use elite universities to train a diverse elite for the country minorities in positions of leadership and they will only get there if they are included in elite education.  Powell rejects this interest in favor of the intellectual interest.  OConnor - But why is she so persuaded by briefs by corporations and former military officers that they need to have diverse officer corps and employees? Doesnt this sound like the argument advanced in Bakke that Powell rejected?  Davis is focusing on a narrow community, while in MI they amicus briefs are focusing on a broader objective.  Is Davis objective enforcing segregation in that it assumes that the minorities will go back to their communities, reinforcing segregation they will never need to compete with whites, so the admissions policy is different.  Is a mission to create elites too broad? Then wouldnt this work for any argument the city of Richmond could then say that the elites of this city look like the city itself? What is special about universities that they can say this? If your goal is to have a really prepared workforce for the global community, what would be your goal? Give extra points to international students it would be extra points to Asians and Latin Americans, but not Africans.  What is problematic is OConnors suggestion that universities are entitled to deference in their academic judgments and saying that the universities rationale matches the fortune 500 rationale (the international marketplace) and the military (getting minority officers to lead minority troops a racially representative officer corps). Are there really new diversity justifications or is this just convenience?  The diversity rationale is fundamentally utilitarian it is still basing affirmative action on the needs of whites to be exposed to what minorities say.  Are we really doing this for the sake of minorities we are largely doing it for the benefits of white. Is a school entitled to be disappointed with a minority student who doesnt speak in class more than a white student?  Do you talk about discrimination as part of this picture b/c they are not able to mention the fact that they want to remedy discrimination. Then how can you talk about the whole history of affirmative action in the first place without talking about the fact that you want to remedy discrimination.  However, discrimination is relevant to narrow tailoring b/c there are systematic reasons why minorities cannot get into college.  Societal discrimination is why you cant rely on your normal admissions process. There is an artificiality to all of this.  Gratz v. Bollinger (2003)  Facts The university's undergraduate admissions policy was based on a point system that automatically granted 20 points to applicants from underrepresented minority groups.  This class-action equal protection suit against respondents, a university, a college, and university officials, alleged racial discrimination.  The parties appealed the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan's rulings. The appellate court heard the case en banc on the same day as a parallel case concerning the university's law school admissions program, which it upheld. Although the circuit court had not yet ruled in the instant case, the Supreme Court granted certiorari.  Holding  The Court held as an initial matter that the lead plaintiff had standing, having been denied freshman admission and having the potential to be denied transfer admission.  The Court also found that the policy made race the decisive factor for virtually every minimally qualified underrepresented minority applicant.  As the policy was not narrowly tailored to achieve respondents' asserted compelling interest in diversity, it violated the Equal Protection Clause, Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and 42 U.S.C.S. 1981.  Reasoning Injury in Fact The \"injury in fact\" in an equal protection case is the denial of equal treatment resulting from the imposition of the barrier, not the ultimate inability to obtain the benefit. In the context of a challenge to a contract set-aside program, the \"injury in fact\" is the inability to compete on an equal footing in the bidding process, not the loss of contract. In the face of such a barrier, to establish standing, a party challenging a set-aside program need only demonstrate that it is able and ready to bid on contracts and that a discriminatory policy prevents it from doing so on an equal basis. Strict scrutiny In the context of an equal protection claim, to withstand strict scrutiny analysis, a respondent must demonstrate that the use of a suspect classification in its program employs narrowly tailored measures that further compelling governmental interests. Because racial classifications are simply too pernicious to permit any but the most exact connection between justification and classification, the court's review of whether such requirements have been met must entail \"a most searching examination.\"  Requirements from Bakke Individual consideration Bakke emphasized the importance of considering each particular applicant as an individual, assessing all of the qualities that individual possesses, and in turn, evaluating that individual's ability to contribute to the unique setting of higher education.  The admissions program described, however, did not contemplate that any single characteristic automatically ensured a specific and identifiable contribution to a university's diversity. Instead, under the approach described, each characteristic of a particular applicant was to be considered in assessing the applicant's entire application. Violation of Title VI Discrimination that violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment committed by an institution that accepts federal funds also constitutes a violation of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C.S. 2000d et seq. Likewise, with respect to 42 U.S.C.S. 1981, the provision was meant, by its broad terms, to proscribe discrimination in the making or enforcement of contracts against, or in favor of, any race.  Furthermore, a contract for educational services is a \"contract\" for purposes of 42 U.S.C.S. 1981. Finally, purposeful discrimination that violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment will also violate 42 U.S.C.S. 1981. Evaluation (Undergraduate program failed in narrow tailoring b/c decisionmaking is supposed to be individualized. Right not to be solely evaluated based on race is the right to be evaluated as an individual.  The Court has a preference for discretion-based systems, and the point system meant that there was no discretion. The Court is strongly against quotas, but how is the critical mass allowed in Grutter different than the point system in Gratz? How small of a range of critical mass percentage can there be before theres a quota? Is critical mass a workable concept? Even though the Head of the Law School said that there were no numbers attached to it, there were daily reports of how many minority students had been admitted. Can you put a label or number on critical mass and still be constitutional? Probably not, but w/o paying attention to numbers you cant achieve your compelling interests.  Croson invalidated a strict proportionality argument that fixed a certain %... Do you co-opt the elite and infiltrate or do you keep the intelligentsia in the trenches, fighting for the revolution? Is affirmative action a trickle-down rationale? That members of minorities who are elite will share the wealth or help others? If we are using data to make are assumptions, who is to say that that social science data is correct?  If it is very difficult to get that last 5% parity in the curve, what are the mechanisms underlying that underperformance?  The social science was that which was created for the litigation and similar litigation.  Thomas why doesnt anyone care that there are disproportionately black women at the law school?  Thomas doesnt think that nothing should be done, but that you should help the poor and that you can help the poor in race-neutral ways.  He thinks that the incremental difference that class makes is much larger than race and doesnt cause as much stigmatization or dissension. He doesnt think the work should be done by elites on behalf of elites.  Whatever level of scrutiny applies to a particular group applies to affirmative action as well benign or malignant discrimination are both subject to strict scrutiny. Important factors the court considered  Did law school consider race-neutral means that might be available? SG submitted poorly written brief on % plans that wouldnt apply at all to grad schools But it was important for the school to have said that they considered race-neutral plans and found them to be lacking -> Should they have had to first try the race-neutral plans? Could they have used socio-economic analysis as a criterion instead of race?  But that wouldnt have achieved goals as well, so it wouldnt have been narrowly tailored or furthering compelling interest. What about eliminating the LSAT for a less biased test or no test at all? The LSAT bias argument as made by the interveners was that LSAT scores were not good predictors at all - a phenomenon called stereotype threat having white and minority students taking tests under different conditions whether just taking a test or whether reputation of other minority students is going to represent their minority groups. This argument has not been bought by the courts that to counter this problem you have to use affirmative action. This hasnt been effective b/c law schools could look to other factors. Department of Education could bring a challenge to schools use of these standardized tests Title VI didnt allow private right of action, but allowed Dept to challenge on basis of universitys bad faith use of tests that they know arent accurate predictors. Did the program unduly burden non-beneficiaries? No, b/c there was individual consideration of each applicant. Will hostility engendered by the affirmative action plans be delayed by hostility, racial backlash, stigmatization, and rational underperformance on the part of minorities? Negative effects of affirmative action on its beneficiaries Thomas argument The interveners say that the stigma from living in a racist society is the reason for depressing minority scores. They do not paint a rosy picture of things getting better.  Cognitive processes of racism wired into you do you think racism will be gone after 25 years?  Was there an endpoint where disadvantaged groups would no longer have to be preferred? MI said that they dont think it is permanent: Number of high achieving minorities will grow and law school will enroll critical number Salience of race in society will disappear - Point in society where experience of being a minority doesnt make such a fundamental difference in their lives where it will not be an interest for the school.  Japanese Internment and the Failure of Equal Protection; use of race as sole comparator Historical Background Exclusion from citizenship The Japanese were not treated well they were excluded from citizenship until 1907 and couldnt own property.  1917 legislation in Congress barring citizens from certain countries in Asia from emigrating to the US.  1924 restrictions on basis of national origin, which became pervasive in emigration law. Barred people who would not be eligible for naturalization from emigrating b/c they could not become citizens.  Difference between Issei and Nissei Issei those who emigrated from Japan and were actually themselves immigrants.  The Issei were barred by law from becoming American citizens.  Nisei US born Japanese citizens.  There was dispute about whether Nissei should be allowed to be treated as citizens the 14th amendment had created basic principle of universal birthright citizenship.  But there was controversy about whether it should apply to US born children of people who themselves couldnt be naturalized.  When the Japanese began to succeed economically, problems started in California.  1918 law in CA noone who was not able to be a citizen were allowed to own property.  Upheld in the Supreme Court against the case that discrimination was based on national origin that it was regulation of land in the public interest b/c if people cant become citizens then you cant be sure that they will work their land in the general interest of all.  The thought was that racial characteristics of the Japanese meant that they were clannish and unable to assimilate.  Sansei the next generation.  Dual citizenship China and Japan extends obligations to nationals in the US the dual citizenship that they still have obligations to their old country meant that they couldnt fully embrace their new citizenship.  One of the questions was will you renounce all loyalty to the Emperor was difficult for them since they could not become citizens of the US.  Internment Process and Regulations Pearl Harbor December 7, 1941 puts Japanese leadership under cloud of suspicion.  Executive Order 1066 February 19, 1942 regarding internment 2.75 months past Pearl Harbor could they have set up a better system in this time period?  The Executive Order puts any or all persons to disloyal people excluded residents under control of military gives transportation, food, shelter to them.  General Secretary DeWitt starts issuing public proclamations like the curfew in Kiyboyashi case and goes from curfew to civilian exclusion orders from the Western US and the establishment of relocation and detention centers to allow for a process of exclusion, assembly at designated points within exclusion area. Congress creates a civilian agency called the War Relocation Agency  DeWitt then authorizes it to handle the process of relocation and to handle actual conditions in the relocation camps.  The centers were set up in remote desert areas with poor conditions.  Interment procedures  The time in the relocation center was supposed to be used to separate out the loyal and the disloyal and the loyal were then supposed to be allowed to leave the leave clearance.  But even if you had leave clearance, you still had issues since there were not many communities that wanted Japanese citizens. The Japanese community was excluded from the California, and the govt was not proactive in protecting their property in CA, so there were few places where they could go.  The relocation centers had difficulties placing the Japanese after internment, since they had to find them jobs. FDR refused to make a speech saying that there were loyal Japanese to make it easier for them, but FDR never does.  1944 cases being heard by the Supreme Court.  Frankfurter gave the administration a days advance notice that Endo was going to come down and was going to strike down the internment program.  But the camps continued to operate until 1949, since the Supreme Court was not doing an unequivocal job to denounce racism.  There was still a lot of actual violence against Japanese Americans who tried to resettle elsewhere and many Issei were very afraid of resettling elsewhere. Even after Endo, when the camps are no longer legally authorized to hold people against their will, there were few places where people could go.  Final Resolution DeWitts final report repudiates facts used to support Korematsu and Endo While litigation about internment is proceeding, the earlier version of DeWitts final report is unearthed and it doesnt mention sabotage or espionage, but instead talks about lack of trust in Japanese citizens.   The DOJ goes berserk about this, and revises DeWitts report with military related facts and additional work is done to bring this to bear on original Korematsu and Hibayashi cases which bring coram mobius case used to correct criminal conviction that conviction was based on incorrect facts where the writ is brought after conviction has been met with completed sentence.  So not like habeas, where youre being held on the same writ, but go back to original writ. What they find is that there was an important change in a footnote in the solicitor generals brief in the Korematsu case.  The change is subtle, but it is views vs. information that is in conflict with the departments their views or information. The change causes fury there is in fact a problem with the information contrary to detailed information in the DOJs possession, as well as the views of the DOJ.  DOJ vs. Solicitor Generals The DOJ acted very inconsistently with its duty influenced by the War Department instead of being independent by obscuring information that would have allowed the court to realize that the claims of military necessity were bogus.  The Solicitor Generals office is always in struggle against the rest of the administration in representing the position of the government responsible for most Supreme Court representation of govt for the US.  It has a practice of confessing error if a US Attorney got a conviction that the govt doesnt agree with or through prosecutorial misconduct, then the Solicitor General creates an expectation that it would confess error and make sure that the US is represented by people who take issues of legality seriously. This practice was successful in the inclusion of the footnote in the first place, but not enough to keep it in there in the first place.  But Korematsu has still not been reversed, so what happens the next time there is a military necessity case? It means that any court affirmatively relying on Korematsu is going to provoke a lot of public outcry.  Hirabayashi decided first. Court only reaches question of curfew held that it was allowed to be applied only to Japanese-Americans. Court accepted govts claim of serious risk to natl security and that there was no way of screening to ID individuals. the challenged orders were defense measures for the avowed purpose of safeguarding the military area in question, at a time of threatened air raids and invasion...  distinctions between citizens solely b/c of their ancestry are odious to a free people whose institutions are founded upon the doctrine of equality.  Korematsu Claim of military necessity out of range of courts institutional powers; used race alone as basis for predicting who was a threat (those of other races not interned) Background He was picked up after the internment order walking with his girlfriend and claimed that he was Spanish-Hawaiian rather than Japanese.  He thought he could get away with this b/c he had had plastic surgery trying to change his features to be less Japanese. He was trying to make enough money to get out of CA with his girlfriend voluntary evacuation.  Deals with the exclusion order failure to report to a relocation center.  Ruling War powers v. racial discrimination Viewed as case that starts the principle that legislation which subjects racial distinctions or classifications to heightened scrutiny.  Black tries to classify this as a war powers case rather than a racial discrimination case he tries to frame it as the power of Congress and the military to command in the time of war. He tried to say that it isnt a race case b/c the country is at war with Japan. He expresses deference to the military, who is telling the court that the basis of the order was for espionage and security issues, rather than racial.  He places a lot of emphasis on the fact that this is a temporary measure. The military was saying that they needed more time to determine loyalty and disloyalty. Black says that it was justified b/c they did indeed find disloyal Japanese.  Racial classifications, especially suspect in criminal statutes, have to be subjected to the most strict scrutiny.  Ways in which the Court could have pushed the military on this issue: If the military had not carried out questioning to determine loyalty, it may have been that the real reasons were for discriminatory reasons.  What is the definition of loyalty in terms of the military purpose loyalty should have been specifically to determine whether someone was a risk. Perhaps the questioning should have been targeted towards the military risk rather than just a loyalty question.  Why are German and Italian Americans being treated differently if the case is really not about race.  What is it about race that makes them loyal or disloyal?  Roberts dissent You cannot look at this in terms of individual cases, but rather as a whole massive relocation program. You have to look at it as one big package as a racial classification. He does talk about proportionality... Roberts had participated in investigatory commission to determine why the US was attacked at Pearl Harbor. And one of the findings was that Japanese Americans had contributed to the attack through espionage.  Murphys dissent He takes apart the case point by point  Dual citizenship precedent in international law, and Japan now allows people to relinquish national citizenship.  Militarys interpretations are consistently taking place through a filter of racism. The military may have expertise about detecting sabotage, but the military is not using military expertise in determining basic temperament and character of members of the Japanese race.  Brilliant opinion of taking apart this.  He has no problem saying that it wasnt military necessity, unlike Jackson, that it was racist.  Frankfurter and Jackson (considered the intellectual leaders in the court) Institutional debate about what the role of the court should be - Jackson Doesnt think that its right to question the judgment you cant parse it as aggressively as Murphy parses it and still give the military the necessary deference. If we are going to be deferential to the military, then we cant exercise any independent constitutional judgment at all. Bringing cases like this is simply asking the court to legitimize conduct that they have no business legitimizing.  Treat these military cases as aconstitutional the Court cannot act sufficiently independently to really be exercising constitutional judgment at all.  Military orders are frequently based on inadmissible evidence, classified documents, so in the very nature of things military decisions are not susceptible to intelligent judicial appraisal. What they rely on to make their decisions is so far from what courts usually require. Is he really saying that he doesnt trust the institutional integrity of the court to make a decision? Does he feel that the military is always going to lie and he doesnt want the integrity of the court impinged by having to legitimize their lies?  The courts in general are not capable of intervening in these events this is not judicial review. If his position is that the court cant take any action, then he would have to be upholding the opinion he would say that there was no power for the court to do anything and the result would be that the conviction would stand. But because hes dissenting, hes obviously taking a judicial posture on the case. He is characterizing this as a military order which is violating constitutional norms.  There is a particular aspect of the case in which the court is not prepared to rule, and that is the issue of military necessity.  But there is also the constitutional problem of whether this is racial discrimination, and Jackson says that this is guilt by ancestry racial classification. He is taking this as an absolute constitutional right. Because he is taking this right as an absolute, the fact that the court is not capable of judging military necessity, this is not stopping him from declaring it unconstitutional. The fact that the court cant judge on the govts purpose and its means/ends analysis drops out of the case, and he is still able to say that Korematsus constitutional rights had been violated.  He was afraid of what precedent this would set compromising all sorts of constitutional rights.  Criticism of Congress for opening up the civil criminal courts to prosecution of civilians under military orders. If Congress insists on getting Congress involved, then the courts will have to get involved to question constitutionality of judgments. Is he protecting the entire federal judiciary from judgments which he believes it should not be used.  If habeaus corpus is available, or challenges to suspension of habeas corpus is available, then how would it escape the federal courts? Jackson is saying that the way in which the military relies on evidence is not the kind of reliance on evidence that courts are used to or to what they hold legislatures to. So Jackson is saying that Murphys opinion would work, except that the evidence rules are totally different not taking the military claims or nature of decision-making seriously enough.  In the end, it is the moral and political responsibility that will bring judgment on the actions of Congress.   Frankfurter Shouldnt hesitate to declare govts actions constitutional should not create sphere of govt activity where Supreme Court and constitution cant be applied.  Endo Issue Continued internment past the point at which loyalty has been determined. There is not a case about the constitutionality of internment in the first place... Reasoning Military v. civilian agency doing the decision-making The Court is much more willing to look at Endo b/c Endo is action of a civilian agency, not military necessity or decision-making.  The militarys action was to prevent sabotage and espionage, but once it has passed to a civilian agency, it is capable of judgment. Ends continuing internment Endo comes out striking down the most disturbing element of the internment the continued internment of people who had been deemed through existing processes to be loyal.  Once way to distinguish them was that Korematsu was a constitutional decision on military action, but Endo doesnt do anything to question Korematsu leaves the constitutional order in place, but uses interpretive trickery to say that administrative program that was created that looks for all purposes like a governmental program somehow is the behavior of rogue administrators who are doing this on their own.  But is it a mistake to say that Korematsu is a constitutional question and Endo is not?  Whenever the court interprets constitutional questions, the decision that the court reaches creates atmospherics that go in direction of saying that the constitution has bite in that area.  So when Douglas sidesteps political realities of internment to say that Congress and the executive do not have to be understood to have trounced on rights, the courts is nonetheless in the posture of lecturing Congress about constitutional rights.  Is Endo a counterweight to Korematsu to lessen the troubles of that decision? Or is Endos constitutional lecture which comes on the same day as Korematsu too weak to count as a counterweight?  14th Amendment and Rational Basis Review for Equal Protection (Economic & Non-suspect classifications) Applies to the federal govt Bolling v. Sharpe (1954) segregation of DC public schools; equal protection applies to fed govt through due process clause of 5th amendment Requirements of equal protection are the same whether the challenge is to the federal govt under 5th amendment or the states discrimination may be so unjustifiable as to violative of due process. Carolene products (1938) Issue Whether the Filled Milk Act of Congress which prohibits the shipment in interstate commerce of skimmed milk compounded with any fat or oil other than milk fat...transcends the power of Congress to regulate interstate commerce or infringes the Fifth Amendment. Reasoning Does underinclusiveness the fact that Congress hasnt gone after other industries violate the economic substantive due process in the 5th amendment?  Strength of filled milk legislation The adulteration argument is a little flimsy, but the fraud case could work oleo margarine worked b/c it was sold as the same color as butter and the filled milk was sold as regular milk. But there was already labeling legislation out there that the filled milk would have to have its ingredients listed. Yet Congress noted that despite the labeling, people are still buying, so they obviously couldnt be defrauded. The Depression is still in full swing, and consumers with limited resources are still choosing the cheaper product.  Footnote 4 What is famous about this case is footnote 4 There may be a narrower scope for operation of the presumption of constitutionality when legislation appears on its face to be within a specific prohibition of the Constitution, such as those of the first 10 amendments, which are deemed equally specific when held to be embraced with the Fourteenth. Indicates that other types of classification used by legislatures should be subject to stricter scrutiny: Restrictions on the right to vote Restraints upon dissemination of info Interferences with political organizations Prohibition of peaceable assembly Review of discriminatory statutes directed at discrete minority groups will be stricter: Religious groups National groups Racial minorities Relaxation of certain types of judicial review Congress is illustrating the types of due process claims which it will really examine that economic due process infringement claims that hurts certain enumerated classes will be examined. But that legislation that benefited certain industrial groups will not be subjected to the same type of strict judicial review.  Notable b/c doctrine prior had been that economic due process had been the main substance of prior claims the right to earn a living w/o legislative interference.  Development of modern day equal protection doctrine with different levels of protection for different classes whether prejudice against discrete and insular minorities may be a special condition, which tends seriously to curtail the operation of those political processes ordinarily to be relied upon to protect minorities, and which may call for a correspondingly more searching judicial inquiry.  Railway Express Agency v. New York (1949) Facts NY city regulation providing that no person shall operate an advertising vehicle; nothing shall prevent putting of business notices upon business delivery vehicles if vehicles are engaged in ordinary work of trade. Ostensible purpose was to increase traffic safety, but it meant that Railway Express Agency with lots of delivery vans could not rent space on their trucks, but NY times could.  Reasoning Unequal treatment on the basis of such a distinction is not justified by the aim and purpose of the regulation no greater distraction for Railways trucks than NY Times. But this analysis is superficial, for local authorities may well have concluded that those who advertise their own wares on trucks do not present same traffic problem in view of the nature or extent of advertising which they use...It would take a degree of omniscience which we lack to say that such is not the case. Classification at issue relates to the purpose for which it is made and does nto contain the kind of discrimination against which the Equal Protection Clause affords protection.  Williamson v. Lee Optical (1955) rational basis test very lax; as long as court can conceive of some basis Facts SC upholds OK statute that prohibited optician to fit or duplicate lenses w/o a prescription from an optometrist or an ophthalmologist. Fed court had declared it unconstit since it failed the rational basis test b/c a prescription was unnecessary if a person broke a pair of glasses the optician could measure the power of the lenses and duplicate them w/o prescription. OK law was most likely adopted to protect business for optometrists, but as long as Court can find legitimate purpose, its ok.  Involved challenges under both Due process and Equal Protection clauses  Douglas reasoning Court treats both clauses as affording same degree of protection in cases of ordinary social and economic regulation. Whether Ps claimed that law violated their economic liberties or that the law made arbitrary distinctions, court subjected it to minimum rationality test. OK law may exact a needless, wasteful requirement in many cases. But it is for the legislature, not the courts, to balance the advantages and disadvantages of the new requirement. It is enough that there is an evil at hand for correction, and that it might be thought that the particular legislative measure was a rational way to correct it... Possible legitimate purposes: Legislature might have concluded that the frequency of occasions where a prescription is necessary was sufficient to justify regulation... Eye examinations were so critical, not only for correction of vision but also for detection of latent diseases every change needed an examination Freeing profession from commercialism Law might be illogical, but day is gone when the Court uses the Due Process Clause to strike down state laws regulatory of business and industrial conditions, b/c they may be unwise, improvident, or out of harmony w/ a particular school of thought. City of Cleburne TX v. Cleburne Living Center (1985) p. 1119; rationality review w/ teeth; Marshalls alternate test for review based on sliding scale of constitutional and societal interest at stake Facts House purchased for group home for mentally retarded citizens CLC intended to comply w/ all state regs and applied for special use permit required for construction of hospitals for the insane or feeble-minded, drug addicts, or penal or correctional institutions. City Council denied permit and then CLC filed suit in federal court b/c if groups residents were not mentally retarded, then its use would be permitted under citys zoning ordinance. Claimed that city councils decision was motivated primarily by the fact that residents were mentally retarded. Holding Mental retardation is not a suspect-classification; should be subject to rationality review: Race, alienage, or ethnicity is strict, gender is intermediate, all else is rationality review Past case law MA Retirement Board v. Murgi (1976) Age discrimination subject to rationality review Where individuals in group affected by law have distinguishing characteristics relevant to interests the state has authority to implement...the courts have been very reluctant...to closely scrutinize legis. choices as to whether, how, and to what extent those interests should be pursued. Reasons why Mental retardation is not a suspect-classification; should be subject to rationality review How large and different group is to be cared for is complex and is matter for legis., not judiciary Those who are mentally retarded have a reduced ability to cope and function in world Very different range from those who can live on their own and those who must be constantly cared for (immutable diff.) Distinctive legis. process for mentally retarded demonstrates that they have unique problems but also shows that legis. have been addressing their needs w/o prejudice or antipathy Requiring strict scrutiny may impede legislature from acting Legislative response negates any claim that mentally retarded are politically powerless Rationality review of zoning ordinance No rational basis for believing that home would pose special threat when other uses (nursing homes, private clubs, hotels, hospitals) dont need special permit Fears on behalf of populace are not permissible bases for treating it differently; Palmore private bias may be outside the law, but the law cant directly or indirectly give them effect. Across the street from a high school worries that students would harass residents but denying on basis of vague fears is not permissible Five hundred year flood plain but why would this be different concern than for nursing homes? Size and number but no restriction in other types of living places; congestion why would this be different? ( Denial of permit rests not on rational reason, but on irrational prejudice Dissent Departure from standard rational basis (Marshall) creates a better test for rational basis which varies with constitutional and societal importance of interest Rational basis is different from Williamson v. Lee Optical rational basis The Court never sorts through record to determine if firm factual basis for the reason if you are employing rationality review. In Williamson, as long as the Court could conceive of a rational basis, then it deferred to legislature.  The burden to disprove a rational basis rests with the attacker, not with the govt.  No foundation is built to determine when rational basis with teeth is employed.  Level of scrutiny employed in equal protection cases should vary with constitutional and societal importance of the interest adversely affected and the recognized invidiousness of the basis upon which the particular classification is drawn. Interest of retarded in establishing group homes is substantial deprives them of human freedom and fulfillment Mentally retarded have been subjected to length and tragic history of segregation and discrimination that is grotesque. State laws frequently deemed them unfit for citizenship and segregated them into homes for life. Also were marriage and sterilization laws. They were also prevented from voting.  (Justifies heightened scrutiny Court says effectively that only discrimination available is that which courts can remedy - why are courts deciding who may be benefited or burdened through legislation? What was once a natural and self-evidence ordering later comes to be seen as an artificial and invidious constraint on human potential freedom.  When judicial action has catalyzed legislative change, that change certainly does not eviscerate underlying constit. principle As with women, not all retarded people are alike in their capacities, so this shouldnt be able to be used as a proxy. Heightened scrutiny is justified based on the fact that such classifications, as a factual matter are seldom relevant to legitimate state ends, and therefore are presumed to rest on prejudice and bigotry.  The problem with the abnormal status is that it misperceives the nature of the difference... Cleburnes ordinance sweeps too broadly means doesnt fit ends rests on prejudice. But court only eliminates classification with regard to this particular case, and not others.  Overbroad generalizations are never permissible require more narrowly tailored means Romer v. Evans (1996) p. 1259 Facts 1992, Colorado voters adopted Amendment 2 by statewide referendum. The drive for it came after several municipalities passed ordinances forbidding discrimination based on sexual orientation.  The amendment said that there could be no protected status based on sexual orientation on which to claim minority status, quota preferences, protected status, or claim of discrimination.  Holding Amendment 2 does more than just repeal the county provisions. Gays are put in a solitary class wrt transactions and relations in both private and govt sphere. Amendment withdraws from gays, but no others, specific legal protection from injuries caused by discrimination and forbids reinstatement.  Colorado state and local govts give heightened scrutiny to many additional traits (age, military status, marital status, pregnancy, parenthood, political affiliation, etc.) and reaches many different forms of private disc. than Congress can. Amendment 2 prevents gays from securing protection against injuries that the public-accommodation laws protect everyone else from. It also nullifies specific legal protections for the targeted class in all real estate, insurance, health, welfare, private education, and employment transactions.  Also rescinds the Colorado Executive Order preventing disc in govt hiring Imposes special disability on gays alone forbidden to seek safeguards that others enjoy.  Has no legitimate govt interest stated.  Bare desire to harm a politically unpopular group cannot constitute a legitimate govt interest.  If a law neither burdens a fundamental right nor targets a suspect class, will employ rational basis review. But Amendment 2 has no rational relationship to legitimate state interest.  Amendment 2 defies this category, since it imposes broad and undifferentiated disability on single named group exceptional and invalid form of legis.  Too narrow and too broad identifies persons by a single trait and then denies them protection.  Govt has to remain open to all a law saying that it will be more difficult for people to access the courts for redress is counter our principles.  Sheer breadth is so discontinuous with reasons offered that amendment seems inexplicable as anything but animus towards gays; lacks a rational relationship to legitimate state interests.  So far removed from interests of conserving resources to fight other disc or preserving freedom of association that there is no rational relationship.  Other ways in which decision could have been made Could have decided that for equal protection purposes gay classifications require heightened levels of scrutiny.  Scalia said that you might have well have done this b/c effectively this is what happened.  There are some govt acts that are per se violations of the equal protection clause and that have that status separate and apart from the entire apparatus of levels of scrutiny. There are some absolutes this case is sui generic in the way it raises these per se issues. The state is not permitted to make classifications that make it harder for one group rather than all other groups to accomplish its goals through the political process. The amendment makes it so that any other group seeking antidiscrimination legislation can do it on the local or state political level, but only on gay rights are those means foreclosed b/c you would have to get a state constitutional amendment.  Require certain scrutiny of any of the rules tinkering of the political process that disadvantages certain groups. So you wont ask about the govt interest, you will just prohibit gerrymandering. Scalia any time a state decides to issue legislation on the state level that preempts municipalities, or states decide to constitutionalize an issue, that happens the people who want to organize to change a law no longer have access to the local govts, the state legislature, etc. Scalia says that it just the way politics goes given that this happens all the time, a broad enough consensus means that the people can take this decision out of the hands of the legislature federal constitutional does this through different levels of scrutiny for different classifications.  Palmore v. Sidoti the legislature cannot act out of a naked desire to harm a politically unpopular group.  Animus can never be a valid govt interest. This is a per se violation.  Scalia says that the majority has mistaken a Kulturkampf (culture battle) for a fit of spite the democratic process is a place where people make moral judgments about what the society should be.  The lottery cases legislating morality by keeping them out of interstate commerce. If a group is disfavored out of some moral objection to that group, this is not permissible.  Scalia says that the constituent group has had criminal legislation enacted against them, but not in Colorado. So the people in Colorado are making a moral judgment, not out of animus, but they want the freedom to make their own moral judgments as landlords, employers, etc.  A simple status/conduct distinction some people may be gay but not practicing, so it would be criminalizing a status offense.  Evaluation Is the court simply convinced that prejudice lies behind this, so they are employing rational basis with bite? But why do these particular groups get the benefit of the bite?  But with Romer, how could you determine the collective intent of the voters of CO? Is this really a cultural meaning approach to how this culturally would be interpreted?  Could it be that the voters were in status competition? Of trying to preserve the hierarchy? It is a zero-sum game giving special privileges to some takes it away from others.  Gender and Intermediate Scrutiny Introduction History Women discriminated against under separate spheres argument through common law coverture or marital status rules. Women could not make contracts binding on themselves w/o their husbands consent.  Adkins uses the 19th amendment to invalidate a minimum wage statute binding only on women, but by end of 1920s, courts had limited 19th amendment only to voting.  Adkins was overruled in West Coast hotel, which upheld a differential wage statute for women than men. 14th amendment equal protection heightened scrutiny not applied to gender until 1976 Goesaert v. Cleary (1948) said that only a minimum rationality standard applied to MI law forbidding women from working as bartenders unless their husband or father owned the place.  Court did not look to intent of legislature, but justified MIs restriction through in terms of womens traditional family roles under control of men and morally appropriate behavior Hoyt v. Florida (1961) upheld law which only placed women on jury lists when they requested, saying that women are center of home and family life.  We dont have heightened constitutional scrutiny for gender until 1976 Reed v. Reed strikes down gender classification purporting to be based on rationality.  Under rational basis test, it would have passed since the measure was reasonable insofar as it reduce workload on probate courts by eliminating one class of contestants. They also argued that the classification was reasonable since men are more likely than women to have knowledge of business affairs women not engaged in industry, politics, etc. like men.  Reed purports to only apply minimum rationality standard, but strikes down ID law requiring men to be administrator of estates when both man and woman are equally qualified.  In the same period the ERA is being promoted, but it wasnt ratified the book says that the reason for its failure was Roe v. Wade anti-abortionists realized that if there really was equal protection then abortion would be guaranteed.  Questions To what extent is gender like race or not like race? Does it justify the differences in treatment?  How likely is gender classification likely to get it right? Are the only legitimate distinctions the ones that are biologically based?  What does under-representation mean? Are women the only people who can represent women? Is the court making a shift saying that official measures of Methods of enforcing social hierarchy for women Segregation, but limited to facilities like education Role differentiation through expectations about family life and paternalism/pseudo-chivalry Biology to what extent invocation of biological differences is appropriate and to what extent it disguises or misrepresents social structures that subordinate women to men have to look past traits considered in isolation, and towards the social structures, institutions, sets of social meanings behind them... Is sexism deeper than racism?  Harder to detect and eradicate Less unequivocally regarded as unjust and unjustifiable Sexism should be though to take sex into account in a certain way, in the context of a specific set of institutional arrangements and a specific ideology which together create and maintain a system of unjust institutions and unwarranted beliefs and attitudes.  Social memory of gender relations creates image of a quiet passive consensual shift rather than one of conflict outside of the public realm in private lives this view of gender politics insulates the gender order from political contestation MacKinnon Gender is a system of social hierarchy and inequality the discourse that centers on gender serves to cover disparities of power.  Difference is the velvet glove on the iron fist of determination the problem is not that differences are not valued, the problem is that they are defined by power.  If differences were the problem, gender neutrality would make sense as an approach. Since hierarchy is the problem, it is inadequate to say that you can be gender-blind when trying to rectify it.  The sexuality of one sex is a social stigma, a target, and provocation to violation, the sexuality of the other is socially a source of pleasure, adventure, power (potency), and a focus for deification, entertainment, nurturance, repression the sexuality of each is different, but not equally socially powerful.  Ely - Women, since they are not minorities, have chosen to accept overdrawn stereotype and thus have nothing to correct. If there are laws enacted against them in the future, it will be b/c women have chosen not to protect themselves.  Isnt this true just if women were majority of legislators rather than voters?  If the 19th amendment is predicated on idea that men cannot adequately represent women as voters, why are men better able to represent them as legislators?  Frontiero v. Richardson (1973) p. 989; establishes heightened standard of review for sex classifications; outlines reasons for heightened standard Facts Congress established scheme to attract career personnel through reenlistment by giving dependents comprehensive medical and dental care and increased basic allowance for quarters. Serviceman may claim wife as dependent w/o regard to whether she actually is dependent, but servicewoman may not claim her husband as a dependent unless he is actually dependent on her. Rational basis test Under rational basis test, this would have passed since differential treatment would have lead to considerable savings of administrative expense and manpower (ends) since husbands traditionally arent dependent, while wives are (classification).  Reasons for intermediate scrutiny for sex classifications History of sex discrimination through romantic paternalism notions.  Women still face pervasive sex discrimination. Sex is an immutable characteristic; imposition of special burdens on particular sex violates basic concept of our system that legal burdens should bear some relationship to individual responsibility. Sex frequently bears no relation to ability to perform or contribute (differentiates it from non-suspect classifications Congress has legislated in a sex-sensitive way: Title VII of Civil Rights Act, ERA, etc. (Says that sex is strict scrutiny??? No evidence to show that cost of evaluating dependency status of wives would be more expensive that granting dependency status to all husbands.  Evidence was gathered through affidavits rather than through more thorough hearings process.  Values of equal protection trump administrative ease and efficiency Represents arbitrary legislative choice forbidden by 14th amendment b/c it is dissimilar treatment for similarly situated men and women Powell concurrence Not all sex classifications should be strict scrutiny Reed didnt add sex to list of suspect classifications Craig v. Boren (1976) Court finally agrees to intermediate standard for gender must serve important governmental objectives and must be substantially related to achievement of those objectives.  US v. Virginia (VMI Case) (1996) p. 1025 Facts Female student wanted admission to VMI and was denied. She sued Commonwealth for exclusion of women from VMI.  In the two years prior, VMI had received 347 apps from women. VMI is sole single-sex school among VAs 15 public schools.  VMIs mission is to produce citizen-soldiers, men prepared for leadership in civilian life and military service. Prime place is to character development uses adversative method modeled on English public schools through intense and grueling hazing rituals and physical conditioning the rat-line. A hierarchical system of privileges and responsibilities, the dyke system for assigning mentors, and a stringently enforced honor code against stealing, cheating, or lying. Only about 15% of graduates go into career military service There is very little privacy everyone lives together in barracks and there are no blinds on the windows. Womens admittance Could achieve at least 10% female enrollment (sufficient critical mass to provide good educational env) Some women are capable of all of activities required VMI would become better training program from perspective of armed forces, since it is mixed-gender.  District Courts ruling VMIs unique method of instruction added diversity Single-sex status would be lost and with it some aspects of schools distinctive training method allowances for personal privacy and changes in physical education. Fourth Circuit reversed A policy of diversity which aims to provide an array of educational opportunities, include single-gender institutions, must do more than favor one gender Neither the goal of producing citizen soldiers nor VMIs implementing methodology is inherently unsuitable for women Allowed school to choose three options: admit women, establish parallel institutions, or abandon state support. VMLI was created, but was fundamentally different Was at Mary Baldwin college, an all-women college. Did not employ adversarial method used more of a cooperative method. Mary Baldwin only offered degrees in liberal arts, not engineering and sciences.  Intermediate scrutiny analysis Determine whether justification is exceedingly persuasive burden rests on the state to show this. Justification must be genuine, not hypothesized or invented post hoc b/c of litigation.  State must show that classification based on gender serves important govt objective Discrimination means employed are substantially related to the ends The means are not based on overly broad generalizations about different talents or abilities between men & women.  Analysis of VAs justifications Violates equal protection requirement justification given is discriminatory Benefits of single-sex education; furtherance of diversification of educational opportunities in state Benign justifications offered in defense of categorical exclusions will not be accepted automatically, a tenable justification must describe actual state purposes, not rationalizations.  Has not shown that VMI was established to diversify, by categorical exclusion of women, educational opps in state VAs other public universities had very long and drawn out battles for coeducation, like the University of VA. Single-sex education was traditionally used to preserve male superiority.  Adversative method of training provides educational benefits that cant be made available to women w/o changes Methodology could be used for training women w/ only minor changes Some women are capable of physical training regime Education should be designed around the rule (women do better in cooperative envs) than the exception Courts have to take a hard look at generalizations or tendencies advanced in support of disc.  The question is not whether women should be forced into the method, but about whether constitutionally should have a right to be admitted to the school.  Self-fulfilling prophecy of destruction of VMI through admission of women Same thing happened in coeducational change of all universities and graduate schools they all said the same thing.  Women have successfully entered federal military schools and have not significantly changed the character of the schools Mission of creating citizen-soldiers would be undermined Goal would not be substantially advanced by continuing to exclude women in total disregard of individual merit Has to show that remedial proposal is directly addressed and related to violation VWIL is not a military institute, no adversarial system, dont live together or in barracks, doesnt foster egalitarian ethic. VMI said that the most important part of the experience occurred in the barracks, yet they didnt reproduce that at VWIL. Generalizations about the way women are (more cooperative) no longer justify denying opportunities to women whose talent and capacity place them outside the average description.  Resources allocated are totally different. no equality of opportunities.  Tuan Anh Nguyen v. INS (2001) Supp 199 Facts Federal statute automatically grants American citizenship to child born out of wedlock in foreign country if born to an American mother, but denies citizenship if father was only American parent unless paternity decree is entered before the child turns 18. Nguyen was born in Vietnam to American father and lived with father after age six and became permanent resident. Nguyen was convicted of sexual assault on a minor and INS was going to deport him, so father established paternity and petitioned for him to stay.  Analysis Importance of assuring that biological parent-child relationship exists. Classification on gender is based on significant different in respective relationship to potential citizen at time of birth.  Relationship is verifiable from birth itself fathers and mothers are not similarly situated wrt proof of biological parenthood. Mothers relationship is proved through birth itself so same affirmative steps not necessary.  Law provides three ways for father to establish paternity: legitimation, paternity oath, court order designed to ensure acceptable documentation of paternity. Although DNA testing is readily available, Constitution does not mandate that Congress elect one particular mechanism among many possible methods of establishing paternity, even if other mechanism is better method. Whether means fit ends Use of gender terms takes into account of biological difference in parents and dissimilar situations Ensure potential for developing relationship Mother automatically has opportunity in birth itself Not always certain that father will know of child or that mother will know fathers identity Have to ensure that there is some opportunity of a relationship provide occasion for initial point of contact Scientific proof through DNA testing does nothing by itself to ensure contact between father and child Whether means fit end Required it to happen before 18 chance to start relationship while child is a minor Easily administered scheme to promote different but still substantial interest of ensuring at least an opportunity for a parent-child relationship to develop All it has to do is demonstrate that means are substantially related to ends, not that it will achieve ends in every case Dissent Requirements With heightened scrutiny, burden should be on the state Justification must be exceedingly persuasive Justification must be genuine, not invented for litigation. Overbroad sex-based generalizations are impermissible even when enjoying empirical support Means/End fit must be substantially related ( most important difference between heightened and rational scrutiny Analysis Biological parent-child relationship INS doesnt rely on this interest in their brief  1409(c) imposes no burden of proof on mothers, so in terms of means/ends fit (ensuring relationship exists so illegals dont sneak in) this is a major hole.  Why does limit on amount of time (18 years) do towards proving biological relationship? DNA testing negates this... Mothers relationship to child may be immediately verifiable to those at the birth, but not to the INS, who wasnt there Less discriminatory means available to accomplish same ends require DNA testing from everyone.  Existence of comparable or superior sex-neutral alternatives in prior cases has been powerful reason to reject sex-based classification Ensure relationship Far too attenuated for provision to be upheld Court focuses on opportunity rather than reality where there is an actual relationship, it does all of the work in rendering appropriate a grant of citizenship Cant a relationship develop after the child is over 18 years of age?  Child could also obtain adjudication of paternity absent any affirmative act by the father, or even against his wishes Sex neutral alternatives would replicate and possibly exceed whatever fit there is between existing means/ends Could require some degree of regular contact; although more difficult to monitor, administrative convenience has been rejected as a justification for sex-based classification (Frontiero) Is based on stereotype, not physical difference that mothers are more caring and forge stronger bonds w/ kids Craig v. Boren general classifications that rest on stereotypes violate Equal Protection even when empirical data Stereotypes are not defined to only be insulting, but rather whether they rest on simplistic, outdated assumption that gender could be used as a proxy for other, more germane bases of classification (MS Univ Women v. Hogan)  Decision reflects stereotype about male irresponsibility more than anything... Physical differences dont justify classification mothers may be torn apart from children after birth just as easily as fathers  Selective Incorporation and the 14th amendment Overview What has been selectively incorporated First Amendment: free establishment clause, free exercise clause, protections of speech, press, assembly, petition Fourth Amendment: unreasonable search and seize, warrant for probable cause, exclusionary rule evidence seized in illegal search Fifth amendment: double jeopardy, protection against self-incrimination, just compensation for takings Sixth amendment: speedy and public trial by impartial jury, chance to confront adverse witnesses, compulsory process for witnesses, assistance of counsel for criminal trials Eight amendment: prohibition against excessive bail and cruel and unusual punishment History Post-slaughterhouse and selective incorporation The state does start to use the due process clause to protect economic rights. Eventually a process of selective incorporation through which 14th amendment due process clause is taken to be the basis for incorporating many provisions of the Bill of Rights into 14th amendment due process which can be invoked against the states.  They are good law in the sense that privileges and immunities are treated as an empty clause, but selective incorporation does give teeth back to 14th. Incorporation and Shelley v. Kraemer This period is when incorporation ideas come philosophically to a head the net result is that there are very few aspects of the Bill of Rights that have not been applied to the states (civil juries, grand jury requirements).  This illustrates the power of the 14th amendment in applying what was originally intended as a Bill against the federal govt affirming states rights to then be turned back against the states.  Incorporation arises out of a political period in which particular concerns about free speech and political activity and Southern criminal justice are paramount.  The court was creating opportunities for itself to deal with race and racial segregation after Plessy.  In the 1920s, the Supreme Court had struck done racially discriminatory zoning ordinances even where ordinance had enforced existing zones.   Shelley was still surprising, even though the DOJ was supporting it, b/c of the breadth of the State action theory that was being articulated here.  Zoning ordinances are easy state action, since the state is specifically acting to enact an ordinance. But the state action here is simply the state courts being open for the enforcement of private agreements. There are questions of privity and substantive law that can determine whether contract is enforceable, but the idea that you can go to court to enforce a private contract or private property agreement was always considered not to be public law. Government enforcement is necessary to reinforce the private right to contract, but it was not seen as state action.  Substantive Due Process Economic Substantive Due Process Definition Constitutional Rights concerning the ability to enter into and enforce contracts; to pursue a trade or profession; and to acquire, possess, and convey property Grounds for challenging economic regulation Article I, Sec. 10, Contracts Clause no impairment of obligations of contracts 5th amendment takings clause nor shall private property be taken for public use (now applied to the states after 1897) 5th and 14th amendments neither federal nor state govts can take a persons property (or life or liberty) w/o due process of law. Due process also used to protect freedom to pursue livelihood, freedom of contract, freedom to practice trade or professions. Dormant commerce clause limits ability of states to burden interstate commerce or discriminate against out-of-staters Procedural due process taking of property, life, liberty Equal protection under the laws taking of property 10th amendment Historical Overview Framers Charles Beard claims Wealth was the primary impetus for constitution protect property and wealth.  John Locke people consented to be governed to protect property Lochner era Many state laws declared unconsist state minimum wage and maximum hour statutes through violation of 14th amendment by impermissibly interfering w/ freedom of contract. Contracts clause not often used, protection fo freedom of contracts under due process made contracts clause superfluous. Freedom of contract under due process limited govt ability to impair existing contracts and to regulate content of future contracts; contract clause always confined to former.  Court used federalism to limit ability of Congress to regulate the economy 19th century 1937: Court narrowly defined scope of Congresss powers under commerce clause and found that 10th amendment reserved zone of authority exclusively for states. State laws declared unconstit under due process clause of 14th amendment Congress laws declared unconstit under 10th amendment 1937: Court adopted policy of great deference to govt economic regs Court didnt protect freedom to contract under due process nor limit Congress ability to reg economy based on federalism or narrow definitions of federal power. Property Rights considered natural law Calder v. Bull CT law that set aside probate decision was considered unconstit. Fletcher v. Peck natural law principles used to declare state law unconstit for rescinding vested property rights History Initial rejection of economic substantive due process Murray due process is met so long as govts procedures accord with law Slaughter House rejected economic substantive due process claim  Majority: Miller Due process will never be relevant under no construction of that provision that we have ever seen, or any that we deem admissible, can the restraint imposed by the State of Louisiana upon the exercise of their trade...be held to be a deprivation of property within the meaning of that provision.  Dissent: Field and Bradley in dissent said that due process limited ability of state to adopt arbitrary laws, especially those that interfere w/ property rights. If being able to slaughter anywhere is a kind of property, then an economic due process claim could be made. Right of freeman was right to adopt trade choosing ones calling is a fundamental liberty.  Interpreted liberty and property in due process clause as protecting right to practice trade or profession.  Increasing govt regulation in 1870s  Great pace of industrialization and concentration of economic power in the large corporation created pressure for govt to adopt regulatory laws. Midwesterners and Southern farmers complained of monopolistic rates by railroads, grain elevators, and banks. Factors workers and miners violent strikes against low wages, poor & unsafe working conditions and long hours.  Under pressure of social discontent, govt started in 1870s and 80s regulating railroad and grain operator rates, labor relations... Corporations lawyers were pressing courts to protect rights of property owners.  Laissez-faire belief in unregulated economy: Economic substantive due process dominated as Courts method to protect economic liberties Social Darwinism society would thrive with least govt reg so as not to interfere with allowing Best to advance and propser Govt regs that unduly interfered w/ natural rights of people to own and use property and with basic liberty of freedom to contract Cases post-Slaughterhouse Munn v. Illinois (1877) Supreme Court continues to reject du process challenges to govt economic regs, but Supreme Court indicated in dicta that it would invalidate laws as violating due process if they interfered w/ natural justice Central question would be whether property is affected with a public interest, b/c when one devotes his property to a use in which the public has interest, he in effect, grants public interest in that use and must submit to be controlled by public for common good. For judiciary to determine reasonableness of state reg, but controlling fact is power to reg recourse must be had thru polls.  Police power of state allowed it to regulate conduct of citizens towards one another and manner in which each shall use his property, when such regulation becomes necessary for public good.  Railroad Commission cases (1886)  Upheld state law regulating RR rates, but indicated that due process could be used in future Power to regulate is not a power to destroy. Cannot require RR to carry persons or property w/o reward, neither can it do unjust taking, or w/o due process of law.  Santa Clara County v. Southern Pacific RR (1886) Person in due process clause of 14th amendment can embody corporation  Chicago, Burlington, & Quincy (1897) First incorporation of Bill of Rights to states was 5th amendment takings 1937 current: Court has been very reluctant to use economic substantive due process or safeguard economic liberties in the same way as before.  Why was there so much concern about regulation of labor? Workers themselves wanted to control the hours and pacing of work crafting unions had wanted this for some time.  Prior to the industrial revolution, in the cottage industry, workers themselves controlled output and means of production.  As the shift of power moved to capital, this tension evolved. There was a loss of dignity to workers when this shifted.  The social question (distributive) was the subject on Congressional hearings in 1883. Newspapers were full of Should capital or labor rule and struggle of the classes. The Knights of Labor were formed in 1869 to break the power of capital and shift the power to the productive classes. The only exclusion for laborers to joining the Knights was for lawyers.  There were highly publicized strikes in the late 1800s and membership doubled in 84 and 85.  Problems that labor statutes aimed to solve:  Imperfect information (availability of jobs communication was poor) Unequal bargaining power Monopoly Externalities not being taken into account effects on third parties Collective action problems organizing Workers thought it was their problem to deal with unemployment to ration working hours to allow for more jobs.  If you can control who gets to enter the field within in the community of bakers, they want to take care of everyones welfare.  If you did not have enough jobs, then there would be an army of unemployed who would drive wages down.  Transaction cost problems No time for meetings Cost of organizing Transportation to other jobs Myth about the Lochner period General view is that this era is a legislative dark period with very little social legislation, but this is not true. The progressive era begins in the early 1900s, but the Lochner period is marked by a coalition of worker rights groups with social scientists.  Courts were a throwback, but states were passing lots of legislation for worker rights minimum wages Problems with the Lochner era Doctrines forumulated by Court were undesirable Court was wrong in protecting freedom of contract as fundamental right and that it erred in concluding that govt could only interfere to enhance public health, safety, morals Govt should be able to reg w/ other goals in mind worker safety, consumers, general public. Unequal bargaining power made real freedom of contract illusory Commitment to laissez-faire economics was really just privileging the powerful over the weak ( Court should defer to laws regulating the economy and protecting workers and consumers Decisions were inconsistent Allowed maximum hours laws for women, but not minimum wage Permitted maximum hour laws for coal miners and manufacturing workers, but not bakers Allowed govt price controls for grain elevators, but not gas (Court should articulate and more consistently follow constitutional principles Too much judicial activism Unelected judges were unduly substituting their values for those of popularly elected legislatures to protect rights that were not expressly state in the constitution. (Judiciary should defer to legislature in areas regarding economic regulation Demise of Lochnerism Intellectual Foundations under attack Freedom of contract and property rights were not natural liberties, but instead (legal realist position) reflected political choices using freedom of contract to invalidate state laws was a political choice that favored employers over employees and corporations over consumers. The courts decisions were not restoring the natural order which had been upset by the legislature, b/c there was no natural economic order. (Epstein) If it was political choices political question the court shouldnt intervene.  Court was ready to allow more govt regulation b/c of the Depression 1934 Nebbia upheld NY law setting prices for milk. Court questions broad theory behind basic premises of Lochner that govt could only regulate to achieve a police purpose and Court needed to be aggressive. 1934 Home Building and Blaisdell upheld constit. of MN law preventing foreclosures of mortgages for emergency procedures.  1936 Morehead v. Tipaldo: declare uconstit. Minimum wage for women last economic liberty ruling. End of Lochnerism Justice Roberts switched sides (substantive due process case and scope of Congresss commerce power) in West Coast Hotel. FDR announced his court-packing plan. Signaled end of Lochnerism West Coast Hotel (1937) overruled Adkins and Morehead.  Made it clear that they were abandoning principles of Lochner -exploitation of workers was now a valid reason. Carolene products reaffirmed West Coast Hotel ruling. Established rational basis review for economic regs.  Court approves virtually all regulation post 1937 Not one state or federal economic regulation has been found unconstitutional as infringing liberty of contract as protected by due process of 5th or 14th amendments. Any conceivable purpose is sufficient if the law reasonable attains the end, did not need to be narrowly tailored to reach the end.  Post-Lochner themes (until 1937) Freedom to contract was a right protected by the due process clauses of 14th and 5th amendments The govt could only interfere w/ freedom of contract to serve valid police purpose of protecting public health, safety, or morals The judiciary would carefully scrutinize legislation to ensure that it served a police purpose Lochner (1905) Facts Facts Lochner says that there is a right to contract he was the baker who was convicted for employing a baker more than 60 hours in one week. Lochner says that he is being deprived of his property his right to freedom of contract to contract bakers for any amount of time. Liberty of contract is generally thought of to go both ways freedom of contract for both parties involved.  In some cases it is the regulated group themselves who is bringing suit people who may want to work longer hours. Sometimes the interests of the beneficiary class are split union v. nonunion shops. Once hours are limited, then union shops can effectively use striking as a bargaining tool.  The bakers had convinced the legislature to pass this law and they had their own journal to publicize this issue and state the issue in broader terms.  But the issue was more about power than it was about health issues... Holding Freedom of contract is a basic right protected as liberty and property rights under the due process clause of 14th amendment.  Liberty includes right to enter into all contracts which may be proper, necessary, and essential to carrying out trade or profession. General right to make contract in relation to business is party of liberty of individual protected in 14th amendment State cannot take away liberty even with due process of law.  Govt could interfere w/ freedom of contract only to serve valid public purpose (public safety, health, or morals) If the state is acting outside of what Supreme Court decides is sphere of police power, then it is acting illegally outside of its powers the same way a trustee of a trust is acting outside of its powers if it uses it fiduciary powers to hurt their trustee.  Property and liberty are held on such reasonable conditions as may be imposed by the governing power of the stae in the exercise of those powers.  It was the judicial role to carefully scrutinize legislation interfering with freedom of contract to make sure that it served a police purpose. Is this a fair reasonable, and appropriate exercise of the state, or is it an unreasonable, unnecessary and arbitrary interference with the right of the individual to his personal liberty....to enter in contracts in relation to labor... Many laws purpoting to be police power are really redistributive or to help particular group at the expense of others Other Issues Court allowing in wide scope of scientific data as evidence the Brandeis brief Harlan was drawing on extensive scientific data that was pulled together in an empirical brief that was filed with the Supreme Court that was developed by the bakers and their supporters in anticipation of this problem trying to make the case that the legislature could conclude that long hours of baking was hazardous, since you could regulate the hours of workers in particularly hazardous occupations.  How to characterize a statute as whether it is a labor statute (invalid) or health statute (valid) Characteristics Goals/Ends Effects Methods/Means A reasonable person could conclude that it is a health statute, so Holmes says that there should be deference to the legislature. But then if it is not a health statute, then he says he will not express an opinion on the constitutionality of the statute.  What if it is a labor statute, is it still within the states power to intervene in the freedom to contract for labor? There could be other reasons happiness, social well-being, general welfare of the people, public morals. The state has traditionally regulated in these areas, so labor regulation could be considered to be in this sphere.  What about spreading the wealth creating more positions for bakers by shortening the hours? States traditionally legislated to keep paupers and vagrants out since it was within their realm to provide for the general social welfare supporting the poor The immigration statutes  Legislation to exclude freed slaves from states State Legislation to prevent revolt or insurrection stop the possible underpinnings of revolt in all situations The court is very suspicious of redistributive efforts... Is it just a redistributive issue (class legislation) of spreading the wealth? There was a lot of concern about redistributive pressures being put on minority of creditors by the majority of the population who were indebted to those people. Majoritarian concerns for wealth redistribution were real at that point.  Can you say that there is a broader public interest at stake when it is purely redistributive statute?  Courts answer If there are too many bakers, then those extra bakers Part of liberty of contract and laissez faire economics is that if you leave the market alone, then it will take care of itself.  The market answer is far more likely to come up with the right answer, rather than a pushy majority influencing the legislature.  Is the freedom to contract a fundamental human right, or is it a matter of the states responsibility to ensure optimal social welfare? If there huge inequalities in baseline assets and in bargaining power, then only one has liberty of contract and the other has duress. Then one side should not be able to enjoy the liberty which has the effect of denying the other side liberty.  Regulating freedom of speech (denying it to those powerful minorities who have control over the presses and are interfering with real public debate) to create a robust public debate is the burden placed on the regulators to great? Can we assume that tinkering with these freedoms are going to lead to greater freedom or less freedom?  At what moment do you look at to determine bargaining power the isolated moment when they sit down to bargain, or do you look at previous state intervention to determine the baseline incentives that the state provided for expansion of the railroads, allowing for indentured labor, etc.  If you truly believe in a fundamental right to contract on the terms they choose, then why is it more problematic if it is a labor regulation rather than a health regulation? Leaving it to the market means that the risk will be adequately compensated that people will trade less years of their life for compensation.  If you say that the health isnt the health of the worker itself or his family since he can freely contract for adequate compensation for his health you argue that it is for the health of third parties involved (the people eating the bread). The public as a third party have interests that cant be protected through a system of liberty of contract.  But as long as there is perfect information a signaling system that shows the risks involved in the production process then the market can still work it out.  So with perfect information, the fact that it is a health regulation shouldnt make any difference.  Why is freedom of contract so important to the court? The history of slavery denial of freedom to contract.  It is a kind of nostalgia reaching back to older ideals to define the country in a time of great change and national expansion.  How do we look at this problem take off the New Deal glasses of labor regulation and history.  Adkins v. Childrens Hospital (1923) p. 391 Background Review of a DC statute (counts as a fed statute) for minimum wage law for women, but not men Deals with 5th Amendment due process claim Holding Payment of a minimum wage (relying in part on 19th amendment to say that differences between men and women in their need for legl protection have come now almost, if not quite, to the vanishing point.) Nebbia (1934) establishes due process rational review requirements p. 415 Background Price-setting legislation by the state of New York to uphold the price of milk, which has been dropping. Board established the price of milk. Due process requirements Cannot be unreasonable, arbitrary or capricious Means have to have real relation to the object (ends) Public interest requirement v. laissez faire economic theory Price fixing is allowed as long as it to address something in the public interest. T here is no claim of monopoly here, but there are other claims of market failure at issue here.  Roberts says that affected with the public interest mean no more than an industry, for adequate reason, is subject to control for the public good  Strong signal that Roberts will pay attention to what country needs ruthless competition has led to the problems. This is in direct conflict with laissez faire economics that the market will regulate itself.  Roberts we will allow the state to address ruthless competition as an evil to be addressed by the legislature.  Perry v. United States: Congress abrogating gold standard and responsibility of govt to pay existing contracts in gold (not in casebook) (1935) Holding: Court upholds the Gold Clause Resolution (1933) authorizing devaluation of the dollar and suspension of gold payments in govt and private contracts. Roberts is part of majority.  Were this legislation passed by the states, it would violate the Contract Clause. But the contract clause does not apply to the fed govt on its face, it only applies to the states. What FDR wants to do is substantively constitution. But a majority of the Court is not happy, but is still convinced that the fed govt can claim sovereign immunity.  Can dispose of case prior to merits on sovereign immunity and not reach substantive constitutional issues. Shows how unhappy the court is that they do reach the substantive issues and says that Congress is acting outside of the bounds of its power, but then says that there is sovereign immunity. Shows that Court does not trust Congress as a constitutional actor that they are engaging in overreaching that Court does not like.  Bad way to start off the relationship between FDRs Congress and the Court.  Morehead v. New York ex. rel Tipaldo (1936) strikes down minimum wage statute for women; p. 426 NY statute declaring minimum wage statute for women Court, relying on Adkins, strikes down statute Debate among contemporary scholars as to whether Roberts would have voted to overturn Adkins if the had thought he was being asked to do so.  Cohen, leading FDR legal advisor, drafted NY state law in ways that made it arguably distinguishable from Adkins.  West Coast Hotel v. Parrish (1937) upholds minimum wage law for women Expressly overturns Adkins and Tipaldo Viewed by some as turning point in Courts repudiation of Lochner, particularly Sunstein stressing Courts rejection of view that common law entitlements are proper baseline against which to judge govt regulation West Coast Hotel stresses non-absolute nature of the Contract Clause and that the police power of the state has always been broad.  What is this freedom of contract? The constitution does not speak of freedom of contract. It speaks of liberty and prohibits the deprivation of liberty without due process of law...Regulation which is reasonable in relation to its subject and is adopted in the interests of the community is due process.  The threads that substantive due process is always subject to the power of the state to legislate in the public interest has always been there, but what is shifting is that legislation aimed at a particular group can be understood to be in the general public interest.  There is an additional and compelling consideration which recent economic experience has brought into a strong light. The exploitation of a class of workers who are in an unequal position wrt bargaining power and are thus relatively defenseless against the denial of a living wage is not only detrimental to their health and well being but casts a direct burden for their support upon the community. Court packing plan and West Coast hotel West Coast Hotel Roberts switches his vote and the Court invalidates Adkins. But Roberts had already voted on the case before the court-packing plan was introduced.  The new way to explain this was that the Court was responding to the landslide victory for FDR.  There was debate that FDR should go for an amendment rather than court-packing that would allow Congress to overrule Court by 2/3 majority to model when Congress v. Supreme Court should get to have its way in response to an electoral affirmation of a set of policies with which the Court disagreed.  Carolene products (1938) Issue Whether the Filled Milk Act of Congress of 1923 which prohibits the shipment in interstate commerce of skimmed milk compounded with any fat or oil other than milk fat...transcends the power of Congress to regulate interstate commerce or infringes the Fifth Amendment. Reasoning Does underinclusiveness the fact that Congress hasnt gone after other industries violate the economic substantive due process in the 5th amendment?  Strength of filled milk legislation The adulteration argument is a little flimsy, but the fraud case could work oleo margarine worked b/c it was sold as the same color as butter and the filled milk was sold as regular milk. But there was already labeling legislation out there that the filled milk would have to have its ingredients listed. Yet Congress noted that despite the labeling, people are still buying, so they obviously couldnt be defrauded. The Depression is still in full swing, and consumers with limited resources are still choosing the cheaper product.  Footnote 4 What is famous about this case is footnote 4 There may be a narrower scope for operation of the presumption of constitutionality when legislation appears on its face to be within a specific prohibition of the Constitution, such as those of the first 10 amendments, which are deemd equally specific when held to be embraced with the Fourteenth. Types of legislations to be subjected to a stricter scrutiny that are restricting political processes: Restrictions on the right to vote Restraints upon dissemination of info Interferences with political organizations Prohibition of peaceable assembly Relaxation of certain types of judicial review Congress is illustrating the types of due process claims which it will really examine that economic due process infringement claims that hurts certain enumerated classes will be examined. But that legislation that benefited certain industrial groups will not be subjected to the same type of strict judicial review.  Notable b/c doctrine prior had been that economic due process had been the main substance of prior claims the right to earn a living w/o legislative interference.  Lincoln Federal Labor Union v. Northwestern Iron & Metal (1949) explicit rejection of Allgeyer-Lochner-Adair-Coppage Court sustained a state prohibition on closed shops.  Black  Return to earlier constitutional principles that states have power to legislate what are found to be injurious practices in their internal commercial and business affairs, so long as their laws do not run afoul of some specific federal constitutional provision. Williamson v. Lee Optical (1955) rational basis test very lax; as long as court can conceive of some basis Facts SC upholds OK statute that prohibited optician to fit or duplicate lenses w/o a prescription from an optometrist or an ophthalmologist. Fed court had declared it unconstit since it failed the rational basis test b/c a prescription was unnecessary if a person broke a pair of glasses the optician could measure the power of the lenses and duplicate them w/o prescription. OK law was most likely adopted to protect business for optometrists, but as long as Court can find legitimate purpose, its ok.  Involved challenges under both Due process and Equal Protection clauses  Douglas reasoning Court treats both clauses as affording same degree of protection in cases of ordinary social and economic regulation. Whether Ps claimed that law violated their economic liberties or that the law made arbitrary distinctions, court subjected it to minimum rationality test. OK law may exact a needless, wasteful requirement in many cases. But it is for the legislature, not the courts, to balance the advantages and disadvantages of the new requirement. It is enough that there is an evil at hand for correction, and that it might be thought that the particular legislative measure was a rational way to correct it... Possible legitimate purposes: Legislature might have concluded that the frequency of occasions where a prescription is necessary was sufficient to justify regulation... Eye examinations were so critical, not only for correction of vision but also for detection of latent diseases every change needed an examination Freeing profession from commercialism Law might be illogical, but day is gone when the Court uses the Due Process Clause to strike down state laws regulatory of business and industrial conditions, b/c they may be unwise, improvident, or out of harmony w/ a particular school of thought. Contracts Clause Introduction Article I, Sec. 10 of the constitution provides that no state shall pass any law impairing the obligation of contracts.  Applies only if state or local law interferes with existing contracts does not apply to fed govts; challenges to fed interference have to be brought under due process clause where they will receive deferential rationality review. Contract clause does not limit govt ability to regulate terms of future contracts, applies only if state or local govt is interfering w/ perf of already existing contracts.  History Framers Motivated by desire to prevent states from adopting laws to help debtors at the expense of creditors. Framers were concerned that in times of depression, state legislatures might adopt laws to protect debtors who were unable to pay what was owed.  Meant to stop debtor relief legislation that interfered with contractual rights also to encourage credit by assuring lenders that they would be repaid.  Progressively used less over time First half of 19th century - Used aggressively to invalidate state and local laws that interfered with rights under existing contracts Early 20th century rarely mentioned in court decisions. 1897 1937 (Lochner era) contracts clause made superfluous by Courts protection of freedom of contract under due process clauses of 5th and 14th amendments. Contracts clause more limited b/c it applied only to existing contracts, while due process could be used to invalidate future contracts. Modern 1934 Blaisdell court upheld debtor relief legislation under emergency basis. 1937 Courts deference to govt economic reg has resulted in contracts clause being rarely used. Only twice since 1937 has court found laws to violate contracts clause only if there is a substantial impairment of the contract and only if the law fails to reasonable serve a significant and legitimate public purpose. Govt impairment of govt contracts will receive greater scrutiny than interference w/ private contracts b/c of distrust of govt when it is acting in its own self-interest. Questions How aggressively should the Court protect contract rights? How much should the Court defer to the legislature, even when contractual rights are impaired?  Fletcher v. Peck (1810) SC declared GA statute unconstit. Law revoking contracts that had sold land violated contracts clause and infringed natural law principles.  Even though legis. that enacted first legis. was corrupt, repealing the legis. and destroying vested rights and interfering with contracts (private contracts between later parties who bought the land) couldnt be done. What about legislation done in public good? No good if it invalidates contracts... Sturges v. Saunders (1819) NY bankruptcy law couldnt operate retroactively to discharge debt incurred before law was enacted.  NJ v. Wilson (1813) Declared unconstit. state law that repealed a tax exemption that colonial legis. had granted to land 50 years earlier. Repealing law violated contracts clause.  Dartmouth College v. Woodward difference between prospective and retrospective legislation (1819) Marshall - Legislative grants to the college might have explicitly reserved the right to the state to amend the charter and this application of contracts clause probably wasnt what founders meant. Declared unconstit. NH law that changed charter issued to Dartmouth College made it a private instit. and NH attempted to change this to public instit.  Ogden v. Saunders (1827) Court limited Sturges to retroactive application of bankruptcy laws to preexisting contracts.  Statute in existence at the time the contract is made becomes part of the contract. Marshalls dissent: Govt could not dictate in advance terms of private contracts in order to release obligors in the event of their insolvency. Origin of freedom of contract is natural right intrinsic and prior to govt. Society can only control formalities of contract formation or prhobit specific contracts as violatiosn of public policy. States can also pass law affecting contract remedies.  Thought that the reserve clauses turned obligatory contracts into de facto conditional promises. Applying the clause to only preexisting contracts would render it useless, and he thought this the most important clause.  Reserve clauses for incorporation charters were not contested Incorporation was thought of as a privilege rather than as a grant of property So reserve clauses possibility invalidating grants of incorporation or changing them were not thought to infringe on contracts clauses.  Blaisdell (1934) Strongest indication that framers intent should not be controlling; contracts clause cannot automatically trump state interests Statute at issue Allows MN courts to lengthen times that property owners would have to cure defaults and stave off repos of their houses so long as payment were made to cover the monthly carrying costs.  Many loans at this period had a balloon payment at the end of the mortgage, so many foreclosures happened b/c of this. But doesnt the contract clause conflict with the power of states to do this.  Holding Cannot use contract clause to automatically trump state interests in general public welfare.  What does this suggest about how the court will exercise its power to decide constitutionality in other govt actions? Govt can interfere with existing contracts if it has a valid police purpose, and it describes police power broadly enough to include debtor relief, protecting people from foreclosure of their mortgages Dissent Contracts clause was put in specifically to limit states power to interfere with contracts during times of economic problems.  We have the clearest possible evidence of the meaning of this clause since it emerged out of very distinct economic circumstances and that those circumstances were predicted and were very similar to the ones at issue here.  Ruling Hughes Manages to pull this off by saying that there has always been the notion that while the state cant impair the obligations of contracts merely to benefit some people while hurting others (naked redistributive purposes), it can impair the obligations when doing so is in the general public interest. Precedent - Property rights case in 1922 dealing with landlord tenant law.  Framers view was not an absolute one, but one that had to be balanced with the general public interest.  Rejection of originalism He rejects originalism, and instead says that there has been a growing recognition of public needs that has grown as the country has grown, and we do not have to stick to the social understandings that the framers had, b/c in words of Marshall in McCulloh, this is a constitution were interpreting.  Constitution has to grow with the country, and this has always been the case.  You have to look at the change in times and you cant be bound entirely by what framers were thinking. There is a far greater understanding now of the ways in which private contracts can affect the public interest.  Need to find a balance between public welfare and individual common law rights.  Reasoning established in Blaisdell applicable to later economic rights cases in determining valid legis. purpose Is the occasion proper for the exercise of police power are vital interests of the public at stake? Yes, the emergency is the threat of loss of homes and lands which furnish necessary shelter and means of subsitence. Was the legislation addressed to a legitimate end not for the mere advantage of particular individuals but for the protection of basic interest of society? Was targeted towards protection of society helps mortgagors and mortgagees alike in general, since mortgagors would not benefit by widespread foreclosure, since then they would lose a lot of money through the decline in property values and the inability to sell the property. Is the relief provided of a character appropriate to that emergency so that it does not contravene the constitutional contract provision and 5th amendment due process? Extending grace period is tailored to emergency. Is it granted upon reasonable conditions? Conditions upon which grace period is extended are not unreasonable. Helps both mortgagors and mortgagees Is it temporary in operation and limited to exigency which caused it to arise?  Modern Substantive Due Process Overview Definition/Description/Scope of modern substantive due process doctrine Personal privacy, procreational choice, sexual autonomy, right to choose how to live or die, family integrity, intimate association.  Since Calder v. Bull, there has been constitutional thought that argues constitutional rights can exist outside text or can be implied from basic constitutional order, fundamental narratives of American history an didentitty, common traditions, or deepest meanings of liberty and equality in free and democratic republic.  Implied fundamental rights can be grounded textually among privileges or immunities clause, or liberties in due process of 14th amendment, or in 9th amendment.  Traditions of fundamental rights adjudication General constitutional law Resurgence of judicial protection of individuals rights following WWII, expansion of equal protection doctrine and incorporation of Bill of Rights into 14th amendment Lochner era intervened to protect interests than had significant noneconomic impact (economic and personal interests not considered discrete) Meyer v. Nebraska (1923) Instructor was convicted under state law prohibiting teaching of foreign language to any child not yet in 8th grade. Viewed it as incursion against his right to teacg freedoms under 14th amendment include freedom to engage in common occupations of life, acquire useful knowledge, marry, establish home and bring up children, worship God, enjoy privileges long recognized by common law as essential to orderly pursuit of happiness by free men.  Cant be interfered with under guise of protecting public interest, by legislative action which is arbitrary or w/o reasonable relation to some purpose w/in state competency. Determination by legis. of what is nece. is subject to judicial review.  Pierce v. Society of Sisters (1925) Challenged Oregon statute requiring children to attend public schools Act unreasonably interferes with liberty of parents and guardians to direct upbringing of children Rights guaranteed by constitution may not be abridged by legislation which has no reasonable relation to some purpose. Fundament theory of liberty excludes any general power of state to standardize its children by forcing them to accept instruction from public teachers. Child is not mere creature of the state those who nurture him and direct his destiny have right, coupled with high duty, to recognize and prepare him.  Skinner v. OK (1942) Invalidated OKs habitual criminal sterilization act as violation of eq. protection clause. Legis. involves one of basic civil rights of man marriage and procreation essential to fundamental existence. Power to sterilize can have devastating effects no redemption from it and forever deprived from basic liberty. When law lays an unequal hand on those who have committed intrinsically same quality of offense and sterilizes one and not the other, it has made as invidious a discrimination as if it had selected a particular race or nationality for oppressive treat. No basis for determining that inheritability of embezzlement tendencies is less than for robbery.  Lochner understood as substantive due process case, but was understood to have been killed off in West Coast Hotel. But the legitimacy is immediate framed by the question of substantive due process.  Even if you call it fundamental rights, Lochner looked at due process clause, saw the word liberty, said of course liberty in general is enumerated as protected. But as to what liberty means, what is fundamental about liberty, but certainly liberty of contract is at the core of what liberty means.  Slavery what was least controversial is the right to make contracts and to get rewards from their labor.  Where did Lochner Court go wrong? Was it in identifying freedom of contract as a fundamental right? Or was it the way it which it enforced freedom to contract? There were predecessor cases post-Lochner that there were certain rights in our ordered liberty, certain practices in criminal area, that they so shocked the conscience that they were against our fundamental conceptions of liberty.  The court is still divided as to what to call this...for fear of imposing limits through the naming scheme.  Justifications for the courts role for invalidating legislation in the name of some constitutional right or value not expressly enumerated in the constitution. Protecting majoritarian morality Sometimes there are process failures minorities are too well organized, so there are times when it is appropriate for the court to step in to protect majorities.  Morality can mean social understandings, values embraces more than just a single type of religious principles. The question is not whether conduct is disapproved by conventional morality, but whether conventional morality supports state enforcement of its disapproval through criminal and civil sanctions.  How do you determine conventional morality? Judges becoming sensitive to it, experience it, read, and ruminate, reflect and analyze Social sciences opinion polls Scalia in Stanford v. KT (death penalty for 16 year old) Interpreted 8th amendment in flexible and dynamic manner Look not to our own conceptions of decency, but to those of modern American society as a whole But this doesnt include looking to our societies... But the heavy burden is on petitioners to establish national consensus against law in question the pattern of enacted laws is the most reliable indicator; jury decisions and reluctance to impose it not enough. Protecting traditional/conventional morality This may or may not coalesce with what the current majority supports. It is important that this country remain recognizable for what it is to retain a core of value over time over which human rights and constitutional rights are based on.  Richards What is the constitutionally permissible content of the legal enforcement of morals? Two crucial assumptions: Persons have capacity to be autonomous in living their life Persons are entitled, as persons, to equal concern anf respect in exercising their capacities for living autonomously Elitism it is an appropriate role for the Court to step in to protect or impose what they in their view to consider the best set of moral principles.  The proponents would of course say is that it is a current international consensus about fundamental human rights. Autonomy v. society Leadership of the US in the world democratic moral scene What are you protecting it against? Present-day legislation The dead-hand of the past if part of what is going on in the process to legitimate modern day due process is a type of legitimization of judicial review. Carolene all emerged in anti-Lochner substantive due process. Areas of systematic failure: Legislatures very rarely go through old laws that arent working ones that reflected clear majority or clear minority interests. If statutes are being systematically underenforced, then noone will complain about it and noone will end up in court no good test cases b/c law enforcement not enforcing it. (Bowers v. Hardwick accidental test case) Collective action problems in getting legislation together, so the collective action problem would be greatest in these areas.  Endowment effect what exists is sticky harder to get people to change what they already have b/c of a sense of entitlement.  Lots of substantive due process cases are dead hand cases (anti-contraception, anti-sodomy, Gerald irrebutable presumption that when child is born into marriage, that husband is father of child even though paternity is easily proved).  Majority that passed that law is a dead majority; but majority is no better served by having those old laws exist than they are by judge-made law.  If all that is going on is concern about dead-hand, then isnt this way too powerful a weapon? Some other courts deal with this creatively.  Some constitutional systems are set up to have a system in which old unconstitutional legislation can be remanded to the legislation for reenactment. MA court gives the legislature a chance to try to come up with it a kind of partnership.  Griswold v. CT (1965) Facts Appellant was director of planned parenthood in CT and were arrested based on statute which prevented distribution of contraception. Reasoning Rejects Lochner reasoning the Court doesnt want to sit as super-legis. to determine wisdom, need and propriety of laws that touch economic problems, business affairs, or social conditions.  Specific guarantees in Bill of Rights have penumbras, formed by emanations from those guarantees that help give them life and substance First amendment doesnt include explicit reference to freedom of association, right to go to school where you choose, or right to learn foreign language, but those have all be construed to be protected by 1st amendment.  1st amendment has a penumbra where privacy is protected from govt intrusion.  Court has also said that other protected forms of association that are not political can be protected social, legal, and economic benefit of members.  Various guarantees create zones of privacy First amendment see above 3rd prohibition against quartering of soldiers 4th right of people to be secure in persons from unreasonable search and seizures 5th self-incrimination creates zone of privacy in which govt may not force him to surrender 9th enumeration of certain rights shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people  4th protect against govt invasions into sanctity of home and privacies of life Unconstitutional Govt purpose to control or prevent activities constitutionally subject to state reg may not be achieved by means which sweep unnecessarily broadly and thereby invade the area of protected freedoms (NAACP v. AL) Allowing police to search marital bedroom for evidence of contraceptives is repulsive to notions of privacy. Privacy here is older than Bill of Rights marriage is coming together and association that promotes way of life. Goldberg, Warren, Brennan Determination of fundamental rights Judges must look to traditions and collective conscience of people to determine whether a principle is so rooted there as to be ranked as fundamental. Inquiry is of such a character that it cannot be denied without violating those fundamental principles of liberty and justice which lie at base of all civil and political institutions.  Court has long history of saying that States may not abridge fundamental personal liberties simply on showing that regulatory statute has some rational relationship have to show a subordinating interest which is compelling.  Harlan Particular text of first 8 amendments doesnt spell out rights, but instead is nontextual concepts existing before Constitution which are fundamental, universal belong to citizens of all free govts for the purposes of securing which men enter into society (Calder v. Bull).  Substantive due process analysis First question is where are these moral concerns coming from? What the court has to do is find a source of power to act. Not popular to admit that what they are doing is substantive due process.  Douglas in Griswold very creative in avoiding labeling it substantive due process. Specific guarantees forming penumbrances... with a listing of everything in the Bill of Rights.  What is the scope of that right? What kinds of legislative actions come into conflict with a constitutional right sufficient to allow the court to step in as a protective move. Identifying what the right is defines what the scope of the courts power will be. The more specifically articulated the right, the fewer cases the court will find that conflict with it.  Is Griswold about contraception for married people? Or criminalization of sale and distribution of contraception for married people? Is it any laws for contraception for any people? Is it about contraception or is it about anything that has to do with procreative choices (including abortion)? Is it procreative choices, or is it any choices that have to do with sexuality and sexual discretion sex that is not procreative (gay sex)? Is it about sex at all or any kind of privacy?  As you generalize, you create more possibilities for cross-fertilization between different constitutions. If you call it a fundamental right of dignity and autonomy, then you would find it in the new wave of constitution-righting. You could then search for best morality in other systems, rather than looking at traditional morality.  If there is something that is a universal horror, then why do we need protection from the political majority? It is b/c there is not a universal agreement...but what kind of super-majority is needed to overcome the collective action process? Roe v. Wade (1973) p. 1172 - Divided up govts ability to restrict abortion to the trimester system states can pursue interest of the child (or the fetus/potential life) much more extensively in third trimester; state can have an interest in the potential life of the child; We dont have consensus about when one becomes rights bearing being, so state cant legislate it. History of abortion Abortions performed before quickening (movement of fetus in utero) were not illegal Blackstone wrote that they were illegal after quickening, this distinction continued in US law.  Burdens imposed by making abortion illegal Medical harm, distressful life and future, psychological harm, mental and physical health impaired by child care; distress associated with unwanted child; stigma of unwed motherhood may prevent future legitimate relations. Can only be justified by compelling state interest narrowly tailored to express only legitimate interests at stake No consensus on when life begins, but fetuses never recognized as whole persons under the law Common law quickening Jews and Protestants birth Physicians conception or interim point at which fetus becomes viable Trimester system women has prima facie right to abortion which can only be defeated by compelling state interest First trimester womens right to privacy is overriding interest. Leave to decision of attending physician. The Doctors rights provision. Second trimester states interest in maternal health overriding Third trimester states interest in potential life Criticisms Inst trimester system set up to fail with increased technological capabilities in terms of viability of removed fetuses? Too focused on medical community and their input shouldve placed woman alone at center rather than + doctor Should have been analyzed under equal protection framework gender discrimination b/c of extent to which abortion regs disadvantaged women. Law the rhetoric of privacy also reinforces a public/private dichotomy that is at the heart of the structures that perpetuate powerlessness of women Conflicts between different areas of interest Why should there be any time at which maternal health is not an issue the state is worried about?  Mortality risk is so low as of now, first trimester mortality risk from abortion is no greater than mortality risk from live birth. But is health risk the same as mortality risk?  Why should SC look at medical evidence in that year, that henceforth there is no legitimate or compelling state interest in maternal health at this stage? Wont the legislature also have access to doctors?  Who says the point at which state interest disappears is the point at which laws equalize? Is there a greater value to society and to the woman in seeing the birth through? Why should the point of equilibrium be the health risks and not the moral benefits?  If sources defining the right are scientific sources that are subject to change, then shouldnt it be that that is better left to the legislature rather than the court?  What are the interest bearers on the other side of the divide? Doctor Womens rights: only their fundamental privacy rights, or should we also be talking about equality rights?  Being able to avoid physical inconveniences of pregnancy Right to choose whether to choose what you do or want to have done with your body Right against the state not to have the state choose for you What about the emotional interest in the child? What about your present self not knowing what your future self will want. It cant be rational choice future self. State has a paternalistic interest in making sure that it doesnt let you make the wrong decision. Fathers rights: Not listed.  Casey cant allow father any rights in the making of the decision b/c to do so would be delegating rights of the state to the father and we cant let the father have any more rights than the state. But why are the states power the same as the father?  If the irrebuttable presumption that husbands are the fathers of their children in marriage, then what are the fathers rights?  Fetus For 14th amendment purposes, court decides that fetus is not an independent bearer of rights.  If a corporation can be an independent bearer of rights, then why not a person? A legal fiction of a person?  States Maternal Health Potential Life  If the state has an interest in potential life at all, what is the reasoning behind saying that the state can only regulate in the name of that interest during viability?  It could survive outside of the womb some chance of survivability upon disconnect from woman.  Inevitability unless some act of violence or something unusual occurs, birth will happen. Population increase increase in House of Representatives Protecting morals Protecting appearances protecting a moral order by creating a world in which the moral order doesnt look like its being disturbed Protecting societys general level of respect for life and disrespect for acts of violence that threaten life Would we somehow be allowing people to treat actual life in the same way Progressive numbing of the moral fibers of society Maybe all along respect for preference for potential life was always a preference for life over abortion? Maybe just the balance tips towards the state when viability occurs.  How do we draw the line? Formalistic line drawing is useless commerce clause give up trying to do it But we cant abdicate responsibility we have to draw it somewhere State has a paternalistic interest in making sure that you make rational choices. Is the state allowed to have a preference for birth over abortion? Why? Do they think that is the choice the rational woman would have made with all things considered? But at what point to do you consider this Much more difficult for women to relinquish parental rights once theyve seen and touched the baby combination of hormonal, emotional, and moral factors will make it very difficult to give up the baby, even if long term it is better for them.  Maybe the state has an interest in intervening in the process of choice itself.  Progressive polarization Is it better of worse for abortion-rights supporters to say that some exercise of abortion rights go too far? The view within the pro-choice movement has always been to say no matter how reasonable any restriction on abortion looks, you should always assume that supporters are supporters of abortion-rights all slippery slopes will be slid down given away the whole thing. Process in which abortion rights advocates have to defend absolutely everything makes them go against everything.  Are these issues entirely non-compromisable? It is like the anti-slavery battle for both sides. Planned Parenthood of PA v. Casey (1992) p. 1202 rejection of trimester framework; uses undue burden test to ensure liberty; state can enact regs as long as cant be substantial obstacle or undue burden; affirm Roe womans interest in choice, states interest in life. Holding Recognition of right of women to choose to have an abortion before viability and to obtain it without undue interference from state. Before viability, states interests are not strong enough to support prohibition or imposition of substantial obstacle to womans right. Womans suffering is too intimate and personal for state to insist without more, upon its own vision of womans role, however dominant that vision has been in the course of our history and culture. Destiny of woman must be shaped on her own conception and her place in society. This dimension of personal liberty was protected by Roe.  Ability of women to participate equally in economic and social life of nation has been facilitated by their ability to control their reproductive lives.  Confirmation of states power to restrict abortions after fetal viability, if law contains exceptions for pregnancies which endanger a womans life or health. State has legitimate interests from outset of pregnancy in protection health of woman and life of fetus that may become a child.  Reasoning Viability is still when state has interest in potential life, no matter when that occurs.  Stare decisis should only be interfered with when some special reason over and above the belief that a prior case was wrongly decided some major societal shift in understanding (e.g. Brown v. Plessy, Adkins v. West Coast Hotel) Courts power lies in its legitimacy, product of substance and perception that shows itself in peoples acceptance of Judiciary as fit to determine what law means and what it demands. Substance has to be furnished by legal principal and something more allow people to accept decisions on the terms Court claims for them, as grounded truly in principle, not as compromises with social and political pressures having, as such, no bearing on principled choices that Court is obliged to make. When Court decides intensely divisive issue, decision requires equally rare precedential force to counter the inevitable efforts to overturn it and thwart implementation. Overruling under political fire compromises legitimacy.  Liberty of woman cannot be infringed b/c of unclear line, so viability is the line; but state always has interest in life of unborn, but that interest isnt sufficiently strong enough until viability.  Fairness woman who fails to act before viability has consented to States intervention on behalf of child.  No constitutional right to abortion on demand.  But strikes down spousal notification as too much of a burden gives man too much control over wife. Women dont lose liberty when they marry.  Judicial bypass for minors is ok parental consent needed.  Undue burden test established State can still intervene to make sure that choice is thoughtful and rational can enact rules to encourage her to continue pregnancy to full term. Not every law which makes abortion more difficult to procure will be unconstitutional can serve a valid purpose yet decrease access or increase cost.  Undue burden standard is appropriate means of reconciling States interest w/ womans constitutionally protected liberty.  State regulation has purpose or effect of placing a substantial obstacle in the path of a women seeking an abortion. Statute with this purpose is invalid b/c means chosen by state to further interest in potential life must be calculated to inform womans free choice, not hinder it. Large obstacles cant be considered permissible means of serving legit ends. What is at stake is womans right to make the ultimate decision, not a right to be insulated from all others in doing so.  Minor regulations are permitted to structure choice to favor childbirth.  But why would state assume that women are more likely to make decisions about abortion without due consideration than other decision affecting their lives and health? Rejection of trimester framework.  Stevens dissent 24 hour waiting period is an example of wearing down pregnant womans ability to exercise right w/o evidence that it helps with decision. Denies women equal respect those who decide to continue pregnancy and those who decide to abort.  State is conscripting womens bodies into its service by enacting restrictive regime. That women have a duty to have children and to accept natural status and incidents of motherhood.  Scalia dissent Constitution says nothing about abortion as a fundamental liberty There is a longstanding tradition in society to have it be legally proscribed There should be no rigid national rule the Court should get out of this issue.  Is Casey producing a more defensible abortion-rights regime? Was there any justification that what they were doing was supporting stare decisis? Were abortion-rights advocates not prepared to speak in their own voices, but instead through stare decisis.  How much of a loss or victory was Casey seen as? Victory not overturned. Burden heavy burden.  Abortion providers are decreasing, so it becomes a much bigger burden.  World that Roe created on paper was a world that never existed there was never any funding state was still allowed to prefer live birth to abortion. Right to abortion on demand never existed for a woman who didnt have the money or for people who couldnt find providers. Nothing in Roe stood in the way of denying funding to public medical schools for training for abortion. Hospitals were never required to have physicians on staff performing abortions.  It was never a positive right. The not undue burden against the burdens that already exist. You still have view Roe as a success story against the prior regime.  SC does use conspiracy laws, RICO, civil rights laws to put boundaries against anti-abortion protestors.  Does the Casey regime have any possibility of quieting controversy? Maher v. Roe (1977) p. 1526 no constit. right to have state pay for abortion; later cases allowed rules prohibiting abortions in public hospitals No constitutional imposition on states to pay for abortions or any medical expenses.  Equal Protection clause doesnt require equal treatment for carrying pregnancies out v. having abortions Indigent women are not suspect classes There is no unqualified right to an abortion it only protects woman from unduly burdensome interference with freedom to decide. No limitation on state to make value judgment favoring childbirth over abortion. Dissent By favoring childbirth and paying medical expenses, some women will have no real choice operates to coerce indigent pregnant women to bear children they would not otherwise choose to have.  Infringement of fundamental rights are not limited to outright denaisl 1st amendment compelling interest test applicable to restraints that make exercise more difficult Right to travel must pass test regardless of whether statutes deter travel Right of access to courts have been excused payment of entry costs w/o being req. first to show indigency was absolute bar Fact that CT scheme may not operate as absolute bar is not critical what is critical is that State has inhibited fundamental right to make that choice free from state interference.  Struck down NC statute that didnt provide unemployment benefits to woman who could have taken job that would have forced her to work on Saturday against her religious beliefs.  Steinberg (partial birth round 1) struck down law that banned any partial birth abortion unless procedure is necessary to save life of mother.  Federal law on what possible grounds, given the existing case law, can Congress exercise a power to regulate partial birth abortion.  What about writers of the opinion to deviate from Roe itself, but on the other hand, even in that deviation they are really not speaking in their own voice, but they are speaking from stare decisis.  Rescuing of Roe is done with three justices saying that they are doing it only b/c it was done before.  Why does stare decisis apply in some cases and not others?  Different views Ginsburg thinks laws passed out of hostility to abortion constitute undue burden, while Kennedy thinks that NE statute should be read as good faith articulation of moral concern.  Court defers to physicians judgment are they going back to pre-Casey? Lawrence v. Texas (2003) p. 235 overrules Bowers; due process clause; more anti-federalist than anti-majoritarian...Federalism Question; Should the extension of the right of intimate association be one of basic privileges and immunities of citizens regardless of state law? Reliance on precedent Eisenstadt struck down law preventing contraception distribution to unmarried persons; said that wrt unmarried persons, law impaired exercise of their personal rights law was in conflict fundamental human rights if right to privacy means anything, it must mean the right of the individual, married or single, to be free from unwarranted governmental intrusion into matters so fundamentally affecting a person as the decision whether to bear or beget a child.  Carey invalidated law preventing distribution of contraceptives to person under 16. Meant that reasoning of Griswold couldnt be confined to unmarried adults... Casey heart of liberty of 14th amendment is making intimate and personal choices the right to define ones own concept of existence, of meaning, of the universe, and of the mystery of human life.  Problems with Bowers Issue was not protected right to engage in sodomy, but rather far-reaching statutes touching upon most private human conduct, sexual behavior, and in most private of places, the home. Do seek to control a personal relationship that, whether or not entitled to formal recognition in the law, is within the liberty of persons to choose without being punished as criminals.  Sexual contact can be but one element in a personal bond that is more enduring liberty in constit. allows individuals the right to make this choice.  Historical grounds relied upon in Bowers are more complex and debated than presented.  Reasons for departing from stare decisis Reasoning in Bowers based on historical evidence was flawed/interpreted wrongly Foundations have sustained serious erosion from decisions in Casey and Romer, so criticism from other sources is of great significance. Courts of 5 states have declined to follow it in interpreting provisions in their own state constitutions parallel to 14th amendment.  Reasoning in Bowers has been rejected elsewhere ECHR. No detrimental reliance induced as result of Bowers no individual or societal reliance of Bowers of the sort that could counsel against overturning its holding. Subsequent conflicting holdings have made reliance difficult. OConnor Relies on Equal protection should be evaluated under rational basis review. Conduct is so closely correlated w/ being homosexual that it means that legis. is targeting gays as a class. Basis for law is moral disapproval rather than rational govt interest, so it fails test. TX rarely enforces so it serves as a moral persuasion tool rather than criminal.   Dissent (Scalia) Bases for departing from stare decisis invalid 14th amendment contains no right to liberty it only says that states must use due process before depriving someone of liberty. Prohibits states from infringing fundamental liberties, but fundamentalness must be proven before law will be struck down. Has to also be interest traditionally protected by society those privileges long recognized by common law.  Reliance on precedent Griswold nor Eisenstadt was based on 14th amendment due process, Eistenstadt was equal protection and Griswold was penumbras of privacy other than due process clause.  If statute is struck down b/c there is no state interest which can justify intrusion into personal life and traditional morality is not enough of an interest, then what moral legislation could be upheld? Majoritarian morality is not a legitimate state interest... What about adultery and incest laws similarly solely based on the identity of the partner?  Isnt this merely casting it as expressing moral disapproval (bad) rather than preserving traditions of society (good)? What then would allow same sex marriage prohibition?  Evaluation Why didnt Keenedy just say that there was a fundamental right? He objected to it as characterization of a right, b/c it demeaned homosexuals by reducing intimacy to sexual act.  Right to privacy is right to form personal relationships, of which sex is only a part.  Does it turn on the relationship the intimacy; the degree of social acceptance of practices, or the fact that it is between consenting adults? What about bestiality, S&M, polygamy, etc.? Loving can be distinguished (1) involved suspect classification (2) traditional morality interest was abridging fundamental right to marry Different ways the court could have gone: Could have focused on expanding right to privacy, as in Lawrence. Consequences for equal protection will strictly scrutinize laws that place discriminatory burdens on exercise of fundamental right or fundamental interest.  B/c right to form same-sex intimate relationships is right of privacy, some discrimination against same-sex conduct will be unconstit. under both due process and equal protection.  Could have found Texas prohibition on same-sex but not opposite sex sodomy violated rational basis.  Why should TX law fail rational basis test if right to privacy doesnt apply to same-sex conduct?  Could have held that classifications based on sexual orientation are suspect and subject to heightened scrutiny. By grounding gay rights in privacy rather than equality, it automatically declared all remaining provisions illegal. Did not have to hold that gays are suspect class holds off decision on gay marriage.  Goodridge Marriage is civil right (Loving v. VA) Ban on gay marriage doesnt pass rational basis test for eq. prot. or for due process The Constitution cannot control such prejudices but neither can it tolerate them. Private biases may be outside the reach of the law, but the law cannot, directly or indirectly, give them effect (Palmore v. Sidoti) Reasons given by state providing a \"favorable setting for procreation\";  Our laws of civil marriage do not privilege procreative heterosexual intercourse between married people above every other form of adult intimacy and every other means of creating a family. Fertility is not a condition of marriage, nor is it grounds for divorce. People who have never consummated their marriage, and never plan to, may be and stay married.  People who cannot stir from their deathbed may marry.  While it is certainly true that many, perhaps most, married couples have children together (assisted or unassisted), it is the exclusive and permanent commitment of the marriage partners to one another, not the begetting of children, that is the sine qua non of civil marriage ensuring the optimal setting for child rearing, which the department defines as \"a two-parent family with one parent of each sex\";  The department has offered no evidence that forbidding marriage to people of the same sex will increase the number of couples choosing to enter into opposite-sex marriages in order to have and raise children.  There is thus no rational relationship between the marriage statute and the Commonwealth's proffered goal of protecting the \"optimal\" child rearing unit.  Moreover, the department readily concedes that people in same-sex couples may be \"excellent\" parents preserving scarce State and private financial resources An absolute statutory ban on same-sex marriage bears no rational relationship to the goal of economy.  First, the department's conclusory generalization--that same-sex couples are less financially dependent on each other than opposite-sex couples--ignores that many same-sex couples, such as many of the plaintiffs in this case, have children and other dependents (here, aged parents) in their care. The department does not contend, nor could it, that these dependents are less needy or deserving than the dependents of married couples.  Second, Massachusetts marriage laws do not condition receipt of public and private financial benefits to married individuals on a demonstration of financial dependence on each other; the benefits are available to married couples regardless of whether they mingle their finances or actually depend on each other for support Executive Power Truman and the Steel Seizure Cases Historical Background FDR and Trumans accession FDR dies in office in his fourth term in office and even though he knew he was going to die in office, put zero trust in Truman and didnt involve him in anything.  FDR was already losing popularity when he died. Truman never had a mandate and Congress was never for him (Dems lost in the election), even though Truman won reelection.  Truman lost in the Taft-Hartley act a statute that was passed on the basis of Congressional findings that the Wagner Act had left labor unions too powerful, so Congress passed the act to limit the role of the govt in the labor union and clipped the labor unions.  Truman vetoed Taft-Hartley, but his veto was overridden by Congress. This statute contains the procedures that arguably Truman was supposed to follow but didnt for intervening in strikes during a national emergency. The statute allows the president to petition the district court to enjoin the strike and the injunction would then have a length of 180 days. A strike injunction protects the status quo during the course of the injunction. Truman believed in Unions demands Truman thought that there was considerable justice in the unions demands and thought that an injunction preserving the status quo would not be enough so he seizes the steel mills and directs them to operate as they had been operating.  But the one thing that the govt takes upon itself to do is to adjust wages and working conditions during the course of the seizure. So he is looking for some way to get the steel workers to work without forcing them to comply with what he considered to be unfair conditions and wages.  Steel Seizure case in the Courts The case becomes for the court to explore exactly what the executive power is, as well as dealing with a war that isnt a declared war.  Its a war that the US is doing in conjunction with the UN, which is a new organization. So the court in examining questions of executive power has the option to say whether if Congress had declared war it would be different. Black (Majority) Blacks opinion is for the majority, but how can he be writing for the majority when there is no agreement on approach? But the approach he takes is very formalistic the power to seize is a legislation power and the executive doesnt have it.  Jackson The most influential approach is Jacksons, which is the most enduring as well. But he is writing only for himself, as a justice rather than as an advocate, since the Department used his ideas of broad executive power to make his case.  Jackson is drawing far more on the past realities of FDRs administration rather than Trumans. He is concerned with the ways in which the modern presidency gives the president far more power than before. The media, head of the political party, all give the president more power, even though Truman himself was not that good at manipulating those powers. He is drawing this image from his experiences with FDR at the height of his power.  He is concerned that claims of power, particularly if they are taken as precedent by the court, will have the tendency to increase that power.  Jackson had spent time off the court to preside over the Nuremberg trials and is drawing on lots of historical experience in writing the opinion where the Nazis had assumed great federal power, which destroyed the Weimar govt.  He is creating a notion of executive power that does not stand independent from Congresss legislation.  2 significant anti-communist acts vs. Trumans veto of Taft-Hartley Hatch Act bars communists from govt service Smith Act regarded as first anti-sedition statute ever passed by US  1947 Taft-Hartley Act passed targeting labor unions thought to be major communist orgs Truman is speaking out of both sides of his mouth anti-communist hysteria and supporting labor union. Truman keeps capitulating to anti-communists.  Truman also pitches a civil rights oriented measures to help Black army veterans period of many more lynchings taking place. Asserting that WWII had changed the status of blacks in the South.  The Congress at this point was controlled by a coalition of conservative democrats and republicans. Joe McCarthy claimed that he had a list of 205 communists in the State Department, and although this was a lie it catapults him in the middle of the anti-communist movement.  Steel Seizure case describes ebb and flow of executive power in relation to Congress Background on Youngstown First cases of incorporation theory of Bill of Rights were in state prosecution and convictions of anarchists, speaking in ways of overthrowing the govt or disrespect. The Supreme Court had problems not applying the first amendment to state acts. This starts also building the case law that starts to deconstruct worst parts of Southern criminal procedure in the South.  This is also part of the context in which Youngstown is evaluating presidential v. Congressional power, and McCarthy was already accusing people of being part of a military and diplomatic conspiracy. In this period, its McCarthy and the Senate that have the power, not the president.  McCarthy and others used power of Senate and House to investigate areas that might be in need of Congressional action to monitor performance of Executive. The power to investigate turned the country inside-out. Look at constitutional structure. To get power in Congress, you have to have been in Congress for a long time Southern Democrats had significant seniority that put them in charge of controlling committees. The developed structure of the legislative branch, which exists nowhere in the constitution, enable long-standing politicians to amass lots of power. These structures can also drive events, and have never been significantly challenged.  Powers at issue How odd is it that even by 1952 we dont know the scope of executive power in the US. Hamilton (less executive power) v. Madison (stronger executive power)?  War power:  What is the importance of absence of declaration of war in Korean Conflict. If only Congress has the power to declare war, if the President is getting us involved w/o Congressional declaration, then the President is abusing the constitution and we need to limit Presidents abuse of power.  Or are the conditions of modern warfare such that it has changed from the Framers convention and that the President needs the power to be able to conduct foreign relations in this way. Is Congress acquiescing through passing appropriations statutes?  Blacks opinion He looks as if the answers can be seen on the face of the constitution, which is not really the case.  Realistically, there is always implied Executive power and how do you determine how broad it is in a given circumstance?  Jacksons opinion - He tries to delineate executive power through its relationship with Congressional power.  The maximum Presidential power is when Congress has authorized Presidential action either expressly or impliedly. The President is personifying the federal sovereignty, and if the act is unconstitutional then it means that the Federal Govt as an undivided whole lacks power. This would be the area in which Presidential action would be presumed constitution burden would rest on anyone questioning it.  The answer is less clear when the Presidents is acting in the absence of either a congressional grant or denial of authority, he can rely upon his own independent powers. There is a zone of twilight in which he and Congress may have concurrent authority, or in which its distribution is uncertain. Congressional inertia or indifference or quiescence may enable or invite independent presidential action. Any actual test of power depends on imperatives of events and contemporary imponderables rather than on abstract theories of law. Conflicts here will have to be resolved morally and politically by the people there is no clear cut law resolved by how much meaning court is prepared to read into constitutional text and legislative history.  The lowest ebb of Presidential power is when his action is incompatible with Congress and expressly against the wishes of Congress. He can rely only on his own independent powers minus Congressional powers of Congress. To sustain exclusive presidential control in such a case can only be done by disabling Congress from action Does the collective action problem justify the executive taking action on certain issues independently to break the collective action problem? Whether Taft-Hartley puts case in Jacksons #2 or #3? National and safety and health is the framework, not war. The legislative history of not adopting seizure as a mechanism was not done in contemplation of situations like the Korean conflict. If you are going to use Congressional action to take away from Executive power (situation #3), then you would want clear Congressional action to move from #2 (zone of twilight) to #3.  Had Congress directly focused on this type of situation to be absolutely sure of what Congress meant. Does this also turn on your view of the war as a real security risk and national emergency, or as a conflict far from the US that didnt pose a real threat? Does the level of crisis posed matter? The President does not have a monopoly on war powers. Congress appropriates funds for the war, declares war, and is empowered to make rules for the Government and Regulation of the armed forces.  15th Amendment Voting Rights Act of 1965 Empowered Attorney General to suspend literacy tests and other restrictions on voting in those states where less than 50% of the citizens had voted or were registered to vote. Once findings made, state could not adopt any new standards with regard to voting w/o obtaining preclearance from AG.  Congress later amended it to completely prohibit literacy tests. SC upheld as valid even though they overturned Lassiter.  South Carolina v. Katzenbach (1966) p. 484 Congress has remedial power under 15th amendment Holding Upheld Voting Rights Act of 1965 as exercise of Congresss power under Section 2 of 15th amendment Section 2 includes enforcement power.  Provisions were remedy for proven violations of 15th amendment. Section 1 of the 15th amendment has always been treated as self-executing and has repeatedly been construed to invalidate state voting qualifications or procedures which are discriminatory on their face or in practice.  Background Some facially neutral disqualification standards for voting, so it is certainly state action that is keeping blacks from polls. The 15th amendment had an enforcement clause, so the voting rights act is clearly within enforcing the 15th amendment.  The storyline is the relationship between the court and Congress when both are active in enforcing civil rights. When Congress makes literacy tests one of the red flags of possible discrimination opens them up to federal intrusion in their voting practices.  There are widespread patterns of discrimination subjective tests of good morals, getting vouchers from other registered voters are suspect practices. This leaves open a very real possibility of abuse by officials.  Case-by-case litigation has proved ineffective.  South Carolina is saying that the court said that literacy tests were ok in Lassiter in 1959. But court says that there is language in Lassiter that says that literacy tests are not ok when they are implemented in a discriminatory fashion.  There is evidence presented from a string of cases showing the racially discriminatory way in which these supposed neutral qualifications are being used. The court can say that there is no issue in needing to worry about the coordination of exercise of power between the court and Congress b/c there is no conflict between what Congress has done and Lassiter.  The 11th Amendment and Congresss Power to Authorize Suits Against the State Govts Overview Legal Text The Judicial Power of the United States shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity, commenced or prosecuted against one of the United States by Citizens of another State, or by Citizens or Subjects of any foreign state. History of suits Limitations on suits Congress could authorize suits against state govts pursuant to Sec. 5 of 14th amendment Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer: State govts may be sued under Title VII of 1964 Civil Rights Act, which prevents employment discrimination on basis of race, gender, or religion.  When Congress acts pursuant to Sec. 5, not only is it exercising legislative authority that is plenary w/in the terms of the constitutional grant, it is exercising that authority under one section of a constitutional Amendment whose other sections by their own terms embody limitations on state authirty. We think that Congress may, in determining what is appropriate legislation for the purpose of enforcing the provisions of the 14th Amendment, provide for private suits against States or state officials which are constitutionally impermissible in other contexts.  Congress cannot subject states to suit under Commerce Power Seminole Tribe v. Florida (1996): Morrison, Lopez, and Printz held that congress cannot subject the states to lawsuits under its Commerce Power. If suits were barred from federal courts by 11th amendment, Congress couldnt require suits for money damages in state courts either (Alden v. Maine 1999) ( Congress can subject states to suits only through legislation passed under its Reconstruction power.  Congress cannot subject states to suits for violations of the 14th amendment due process clause (Florida Prepaid v. College Savings Bank 1999) Patent Remedy Act failed test of congruence and proportionality b/c Congress identified no pattern of patent infringement by the States, let alone a pattern of constitutional violations. B/c many patent infringements affected by statute werent unconstitutional, scope of Act was out of proportion to its supposed remedial or preventive objects to place states on same footing as private parties under that regime. This was not a permissible goal under Section 5.  Congress could not abrogate sovereign immunity of states in suits under Age Discrimination in Employment Act (Kimel v. Florida Board of Regents 2000) ADEA was proper legislation under Commerce clause, and Congress made clear statement that it wished to abrogate 11th amendment immunity. But ADEA not proper since age is only subject to rational basis test. Under 14th amendment, state can use age as proxy for other qualities and abilities relevant to States legitimate interests w/o being unconstitutional.  So against backdrop of equal protection jurisprudence, ADEA is so out of proportion to supposed remedial or preventive object that it cannot be understood as responsive to, or designed to prevent, unconstitutional behavior. (City of Boerne). The broad restriction in the act prohibits substantially more state employment decisions and practices as would be unconstitutional under applicable equal protection rational basis standard. Could also not be a prophylactic measure b/c Congress shows no significant pattern of unconstitutional discrimination. Finds that level of scrutiny under Equal Protection is substantive element of 14th amendment. ( Congress may thus not subject states to money damages for conduct that the Court thinks would not violate equal protection.  (So no money damages possible for any acts based on anything other than strict scrutiny.  Requirements for abrogating immunity Clear statement that the are abrogating state immunity Congruence - Statute touches on Section 5 violations that are normally subject to strict scrutiny (race, alienage, ethnicity) Proportionality some pattern of unconstitutional behavior of states is demonstrated such that preventive action is necessary. ( 11th amendment immunity is determined by scope of Sec. 5 power 11th amendment immunity does not extend to local and municipal govts (Garrett)  Cases Board of Trustees of U of AL v. Garrett (2001); Converts strict scrutiny rules into substantive limitations on Congressional power; B/c disc based on disability would always pass ratl basis, legis. targeting disc will always flunk congruence & proportionality test; Must limit Sec. 5 power to broaden immunity and enforce federalism; If states activity is ratl basis, prophylactic legis. improper; Dissent scrutiny rule that judges apply isnt constitutional guarantee itself, just reps limits of judicial auth to enforce constit. guarantee Facts Employers cannot discrimination against disabled persons. Garrett was diagnosed with breast cancer (was nurse at hospital) and then forced to give up Director position when she returned to work after chemo.  Act requires employers to make reasonable accommodations to known physical or mental limitations of employees unless employer can demonstrate that accommodation would impose undue hardship on operation of business. Issue Whether employees of State of AL may recover $ by reason of states failure to comply with Title I of ADA (Disabilities Act). Holding States immunity cannot be abrogated for suits under ADA. (For $ damages against states, there must be a pattern of disc by the States which violates 14th amendment, and the remedy imposed by Congress must be congruent and proportional to targeted violation.  Reasoning  Congress may abrogate immunity when Unequivocally intends to do so Acts pursuant to valid grant of constitutional authority Power under Section 5 To remedy and deter violations of rights which includes broader swath of conduct which may not all be unconstit. by 14th City of Boerne responsibility of court to determine substance of constit. guarantees Legislation reaching beyond scope of Sec. 1s guarantees must exhibit congruence and proportionality between the injury to be prevented or remedied and the means adopted to that end. Requirements Suspect classifications Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Centers: mental retardation not suspect classification ( where group possesses distinguishing characteristics relevant to interests of State is not unconstit. If Congress wants to enact special accommodations for the disabled, it has to come from positive law and not through equal protection. Congruence Whether Congress identified history and pattern of employment discrimination Congress Sec. 5 authority is only properly exercised in response to state transgressions. Local govts still subject to private claims under ADA since no 11th amendment immunity ( so evidence of disc on part of local govts doesnt count ( But shouldnt real question be if local and municipal auths are engaging in state action?  Adverse disparate treatment isnt constitutional violation where rational basis scrutiny employed no legislative findings in record, only anecdotal findings. No pattern of disc found in state govt.  Proportionality It might be entirely rational and constit. for state employer to conserve scarce financial resources by hiring employees who can use existing facilities, but ADA requires employers to make facilities accessible. ( Accommodation burden far exceeds what is constitutionally required in that it makes unlawful a range of alternate responses that would be reasonable but would fall short of imposing an undue burden upon employer. ADA forbids utilizing standards or method of administration that disparately impact disabled, w/o regard as to whether conduct has rational basis. Disparate impact is not enough even for strict scrutiny... Dissent Law should be a leader in moral teacher ADA can be milestone on path to more tolerant future. Intentional or purposeful discrimination on the part of states should not be a requirement for action States should not have to be held in violation of constitutional duties or pattern of disc to be held liable. Failure of states to revise policies fore behavior now seen as incorrect doesnt always constitute a purposeful and intentional act which is violation of equal protection clause. If discrimination is pervasive in society, then likely state govts are participants Extensive documentation by Congress of problem 300 examples of state disc on record. State-imposed barriers also obstructed voting and operation of govt services, finding housing Court is holding Congress to strict scrutiny standard in evidence  Evidence presented in Congress may not have passed strict judicial scrutiny for evidence, but for Sec. 5 legislation Court has never required Congress to perform same sort of judicial review of every piece of evidence that court evidence standards require. Congressional findings have never had to be broken down, category by category Limitations stemming from the nature of the judicial process...have no application to Congress (Oregon v. Mitchell 1970) When economic or social legislation is challenged in court as irrational, hence unconstit., burden is upon the challenging party to negative any reasonably conceivable state of facts that could provide rational basis for the classification. Ration basis review is a paradigm of judicial restraint. FCC v. Beach Communications (1993) Courts are generally very reluctant, as they should be in federal system, to closely scrutinize legis. choices. (Cleburne) Congress in the past has influenced what level of scrutiny should apply ( Courts reliance on Cleburne is misplaced since Cleburne itself allowed Congress to determine 14th amendment application to the states ( Absence of a contrary congressional finding was critical to our decision to apply mere rationa-basis review to disability discrimination claims a congressional directive to apply more stringent standard would have been controlling. (Cleburne) (The nature of Congress institutional competency allows it to have more flexible evidence standards There is no reason to hold Congress to strict evidence rules or presumptions that reflect courts institutional limits.  Congress can readily gather facts from across the nation, assess the magnitude of the problem, and find remedy.  Congress directly reflects public attitudes and belief so they know better where to impose remedies can get evidence directly from constituents.  ( Court is thwarting democratic process by conservative judicial activism Congress is elected public body and is responsible to people Courts should not sit as a superlegislature to judge the wisdom or desirability of legislative policy determinations. Section 5 power can enforce beyond what is directly unconstit.  Inconsistent: Court applies rational basis review to legislation burdening disabled, but strict scrutiny to legislation benefiting disabled.  Congress will only have to resort to more intrusive legis. like court injunctions and federal standards Evaluation Rhenquists rhetorical techniques to narrow relevant Congressional evidence Cleburne is ratl basis test (even though its ratl basis w/ bite) Only examples of discrimination by state actors should county, not local or county (But dont they engage in state action? If there is evidence of disc at local level, d/nt that point to existence at state level? Only examples of employment discrimination should count Excludes a lot of cases... Why should Congress be stopped form legislating against new discrimination? If popular consciousness changes about what liberty and equality require, shouldnt Congress be able to respond? If courts dont want to be judicial activists pushing forth change (like Warren court), then shouldnt they let Congress? Impact of ruling Garret is not really striking down ADA is not saying that states and their instrumentalities are exempt they are just dealing with suits brought by private parties against the states. Certain actions for injunctions brought by private parties are not an issue prospective injunctive relief.  Private rights of action are created by Congress precisely to get them involved in enforcement. Incentive depends on monetary remedies available practically have a significant effect on enforcement of statutes against the states.  How broad and specific is sovereign immunity does it change over time?  Fed Ct diversity (different and same state) Fed Ct Fed Q, express abrogation pursuant to reconstruction amendments. If it was enacted pursuant to when Congress expressly wanted to abrogate state immunity. If Congress expressly abrogates it and is acting under Sec. 5 of 14th amendment, then it is ok. 14th amendment can be understood for that reason to implicitly move beyond federalism block of the 14th amendment.  Fed Ct Fed Q (different state or same state) State Ct fed Q own citizens: Alden v. Maine applies to suits that are brought in state courts by citizens of that state.  Reaction of the federal judiciary to ADA Federal judiciary hates the ADA b/c it has sweeping purpose language, complex interlocking provisions which create a statute that has considerably narrower scope that the broad sweeping language of the purpose.  Congress did such a bad job of making the statute broader, so in a sense federal courts are trying to remand the statute back to Congress the federal courts are taking very restrictive readings of the statute. What if there were enough evidence from every state in the union... There are plenty of circumstances in which employers are allowed to fire employees with disabilities. It is not enough to prove that it happened, but you have to prove that there was no rational relationship whatsoever to a legitimate govt purpose. Criticisms Radical move away from textualism 11th amendment bars federal court juris over suits against a state brought by Citizens of a another state Isnt Garrett from same state? Isnt she suing in state court?  Nevada Dept. of Human Resources v. Hibbs (2003); heightened scrutiny given wider latitude for prophylactic legis.; Congress has narrowly tailored remedy; proven disc; Dissent when has Congress recognized family & med leave as substantive 14th right? D/nt Garrett say that Ct. alone determines meaning of constit. equality?  Background Employers would give some sort of physical disability leave for giving birth. The Hibbs case involves care-giving leave.  Only by creating possibility for men to take leave will men start to step up and take more family responsibilities. But the main problem is that the leave is unpaid. So since women are still making less money, in a rational household it will be the woman who takes the leave.  Hibbs comes down after the academic community has jumped all over the court for Garrett. The court knows that Congress needs to be taught a lesson, but is less sure about precisely what that lesson should be. Few people would have predicted that intermediate scrutiny would have had such a big effect on the case. Powers relied on in FMLA Article I commerce power Sec 5 enforcement power under 14th amendment FMLA Protect right to be free from gender-based discrimination in workplace Congress has evidence that states continue to disc in leave-context in gender disc Wide differences exist in state leave policies up to one year for women, but nothing for men. Only based on stereotype that women have primary role in caring for families.  Ruling Gender disc is subject to heightened scrutiny Congressional evidence shows Widespread pattern of state disc based on gender Stereo types that women are mothers first and workers second is fueling discrimination Congress policy is congruent and proportional to targeted violation Has already unsuccessfully tried to address problem through Title VII Confronted difficult and intractable problem where previous legis. attempts failed Justified in promoting prophylactic legis. ( Created an across-the board leave regardless of gender, so it directly attacks states unconstit stereotype that women are responsible for family care-giving. Statute that simply mandated fairness in leave programs might have resulted in states giving no leave at all FMLA is narrowly targeted at fault line between work and family, and Congress placed many limitations on measure only unpaid leave, applies only to employees who have been employed for at least 1 year full-time, high-ranking or sensitive employees not subject to policy (state officials or staff), employers may require health cert by doctor for leave. ( Congress chose a middle-ground, a period long enough to serve needs of families but balanace with interests of employers.  Evaluation Isnt this Congress enforcing/imposing and interpreting a new substantive right under Sec. 5?  What is the difference between Garrett and Hibbs? Heightened scrutiny Where Congress is addressing prophylactic legis. against heightened or strict scrutiny class. Given more flexibility ( But where has the court before recognized family and medical leave as sex equality issue? D/nt the court say in Garrett and Boerne that it alone determines meaning of constitutional equality? Distinguishing between old rights and new rights Congress is given freer hand where long histories of race or sex inequality concerned Kimel and Garrett are about new rights Dont take a good thing too far Court is extending federalism precedents to trench on highly visible and consequential civil rights statutes like FMLA b/c otherwise people would get hostile and wouldnt believe in Ct.
