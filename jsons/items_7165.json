The Wallerstein Collaborative For Urban Environmental Education was established in 2000 in the Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development at New York University to promote environmental literacy and sustainability by working with educators in K-12 classroom settings, graduate students, and faculty in colleges and universities.    The Collaborative provides year-round programs which stimulate public school teachers in the metropolitan New York City region to incorporate environmental education in their classrooms. Additionally the Collaborative provides environmental education opportunities for pre-service teachers through field work, course modules, and direct experience in the urban environment.    Under the direction of Dr. Mary J. Leou, the Collaborative introduces educators to resources, materials, and strategies required to successfully implement environmental education across all grade levels and curriculum areas. To achieve this goal, the Collaborative has developed partnerships with a wide range of formal and non-formal science institutions, environmental organizations, government agencies, and New York City schools which provide opportunities for field-based teaching and learning.    Services include: courses, internships, seminars, conferences, workshops, curriculum design and professional development for classroom teachers.
