Admissions Process Departmental Requirements  How can I find out more information about ITP? Prospective applicants are strongly encouraged to visit the department before applying. Each Fall semester (September through December), ITP hosts a series of Admissions Open House sessions meant for potential applicants who are interested in learning more about full-time study in the department. Each session is attended by Red Burns, the Chair of ITP, and Midori Yasuda, ITP's Admissions Coordinator, who will provide a tour of the department as well as answer questions about the admissions process and the program. See the open house page .    If your schedule does not permit you to attend an open house, individual appointments can be scheduled. Please feel free to call or email with questions or to schedule appointments by contacting Midori Yasuda at 212-998-1882 or midori.yasuda@nyu.edu .    In addition, ITP hosts student showcases at the end of each semester (May and December) where the department features dozens of multimedia installations including physical and virtual interaction design demonstrations, sound and video design projects, and screen-based works featured from some of our advanced production courses. ITP shows are the best time to get a sense of the energy, diversity, and spirit of the department. top Must I attend ITP full-time? Yes. ITP is a 2-year, full-time graduate program. All students must maintain full-time student status, meaning they must take at least 12 credits and no more than 18 credits each semester. (Most of ITP's courses are 4 credits each; we do offer some 2 credit courses). We require 60 credits to graduate from the department. top What is the due date for the application? Applications must be received by December 1 for consideration for the Fall term. Applicants can submit the graduate application earlier (and we encourage applicants to do so in order to ease the administrative burden).    Admissions is for the Fall semester only. We do not have Spring admissions.    Please note that the department does not have an early decision admissions process. If you are requesting a special exception to the deadline, please contact Midori Yasuda, ITP's Admissions Coordinator. top When will I be notified of the admissions decisions? Admissions decisions are mailed out by the end of March through early April.    Admissions offers are only valid for the semester which is specified on the acceptance letter. Due to the nature of our admissions process, we do not defer admissions (except under extreme circumstances). top What sort of financial aid is available? All U.S. applicants who are 1) accepted and 2) filed the FAFSA (Free Application for Federal Student Aid), will receive a financial aid package that will allow them to study at NYU.    Most students receive loan-based assistance, but some ITP scholarships are available, though highly competitive. U.S. applicants are strongly urged to complete the FAFSA by February 15.    International students are urged to look for outside sources of funding well in advance of the acceptance notice, but will be considered for departmental scholarships.    Please refer to the graduate application and Office of Financial Aid for more information. top What materials do I have to submit as a part of the application? All applicants need to submit a completed application form, personal statement, current resume, 2 letters of recommendations, official transcripts, the application fee, and an optional creative portfolio. There is also an optional group interview process. International students must also submit TOEFL (Test of English as a Foreign Language) results.    Through the online application system, everything can now be submitted online except transcripts, portfolios and TOEFL scores. Applicants are strongly urged to request that their recommenders file their letters through the online system. If your recommenders are unable to use the system, letters of recommendations and official transcripts can be sent directly to the Tisch Graduate Admissions Office. The applicant's name and social security number must be listed on the supporting materials so that Graduate Admissions can accurately match them with the rest of the application file. Please refer to the detailed instructions in the application.    The departmental code for the TOEFL score is 9633.    GRE scores are not required for admissions. top Do I have to submit a portfolio? Will this help or hinder my application? Submitting a creative portfolio is optional. The portfolio is meant for those applicants who feel that they have something creative to share with the admissions committee.    Applicants can submit professional or personal works, anything that exhibits ideas and a sense of creativity. For example, an applicant who is a professional photographer may want to submit a portfolio - i.e. via slides, print, digital images, etc. On the other hand, an applicant who is an amateur photographer is also welcome to submit a personal portfolio.    However, please make sure to fill out the creative portfolio description sheet so the Admissions Committee understands how to interpret the work - whether it's professional quality, a class project, or a personal hobby.    Please note that it does not reflect badly on applicants if they choose not to submit a portfolio. Also, please note that ITP cannot be held responsible for any creative materials lost or damaged while in our possession or in transit. Please do not send us original work. Applicants who would like portfolios returned must include a self-addressed stamped envelope with the portfolio.    For full instructions, please see the portfolio section in the Graduate Application. top Is there an interview as part of the admissions process? ITP hosts a series of group interviews starting in January through the end of February. We strongly encourage applicants to visit the department, meet current students, faculty and staff, see the projects on display and get a better feel for and understanding of the program.    Students who live on the east coast will automatically be contacted for an interview. Students who live abroad or further away from NYC are more than welcome to participate in the admissions process. If you will be visiting the NYC area, please contact Midori Yasuda to schedule a visit/interview. top What are the backgrounds of the ITP students? The ITP student population is very diverse. Candidates do not need to have prior experience with technology or interactive design. Rather, ITP seeks students from all different educational and professional backgrounds as well as maintaining geographic and cultural diversity. Since ITP is such a highly collaborative environment, the diversity of the student population is a very important factor.    A sampling of some of the backgrounds include - film, video, photography, painting, sculpting, architecture, industrial design, theatre, dance, music composition, web and graphic design, creative writing, history, philosophy, political science, urban studies, psychology, non-profit activism, biology, law, advertising, finance, business, computer science and engineering.    The average age of ITP students is approximately 27-28 years old. ITP prefers that candidates have at least a few years of work experience before joining the program. However, we do accept candidates directly out of undergraduate school as well as students well into their 30's, 40's, 50's and 60's. ITP is equally balanced between men and women in the program.    ITP's international student population is very diverse - this past year, roughly 25 countries were represented. We have students from such places as Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Philippines, Singapore, India, Australia, Brazil, Argentina, Venezuela, Canada, England, France, Germany, Spain, Italy, Lebanon, Slovenia, Russia, Turkey, Israel, Iran, Greece, Cyprus, Zimbabwe, Botswana and South Africa. top What if I don't have a technical or design background? It is not necessary to have a technical or interactive design background to attend ITP. In fact, the purpose of the four Foundation courses (which makeup the Tier I group of classes which are required of all students) is to introduce such key concepts and ideas. Foundation courses include Applications of Interactive Technologies, Communications Lab, Introduction to Computational Media and Introduction to Physical Computing. Please refer to our course descriptions. top I am an international student. Are they any other issues that I need to know in order to apply to the program? In order to avoid delays, international students are encouraged to submit all application materials in advance of deadline to the Tisch Graduate Admissions office.    All international students need to take the TOEFL English exam. There are special cases where applicants may be able to waive out of this requirement, please refer to the graduate application for more details.    Once an international applicant is accepted to the program, NYU will provide assistance with student visa issues. More information can be found in the graduate application and on the Office of International Students and Scholars ( OISS ) website. top Can I work while attending ITP? ITP is a 2-year, full-time program. Many ITP students work part-time or as interns while in the program whether it be for financial reasons or to gain valuable experience. However, we highly recommend no more than 20 hours of work per week in addition to the regular full-time class load. Many of the ITP classes require a large number of hours outside of the classroom that require flexibility of time for group collaborative meetings and developing individual projects that are essential to the overall ITP experience.    Special notice to international students: Due to the complex rules and regulations which govern student visa/employment issues, international students must obtain the permission of NYU's Office for International Students and Scholars (OISS) in order to seek employment, and must maintain full-time student status. See the OISS website . top Can I take classes on a non-degree basis? During the academic year, ITP classes are limited to ITP students and other matriculated, degree-seeking students at NYU.    However, each summer, ITP offers an array of courses that are available to the larger academic community beyond NYU for graduate credit. To inquire about summer courses, please contact the department. Please note that the summer session is a special circumstance where the department allows outside students to take ITP classes. The ITP student status for the summer does not carry over to the academic year unless the student has officially been admitted into the program. top Is housing available to ITP students? Graduate student housing is limited but available. Applicants who would like to be considered for graduate housing should mark the appropriate box on the graduate application. If accepted into the program, applicants will be mailed the graduate housing application. top How can I request a graduate application? Potential applicants can apply online by going to:    http://graduate.tisch.nyu.edu/object/howtoapply.html    Please check the Tisch Graduate Admissions website often to check for updates. top Can I charge my application fee? Yes, the online application requires that you pay by credit card or e-check. top Is it a problem if my undergraduate degree is in a field unrelated to what I want to study on the graduate level? No. We have many students who apply from a wide variety of undergraduate backgrounds. What is important is the creative material (portfolios, writing samples or auditions) for the conservatory training departments and evidence of strong scholarly and research abilities for our academic departments. If you feel you don't have enough experience in the field you want to go into, it may be a good idea to prepare by taking a noncredit course or gaining practical experience before applying. top If I'm having trouble getting a recommendation or transcript to you on time, can I fax it? The application is expressly designed to allow recommenders to submit letters of recommendation online. Transcripts should be uploaded online whenever possible to expedite the processing of the application. top Can I fax my application to you? No. We do not accept faxed applications. top Is a bachelor's degree required for all Master's level programs? Yes. You must have an undergraduate degree to apply to any of our Graduate programs.

Admissions Process Departmental Requirements  How can I find out more information about ITP? Prospective applicants are strongly encouraged to visit the department before applying. Each Fall semester (September through December), ITP hosts a series of Admissions Open House sessions meant for potential applicants who are interested in learning more about full-time study in the department. Each session is attended by Red Burns, the Chair of ITP, and Midori Yasuda, ITP's Admissions Coordinator, who will provide a tour of the department as well as answer questions about the admissions process and the program. See the open house page .    If your schedule does not permit you to attend an open house, individual appointments can be scheduled. Please feel free to call or email with questions or to schedule appointments by contacting Midori Yasuda at 212-998-1882 or midori.yasuda@nyu.edu .    In addition, ITP hosts student showcases at the end of each semester (May and December) where the department features dozens of multimedia installations including physical and virtual interaction design demonstrations, sound and video design projects, and screen-based works featured from some of our advanced production courses. ITP shows are the best time to get a sense of the energy, diversity, and spirit of the department. top Must I attend ITP full-time? Yes. ITP is a 2-year, full-time graduate program. All students must maintain full-time student status, meaning they must take at least 12 credits and no more than 18 credits each semester. (Most of ITP's courses are 4 credits each; we do offer some 2 credit courses). We require 60 credits to graduate from the department. top What is the due date for the application? Applications must be received by December 1 for consideration for the Fall term. Applicants can submit the graduate application earlier (and we encourage applicants to do so in order to ease the administrative burden).    Admissions is for the Fall semester only. We do not have Spring admissions.    Please note that the department does not have an early decision admissions process. If you are requesting a special exception to the deadline, please contact Midori Yasuda, ITP's Admissions Coordinator. top When will I be notified of the admissions decisions? Admissions decisions are mailed out by the end of March through early April.    Admissions offers are only valid for the semester which is specified on the acceptance letter. Due to the nature of our admissions process, we do not defer admissions (except under extreme circumstances). top What sort of financial aid is available? All U.S. applicants who are 1) accepted and 2) filed the FAFSA (Free Application for Federal Student Aid), will receive a financial aid package that will allow them to study at NYU.    Most students receive loan-based assistance, but some ITP scholarships are available, though highly competitive. U.S. applicants are strongly urged to complete the FAFSA by February 15.    International students are urged to look for outside sources of funding well in advance of the acceptance notice, but will be considered for departmental scholarships.    Please refer to the graduate application and Office of Financial Aid for more information. top What materials do I have to submit as a part of the application? All applicants need to submit a completed application form, personal statement, current resume, 2 letters of recommendations, official transcripts, the application fee, and an optional creative portfolio. There is also an optional group interview process. International students must also submit TOEFL (Test of English as a Foreign Language) results.    Through the online application system, everything can now be submitted online except transcripts, portfolios and TOEFL scores. Applicants are strongly urged to request that their recommenders file their letters through the online system. If your recommenders are unable to use the system, letters of recommendations and official transcripts can be sent directly to the Tisch Graduate Admissions Office. The applicant's name and social security number must be listed on the supporting materials so that Graduate Admissions can accurately match them with the rest of the application file. Please refer to the detailed instructions in the application.    The departmental code for the TOEFL score is 9633.    GRE scores are not required for admissions. top Do I have to submit a portfolio? Will this help or hinder my application? Submitting a creative portfolio is optional. The portfolio is meant for those applicants who feel that they have something creative to share with the admissions committee.    Applicants can submit professional or personal works, anything that exhibits ideas and a sense of creativity. For example, an applicant who is a professional photographer may want to submit a portfolio - i.e. via slides, print, digital images, etc. On the other hand, an applicant who is an amateur photographer is also welcome to submit a personal portfolio.    However, please make sure to fill out the creative portfolio description sheet so the Admissions Committee understands how to interpret the work - whether it's professional quality, a class project, or a personal hobby.    Please note that it does not reflect badly on applicants if they choose not to submit a portfolio. Also, please note that ITP cannot be held responsible for any creative materials lost or damaged while in our possession or in transit. Please do not send us original work. Applicants who would like portfolios returned must include a self-addressed stamped envelope with the portfolio.    For full instructions, please see the portfolio section in the Graduate Application. top Is there an interview as part of the admissions process? ITP hosts a series of group interviews starting in January through the end of February. We strongly encourage applicants to visit the department, meet current students, faculty and staff, see the projects on display and get a better feel for and understanding of the program.    Students who live on the east coast will automatically be contacted for an interview. Students who live abroad or further away from NYC are more than welcome to participate in the admissions process. If you will be visiting the NYC area, please contact Midori Yasuda to schedule a visit/interview. top What are the backgrounds of the ITP students? The ITP student population is very diverse. Candidates do not need to have prior experience with technology or interactive design. Rather, ITP seeks students from all different educational and professional backgrounds as well as maintaining geographic and cultural diversity. Since ITP is such a highly collaborative environment, the diversity of the student population is a very important factor.    A sampling of some of the backgrounds include - film, video, photography, painting, sculpting, architecture, industrial design, theatre, dance, music composition, web and graphic design, creative writing, history, philosophy, political science, urban studies, psychology, non-profit activism, biology, law, advertising, finance, business, computer science and engineering.    The average age of ITP students is approximately 27-28 years old. ITP prefers that candidates have at least a few years of work experience before joining the program. However, we do accept candidates directly out of undergraduate school as well as students well into their 30's, 40's, 50's and 60's. ITP is equally balanced between men and women in the program.    ITP's international student population is very diverse - this past year, roughly 25 countries were represented. We have students from such places as Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Philippines, Singapore, India, Australia, Brazil, Argentina, Venezuela, Canada, England, France, Germany, Spain, Italy, Lebanon, Slovenia, Russia, Turkey, Israel, Iran, Greece, Cyprus, Zimbabwe, Botswana and South Africa. top What if I don't have a technical or design background? It is not necessary to have a technical or interactive design background to attend ITP. In fact, the purpose of the four Foundation courses (which makeup the Tier I group of classes which are required of all students) is to introduce such key concepts and ideas. Foundation courses include Applications of Interactive Technologies, Communications Lab, Introduction to Computational Media and Introduction to Physical Computing. Please refer to our course descriptions. top I am an international student. Are they any other issues that I need to know in order to apply to the program? In order to avoid delays, international students are encouraged to submit all application materials in advance of deadline to the Tisch Graduate Admissions office.    All international students need to take the TOEFL English exam. There are special cases where applicants may be able to waive out of this requirement, please refer to the graduate application for more details.    Once an international applicant is accepted to the program, NYU will provide assistance with student visa issues. More information can be found in the graduate application and on the Office of International Students and Scholars ( OISS ) website. top Can I work while attending ITP? ITP is a 2-year, full-time program. Many ITP students work part-time or as interns while in the program whether it be for financial reasons or to gain valuable experience. However, we highly recommend no more than 20 hours of work per week in addition to the regular full-time class load. Many of the ITP classes require a large number of hours outside of the classroom that require flexibility of time for group collaborative meetings and developing individual projects that are essential to the overall ITP experience.    Special notice to international students: Due to the complex rules and regulations which govern student visa/employment issues, international students must obtain the permission of NYU's Office for International Students and Scholars (OISS) in order to seek employment, and must maintain full-time student status. See the OISS website . top Can I take classes on a non-degree basis? During the academic year, ITP classes are limited to ITP students and other matriculated, degree-seeking students at NYU.    However, each summer, ITP offers an array of courses that are available to the larger academic community beyond NYU for graduate credit. To inquire about summer courses, please contact the department. Please note that the summer session is a special circumstance where the department allows outside students to take ITP classes. The ITP student status for the summer does not carry over to the academic year unless the student has officially been admitted into the program. top Is housing available to ITP students? Graduate student housing is limited but available. Applicants who would like to be considered for graduate housing should mark the appropriate box on the graduate application. If accepted into the program, applicants will be mailed the graduate housing application. top How can I request a graduate application? Potential applicants can apply online by going to:    http://graduate.tisch.nyu.edu/object/howtoapply.html    Please check the Tisch Graduate Admissions website often to check for updates. top Can I charge my application fee? Yes, the online application requires that you pay by credit card or e-check. top Is it a problem if my undergraduate degree is in a field unrelated to what I want to study on the graduate level? No. We have many students who apply from a wide variety of undergraduate backgrounds. What is important is the creative material (portfolios, writing samples or auditions) for the conservatory training departments and evidence of strong scholarly and research abilities for our academic departments. If you feel you don't have enough experience in the field you want to go into, it may be a good idea to prepare by taking a noncredit course or gaining practical experience before applying. top If I'm having trouble getting a recommendation or transcript to you on time, can I fax it? The application is expressly designed to allow recommenders to submit letters of recommendation online. Transcripts should be uploaded online whenever possible to expedite the processing of the application. top Can I fax my application to you? No. We do not accept faxed applications. top Is a bachelor's degree required for all Master's level programs? Yes. You must have an undergraduate degree to apply to any of our Graduate programs.

Of special interest is the design of computer-based, multimedia simulations and games for learning, dramatic and documentary narratives, media that support advocacy and advance social justice; the educational potential of social media; and educational applications of media and technology for international development. Media design principles are drawn from theoretical perspectives in the cognitive sciences, the learning sciences, developmental models of learning, constructivist and constructionist philosophies of learning, and social learning theories. Other fields that contribute to the design of media environments and programs that support learning include communication design, interaction design, information design, multimedia learning theory, human-computer interaction, human symbolization and aesthetics. The DMDL project-based curriculum is complemented by an excellent internship program with host sites in all areas of educational technology throughout the metropolitan area.
