The database assures that the NYU community can readily retrieve the most current versions of University policies.     What is a University Policy?     University policies advance our academic mission as an institution of higher education by helping to ensure compliance with applicable laws, ethical norms, and accepted best practices; promoting operational efficiencies; enhancing the opportunities to achieve the University\u2019s goals and reducing institutional risks.     University policies have broad application throughout the University across colleges, schools, institutes and/or operating units. These policies apply to all University Affiliates to the extent that they are relevant to the Affiliates' operations, unless an exception is provided by the President or the President's designee, in consultation with the General Counsel.     Policy Applicability   University policies can apply to some or all members of the University Community, including: (a) the Board of Trustees; (b) faculty, including visiting faculty; (c) researchers, including persons conducting research at or under the auspices of the University; (d) employees; (e) volunteers; (f) fellows, trainees and post-doctoral appointees; (g) students; and (h) others who are performing activities or providing services at or under the auspices of the University, including consultants, vendors, and contractors.   Employees engaged in developing University policies must follow the requirements outlined in NYU's Developing University Policies for drafting, approving, and amending University policies.                                                    Policy Global Applicability     University policies apply to the operations and activities of the University regardless of location . As a Global Network University, operating in an expanding international environment, the University will encounter varying laws and business practices when it conducts its affairs outside the United States. When a University policy or a provision of a policy conflicts with the laws in another country, the University seeks to have its operations and activities comply with the laws of that jurisdiction.     Because differences between University policy and foreign laws may not be self-evident and can be complex, whenever there is a question regarding the University's legal responsibilities at locations outside the United States, the Office of General Counsel must be consulted to evaluate and to advise on the appropriate course of action.

The database assures that the NYU community can readily retrieve the most current versions of University policies.     What is a University Policy?     University policies advance our academic mission as an institution of higher education by helping to ensure compliance with applicable laws, ethical norms, and accepted best practices; promoting operational efficiencies; enhancing the opportunities to achieve the University\u2019s goals and reducing institutional risks.     University policies have broad application throughout the University across colleges, schools, institutes and/or operating units. These policies apply to all University Affiliates to the extent that they are relevant to the Affiliates' operations, unless an exception is provided by the President or the President's designee, in consultation with the General Counsel.     Policy Applicability   University policies can apply to some or all members of the University Community, including: (a) the Board of Trustees; (b) faculty, including visiting faculty; (c) researchers, including persons conducting research at or under the auspices of the University; (d) employees; (e) volunteers; (f) fellows, trainees and post-doctoral appointees; (g) students; and (h) others who are performing activities or providing services at or under the auspices of the University, including consultants, vendors, and contractors.   Employees engaged in developing University policies must follow the requirements outlined in NYU's Developing University Policies for drafting, approving, and amending University policies.                                                    Policy Global Applicability     University policies apply to the operations and activities of the University regardless of location . As a Global Network University, operating in an expanding international environment, the University will encounter varying laws and business practices when it conducts its affairs outside the United States. When a University policy or a provision of a policy conflicts with the laws in another country, the University seeks to have its operations and activities comply with the laws of that jurisdiction.     Because differences between University policy and foreign laws may not be self-evident and can be complex, whenever there is a question regarding the University's legal responsibilities at locations outside the United States, the Office of General Counsel must be consulted to evaluate and to advise on the appropriate course of action.

A  full-time schedule normally consists of 16 points per term, or 32 points per  year, which enables a student to complete the entire program of 128 points in  four years. Minimal full-time status entails completing at least 12 points per  term, or 24 points per year. Students who wish to attend part time should obtain  permission from the Office of the Associate Dean for Students, Silver Center,  Room 909; 212-998-8140. Such status will be granted only when there is good and  sufficient reason for part-time study. Failure to complete a minimum of 24  points per year jeopardizes a student\u2019s full-time status. Failure to complete  32 points per year may jeopardize a student\u2019s eligibility to receive financial  aid; students should discuss their situation with the Office of Financial Aid  in the Student Services Center, 25 West Fourth Street.      Students  in good academic standing may register for more than 18 points per term with  the approval and clearance of their academic adviser. Students on academic  probation, however, who wish to register for more than 18 points per term must  obtain the prior approval of the Committee on Undergraduate Academic Standards,  as must any other student wishing to register for more than 20 points.          Change  of Program      To  make any changes in their program, including dropping or adding courses given  in other divisions of the University, students must access Albert via NYUHome  at home.nyu.edu or file a change  of program (\u201cdrop/add\u201d) form with the Office of the Registrar in the Student  Services Center, 25 West Fourth Street.          Adding  Courses      The  deadline for the adding of a course or a section is the end of the second week  of the semester. The deadline applies to any course added by a College of Arts  and Science student and to any College of Arts and Science course added by  students from other divisions. The adding of any course or section after the  end of the second week is generally allowed only when the student is changing  levels within a discipline\u2014for example, from a French or mathematics course to  a higher- or lower-level course in the same discipline. The addition is  permitted only with the written approval of both the instructor and a CAS dean.          Dropping  and Withdrawing from Courses      Students  are expected to maintain a full-time program as described above. Occasionally,  they may withdraw from a course if, because of reasons beyond their control,  they cannot continue. Courses dropped during the first three weeks of the term  will not appear on the transcript. Those dropped from the beginning of the  fourth week through the end of the ninth week of the term will be recorded with  a grade of W. After the ninth week, no one may withdraw from a course. Students  who are ill or have a serious personal problem should see, call, or write to an  adviser in the College Advising Center, College of Arts and Science, New York University,  Silver Center, 100 Washington Square East, Room 905, New York, NY 10003-6688;  212-998-8130.          Complete  Withdrawals      Students  who wish to withdraw from all their courses must make an appointment for an  interview with an adviser in the College Advising Center.      A  student who withdraws officially from all courses in a term may register for  the following term. If the student is unable to attend the College during the  term following the withdrawal, he or she should discuss a leave of absence from  an adviser in the College Advising Center. For more information, see  \u201cattendance,\u201d below.          Auditing      Matriculated  students in the College or in any division of the University (undergraduate or graduate) may audit (i.e., attend lectures without intending to  receive credit) any course in the College with the consent of, and under the  conditions established by, the instructor and the department. Auditors may not  preempt space required for registered students. Courses cannot be audited as a  means of satisfying requirements for an incomplete grade or as a means of  changing a previous grade.      A  student cannot register as an auditor, and audited courses will not appear on  the student\u2019s official transcript. Special (visiting, nondegree) students may not audit  courses.                   ATTENDANCE           Although  the administration of the College does not supervise attendance of classes, it  supports the standards imposed by instructors.      Students  who, in the judgment of the instructor, have not substantially met the  requirements of the course or who have been excessively absent may be  considered to have withdrawn unofficially and may be given the final grade of  F. See \u201cwithdrawing from courses,\u201d above.          Religious  Holidays and Attendance      New  York University, as a nonsectarian institution, adheres to the general policy  of including in its official calendar only certain legal holidays. However, it  has also long been University policy that members of any religious group may,  without penalty, absent themselves from classes when compliance with their  religious obligations requires it. In 1988, the University Senate affirmed this  policy and passed a resolution that elaborated on it as follows:      Students  who anticipate being absent because of any religious observance should,  whenever possible, notify faculty in advance of such anticipated absence.      Whenever  feasible, examinations and assignment deadlines should not be scheduled on  religious holidays. Any student absent from class because of religious beliefs  shall not be penalized for any class, examination, or assignment deadline  missed on that day or days.      If  examinations or assignment deadlines are scheduled, any student who is unable  to attend class because of religious beliefs shall be given the opportunity to  make up that day or days.      No  adverse or prejudicial effects shall result to any student who avails himself  or herself of the above provisions.                     LEAVE  OF ABSENCE           General  Leave      If  a student and an adviser agree that a leave of absence is the best way to  proceed given the student\u2019s situation, the adviser will assist in the  withdrawal from the semester and extended time for a leave of absence. A  student needs to make an appointment with an adviser to discuss his or her  particular situation and review the terms of the leave of absence; please  contact the College Advising Center, Silver Center, Room 905; 212-998-8130.      A  student may request a leave of absence for the fall or spring semester, and must  make his or her request prior to the end of the third week of the semester he  or she wishes to be on leave. A student who requests a leave after that  deadline or who has been out of attendance without first being granted a leave  must apply for readmission. Also note that leaves are not granted retroactively  for past semesters.      There  are no leaves of absence for the summer and January terms, as enrollment during  these terms is not required to maintain matriculation in the College.      A  student granted a leave does not have to make a formal application for  readmission as long as he or she returns to the College within the agreed-upon  time (a maximum of two semesters during a student\u2019s academic career). Students  who attend another college during the leave must petition to have the credits  transferred after they have been approved to return to the College. Petitions  may be obtained at the Office of the Associate Dean for Students, Silver  Center, Room 909; 212-998-8140.      Students  are advised to inquire how the leave of absence may affect their scholarship  and financial aid award and should contact the Office of Financial Aid at 25  West Fourth Street. If students are on probation when the leave is granted,  they will return on probation. Students out of attendance who did not apply for  a leave and who wish to return to the College must apply for readmission. (See  the admission section of this Bulletin.)          Psychological and Medical Leave      If  a student and a counselor or a physician agree that a psychological or medical  leave of absence is the best way to proceed given the situation, the counselor  or physician should make a recommendation to the associate dean for students at  the College for the withdrawal from the semester and extended time for a leave  of absence. A student needs to complete the leave of absence petition form,  which can be obtained at the Office of the Associate Dean for Students, Silver  Center, Room 909; 212-998-8140. Leave of absence petitions are accepted and  reviewed on a rolling basis throughout the academic year.      A  certification of readiness to return to school from a leave of absence form  should be completed by the counselor/therapist or physician, who needs to state  clearly that the student is ready to return and that NYU is a suitable  environment in which to continue his or her academic work. The student must  also schedule an appointment with a counselor/therapist or physician at the NYU  Student Health Center prior to receiving approval from the College to return. A  student granted a leave does not have to make a formal application for  readmission as long as he or she returns to the College within the agreed-upon  time (a maximum of two semesters during a student\u2019s academic career). Students  who attend another college during the leave must petition to have the credits  transferred after they have been approved to return to the College. Petitions  may be obtained at the Office of the Associate Dean for Students, Silver  Center, Room 909; 212-998-8140.      Students  are advised to inquire how the leave of absence may affect their scholarship  and financial aid award and should contact the Office of Financial Aid at 25  West Fourth Street. If students are on probation when the leave is granted,  they will return on probation. Students out of attendance who did not apply for  a leave and who wish to return to the College must apply for readmission. (See  the admission section of this Bulletin.)                CREDIT          Credit  for Advanced Placement, International Baccalaureate, A Level, and Other  Examinations      The  College participates in the Advanced Placement Program of the College Entrance  Examination Board. Students who have taken Advanced Placement exams while in  high school should have the Educational Testing Service in Princeton, N.J.,  forward their official scores to the Office of Undergraduate Admissions, 665  Broadway, 11th Floor, New York, NY 10012-2339.      No  credit is given for AP tests taken after the completion of high school. In most  subjects, if the score received is 4 or 5, credit will be granted. The AP  credit will be lost, however, if a student takes the equivalent course for  credit in the College. For more information, see the \u201cadvanced placement  equivalencies\u201d chart in the admission section of this Bulletin.      For  information on IB, A Level, and the other international examinations for which  CAS awards credit (minimum scores, course equivalencies, etc.), please see  \u201ccredit by examination\u201d and charts in the admission section of this Bulletin.      The  maximum number of credits allowed toward the degree requirements of the College  that are a result of any possible combination of nonresident special  examination programs (plus previous coursework, if applicable and approved)  shall not exceed a total of 32.      College Credit Taken While in High School      Credit may be awarded to students who have completed college courses while in high school, provided they received a grade of \"B\" or better in the courses, an official transcript from the college or university is received, and corresponding courses are offered at NYU. These courses should be taken on a college/university campus, with other college/university students, and taught by a college/university faculty member.      NYU does not grant credit for college courses that are used to satisfy high school graduation requirements.      Students who enter CAS as freshmen can be awarded a maximum of 32 advanced standing credits; this limit includes both credit from AP and other exams and previous college credit.      Credit  for Courses in the College      To  receive credit for a course, the student must register before attending, meet  the requirements for attendance, and creditably complete all examinations and  assignments prescribed by the instructor. For exceptional students, most  departments also offer independent study. The College does not permit students  to register as auditors.          Restrictions on Receiving Credit (Including Course  Repeat Policy)      For  students who matriculate in or are re-admitted to the College of Arts and Science  in fall 2012 and thereafter: A student who has taken a course for  credit or who has obtained a W in a course is permitted to repeat that course  once. Students may not repeat more than two courses during their undergraduate  careers. Students may not repeat courses in a designated sequence after taking  more advanced courses. The departments determine the sequencing of courses.  Students with questions regarding the repetition of courses or course sequences  must consult with the particular department offering the course. When a student  repeats a course, no additional credit will be awarded. Both grades will be  recorded and computed in the grade point average. Courses that a student repeated before internally or externally transferring or transitioning into CAS do not count against the two-course limit. (Students who entered CAS  before fall 2012 should consult this section of the CAS Bulletin for the year  they matriculated in the College to find the course repeat policy applicable to  them.)      A  limited number of credits may be earned by those in the military services who  take correspondence courses in colleges approved by the United States Armed  Forces Institute.      Students  may not be registered at another university at the same time that they are  registered in the College of Arts and Science.          Credit  for Courses at Other Schools and Divisions of New York University      Courses may be taken in the New York University Graduate  School of Arts and Science. 1000-level graduate courses may be taken as  described in the departmental sections of this bulletin, and 2000-level  graduate courses may be taken with written approval of the instructor. If  graduate courses are applied toward the completion of requirements for the  baccalaureate degree, no advanced credit is allowed for them in the Graduate  School of Arts and Science.      It  is also possible for students to take courses in other undergraduate divisions  of New York University and to have credits for these courses applied to the  degree in the College.      Students  may take a total of 16 points in other divisions, including any courses for  particular minors approved by the College. Transfer students should note that  credits for non-liberal-arts courses (e.g., business, applied art, speech)  taken at another institution count as part of the 16 points. Students seeking  additional non-liberal-arts credits beyond the 16-point limit must file a  petition with the Committee on Undergraduate Academic Standards in the Office  of the Associate Dean for Students, Silver Center, Room 909; 212-998-8140.      Please  note that restrictions apply. Courses in other divisions that duplicate the  contents of a College of Arts and Science course do not count toward the  College degree. For details, students must check with an adviser in the College  Advising Center before registering for any courses in other divisions. If a  course is not approved, students will not receive credit for it. Independent  study or internship courses taken in other divisions of the University do not  count toward the College degree. If such courses are taken at schools outside  the University, the credit will not transfer to the College.      Also  excluded from credit toward the degree are any courses taken in the School of  Continuing and Professional Studies, and/or in the Liberal Studies Program, once a student is registered in the  College.      Credit  for online courses will not be counted toward the baccalaureate degree.          Summer  Credits      Once  admitted to the College, students must take all courses here, including those  they need or wish to take during the summer. Exceptions are granted only rarely  and only for good academic reasons. Requests for a waiver should be made by  submitting a petition to the Committee on Undergraduate Academic Standards in  the Office of the Associate Dean for Students, Silver Center, Room 909;  212-998-8140.      Information  about NYU summer course offerings is available during the preceding fall and  spring terms, as is information about dormitory facilities available to  students who usually commute.          Credit  for Independent Study      Most  departments offer independent study courses for students with exceptional  qualifications. In these courses, the work is planned specifically for each  student.      Independent  study courses allow the student to work independently with faculty supervision  and counsel. The courses typically carry variable credit of 2 or 4 points each  term. They are normally limited to upper-class majors but may be open to other  well-qualified students. To register for independent study, a student must have  written approval of the director of undergraduate studies of the department in  which the course is offered. The result of the independent study course should  be a paper or objective, tangible evidence of completion of the work. The  individual departments may grant credit for not more than 8 points of  independent study for work approved in advance. In general, students are not  permitted to take more than 12 points of independent study and/or internship, and  no more than 8 points may be taken in any one department. Internships and/or  independent study courses taken in other divisions of the University or at  other universities do not count toward the College degree.      More  specific information can be found under the individual departmental sections.          Credit  for Transfer Students      Students  are allowed to transfer up to 64 credits to the College and must present official college transcripts. Credits based on  semester hours are accepted from other institutions at face value and are not  altered when they are transferred into the College. Quarter hours will be  converted to semester hours to determine the number of credits transferable to  the College of Arts and Science. Non-liberal-arts credits are not always  transferable, and transfer credit is never awarded for independent study or  internship courses. Only credits for course work taken with a grade of C or  better will be transferred. Courses taken for a pass/fail grade will not  transfer to the College.          Credit  for Non-NYU Study Abroad      Credits  based on semester hours (similar to schools in the United States) are accepted  from institutions abroad at face value and are not altered when the credits  transfer into the College. Often credits from institutions abroad must be  adjusted or converted to correspond to the College\u2019s requirements for awarding  credits. Approval to participate in a non-NYU study abroad is only obtained by  completing an academic proposal. The packet of information required to complete  the proposal is available at the Office of the Associate Dean for Students,  Silver Center, Room 909; 212-998-8140.      When  students receive approval to participate in a non-NYU program abroad, the  specific courses they will take are approved and the number of transfer credits  they will receive are specified.                     EXAMINATIONS  AND GRADES           Missed  and Makeup Examinations      As  noted under \u201cgrades,\u201d below, a student who cannot take the final examination in  a course at the regularly scheduled time may be given the grade of Incomplete.  The student must discuss the reasons for missing the examination with the  instructor and, in the case of illness, must submit a doctor\u2019s note to the  instructor. The student must ask the instructor to give a grade of Incomplete.  Incompletes are not awarded automatically. The time and place of any makeup examinations  are set by the instructor or the department.      Incomplete  grades received because of a missed final examination must be removed within  the semester following the one in which the Incomplete was received. In the  case of students who are out of attendance, such grades must be removed within  one year after the end of the course concerned. A grade of Incomplete that is  not removed within this time limit becomes an F and is computed in the grade  point average. (Regarding the removal of Incompletes received for missed work  other than final examinations, see under \u201cgrades\u201d and \u201cincompletes,\u201d below.)          Grades      Students  may obtain their final grades for each semester on Albert via NYUHome at home.nyu.edu . The parents or  guardian of a student who is a minor (under 18 years of age) may, on a written  request to the Office of the University Registrar, obtain the student\u2019s grades  at any time.      The  following symbols indicating grades are used: A, B, C, D, P, F, and W. The  following symbol indicates incomplete work: I. Only grades of A, B, C, D, or F  earned in any New York University course while matriculated in the College, or  earned in any of the College\u2019s courses (courses suffixed by \u201c-UA\u201d) while  matriculated in another division of the University, are computed in the  average. The following grades may be awarded: A, A-, B+, B, B-, C+, C, C-, D+,  D, F. In general, A indicates excellent work, B indicates good work, C  indicates satisfactory work, and D indicates passable work and is the lowest  passing grade. F indicates failure. The weights assigned in computing the grade  point average are as follows:      A = 4.0      A- = 3.7      B+ = 3.3      B = 3.0      B- = 2.7      C+ = 2.3      C = 2.0      C- = 1.7      D+ = 1.3      D = 1.0      F = 0.0          Computing the Grade Point Average   The  grade point average can be obtained by determining the total of all grade  points earned (quality points) and dividing that figure by the total number of  credit hours completed (quality hours).      For  example: A student who has completed 8 points of A (4.0), 4 points of B (3.0),  and 4 points of C (2.0) has a grade point average of 3.25. This is obtained by  adding 8 (points of A) x 4.0 (point value of A), 4 (points of B) x 3.0 (point  value of B), and 4 (points of C) x 2.0 (point value of C), which totals 52 (the  total of all grade points earned), and then by dividing 52 by 16 (the total  number of credit hours completed). This gives the grade point average of 3.25.          Policies on Assigned Grades   Once a final grade has been submitted by the instructor and recorded on the  transcript, the final grade cannot be changed by turning in additional course  work.      Courses cannot be audited as a  means of satisfying requirements for an incomplete grade or as a means of  changing a previous grade.      To  appeal an assigned grade, the student should first consult with the instructor  who assigned the grade to discuss the grading requirements for the course and  how the grade was determined. If the student is not satisfied with the outcome  of the discussion and wishes to appeal the grade further, a formal written  appeal should be submitted to the chair and/or director of undergraduate  studies in the particular department. An independent review of the grade will  be undertaken by the department. All of the student\u2019s work will be reviewed to  clarify how the grade was determined and to ensure the grade is consistent with  the academic guidelines and policies of the department. The decision of the  department in matters related to a course grade is final.      In  the case of a course that has been repeated, for students who matriculated in  CAS before fall 2012: only the second grade, whether higher or lower, is  computed into the grade point average. The initial grade, however, remains on  the transcript.      In  the case of a course that has been repeated, for students who matriculate in or  are re-admitted to CAS in fall 2012 and thereafter: both grades will be  recorded on the transcript and both grades will be computed in the grade point  average.      The  grades for courses taken abroad in one of New York University\u2019s programs or at  one of the exchange sites are recorded on the transcript and are also included  in the grade point average. The grades for graduate and professional courses  taken at other divisions in the University are included in the grade point  average, provided that permission to enroll is obtained prior to registration  for the courses.      Not  included in the undergraduate grade point average are grades for the first year  of professional courses taken by those students in the three-year accelerated  dental program and grades for work done at institutions other than New York  University (except for exchange sites abroad).          Grade of P   The grade of P (Pass) indicates a passing grade (A, B, C, or D) in a course  taken under the pass/fail option. It is also used to indicate nongraded  courses. The grade of P is not computed in the average. The grade of F under  the pass/fail option is computed in the average. For more information and  procedures to obtain the pass/fail option, see the section \u201cpass/fail option,\u201d  below.          Grade of W   The grade of W indicates an official withdrawal of the student from a course in  good academic standing. Please see \u201cchange of program\u201d and \u201cwithdrawing from  courses,\u201d above, for information on the regulations and procedures for  withdrawing officially from courses.          Grade of I   The grade of I (Incomplete) is a temporary grade that indicates that the  student has, for good reason, not completed all of the course work but that  there is the possibility that the student will eventually pass the course when  all of the requirements have been completed. A student must ask the instructor  for a grade of I, present documented evidence of illness or the equivalent, and  clarify the remaining course requirements with the instructor.      The  incomplete grade is not awarded automatically. It is not used when there is no  possibility that the student will eventually pass the course. Courses cannot be audited as a  means of satisfying requirements for an incomplete grade. If the course  work is not completed after the statutory time for making up incompletes has  elapsed, the temporary grade of I shall become an F and will be computed in the  student\u2019s grade point average.          Incompletes      All  work missed in the fall term must be made up by the end of the following spring  term. All work missed in the spring term or in a summer session must be made up  by the end of the following fall term. Students who are out of attendance in  the semester following the one in which the course was taken have one year to  complete the work. Students should contact the College Advising Center (Silver  Center, Room 905; 212-998-8130) for an extension of incomplete form, which must  be approved by the instructor. Extensions of these time limits are rarely  granted.          Pass/Fail  Option      Students  may elect one pass/fail option each term, including the summer sessions, for a  total of not more than 32 points during their college career. The pass/fail  option is not acceptable for courses completed at other institutions.      The  choice must be made before the completion of the fifth week of the term (second  week of a six-week summer session); after that time, the decision cannot be  initiated or changed. No grade other than P or F will be recorded for those  students choosing this option. P includes the grades of A, B, C, and D and is  not counted in the average. F is counted in the average.      The  pass/fail option is not acceptable in the major, the minor, or any of the  courses taken in fulfillment of the College Core Curriculum requirements.  Students considering the pass/fail option in their area of study or in required  preprofessional courses should consult with their advisers about the effect of  such grades on admission to graduate and professional schools. Students who  change their majors may not be able to use courses taken under the pass/fail  option to satisfy the requirements of their new majors. To declare the  pass/fail option before the end of the fifth week of the semester or the end of the second week of a  six-week summer session, students must consult with an adviser in the College Advising  Center, Silver Center, Room 905; 212-998-8130. Advisers submit the request on  students\u2019 behalf.                     PLACEMENT  EXAMINATIONS, DEGREE PROGRESS, AND TRANSCRIPTS           Placement  Examinations in Foreign Languages      Most  entering students take a placement test prior to their first registration in  the College. Students who took a foreign-language SAT Subject test while in  high school are encouraged to present the score instead of or in addition to  taking the College\u2019s test. (Please consult the table on SAT Subject exams and  the College Core Curriculum in the admission section of this Bulletin.)      Placement  exams for the following languages are accessible online: Cantonese, French,  German, Greek (modern), Hebrew, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Latin, Mandarin  (traditional and simplified), Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, and Tagalog (Filipino). To take an  exam, go to http://cas.nyu.edu/page/placementexams and follow the  appropriate links.      Online  exams in these languages are for placement only, not exemption. Eligibility to  take an in-person, paper exam for exemption from the CAS foreign language  requirement is determined by a student\u2019s score on the online placement exam.      Some languages do not have online placement exams and  are tested on paper: Gaelic (Irish),  arranged through Ireland House; and Arabic, Turkish, Persian, Hindi, and Urdu,  all arranged through the Department of Middle Eastern and Islamic Studies.  These written exams result either in an exemption from the foreign language  requirement (see \u201cforeign language\u201d under College Core Curriculum in this  Bulletin) or in placement into the appropriate-level course.      Whether  online or written, these are reading examinations; students should choose to be  tested in the language in which they have good reading skills.      Placement  into a lower-level course means that the student must continue his or her  studies of that language (or begin a new language) until completion of the  intermediate two level of that language. In some cases, adjustments in  placement may be made during the first weeks of class. Students who place at a  level below that which they have completed at another college  will lose transfer credit if they repeat foreign language course work at the  College of Arts and Science.     A  foreign language examination is required of all entering students with the  following exceptions: students who will begin a language they have not  previously studied; students whose entire secondary schooling was in a language  other than English and other than those languages taught in the College; and  foreign students who complete the sequence of required Expository Writing  courses for international students. Students in these categories should contact  the College Advising Center to verify that they have satisfied the foreign  language requirement.      Information  on foreign language placement and exemption testing can be obtained from the  Office of Academic Affairs, Silver Center, 100 Washington Square East, Room  908; 212-998-8110; http://cas.nyu.edu/page/placementexams .            Placement  Examination in Calculus      Students who intend to register for Calculus I (MATH-UA 121) or  Mathematics for Economics I (MATH-UA 211) and do not meet any of the  prerequisites listed in the mathematics section of this Bulletin must take a  placement exam to determine their readiness to enter calculus. Contact the  Department of Mathematics, 251 Mercer Street; 212-998-3005; http://math.nyu.edu .          Degree  Progress      All  students have access to their degree progress report, as generated by the  Office of the University Registrar, on Albert via NYUHome at home.nyu.edu . It is called \"academic requirements\" and is accessed through the Student Center. The degree  progress report is a Student Information System (SIS) accounting of completed  and remaining degree requirements.          Transcripts  of Record      Unofficial  transcripts are available on Albert, NYU\u2019s Web-based registration and  information system. Albert can be accessed via NYUHome.      Students  requiring a stamped and sealed copy of their New York University records should  request an official copy of their University transcript from the Office of the  University Registrar. Requests for official transcripts require the signature  of the student/alumnus requesting the transcript, unless the student/alumnus  has a valid NetID.      Current  students and graduates with a valid NYU NetID (able to access NYUHome/Albert)  who attended NYU in or after 1990 can request an official transcript from the  Albert Student Center. The Official Transcript form can be found under the My  Academics section of the Student Center.      Alumni  who attended NYU prior to 1990 and have a valid NetID can go to the secure  online transcript request form and log in with their NetID and password. A  signed consent form is not required.      Before  completing their transcript request, current students should check to ensure  that all their grades have been posted. Recent graduates should check to ensure  that their degree has been recorded.      Any  transcript request that requires any special handling must go through the  secure online transcript request form (see above) and cannot be requested on  Albert. Special handling includes: (1) sending transcripts by express mail; (2)  transcripts sent to the student or alumnus in separate sealed envelopes  addressed to admissions offices of other universities; (3) including additional  documents to be sent along with the NYU transcript.      Former  students who no longer have a valid NetID (unable to access NYUHome/Albert) or  who attended New York University prior to 1990 must complete the secure online  transcript request form (see above) and mail/fax the signature page to the  Office of the University Registrar. Alternatively, they may write a letter to  request transcripts and send this to the registrar. A signed consent form is  required. The request letter must include all of the following information: University ID number Current name and any other name under which the graduate attended NYU       Current address      Date of birth School of the University attended Dates of attendance Date of graduation The full name and address of the person or institution to which the transcript  is to be sent     The  request may be faxed to 212-995-4154 or mailed to New York University, Office  of the University Registrar, Academic Records, P.O. Box 910, New York, NY  10276-0910.      There  is never any charge for academic transcripts. Transcripts cannot be produced  for anyone whose record has been put on hold for an outstanding University obligation.          Requesting  Enrollment Verification      Students can view/print their own enrollment  certification directly from Albert using the integrated National Student  Clearinghouse student portal. This feature can be accessed from the \u201crequest  enrollment verification\u201d link in the \u201cmy academics\u201d section of the Student  Center. Eligible students are also able to view/print a good student discount  certificate, which can be mailed to an auto insurer or any other company that  requests proof of status as a good student (based on the cumulative GPA).      Verification  of enrollment or graduation may also be requested by submitting a signed letter  with the following information: University ID number Current name and any name under which the student or graduate attended NYU Current address Date of birth School of the University attended Dates attended Date of graduation The full name and address of the person or institution to which the  verification is to be sent     The  request may be mailed to New York University, Office of the University  Registrar, Enrollment Verification and Graduation, P.O. Box 910, New York, NY  10276-0910. Alternatively, signed requests may be faxed to 212-995-4154. The  registrar does not accept requests for certification by e-mail.          Arrears  Policy      The  University reserves the right to deny registration and withhold all information  regarding the record of any student who is in arrears in the payment of  tuition, fees, loans, or other charges (including charges for housing, dining,  or other activities or services) for as long as any arrears remain.          Diploma  Arrears Policy      Diplomas  of students in arrears will be held until their financial obligations to the  University are fulfilled and they have been cleared by the bursar. Graduates  with a diploma hold may contact the Office of the Bursar at 212-998-2806 to  clear arrears or to discuss their financial status at the University.          Diploma  Application      Students  may officially graduate in September, January, or May. The all-University  Commencement ceremony is held in May. The College holds a baccalaureate  ceremony in May. Students must apply for graduation on Albert, and they must be  enrolled for either course work, leave of absence, or maintenance of  matriculation during their final semester.      To  graduate in a specific semester, students must apply for graduation within the  application deadline period indicated on the calendar available at the Office  of the University Registrar\u2019s web page. It is recommended that students apply  for graduation no later than the beginning of the semester in which they plan  to complete all program requirements. Students who do not successfully complete  all academic requirements by the end of that semester must reapply for  graduation for the following cycle.                     ACADEMIC  STANDARDS AND DISCIPLINE           Academic  Standards      The  Committee on Undergraduate Academic Standards reviews student records  throughout the academic year. All of its actions are based on the grades to  date at the end of the term.          Academic Alert      Students  with cumulative grade point averages of 2.0 to 2.25 will receive an academic  alert letter reflecting the committee\u2019s specific recommendations for achieving  an appropriate standard for academic performance.          Academic Probation      Any  student whose record is deemed unsatisfactory will be placed on academic  probation and will be so informed by letter. A record will be deemed  unsatisfactory if, in any semester, the cumulative or semester grade point  average falls below 2.0 or if it fails to show steady and substantial progress  toward the degree. Steady and substantial progress toward the degree entails  the completion, with satisfactory grades, of more than half of the courses (and  points) for which a student registers in any semester. In addition, it entails  satisfactory progress in the student\u2019s major.      Failure  to satisfy the conditions of probation will result in further academic  sanctions and possibly dismissal from the College. The conditions usually  require that the student (a) achieve a grade point average of at least 2.0  during the term he or she is on probation, (b) not receive any grade below a C  or any grade of I, and (c) not withdraw from any course without securing the  permission of the Committee on Undergraduate Academic Standards prior to the  withdrawal. Students on academic probation are also required to have a special  probation interview with an adviser in the College Advising Center to receive  registration clearance for the next semester. More specific requirements may be  imposed.      The  Committee on Undergraduate Academic Standards may summon students with  unsatisfactory records to discuss their problems and to determine whether and  under what conditions they may continue in the College. In special  circumstances, the committee may recommend to the dean that students may be  granted or placed on leave for a period not to exceed two semesters.      Students  on academic probation may not engage in any extracurricular activities (except  for departmental clubs) and may not hold office in these clubs without the  approval of the Committee on Undergraduate Academic Standards.      Students  on academic probation should be aware that they are usually ineligible for  financial aid.          Academic Dismissal      Students  who are dismissed from the College for poor academic performance will be  informed via e-mail two to three weeks after their most recent grades are  posted for the enrolled semester. Students who have paid tuition for the next  term at the time of dismissal will receive a full refund of tuition and fees.          Academic  Integrity      Community of the Mind      The College is a \u201ccommunity of the mind.\u201d Its students, faculty, and staff all  share the goal of pursuing truth through free and open inquiry, and we support  one another\u2019s endeavors in this regard. As in any community, membership comes  with certain rights and responsibilities. Foremost among these is academic  integrity. Cheating on an exam, falsifying data, or having someone else write a  paper undermines others who are \u201cdoing it on their own\u201d; it makes it difficult  or impossible to assess fairly a student\u2019s interest, aptitude, and achievement;  and it diminishes the cheater, depriving him or her of an education. Most  important, academic dishonesty is a violation of the very principles upon which  the academy is founded. For this reason, violations of these principles are  treated with the utmost seriousness.          College of Arts and Science Honor Code    As a student in the College of Arts and Science at New York University, you  belong to a community of scholars who value free and open inquiry. Honest  assessment of ideas and their sources is the foundation of what we do.      Our  University is a community of mutual trust and respect in which personal  prejudice has no part in the critical evaluation of ideas. It is a place  where differences of opinion can be subjected to deliberate and reasonable  examination without animus.      As  scholars, it is therefore as a matter of honor and good repute that we each  commit ourselves to assuring the integrity of our academic community and of the  educational pursuits we undertake together.      As  a student in the College, I pledge that: I shall perform honestly all my academic obligations. I will not  represent the words, works, or ideas of others as my own; will not cheat; and  will not seek to mislead faculty or other academic officers in their evaluation  of my course work or in any other academic affairs. I shall behave with decorum and civility, and with respectful regard for all  members of the University\u2014faculty, staff, and fellow students\u2014our guests, and  members of our wider communities. I shall abide by the College and by the University rules of conduct and  policies on academic integrity and by the special requirements of any  individual course of study or other academic activity. I shall endeavor earnestly to uphold the values, standards, and ideals on which  our University community depends and call on others to do so.          Discipline: College of Arts and Science Rules and Procedures on Student Misconduct        Approved by the Faculty of Arts and Science April 21, 2014      New York University is a community of scholars who value free and open inquiry. Our work depends on honest assessment of ideas and their sources; and we expect all members of our community to maintain the highest integrity in their academic work. As scholars committed to the critical evaluation of ideas, free of personal prejudice, we also have an obligation to one other to create an educational atmosphere of mutual trust and respect in which differences of opinion can be subjected to deliberate and reasonable examination without animus. Because of the central importance of these values to our intellectual life together, students who fail to maintain them will be subject to disciplinary sanction, which may include dismissal from the University.        Disciplinary offenses include but are not limited to:      \u2022 cheating, plagiarism, falsification of data or sources, forgery of academic documents in attempt to defraud;    \u2022 destruction, theft, or unauthorized use of laboratory data, library or research materials, computer resources, or university property;    \u2022 disruption of academic events or interference with access to classrooms, laboratories, or academic offices;    \u2022 actual or threatened violence against, or sexual assault or harassment of a student, instructor, staff member, or administrator.      The following penalties may be imposed by the faculty for disciplinary infractions:      \u2022 Warning    \u2022 Disciplinary Probation    \u2022 Suspension    \u2022 Dismissal      Complete statements of the rules and procedures for adjudicating disciplinary complaints concerning students in the College are available from the Office of the Associate Dean for Students and on the website of the College of Arts and Science.        Rules and Procedures      1. General Principles      a) Student conduct that violates the College of Arts and Science Honor Code, University-wide student conduct policies, and/or student conduct policies established by portal campuses, global academic sites, or administrative offices of the University may be subject to disciplinary action in accordance with established CAS and University procedures.    b) Student misconduct includes academic misconduct, such as plagiarism, cheating, and possession of or use of any prohibited notes, reference resources, or data processing or other devices in any class or examination, and behavioral misconduct, such as forgery of academic documents in attempt to defraud; destruction, misuse, or theft of University resources; disruption of classes or other academic events, or University administrative operations; acts of violence; and sexual assault and harassment.    c) In cases of academic misconduct, evaluation of the student\u2019s academic performance is distinguished from disciplinary adjudication of the offense. The question of what grade the student\u2019s work should earn is distinct from that about whether a disciplinary sanction should also be imposed. When a student is found to have engaged in academic misconduct, the instructor may reduce the student\u2019s grade for the assignment or for the course as a whole; however, such a determination is an academic judgment made by the instructor in accord with the expectations of the department or program offering the course and is not a form of disciplinary sanction. The question of whether a disciplinary sanction should also be imposed is separate from this academic determination, as specified in the procedures described herein.      2. Academic Misconduct\u2014Academic Review      a) When it is believed that violations of academic integrity may have occurred it is within the discretion of the faculty member to address the matter informally with the student should the infraction be judged insubstantial or should the evidence be inconclusive. In such cases the faculty member may determine that no grade reduction is warranted.    b) Should the faculty member judge the violation substantial and well supported by the evidence, he or she may, with the assent of the Director of Undergraduate Studies (or, if the Director of Undergraduate Studies is the instructor, with the chair or another academic director in the department or program, or if the department or program should be too small, in an ad hoc consultation with a chair or academic director of another department or program from the same academic division) reduce the student\u2019s grade or assign the student a failing grade for the assignment in question or for the course as a whole. This grade reduction only reflects the student\u2019s failure creditably to complete the academic requirements in question and is not a disciplinary sanction. The grade reduction should be proportional to the size and weight of the incident of academic misconduct among all requirements for the course and appropriate to the level at which the course is offered.    c) In order to better educate the student about the CAS standards for academic integrity, the faculty member and/or the Director of Undergraduate Studies should meet with the student to discuss the nature of the offense and the action taken. This responsibility of the faculty should not be delegated to recitation or laboratory instructors or other course assistants.    d) For incidents of academic misconduct, the student\u2019s appeal of the grade reduction is limited to departmental review conducted by the Director of Undergraduate Studies and/or the Department Chair, as specified in the CAS policy for grade appeals. The review will be limited to the question of whether the reduction in grade was made fairly and in keeping with the expectations of the department or program.    e) The decision of the department or program on the student\u2019s appeal is final.      3. Academic Misconduct\u2014Reporting and Disciplinary Referral      a) In all instances in which there has been a finding that a CAS student committed a substantial violation of academic integrity standards of CAS or of any of its departments or programs, the Director of Undergraduate Studies will inform the student within seven (7) calendar days in writing and/or via email of any action taken and send copies of this letter to the CAS Associate Dean for Students, the faculty member, and the Department Chair or Program Director. The letter will include the nature of the violation, any resulting reduction in grade, and notice of the student\u2019s right to appeal. A copy of the correspondence and the evidence of the violation shall be kept in a confidential file maintained by the Director of Undergraduate Studies.    b) The Director of Undergraduate Studies will also within seven (7) calendar days inform the CAS Associate Dean for Students in writing and/or via email of the student\u2019s violation, forward to the dean the evidence of the violation, and send a copy of the correspondence to the faculty member and to the Department Chair or Program Director.    c) If this is the student\u2019s first incident of academic misconduct, the Associate Dean for Students will send the student a warning letter indicating that a suspension or a more severe penalty may result from a second academic integrity offense of any kind.    d) If this is the student\u2019s second or further incident of academic misconduct, the Associate Dean for Students will meet with the student, discuss the evidence of academic misconduct, and provide the student an opportunity to respond. The student will be informed of his or her right to accept or reject a resolution by the Associate Dean. After considering all relevant information, the Associate Dean may offer the student terms upon which CAS is willing to resolve the matter, which may include imposition of a disciplinary sanction. Where the student and the Associate Dean agree to terms in writing, a binding consensual resolution will exist between the student and CAS. Where the Associate Dean is unable to resolve the complaint by consensual resolution, the matter will be referred to the Committee on Student Discipline.    e) In all instances in which there has been a finding that a non-CAS student committed a substantial violation of academic integrity standards of CAS or of any of its departments or programs, the Director of Undergraduate Studies will proceed in accord with the procedures under (a) and (b), except that notice will be made instead to the Dean of Students of the student\u2019s school.      4. Behavioral Misconduct      a) Complaints of student behavioral misconduct should be made in writing to the CAS Associate Dean for Students. When such a complaint is received, the Associate Dean will notify the student of the complaint and investigate the matter. In cases of students who have transferred internally among divisions of the University, the dean will query the student\u2019s prior school(s) concerning their disciplinary records for the student, if any.    b) The Associate Dean of Students will meet with the student against whom the complaint has been filed, describe the complaint, and offer the student an opportunity to respond. The student will be informed of his or her right to accept or reject a resolution by the Associate Dean. After considering all relevant information, the Associate Dean may offer the student terms upon which CAS is willing to resolve the matter, which may include imposition of a disciplinary sanction. Where the student and the Associate Dean agree to terms in writing, a binding consensual resolution will exist between the student and CAS. Where the Associate Dean is unable to resolve the complaint by consensual resolution, the matter will be referred to the Committee on Student Discipline.    c) Ordinarily, if the misconduct is a student\u2019s first offense at the University and does not warrant further disciplinary sanction, the student will be offered the opportunity to continue in CAS under written warning that a one-semester suspension or a more severe penalty may result from a second disciplinary offense of any kind.        Discipline: Definitions of Sanctions        Approved by the Faculty of Arts and Science April 21, 2014          Warning: Written reprimand, including notice that a one-semester suspension or a more severe penalty may result from a second disciplinary offense within the period of the censure specified in the letter of reprimand.           Disciplinary Probation: Suspension of privileges or exclusion fromparticipation in extracurricular University activities as set forth in thenotice of disciplinary probation for a specified period of time.          Suspension: Exclusion from classes as well as suspension of privileges and exclusion from other activities as set forth in the notice of suspension for a definite period of time. A student who has been suspended and against whom charges are dismissed or not sustained will be allowed full opportunity to make up whatever work was missed due to the suspension.      Dismissal: Termination of student status for an indefinite period. The conditions for readmission, if any are permitted, will be stated in the order of dismissal.        STUDENT GRIEVANCE   Students in the College of Arts and Science are referred to the \u201cstudent  grievance procedure\u201d applicable to all the schools of New York University as  found in the NYU Student\u2019s Guide. The College adheres to all articles of the \u201cstudent  grievance procedure\u201d as set forth in the \u201cUniversity Policies and Procedures\u201d  section of the NYU Student\u2019s Guide.                   PETITIONS           The  Faculty Committee on Undergraduate Academic Standards will consider petitions  from students to waive requirements or modify policies and regulations of the  College. Students should be aware that only very exceptional cases, supported  by valid and documented reasons, will be considered. After deliberation, the  committee\u2019s decisions on such matters are final. Petition forms may be obtained  in the Office of the Associate Dean for Students, Silver Center, Room 909;  212-998-8140.                   UNIVERSITY  POLICIES AND CAMPUS SAFETY               University  Policy on Patents      Students  offered research opportunities are reminded that inventions arising from  participation in such research are governed by the University\u2019s \u201cstatement of  policy on patents,\u201d a copy of which may be found in the Faculty Handbook or  obtained from the dean\u2019s office.          Immunization  Requirements      New  York State Public Health Law (NYS PHL) 2165 requires all students registering  for 6 or more credits in a degree-granting program to provide immunization  documentation for measles (rubeola), mumps, and rubella (German measles) prior  to registration. Students born before January 1, 1957, are exempt. New students  should complete the MMR section of the student health history form. Continuing  students should complete and submit a student immunization record form.      New  York State Public Health Law (NYS PHL) 2167 requires that all students registered  for 6 or more credits submit a meningitis response form as formal confirmation  of their decision as to whether or not to be immunized with the meningococcal  (meningitis) vaccine. New students should complete the meningitis response  section of the student health history form. Continuing students should complete  and submit a meningitis response form.      Failure  to comply with state immunization laws will prevent NYU students from  registering for classes. In addition to these requirements, the NYU Student Health  Center recommends that students also consider hepatitis B and varicella  immunizations. Students should discuss immunization options with their primary  care provider.          Campus  Safety      The  Department of Public Safety is located at 14 Washington Place; telephone:  212-998-2222; 212-998-2220 (TTY).      New  York University\u2019s annual campus security report includes statistics for the  previous three years concerning reported crimes that occurred on campus, in  certain off-campus buildings or property owned or controlled by NYU, and on  public property within or immediately adjacent to the campus. The report also  includes institutional policies concerning campus security, such as policies  concerning sexual assault, drugs, and alcohol. Students may obtain a copy of  the current report by contacting Thomas Grace, Director of Judicial Affairs and  Compliance, Office of the Vice President for Student Affairs (601 Kimmel  Center: 212-998-4403), or Jay Zwicker, Crime Prevention Manager, Department of  Public Safety (7 Washington Place: 212-998-1451), or by visiting the following  website: www.nyu.edu/public.safety/policies .          New  York University Weapons Policy      New  York University strictly prohibits the possession of all weapons, as described  in local, state, and federal statutes, including, but not limited to, firearms,  knives, and explosives, in and/or around any and all University  facilities\u2014academic, residential, or others. This prohibition extends to all  buildings\u2014whether owned, leased, or controlled by the University, regardless of  whether the bearer or possessor is licensed to carry that weapon. The  possession of any weapon has the potential of creating a dangerous situation  for the bearer and others.      The  only exceptions to this policy are duly authorized law enforcement personnel  who are performing official federal, state, or local business and instances in  which the bearer of the weapon is licensed by an appropriate licensing  authority and has received written permission from the executive vice president  of the University.          New  York University Simulated Firearm Policy      New  York University strictly prohibits simulated firearms in and/or around any and  all University facilities\u2014academic, residential, or other. This prohibition  extends to all buildings\u2014whether owned, leased, or controlled by the  University. The possession of a simulated firearm has the potential of creating  a dangerous situation for the bearer and others.      The  only exceptions to this policy are instances in which (1) the bearer is in  possession of written permission from a dean, associate dean, assistant dean,  or department head and (2) such possession or use of simulated firearms is  directly connected to a University- or school-related event (e.g., play, film  production). Whenever an approved simulated firearm is transported from one  location to another, it must be placed in a secure container in such a manner  that it cannot be observed. Storage of approved simulated firearms shall be the  responsibility of the Department of Public Safety in a location designated by the  vice president for public safety. Under no circumstances, other than at a  Public Safety storage area, may approved simulated firearms be stored in any  University-owned, -leased, or -controlled facilities.
