4-6pm    Description: This course will focus on the collaborative interdisciplinary remediation of singers by vocologists (speech language pathologist &amp; singing teachers), &amp; otolaryngologists. Through master clinician demonstrations, student led discussions, &amp; hands on voice training experience, student clinicians will work as a team to evaluate, develop, implement, &amp; critique the effectiveness of the training/treatment. Students will use evidence based practice, discipline specific vocal exercises, &amp; approaches to heighten efficiency of the vocal mechanism in order to reduce effort. Psychological aspects of voice use as well as body awareness will be discussed to aid in the promotion of sustainable production of voice in both speech &amp; singing.    For more information regarding professors and meeting times, students can use Albert directly.

(speech language pathologist &amp; singing teachers), &amp; otolaryngologists. Through master clinician demonstrations, student led discussions, &amp; hands on voice training experience, student clinicians will work as a team to evaluate, develop, implement, &amp; critique the effectiveness of the training/treatment. Students will use evidence based practice, discipline specific vocal exercises, &amp; approaches to heighten efficiency of the vocal mechanism in order to reduce effort. Psychological aspects of voice use as well as body awareness will be discussed to aid in the promotion of sustainable production of voice in both speech &amp; singing.    For more information regarding professors and meeting times, students can use Albert directly. The course can be found under both the Department of Communcative Sciences and Disorders and the Department of Music and Performing Arts Professions.
