Undergraduate Students  Graduate Students     Undergraduate Students    Auditioning/Interviewing for Jazz Studies at NYU is a positive and valuable experience. We have designed a unique audition/interview structure for undergraduates through which you will be immersed in the world of NYU jazz by participating in various musical activities.    The interview and audition process in Jazz at NYU is an opportunity for you to introduce yourself to faculty who wish to be advocates and want to provide an environment in which you can demonstrate your full potential. You will meet and play with some of today's most prominent figures in the jazz industry. We don't believe that your potential as a jazz artist can be assessed in a traditional audition format. Therefore, far from a sterile audition environment, at NYU you will be experiencing our community in a much richer and more meaningful way. Always remember that your task is to share your talents - not to impress the auditors.    How/When do I send in audition materials for the program?    Send video recorded materials:    All undergraduate applicants - freshmen and transfers &ndash; must send the link to a pre-screening video upladed to YouTube. Subsequent to this pre-screening of your video performance, in-person audition and interview invitations will be issued if appropriate.    All pre-screening videos are to be submitted online ( instructions here ) and must arrive by the dates listed below. Materials submitted after these dates may not be accepted. Please remember to attach the information sheet to your email with your YouTube video submission.

All applicants are required to submit a video recording (online video submission via YouTube, instructions here ) of up to four contrasting standard tunes as follows:    Required Repertoire    1) Blues in F: &ldquo;Billie&rsquo;s Bounce&rdquo; (Charlie Parker) 2) Minor blues: \"Footprints\" (Wayne Shorter) 3) Your choice of an up tempo standard 4) Your choice of an original composition (optional)    Please remember to attach the jazz studies information sheet to your email with your YouTube video submission.    You will receive an email notification that your materials have been received. After those materials have been reviewed, you will be contacted if additional information is required. At that point selected applicants will be asked to schedule an on-campus interview/audition for which you must prepare according to the guidelines below. If you cannot travel to New York, you may choose to use only your online video for consideration.    If I am invited to New York, what do I prepare for my in person Interview/Audition?    Three (3) Contrasting tunes selected from the Standard jazz repertoire.    These should be tunes that you can &ldquo;call&rdquo; in a jam session setting. You should stick to swing, ballad, Brazilian, Afro-Cuban or Afro-Peruvian grooves. Avoid rock, funk or pop music (while these styles are valid and we teach them at NYU, for auditions and interviews we prefer to hear you on standard repertoire as described above).    The session: The audition will take place in a jam session setting. You will be in a group of about 20 students. NYU faculty and current NYU students will also participate in a supportive and friendly environment. You will play, listen and call tunes. The process will last about two hours and you will be immersed the entire time.    What do I bring to my Interview/Audition?    Bring an open mind and positive attitude. You should bring your instrument unless you are a drum set player in which case a drum kit will be provided (feel free to bring your own cymbals). Double basses cannot be provided.    What should I expect at my audition?    Other musicians: You will be immersed in the live audition at NYU for at least two hours. In addition you will have the opportunity to talk to faculty and current students in a social meal setting afterward.    Questions: The faculty may decide to ask you questions about your training, your experience, and your goals. This is done in an attempt to get to know you better and to take advantage of our time together. You should feel free to also ask questions to everyone you meet in order to determine if NYU is the right place for you. Coaching &amp; Direction: The faculty member leading any particular session may suggest that you make some adjustments or solo or changes using a particular approach or technique. This is done in order to determine how readily and receptively you work with instruction and how well you &ldquo;think on your feet&rdquo; as a jazz artist. Just stay alert, use your common sense and you will do fine.    Graduate Students    Graduate (masters) applicants must send an online audition video recording with the required repertoire.

Undergraduate Students  Graduate Students     Undergraduate Students    Auditioning/Interviewing for Jazz Studies at NYU is a positive and valuable experience. We have designed a unique audition/interview structure for undergraduates through which you will be immersed in the world of NYU jazz by participating in various musical activities.    The interview and audition process in Jazz at NYU is an opportunity for you to introduce yourself to faculty who wish to be advocates and want to provide an environment in which you can demonstrate your full potential. You will meet and play with some of today's most prominent figures in the jazz industry. We don't believe that your potential as a jazz artist can be assessed in a traditional audition format. Therefore, far from a sterile audition environment, at NYU you will be experiencing our community in a much richer and more meaningful way. Always remember that your task is to share your talents - not to impress the auditors.    How/When do I send in audition materials for the program?    Send video recorded materials:    All undergraduate applicants - freshmen and transfers &ndash; must send the link to a pre-screening video upladed to YouTube. Subsequent to this pre-screening of your video performance, in-person audition and interview invitations will be issued if appropriate.    All pre-screening videos are to be submitted online ( instructions here ) and must arrive by the dates listed below. Materials submitted after these dates may not be accepted. Please remember to attach the information sheet to your email with your YouTube video submission.

All applicants are required to submit a video recording (online video submission via YouTube, instructions here ) of up to four contrasting standard tunes as follows:    Required Repertoire    1) Blues in F: &ldquo;Billie&rsquo;s Bounce&rdquo; (Charlie Parker) 2) Minor blues: \"Footprints\" (Wayne Shorter) 3) Your choice of an up tempo standard 4) Your choice of an original composition (optional)    Please remember to attach the jazz studies information sheet to your email with your YouTube video submission.

At that point selected applicants will be asked to schedule an on-campus interview/audition for which you must prepare according to the guidelines below. If you cannot travel to New York, you may choose to use only your online video for consideration.    If I am invited to New York, what do I prepare for my in person Interview/Audition?    Three (3) Contrasting tunes selected from the Standard jazz repertoire.    These should be tunes that you can &ldquo;call&rdquo; in a jam session setting. You should stick to swing, ballad, Brazilian, Afro-Cuban or Afro-Peruvian grooves. Avoid rock, funk or pop music (while these styles are valid and we teach them at NYU, for auditions and interviews we prefer to hear you on standard repertoire as described above).    The session: The audition will take place in a jam session setting. You will be in a group of about 20 students. NYU faculty and current NYU students will also participate in a supportive and friendly environment. You will play, listen and call tunes. The process will last about two hours and you will be immersed the entire time.    What do I bring to my Interview/Audition?    Bring an open mind and positive attitude. You should bring your instrument unless you are a drum set player in which case a drum kit will be provided (feel free to bring your own cymbals). Double basses cannot be provided.    What should I expect at my audition?    Other musicians: You will be immersed in the live audition at NYU for at least two hours. In addition you will have the opportunity to talk to faculty and current students in a social meal setting afterward.    Questions: The faculty may decide to ask you questions about your training, your experience, and your goals.
