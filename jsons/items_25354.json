Our graduates have the reputation of being creative muses and innovative choreographers; they perform with world-class dance companies and choreographers, appear on Broadway, at Radio City Music Hall, at The Metropolitan Opera, striking a balance between concert and commercial dance. The Master\u2019s degree program is an opportunity for individuals to further their education in dance through physical and academic immersion. Unlike many graduate dance programs, Tisch Dance does not require that applicants have a degree in dance or a dance related field, creating a unique environment where students approach dance in a fresh and innovative manner, using their individual knowledge and experience to expand and explore existing notions of dance and choreography. The graduate program at Tisch Dance seeks to empower individuals with the ideals that dance is not simply a physical endeavor, but a life-long investigation of individual growth and creativity.    Technique, Academic Dance Course Work, and Creative Research The Dance Department at Tisch has a strong technical base, requiring all Master\u2019s students to participate in daily ballet and contemporary technique classes; these classes are divided into multiple levels in which graduate students combine with undergraduates (class combining occurs only in technique classes). Additional technique courses include: contemporary and classical partnering, pointe work, men\u2019s class, Yoga, Pilates and other somatic practices. The physical rigor of the program insures that students maintain the highest level of technical practice while simultaneously providing them opportunities to apply newly acquired knowledge from other dance and academic courses.    In addition to technique classes, graduate students also study music history and theory, dance history, anatomy, acting, critical thinking and analysis of dance, and collaborative practices. These courses provide graduate students the opportunity to research and analyze dance in a critical manner, challenging them to explore new areas of dance study. In their second year of study students have the option of taking elective courses in dance and new media, music composition, pedagogy, musical collaboration, and lighting design. These courses provide students a comprehensive understanding of the multi-faceted nature of dance and allow them to tailor the program to their individual interests.    Graduate students are also provided the opportunity to take special workshops in dance administration led by Allyson Green, Associate Dean of the Institute of Performing Arts at NYU, and Dana Witco, Assistant Director of the Institute of Performing Arts at NYU. These classes introduce graduate students to the administrative end of the art world, with topics that include: marketing skills, grant making, artist statements, and how to acquire resources for dance-making.    A key component of the Master\u2019s program at Tisch is dance composition, required for all students, which is taken throughout the two year program. This course, taught by leading professionals in the New York dance community, combines elements of composition and improvisation and strives to break down preconceived notions of choreography to discover the individual\u2019s unique choreographic voice.    Second Avenue Dance Company The final year of study culminates in a modeled professional experience in our resident performing ensemble, the Second Avenue Dance Company (SADC). SADC functions as Tisch Dance\u2019s professional dance company, operating independently from students in their first years of study. Each year, four noteworthy guest choreographers are engaged to create new work or set existing master works, providing students a professional experience and allowing them to explore new styles of dance. In addition to performing work by guest choreographers, students also develop their own choreography, all of which is showcased in four concerts throughout their SADC year.    Performance The Dance Department produces twelve concerts each year, a total of 38 nights of performances and upwards of 75 student pieces each year, affording students numerous opportunities to perform and choreograph. Each concert is supervised by one of our experienced faculty, with whom students work closely to craft their work and bring their artistic vision to life. Graduate students produce two concerts each year, in which only work choreographed by either the first or second year Master\u2019s students is presented, exhibiting to the school and the New York dance community the caliber of originality and innovation of our graduate students. All performances are produced in a theater with full lights and costumes, allowing students to build a repertoire and gain experience as performers.   Training Program M.F.A.

The politics that art makes. This is an opportunity for artists and those working in the intellectual and institutional domains of art to enhance and elaborate the value and significance of their creative endeavors through intensive study, reflection, and engagement with the university and the world. Based at Tisch, the program combines a dedicated core faculty with access to faculty and courses from five different schools at New York University.    Students who undertake this advanced course of study will gain a broad understanding of the issues and the skills required to make their ideas work in practice. They will be well placed to assume a leadership role in creating new institutional venues and public forums for creative work with their publics and for deepening an understanding of how art enriches social life. Students will be encouraged to become advocates for the arts from within the arts. The program will provide a deep grasp of what makes art necessary\u2014both aesthetically and socially\u2014and what constrains its expression and development. They will complicate received notions of access to the arts and the artist\u2019s social responsibility.    New York University is already renowned for producing precisely this kind of independent creative intelligence oriented toward making a mark in the world. Drawing on a diverse faculty across School and departmental lines, a dedicated core faculty, and special visiting faculty, the program avails itself of rich resources and its location in a global cultural center. Students will learn to blend esthetic and social innovation in close connection with various art worlds. They will be able to work collaboratively across disciplinary lines with a robust integration of creative talent and critical acumen. The goal of the program is to train unique arts activists\u2014capable of activating critical and creative dialogue between art and world and committed to reshaping how art is produced, perceived, and received.    \u2026the relation between art and society and the role of the artist in civic life.    The M.A. in Arts Politics Program provides a critical and analytic setting in which artists and others with a social commitment to the arts can develop the means for an appraisal of the political implications and social significance of their work. The program combines an administrative home within the Tisch School of the Arts with partnerships across other NYU schools to offer a spectrum of interdisciplinary courses. The curriculum examines, in an activist key, the relation between art and society and the role of the artist in civic life. Art is treated as providing a particular lens through which the social world can be understood and as a medium of cultural intervention in political processes.    The M.A. program combines core courses with relevant electives drawn from across the University. Students attend classes with those who have related arts interests in other University areas and come together to critically reflect on the discourses and practical strategies that issue from the ability of art to intervene in and transform the social world. Arts politics considers art as both a way of knowing and a kind of action, as an invitation to claim artistic citizenship and a means to democratize the public sphere.    Arts politics attends to both formal and informal political processes that bear on the production, dissemination, and reception of the arts. It integrates approaches from the humanities, social sciences, and the arts themselves. It studies governmental and policy processes and the institutional ecology and political economy of the arts. It employs perspectives that understand how to decode cultural meanings, how social movements are formed, and how to read the aesthetic dimension of contemporary politics. Through official patronage and censorship, celebration and loathing, affirmation and critique of prevailing values, art has long been imbricated and implicated in the political. Yet arts politics is never fixed; its historical and cross-cultural variations help us understand what possibilities exist for civically engaged artists working in the present.    In the United States, cultural policy is typically seen as being weakly developed, and the skills artists use to get their work into the world often frequently rest on tacit knowledge. Art is rarely bestowed with official status or sanction, which can make its social or political impact all the more challenging to discern. Given the often-subtle ways in which art interacts with and acts upon the social world, the political value and efficacy of art can be difficult to assess. Alternately, when art itself is grasped epistemologically, as a way of knowing the world, a distinctive array of art\u2019s social effects becomes legible.    Curriculum    The M.A. is an intensive one year (two semester) program in which students take 18 credits per semester. The curriculum requires four specific courses for this program. They are \u201cIssues in Arts Politics,\u201d \u201cSeminar in Arts Activism,\u201d \u201cGraduate Colloquium,\u201d and \u201cGraduate Fieldwork.\u201d Students also enroll in at least two electives offered through the Department of Art and Public Policy during the course of the academic year. In addition, students must take up to 16 points of electives drawn from a University-wide list of linked course offerings, including advanced course work in art and public policy. Enrollment in the program will remain small, so that there is room in the core courses for students from other programs at the University. Program electives are courses from around the University that are already on the books, and the respective departments have already agreed to admit arts politics students (subject to permission of the individual instructor).    Issues in Arts Politics    This seminar aims to give students both a conceptual and practical grounding in the range of issues and approaches by which arts politics can be understood. The course will be framed by the following considerations: What are the institutional, discursive, and ideological contexts that shape the objects, images, sounds or texts we call \u201cart?\u201d What are the links between cultural spaces-- the museum, the movie-theater, the gallery, the music/dance hall, the bookstore, the fashion runway, the public street, television, cyber space-- and the larger realm of politics? And how do these relationships impact, implicitly or explicitly, the ways we create, curate, or study the arts? How do consumers play an active role in the reception of cultural products? What is the relation between formally promulgated cultural policy and the tacit knowledge that artists call upon to get their work into the world? What dimensions of the broader cultural terrain are made legible through artistic practice? What are the means through which art intervenes in the political arena? \u201cArt\u201d will be studied as a site of contested representations and visions, emb edded in power formations-- themselves shaped by specific historical moments and geographical locations. Given contemporary global technologies, cultural practices will also be studied within the transnational \u201ctravel\u201d of ideas and people. Such germane issues as the legal and constitutional dimensions of censorship, the social formation of taste, the consumption of stars, the bio-politics of the body, transnational copyrights law-- will all pass through an intersectional analyses of gender, race, class, sexuality, ethnicity, religion, and nation, incorporating the insights of such areas of inquiry as multiculturalism, feminism, postcolonialism, and queer studies. The first half of the course is explores certain key conceptual issues and the second half examines practical applications. Specific examples are provided through student presentations.    Seminar in Arts Activism    This seminar will focus on developing our work, theory, and art into a realized production. Each student will start with presenting his or her ideas and goals of creating a public project. This may take the form of public art, exhibition, performance, narrative but bringing it to a goal of actualizing the work out of the school student world. But the class is more than just bringing the art into the public light. We will scrutinize and examine intent and where to bring a production. Media, reviews, current events, intent, audience, controversy, economics, politics and other issues and challenges that is vital to a successful professional life. These connections and awareness of the outside world out of school will be a reality check of all the responsibilities of participating in culture. The class is interested in original and dynamic thought, provoking associative thinking and awareness. The class is designed to transform and consider challenging your process and opinion. You are encouraged to bring awareness of different approaches to create new and borrowed strategies in cultural activism. The class is considered process oriented and the professor is encouraging conceptual principles. Process is encouraging original thought over guaranteed knowns.
