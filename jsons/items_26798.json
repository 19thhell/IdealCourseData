The authors reference a political advertisement from the late 1860s which depicts a black man reclining in a field, surrounded by white industrious men tilling the land. The headline reads \"Negro in idleness at the expense of the white man.\" The idea of African American laziness is not the only stereotype that figured in the campaign speeches of many Republican candidates running for the 2012 nomination. McIlwain and Caliendo suggest that the more pervasive idea to appear in campaign messaging was the suffering white America endures as a result of black idleness. Websites such as ObamaIsntWorking.com , a slogan Romney embraced on the campaign trail, perpetuated these associations. For example, some advertisements showed white citizens in unemployment lines under the heading \"Obama Isn't Working.\"                     This site, and all its contents, are Copyright &copy;    by New York University.
