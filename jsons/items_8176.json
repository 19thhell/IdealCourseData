With information technology (IT) having become an indispensible element of the business world, strong managers with information and systems specialties are in high demand. These positions are now closely aligned with the C-Suite, and to excel in them, you must be as adept at crafting budgets and understanding organizational structures as you are in designing and implementing company-wide computer upgrades.   The M.S. in Management and Systems is a unique program that provides you with strong business leadership skills and comprehensive knowledge of information technologies that can enable an organization to improve its financial or marketplace performance. With a focus on the alignment and the integration of management information systems and technology with key business strategies, the program provides you the competitive advantage of understanding organizations as complex systems with a shared vision.       The program can be completed fully online, or in a traditional classroom setting, or by blending a combination of the two formats. The curriculum is taught by accomplished practitioners who possess significant management expertise and in-depth knowledge of the latest innovations in information technology. Students can select one of four concentrations:     Strategy and leadership   Enterprise risk management   Systems management   Database technologies             Program Locations : NYU Midtown Center , Online           View General Curriculum            Learn More            NYU School of Professional Studies faculty and staff members look forward to learning more about you, and we want you to learn more about us, to ensure that your decisions regarding your educational experience are well informed.
