The algorithm was developed with the advice of a panel of ED and primary care physicians, and it is based on an examination of a sample of almost 6,000 full ED records. Data abstracted from these records included the initial complaint, presenting symptoms, vital signs, medical history, age, gender, diagnoses, procedures performed, and resources used in the ED. Based on this information, each case was classified into one of the following categories:   Non-emergent - The patient's initial complaint, presenting symptoms, vital signs, medical history, and age indicated that immediate medical care was not required within 12 hours;   Emergent/Primary Care Treatable - Based on information in the record, treatment was required within 12 hours, but care could have been provided effectively and safely in a primary care setting. The complaint did not require continuous observation, and no procedures were performed or resources used that are not available in a primary care setting (e.g., CAT scan or certain lab tests);   Emergent - ED Care Needed - Preventable/Avoidable - Emergency department care was required based on the complaint or procedures performed/resources used, but the emergent nature of the condition was potentially preventable/avoidable if timely and effective ambulatory care had been received during the episode of illness (e.g., the flare-ups of asthma, diabetes, congestive heart failure, etc.); and   Emergent - ED Care Needed - Not Preventable/Avoidable - Emergency department care was required and ambulatory care treatment could not have prevented the condition (e.g., trauma, appendicitis, myocardial infarction, etc.).   This information that was used to develop the algorithm required analysis of the full medical record. Since such detailed information is not generally available on computerized ED or claims records, these classifications were then \"mapped\" to the discharge diagnosis of each case in our sample to determine for each diagnosis the percentage of sample cases that fell into these four categories. For example, patients discharged with a final diagnosis of \"abdominal pain\" may include both patients who arrived at the ED complaining of stomach pain, as well as those who reported chest pain (an a possible heart attack). Accordingly, for abdominal pain, the algorithm assigns a specific percentage of the visit into the categories of \"non-emergent\", \"emergent/primary care treatable\", and \"emergent/ED care needed-not preventable/avoidable\" based on what we observed in our sample for cases with an ultimate discharge diagnosis of abdominal pain.   It is important to recognize that the algorithm is not intended as a triage tool or a mechanism to determine whether ED use in a specific case is \"appropriate\" (e.g., for reimbursement purposes). Since few diagnostic categories are clear-cut in all cases, the algorithm assigns cases probabilistically on a percentage basis, reflecting this potential uncertainty and variation.   Since the original development of the algorithm, users have expressed an interest in examining separately cases involving a primary diagnosis of injury, mental health problems, alcohol, or substance abuse. Accordingly, we have pulled these conditions out of the standard classification scheme, and tabulate them separately. There are also a residual of conditions (approximately 15%) where our sample was not of sufficient size to assign percentages for the standard classification - these conditions are also tabulated separately. See Attachment for schematic diagram of algorithm.   Applying the Algorithm to an ED Data Base   We have developed software for applying the algorithm using three different software applications: SAS, SPSS, and ACCESS. Detailed instructions on how to use the algorithm are included in Download section of this website. All three applications produce an output data set that adds a new set of variables to your original data set - the names of the new variables are:   ne = \"Non-emergent\"   \u00a0   epct = \"Emergent/Primary Care Treatable\"   \u00a0   edcnpa = \"Emergent ? ED Care Needed ? Preventable/Avoidable\"   \u00a0   edcnnpa = \"Emergent ? ED Care Needed ? Not Preventable/Avoidable\"   \u00a0   injury = \"Injury principal diagnoses\"   \u00a0   psych = \"Mental health principal diagnoses\"   \u00a0   alcohol = \"Alcohol-related health principal diagnoses\"   \u00a0   drug = \"Drug-related health principal diagnoses (excluding alcohol)\"   \u00a0   unclassified = \"Not classified - not in one of the above categories\"   For each ED encounter, the numbers in the new fields represent the relative percentage of cases for that diagnosis falling into the various classification categories. For example, in the case of urinary tract infections (ICD-9-CM code 599.0), each case is assigned 66% \"non-emergent\", 17% \"emergent/primary care treatable\", and 17% \"emergent - ED care needed - preventable/avoidable\". The sum of the data new data fields will always total 1\", and the injury, psych, alcohol, drug, and unclassified fields are always binary (equal to 1\" or 0\").   In addition, the ACCESS program produce output files in EXCEL format that profiles ED use by hospital, payor group, zip code area, and by patient race/ethnicity. For SAS and SPSS applications, this output can be obtained by simply aggregated these values to find the total percentage of cases by hospital, payor group, zip code, race/ethnicity, etc.                                                                                      \u00a9 NYU Wagner   295 Lafayette Street, New York, NY 10012-9604   212.998.7400   Copyright and Fair Use   Contact Us   Sitemap   New York University"}]},

The complaint did not require continuous observation, and no procedures were performed or resources used that are not available in a primary care setting (e.g., CAT scan or certain lab tests);   Emergent - ED Care Needed - Preventable/Avoidable - Emergency department care was required based on the complaint or procedures performed/resources used, but the emergent nature of the condition was potentially preventable/avoidable if timely and effective ambulatory care had been received during the episode of illness (e.g., the flare-ups of asthma, diabetes, congestive heart failure, etc.); and   Emergent - ED Care Needed - Not Preventable/Avoidable - Emergency department care was required and ambulatory care treatment could not have prevented the condition (e.g., trauma, appendicitis, myocardial infarction, etc.).   This information that was used to develop the algorithm required analysis of the full medical record. Since such detailed information is not generally available on computerized ED or claims records, these classifications were then \"mapped\" to the discharge diagnosis of each case in our sample to determine for each diagnosis the percentage of sample cases that fell into these four categories. For example, patients discharged with a final diagnosis of \"abdominal pain\" may include both patients who arrived at the ED complaining of stomach pain, as well as those who reported chest pain (an a possible heart attack). Accordingly, for abdominal pain, the algorithm assigns a specific percentage of the visit into the categories of \"non-emergent\", \"emergent/primary care treatable\", and \"emergent/ED care needed-not preventable/avoidable\" based on what we observed in our sample for cases with an ultimate discharge diagnosis of abdominal pain.   It is important to recognize that the algorithm is not intended as a triage tool or a mechanism to determine whether ED use in a specific case is \"appropriate\" (e.g., for reimbursement purposes). Since few diagnostic categories are clear-cut in all cases, the algorithm assigns cases probabilistically on a percentage basis, reflecting this potential uncertainty and variation.   Since the original development of the algorithm, users have expressed an interest in examining separately cases involving a primary diagnosis of injury, mental health problems, alcohol, or substance abuse. Accordingly, we have pulled these conditions out of the standard classification scheme, and tabulate them separately. There are also a residual of conditions (approximately 15%) where our sample was not of sufficient size to assign percentages for the standard classification - these conditions are also tabulated separately. See Attachment for schematic diagram of algorithm.   Applying the Algorithm to an ED Data Base   We have developed software for applying the algorithm using three different software applications: SAS, SPSS, and ACCESS. Detailed instructions on how to use the algorithm are included in Download section of this website. All three applications produce an output data set that adds a new set of variables to your original data set - the names of the new variables are:   ne = \"Non-emergent\"   \u00a0   epct = \"Emergent/Primary Care Treatable\"   \u00a0   edcnpa = \"Emergent ? ED Care Needed ? Preventable/Avoidable\"   \u00a0   edcnnpa = \"Emergent ? ED Care Needed ? Not Preventable/Avoidable\"   \u00a0   injury = \"Injury principal diagnoses\"   \u00a0   psych = \"Mental health principal diagnoses\"   \u00a0   alcohol = \"Alcohol-related health principal diagnoses\"   \u00a0   drug = \"Drug-related health principal diagnoses (excluding alcohol)\"   \u00a0   unclassified = \"Not classified - not in one of the above categories\"   For each ED encounter, the numbers in the new fields represent the relative percentage of cases for that diagnosis falling into the various classification categories. For example, in the case of urinary tract infections (ICD-9-CM code 599.0), each case is assigned 66% \"non-emergent\", 17% \"emergent/primary care treatable\", and 17% \"emergent - ED care needed - preventable/avoidable\". The sum of the data new data fields will always total 1\", and the injury, psych, alcohol, drug, and unclassified fields are always binary (equal to 1\" or 0\").   In addition, the ACCESS program produce output files in EXCEL format that profiles ED use by hospital, payor group, zip code area, and by patient race/ethnicity. For SAS and SPSS applications, this output can be obtained by simply aggregated these values to find the total percentage of cases by hospital, payor group, zip code, race/ethnicity, etc.                                                                                      \u00a9 NYU Wagner   295 Lafayette Street, New York, NY 10012-9604   212.998.7400   Copyright and Fair Use   Contact Us   Sitemap   New York University"}, {"content": "Fundamental Algorithms -- Spring 2015    SPECIAL NOTE:  There will be special Midterm office hours on SUNDAY EVENING, March 29, 7-9 p.m.   NO questions will be answered on March 30, the date of the exam.

Siegel  Joel H. Spencer  Chee K. Yap     Three key issues for an algorithm are: Is it correct? How efficient is it? Can one do better? Our strong and diverse group seeks provable answers to these questions. It focuses on problems and questions in the following areas: computational geometry, computational algebra, randomness (in algorithm design and average case analysis), computational biology, correctness of programs and hardware, and game theory.    Richard Cole has worked on a wide range of algorithmic topics. His current focus is the new area of algorithmic economics. One of the fundamental notions in economics is the concept of equilibrium: for example, prices that approximately balance supply and demand are expected to be the norm. From a computer science perspective, for an equilibrium to be attainable, it has to be computationally feasible to find equilibrium prices and, in addition, the market itself must be able to \"compute\" such prices. Prof. Cole, his collaborators, and students are studying the computational hardness of the pricing problem and specific pricing algorithms for different market and agent models.    Yevgeniy Dodis is primarily interested in cryptography. His current primary research directions are cryptography based on imperfect randomness, exposure-resilient cryptography, cryptography with biometrics and other noisy data, hash functions and random oracle model and information-theoretic cryptography. Recent achievements include design of special purpose randomness extractors for imperfect sources, formal model of cryptography based on noisy data, design and formalization of intrusion-resilient cryptosystems and new criteria and techniques for design of hash functions.    Subhash Khot is broadly interested in all aspects of algorithms and computational complexity. His specific interests include efficiently computing approximate solutions to NP-hard problems and negative results showing that for many problems, even computing approximate solutions is intractable. His recent works include negative results for semi-definite programming based algorithms, their connection to metric geometry and analysis, and negative results for some learning theory problems.    Bud Mishra has worked in many areas of Computer Science. His current focus is on applications of computer science and mathematical ideas to biological sciences. He has developed optical mapping technology, a successful approach to physical genome mapping. He aims to develop efficient practical algorithmic tools for genome mapping and sequencing. He leads a number of projects in bioinformatics, primarily in genomics and systems biology, including a novel technology aimed at making fast and cheap sequencing of the human genome broadly accessible, a cancer genome atlas, algebraic model checking for systems biology, large-scale models of pandemic flu and smallpox and many others.    Mehryar Mohri's primary research areas are machine learning, theory and algorithms, text and speech processing, and computational biology. This includes in particular the study of the theoretical aspects of machine learning, the design of general and accurate learning algorithms, and their applications to large-scale learning problems such as those found in bioinformatics and language processing.    Oded Regev's research is in mathematical aspects of theoretical computer science. He is particularly interested in advancing the area of lattice-based cryptography using concepts from quantum computation, analysis, and number theory.    Victor Shoup 's research areas are cryptography and computational number theory; he is especially interested in the interactions between these two areas. He designs and analyzes cryptographic primitives and protocols with security properties that can be proven based on clear and reasonable assumptions, and which are nevertheless practical enough to use in the real world. Most recently, he has been working on practical secure deniable protocols (i.e., participants in an exchange using this protocol can deny that it ever took place) based on novel and use of number-theoretic algorithms.    Alan Siegel is interested in the analysis of algorithms and related mathematics, which includes applications from probability, statistics, partial and ordinary differential equations and methods in asymptotic analysis. He works on analysis of probabilistic processes and geometric arrangements of lines. His current research focuses on hashing functions and their properties. He is also interested in K-12 mathematics education and new approaches to teaching algorithms at the college and graduate level.    Joel Spencer is interested in applications of probabilistic methods in discrete mathematics and theoretical computer science. He worked on many topics including Ramsey theory (which studies the conditions under which order must appear in random systems), discrepancy theory (which deals with measuring irregularities of discrete distributions), random graphs and their connections to logic and randomized greedy methods. He is the author of a number of widely known books on probabilistic method.    Chee Yap works in the areas of computational geometry, algebraic computation and visualization. His current research focuses on two themes: exact arithmetic computation and large-scale visualization. Numerical nonrobustness has been called \"computer scientists' dirty secret\" --everyone knows that our numerical software can break, but we rarely talk about it. The most successful approach to solving the robustness problem in geometry is based on exact geometric computation. Chee Yap and his group are developing techniques for this type of computation based on algebraic zero bounds. Exact geometric computation provides considerable insight into the theory of real computation. The other direction of Chee Yap's work is large-scale visualization, dynamic visualization of geospatial data in particular.
