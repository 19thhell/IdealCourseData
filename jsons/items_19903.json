Liberal Studies students, for example, can spend their first year at one of the NYU campuses in Florence, London, or Paris. Many programs \u2013 from Business and Political Economy, to International Relations and Global Public Health \u2013 integrate global study into the curriculum.     NYU sends more students abroad than any other American university. Where will the global network take you?

If you need additional help, you can attend an NYURoam Wireless Workshops for hands-on assistance. Visit the ITS Training and Workshops pages for more information.

Configuring & Connecting       Troubleshooting Tips       Other Ways of Connecting to NYURoam              nyuguest        NYU-ROAM3        VPN        nyupda (soon to be retired)                  Configuring & Connecting    The following instructions are for connecting to nyu , the primary access gateway (or \"SSID\") for the NYURoam wireless network. NYU community members should use these instructions to connect to NYURoam.    If for some reason you are unable to connect to nyu , however, see Other Ways of Connecting to NYURoam .      Select your computer or device model below for instructions:      Macintosh OS X    iPhone, iPad &amp; iPod Touch    Windows 8    Windows 7    Windows Vista    Windows XP    Android    BlackBerry OS 10    Google ChromeBook       Troubleshooting Tips      You may not be able to connect to nyu , the default SSID for NYURoam access for a few different reasons:      You are not in an NYURoam enabled location.      NYURoam wireless service is available at an ever-increasing number of locations. You must be at a designated NYURoam Wireless access location to receive a signal from NYURoam. Click here for the complete list of locations .     Your computer does not support WPA security.      If this is the case, you can try to connect via the NYU-ROAM3 SSID. VPN is required to successfully connect via NYU-ROAM3. See Other Ways of Connecting to NYURoam (below) for more information.          You wireless adapter (e.g., Network Interface Card) is using an outdated wireless protocol      NYURoam currently supports the IEEE 802.11g or 802.11n protocols. If your wireless adapater is using an older protocol (e.g., 802.11b), you will either need to reconfigure your current adapter to use one of the supported protocols, if possible, or buy a newer model that supports these protocols.          You do not have an active NYU NetID or password.           If you are a guest of the University or otherwise don't have an active NetID and password, you can connect to NYURoam Wireless via one of two different ways:              If you want to connect via a wireless-enabled computer or mobile device, and you are a guest of the University, your sponsor or event host can request temporary access credentials for the nyuguest SSID. See Other Ways of Connecting to NYURoam (below) for more information.        If you want to connect via your smart phone, you can use the nyupda SSID. See Other Ways of Connecting to NYURoam (below) for more information.                  Other Ways of Connecting to NYURoam            nyuguest       nyuguest is a wireless network made available for NYU guests and visitors who do not have an NYU NetID and thus cannot connect to the regular NYURoam SSID of nyu . If you have a guest or group of guests who will need wireless Internet access, you can request an nyuguest username/password from a designated departmental or school representative .       If there is no departmental contact for your area, you can request an nyuguest username and password for your guest(s) by calling emailing the IT Service Desk.    Click here for instructions on connecting to the nyuguest network .        NYU-ROAM3       You should only connect to NYURoam via NYU-ROAM3 if you are using an older computer that is not compatible with the nyu SSID. Connecting via NYU-ROAM3 requires the use of NYU VPN .  For instructions on connecting to NYU-ROAM3, see Configuring a Windows computer to connect to the NYU-ROAM3 network or Configuring a Mac to connect to the NYU-ROAM3 network .   VPN        VPN (Virtual Private Network) is software that provides secure, password-protected access to NYU's network (NYU-NET) and Internet services when you are connecting from off-campus. VPN is required to access some secure NYU services when using a computer or mobile device outside NYU-NET and via NYURoam. For more information on VPN, including download and installation instructions, see the NYU VPN web page .    nyupda   The nyupda network has been retired. All NYU community members should use the nyu network instead.    Page last reviewed: January 12, 2015"}]}]
