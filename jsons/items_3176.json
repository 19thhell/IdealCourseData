Kovner, A.R.          01/01/2003              This article traces the development of a course in health services management over 40 years and presents the course within a context of teaching evidence-based management. One emphasis of the course is on teaching through storytelling--students developing learning capability to listen to what each stakeholder has to say, and then figuring what to do about it. Students share evidence from the professor's own work experience, the student's own work experience, peer-reviewed published articles, and case studies.
