A block of wood, milk, and air   all have properties. All the material on earth is in three states- solid, liquid,   and gas . The &quot;state&quot; of the matter refers to the group of matter   with the same properties. In other words, you group the objects together according   to their properties.     Solids  The wood block   is solid. A solid has a certain size and shape. The wood   block does not change size or shape. Other examples of solids are the computer,   the desk, and the floor. You can change the shape   of solids. You change the shape of sheets of lumber by sawing it in half or burning   it. From wood    to  How   might you change the shape of a piece of gum?      Liquids  Milk is a liquid.   Milk is liquid matter. It has a size or volume. Volume means it takes up space.   But milk doesn't have a definite shape. It takes the shape of its container.    Liquids can flow, be poured, and spilled. Did you ever spill   juice? Did you notice how the liquid goes everywhere and you have to hurry and   wipe it up? The liquid is taking the shape of the floor and the floor is expansive   limitless boundary (until it hits the wall). You can't spill a wooden block. You   can drop it and it still has the same shape.  What   about jello and peanut butter?  You can spread peanut   butter on bread, but peanut butter does not flow. It is not a liquid at room temperature.   You have to heat peanut butter up to make it a liquid. When you or your mom makes   jello, it is first a liquid. You have to put it in the refrigerator so that it   becomes a solid. These are yummy forms of matter with properties of a liquid and   a solid.     Gases  Run in place very   fast for a minute. Do you notice how hard you are breathing? What you are breathing   is oxygen? You need oxygen to live. That's why you can only hold your breath for   a certain amount of time.  You can't see oxygen. It's   invisible. It is a gas. A gas is matter that has no shape or size of its own.   Gases have no color.  Gases are all around you. You   can feel gas when the wind blows. The wind is moving air. Air is many gases mixed   together.  to Matter Review    Pages and gif animations written and designed by   Sheila M. Estacio.

GRADE      States of Water  Water   exists in three states- solid, liquid, and gaseous. This   is a K-5 Activity ---&gt; For   Middle School and High School  Liquid Water-      Liquid   water is found in many places. You see liquid water coming out of the faucet,   when it rains, and running in a river. Pure liquid water is free of salt, rocks,   soil, and garbage.  Solid Water-    Ice,   snow, and frost are examples of water in the solid state. Liquid water freezes   at 0 degrees Celsius. Celsius is scale that measures temperature. What instrument   do you use to measure temperature? Winter is a season that you see a lot of solid   water. Other examples of solid water are ice cubes, icicles, ice on a skating   rink.  Water as a Gas - Look   at this picture of gas  You   don't see anything because gas is invisible. Water in the   liquid state may change to water in the gaseous state. Water evaporates   to turn into a gas. Gases are colorless and odorless. You cannot see gas ,but   sometimes you can hear it and smell it. What are some ways that you can hear or   smell a gas?  Water can evaporate or disappear with   the help of heat. Changes in temperature can increase the rate or how long   it takes water to evaporate . Evaporate means to disappear. Water can evaporate   from soil. It evaporates off wet clothes hanging on a clothesline. Plants release   water vapor into the air. We breathe out water vapor.  TRY   THIS!!!   1. Dry your   hand with a towel. Feel your palm. Is it wet or dry?  2.   Hold your hand in front of your mouth about 1 inch away from you. Breathe out   slowly about 8 times on to the palm of your hand. Do not blow. When you are done,   feel your palm. What does it feel like? Is it wet or dry? Your   palm should have felt wet to you. That moist feeling was water vapor. Remember   that we breathe out water vapor. If you have a dog or a cat, you can feel the   water vapor that they breathe out. Try this with a mirror. See the water droplets   form on the mirror. The water vapor that you breathed out is now becoming liquid   water on the mirror. Why?  Let's find out   why...What happens to water as it changes from a solid to a liquid to a gas? The   changes from a solid to a liquid to a gas or from a gas to a liquid to a solid   are called a phase changes. When substances such as water change phase, its physical   properties change, but not its chemical properties. Melting, freezing, condensation,   and evaporation are examples of phase changes.The phase of a substance depends   on temperature and pressure. The pictures below show how molecules of water look   in each phase. Notice how solid water molecules are bunched together and how far   apart the gas molecules are.       to Chapter 4- Review  Pages   and gif animations written and designed by Sheila M. Estacio.
