October 2012                      Social media networks are valuable tools for the public outreach needs of transportation providers: they are free, instantaneous, reach large numbers of people simultaneously, and allow for sideline discussions. When transportation providers are trying to notify large numbers of passengers about delays, drivers about construction work, or bus riders about re-routes, they can \u201cblast\u201d messages through social media channels to reach their intended audience immediately (the audience accesses these networks far more frequently than the websites of their local transportation agencies).

Some more info on the chain reaction&#8230;                           When we run the chain reactions, we will want to run them a couple times, hopefully out in the common space of the 4th floor, then probably separate them into individual parts and run them again back\u00a0 in the class room, and talk about them. We would love to see your process when we talk about your Machines. Before you make your final parts you are probably going to do some simple prototypes to show yourself that it will take the alotted time, or knock over the next part, so show us how you tested/prototyped that part.   So, a couple points to emphasize that we didnt in class:  Document your chain reaction. We will ask you to put up pictures or sketches showing how you tested your theories of your machines, or prototyped out your parts. Take pictures, make sketches, put em out when we talk about your Machine. I suppose if you all document the stuff on your individual blogs/sites, we could pull those up during discussion, rather than printing out a bunch of stuff, if you prefer.   Make your Machine re-settable. If it absolutely has to explode in an enormous fireball, then bring spare parts to do it again a couple times, but ideally this is a machine you can re-set, re-use.
