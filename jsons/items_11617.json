In fact, she writes, \u0093American Jews told and retold details of the catastrophe in multiple forms. Over and over, men and women asserted the necessity of revisiting it in their institutions and organs of public opinion, in all its horrors. By virtue of belonging to the people who had been targeted for extinction and as the victims\u0092 kin, both literal and metaphoric, they considered it their duty to recite the story of the six million.\u0094 Diner adds that these actions \u0093laid the foundation for the better organized, bigger, and more elaborately funded Holocaust projects of the last decades of the twentieth century.\u0094  Diner\u0092s work challenges the existing post-war narrative of the Holocaust that posits American Jews turned away from the genocide in Europe and instead focused on the comforts of suburbia and other benefits generated by the 1950s economic boom. Previous scholars have contended it was the offspring of Holocaust survivors who brought the horrors of World War II to the public sphere-a development that occurred in the 1960s as a result of either the Eichmann trial early in the decade or the June 1967 Six-Day War in Israel. An exhaustive review of Jewish life in America over the nearly two decades following World War II reveals the extent to which the Holocaust was a fundamental component in families and communities. \u0093Some American Jews chiseled references to the tragedy onto cemetery markers and emblazoned them onto the plaques that adorned the walls of Jewish communal buildings,\u0094 Diner writes. \u0093Others turned to music, composing, recording and performing what would emerge as a familiar repertoire of works that stood for the Holocaust. Those able to created dances, dramas, pageants, poems, scholarly works, and graphic images that took as their subject something about the Jews who had perished.\u0094 In a starred review, Kirkus Review writes it is \u0093a work of towering research and conviction,\u0094 adding that \u0093Diner is particularly compelling in her exploration of how the postwar Jewish liberal agenda-transformed by the experience of the Holocaust, immigration discrimination, and anti-Semitism in America-boldly embraced the civil-rights crusade.\u0094 Diner, a professor in NYU\u0092s Department of Hebrew and Judaic Studies, has also authored The Jews of the United States, 1645 to 2000 (2004) and The Lower East Side Memories: The Jewish Place in America (2000), among other works.
