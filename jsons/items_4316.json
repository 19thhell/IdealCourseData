Chemists Create DNA Assembly Line                   May 12, 2010          401                                             Chemists at New York University and China\u2019s Nanjing University have created a DNA assembly line that has the potential to create novel materials efficiently on the nanoscale. Their work is reported in the latest issue of the journal Nature .     \u201cAn industrial assembly line includes a factory, workers, and a conveyor system,\u201d said NYU Chemistry Professor Nadrian Seeman, the study\u2019s senior author. \u201cWe have emulated each of those features using DNA components.\u201d     The assembly line relies on three DNA-based components.     The first is DNA origami, a composition that uses a few hundred short DNA strands to direct a very long DNA strand to form structures to any desired shape. These shapes are approximately 100 x 100 nanometers in area, and about 2 nm thick (a nanometer is one billionth of a meter). DNA origami serves as the assembly line\u2019s framework and also houses its track.     The second are three DNA machines, or cassettes, that serve as programmable cargo-donating devices. The cargo species the researchers used are gold nanoparticles, which measure 5 to 10 nanometers in diameter. Changing the cassette\u2019s control sequences allows the researchers to enable or prevent the donation of the cargoes to the growing construct.     The third is a DNA \u201cwalker,\u201d which is analogous to the chassis of a car being assembled. It moves along the assembly line\u2019s track, stopping at the DNA machines to collect and carry the DNA \u201ccargo.\u201d     As the walker moves along the pathway prescribed by the origami tile track, it encounters sequentially the three DNA devices. These devices can be switched between an \u201con\u201d state, allowing its cargo to be transferred to the walker, and an \u201coff\u201d state, in which no transfer occurs. In this way, the DNA product at the end of the assembly line may include cargo picked up from one, two, or three of the DNA machines.     \u201cA key feature of the assembly line is the programmability of the cargo-donating DNA machines, which allows the generation of eight different products,\u201d explained Seeman.

Chemists Create DNA Assembly Line                   May 12, 2010          401                                             Chemists at New York University and China\u2019s Nanjing University have created a DNA assembly line that has the potential to create novel materials efficiently on the nanoscale. Their work is reported in the latest issue of the journal Nature .     \u201cAn industrial assembly line includes a factory, workers, and a conveyor system,\u201d said NYU Chemistry Professor Nadrian Seeman, the study\u2019s senior author. \u201cWe have emulated each of those features using DNA components.\u201d     The assembly line relies on three DNA-based components.     The first is DNA origami, a composition that uses a few hundred short DNA strands to direct a very long DNA strand to form structures to any desired shape. These shapes are approximately 100 x 100 nanometers in area, and about 2 nm thick (a nanometer is one billionth of a meter). DNA origami serves as the assembly line\u2019s framework and also houses its track.     The second are three DNA machines, or cassettes, that serve as programmable cargo-donating devices. The cargo species the researchers used are gold nanoparticles, which measure 5 to 10 nanometers in diameter. Changing the cassette\u2019s control sequences allows the researchers to enable or prevent the donation of the cargoes to the growing construct.     The third is a DNA \u201cwalker,\u201d which is analogous to the chassis of a car being assembled. It moves along the assembly line\u2019s track, stopping at the DNA machines to collect and carry the DNA \u201ccargo.\u201d     As the walker moves along the pathway prescribed by the origami tile track, it encounters sequentially the three DNA devices. These devices can be switched between an \u201con\u201d state, allowing its cargo to be transferred to the walker, and an \u201coff\u201d state, in which no transfer occurs. In this way, the DNA product at the end of the assembly line may include cargo picked up from one, two, or three of the DNA machines.     \u201cA key feature of the assembly line is the programmability of the cargo-donating DNA machines, which allows the generation of eight different products,\u201d explained Seeman.

The device is described in the latest issue of the journal Nature Nanotechnology .  \u201cThe aim of nanotechnology is to put specific atomic and molecular species where we want them and when we want them there,\u201d said NYU Chemistry Professor Nadrian Seeman, one of the co-authors. \u201cThis is a programmable unit that allows researchers to capture and maneuver patterns on a scale that is unprecedented.\u201d The device is approximately 150 x 50 x 8 nanometers. A nanometer is one billionth of a meter. Put another way, if a nanometer were the size of a normal apple, measuring approximately 10 centimeters in diameter, a normal apple, enlarged proportionally, would be roughly the size of the earth. The creation enhances Seeman\u2019s earlier work-a single nanorobotic arm, completed in 2006, marking the first time scientists had been able to employ a functional nanotechnology device within a DNA array.  The new, two-armed device employs DNA origami, a method unveiled in 2006 that uses a few hundred short DNA strands to direct a very long DNA strand to form structures that adopt any desired shape. These shapes, approximately 100 nanometers in diameter, are eight times larger and three times more complex than what could be created within a simple crystalline DNA array.  As with Seeman\u2019s previous creation, the two-armed nanorobotic device enables the creation of new DNA structures, thereby potentially serving as a factory for assembling the building blocks of new materials. With this capability, it has the potential to develop new synthetic fibers, advance the encryption of information, and improve DNA-scaffolded computer assembly. In the two-armed nanorobotic device, the arms face each other, ready to capture molecules that make up a DNA sequence. Using set strands that bind to its molecules, the arms are then able to change the structure of the device. This changes the sticky ends available to capture a new pattern component. The researchers note that the device performs with 100 percent accuracy. Earlier trials revealed that it captured targeted molecules only 60 to 80 percent of the time. But by heating the device in the presence of the correct species, they found that the arms captured the targeted molecules 100 percent of the time.  They confirmed their results by atomic force microscopy (AFM), which permits features that are a few billionths of a meter to be visualized. The study\u2019s other co-authors were Hongzhou Gu, a graduate student in NYU\u2019s Department of Chemistry, and Jie Chao, who had been a visiting graduate student at NYU, and Professor Shou-Jun Xiao, both based at China\u2019s Nanjing University.
