Over the next two years, NYU\u2019s MA program plans to implement a formal concentration in forensic psychology. The specializations currently available are informal tracks that do not appear on students\u2019 transcripts, whereas a concentration is a formal course of study designed to meet standards set by the NYS Board of Regents. In actuality, NYU students can already take a full load of forensic courses, but it is clearly advantageous to have an official concentration.

Fellows participate in supervised clinical experiences in four principal rotations, each lasting three months. These rotations include a court-based evaluation clinic, an acute psychiatric unit for pre-trial detainees, a forensic hospital and a mandated outpatient treatment program. Fellows also have part-time supervised clinical rotations in a general forensic psychiatry private practice, which includes exposure to child/adolescent cases. Evaluation, research and teaching skills are emphasized at all of our principal clinical sites. In addition to the didactics described below, fellows participate in a year-long seminar on ethics; a year-long seminar in the basics of law; an original scholarly project that is submitted for Grand Rounds, a Mental Health Disability law class at NYU School of Law, mock trial experiences, and a field trip to the U.S. Supreme Court to hear oral arguments about a mental health case.   Classes and administrative offices are centrally located in Manhattan at Bellevue Hospital Center. Fellows rotate at four primary sites for three months each; all sites are based in New York City and are easily accessible by public transportation. The forensic private practice elective takes place for one half-day for six months in a local private office. Trainees are expected to be at rotation sites from approximately 9am to 5pm daily. Moonlighting is permitted.   Daily Schedule   Fellowship Rotations   Bellevue Hospital Jail Forensic Psychiatry Inpatient Service   This rotation is designed to assist fellows in the development of the requisite knowledge, skills, attitudes, and behaviors necessary to competently treat and manage acutely ill psychiatric inpatients who are in the custody of either the New York City Police Department or the New York City Correction Department. The patient population consists of men ages 16 years and older with a wide range of psychiatric disorders including a large percentage of seriously mentally ill, all of whom are facing legal issues at any point from arrest to conviction and sentencing.   Bellevue Hospital Forensic Psychiatry Court Clinic   This rotation aims to teach fellows how to perform comprehensive criminal outpatient forensic examinations and to write concise forensic psychiatric reports for submission to the courts and probation department. The population being evaluated consists of a broad demographic spectrum and wide range of psychopathology; male and female offenders; ages 13 years and older; and a wide variety of often co-morbid psychiatric disorders.   Kirby Forensic Psychiatric Center   Kirby Forensic Psychiatric Center (KFPC) is a maximum-security hospital of the New York State Office of Mental Health that provides treatment for insanity acquittees, incompetent defendants, and civilly committed patients who cannot be managed in less secure settings. This rotation helps fellows develop the requisite knowledge, skills, attitudes, and techniques necessary to work with long-term patients in a forensic setting, to assess dangerousness and competency, and to prepare reports for the court.   Manhattan Assisted Outpatient Treatment Program (AOT)   At this rotation fellows are taught to perform comprehensive forensic examinations for individuals referred for court-mandated outpatient treatment pursuant to Kendra's Law in New York State. Testimony is prepared and presented before the Court on each eligible case. The population being evaluated consists of a broad demographic spectrum, a wide range of psychopathology, and male and female offenders.   The Private Practice of Forensic Psychiatry   Fellows spend a half-day a week for six months learning about the private practice of general and child and adolescent forensic psychiatry. Multiple cases are conducted under the supervision of expert faculty. A wide range of evaluations are offered, including: child custody, juvenile justice, criminal responsibility, personal injury, disability, immigration issues, fitness for duty, testamentary capacity, personal injury, guardianship, domestic violence and eyewitness cases.   Didactic Curriculum   The didactic core curriculum includes educational modules on forensic assessment, criminal law, civil law, mental health law, correctional psychiatry, law and the legal system, ethics, child and adolescent forensic psychiatry, special issues in forensic assessment, introduction to forensic research, and forensic practice; seminars on administrative psychiatry, ethical issues in forensic psychiatry, research methodology, and supervision; addiction medicine for forensic psychiatrists; and a journal club that reviews the latest literature on issues and research in forensic psychiatry. One and one-half days per week are dedicated to this robust curriculum; one day of didactics is shared with the other NYC-area forensic psychiatry fellowships and one half-day is reserved for NYU residents only.

If you are a prospective applicant interested in the Forensic specialization, you should apply directly to the General MA Psychology Program and write in your application essay that your interest is in the Forensic track. Instructions for application procedures can be found here: http://gsas.nyu.edu/page/grad.admissionsapplication       Forensic psychology is one of the fastest growing specializations within the field of psychology, and enrollment in our forensic courses continues to grow. By popular demand, we have added several core forensic classes (such as Forensic Assessment) and several forensic electives (such as Personality Disorders). In addition, new opportunities have emerged for forensic research, fieldwork, and thesis topics. Over the past two-year cycle, we have offered the following Forensic Psychology courses:    Basic Forensic Psychology      Advanced Forensic Psychology      Forensic Assessment      Advanced Forensic Assessment      Psychology of Violence      Traumatic Stress Reactions      Personality Disorders      Psychology of Addiction      Research Methods and Experience, taught with a forensic focus.          In the context of the broader requirements of the MA program, here are the suggested options for a 36-credit curriculum with a forensic specialization. Note that the curriculum is flexible, and students will work individually with a faculty advisor to develop a study plan tailored to specific career goals in forensic psychology.           General MA Core courses (choose a total of three, including at least one Core A, and at least one Core B):      Core A: Physiological Psychology OR Cognitive Psychology OR Cognitive Neuroscience      Core B: Foundations of Psychopathology OR Theories of Personality OR Social Psychology           Statistics (choose one)      (MA level) OR Doctoral           Research Methods (choose one)      Clinical Research Design OR Research Methods and Experience OR Applied Forensic Research (beginning 2009-2010].            Forensic Core courses (choose at least four)      Basic Forensic Psychology      Advanced Forensic Psychology      Forensic Assessment      Advanced Forensic Assessment      Psychology of Violence      Traumatic Stress Reactions           Recommended Forensic Electives (choose at least one)      Personality Disorders      Psychology of Addiction      Affective Neuroscience      Foundations of Psychopathology      Theories of Personality      Social Psychology      Gender Roles           MA Thesis      Students are encouraged to write a forensic thesis as an alternative to taking the general comprehensive examination. The thesis can be a revised and expanded version of the empirical paper written for one of the required research methods classes. Alternately, a thesis can be a scholarly literature review of a topic of special interest. Either way, the thesis is an opportunity to develop specialized forensic expertise in preparation for specific career objectives. This includes admission to forensically oriented doctoral psychology programs, which are naturally somewhat specialized, according to faculty research interests.      Over the next two years, NYU\u2019s MA program plans to implement a formal concentration in forensic psychology. The specializations currently available are informal tracks that do not appear on students\u2019 transcripts, whereas a concentration is a formal course of study designed to meet standards set by the NYS Board of Regents. In actuality, NYU students can already take a full load of forensic courses, but it is clearly advantageous to have an official concentration. This would appear on student transcripts as a Masters in General Psychology with a Concentration in Forensic Psychology.      For more information on the field of forensic psychology, including careers, we recommend that you begin with APA\u2019s American Psychology-Law Society (Division 41). We will have a Links page online shortly, as well as a customized forensic psychology search engine.           NYU MA Forensic Psychology Faculty      Adrienne Gans, Interim Forensics Coordinator      Monica Brooker      Pamela Karp      Jessica Pearson      Margaret Rombone      Barry Winkler      Our forensic professors are all licensed psychologists with active clinical practices and/or research programs. Some hold law degrees and other postdoctoral credentials. They have extensive experience in outpatient and inpatient clinical-forensic assessment and psychotherapy. As a group, they have worked with multiple populations and disorders: violent offenders, sexual predators, stalkers, substance abusers, trauma victims, and pathological family systems (including domestic violence, child abuse, and delinquency). Beyond the basics, their diverse experiences include police and detective work; psychological evaluation of police; civil and criminal law practice, expert witness work, forensic media consultation, and published social science research.                    Forensics @ NYU:      As the largest private University in the country, NYU has multiple Schools, Centers, and Departments with forensic interests and courses. There are multiple opportunities to absorb and integrate the broader multidisciplinary field of forensics. This includes the physical and social sciences (e.g., biology, anthropology, criminology); clinical practice (social work, psychiatry); media studies (the CSI phenomenon: creative journalism); computer science (cybercrime); business (forensic accounting); and the arts (e.g., forensic graphics for law enforcement agencies). Other relevant disciplines include politics and foreign languages (the most recent CIA employment openings for psychologists specify profiling of foreign leaders and governments). Finally, the prestigious School of Law at NYU is affiliated with the interdisciplinary Law and Society MA Program within the Graduate School of Arts &amp; Science, where qualified forensic psychology students can take courses.

Fellows participate in supervised clinical experiences in four principal rotations, each lasting three months. These rotations include a court-based evaluation clinic, an acute psychiatric unit for pre-trial detainees, a forensic hospital and a mandated outpatient treatment program. Fellows also have part-time supervised clinical rotations in a general forensic psychiatry private practice, which includes exposure to child/adolescent cases. Evaluation, research and teaching skills are emphasized at all of our principal clinical sites. In addition to the didactics described below, fellows participate in a year-long seminar on ethics; a year-long seminar in the basics of law; an original scholarly project that is submitted for Grand Rounds, a Mental Health Disability law class at NYU School of Law, mock trial experiences, and a field trip to the U.S. Supreme Court to hear oral arguments about a mental health case.   Classes and administrative offices are centrally located in Manhattan at Bellevue Hospital Center. Fellows rotate at four primary sites for three months each; all sites are based in New York City and are easily accessible by public transportation. The forensic private practice elective takes place for one half-day for six months in a local private office. Trainees are expected to be at rotation sites from approximately 9am to 5pm daily. Moonlighting is permitted.   Daily Schedule   Fellowship Rotations   Bellevue Hospital Jail Forensic Psychiatry Inpatient Service   This rotation is designed to assist fellows in the development of the requisite knowledge, skills, attitudes, and behaviors necessary to competently treat and manage acutely ill psychiatric inpatients who are in the custody of either the New York City Police Department or the New York City Correction Department. The patient population consists of men ages 16 years and older with a wide range of psychiatric disorders including a large percentage of seriously mentally ill, all of whom are facing legal issues at any point from arrest to conviction and sentencing.   Bellevue Hospital Forensic Psychiatry Court Clinic   This rotation aims to teach fellows how to perform comprehensive criminal outpatient forensic examinations and to write concise forensic psychiatric reports for submission to the courts and probation department. The population being evaluated consists of a broad demographic spectrum and wide range of psychopathology; male and female offenders; ages 13 years and older; and a wide variety of often co-morbid psychiatric disorders.   Kirby Forensic Psychiatric Center   Kirby Forensic Psychiatric Center (KFPC) is a maximum-security hospital of the New York State Office of Mental Health that provides treatment for insanity acquittees, incompetent defendants, and civilly committed patients who cannot be managed in less secure settings. This rotation helps fellows develop the requisite knowledge, skills, attitudes, and techniques necessary to work with long-term patients in a forensic setting, to assess dangerousness and competency, and to prepare reports for the court.   Manhattan Assisted Outpatient Treatment Program (AOT)   At this rotation fellows are taught to perform comprehensive forensic examinations for individuals referred for court-mandated outpatient treatment pursuant to Kendra's Law in New York State. Testimony is prepared and presented before the Court on each eligible case. The population being evaluated consists of a broad demographic spectrum, a wide range of psychopathology, and male and female offenders.   The Private Practice of Forensic Psychiatry   Fellows spend a half-day a week for six months learning about the private practice of general and child and adolescent forensic psychiatry. Multiple cases are conducted under the supervision of expert faculty. A wide range of evaluations are offered, including: child custody, juvenile justice, criminal responsibility, personal injury, disability, immigration issues, fitness for duty, testamentary capacity, personal injury, guardianship, domestic violence and eyewitness cases.   Didactic Curriculum   The didactic core curriculum includes educational modules on forensic assessment, criminal law, civil law, mental health law, correctional psychiatry, law and the legal system, ethics, child and adolescent forensic psychiatry, special issues in forensic assessment, introduction to forensic research, and forensic practice; seminars on administrative psychiatry, ethical issues in forensic psychiatry, research methodology, and supervision; addiction medicine for forensic psychiatrists; and a journal club that reviews the latest literature on issues and research in forensic psychiatry. One and one-half days per week are dedicated to this robust curriculum; one day of didactics is shared with the other NYC-area forensic psychiatry fellowships and one half-day is reserved for NYU residents only.
