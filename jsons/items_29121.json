Students must have a minimum 3.0 grade point average (GPA). Topics in Cuban Culture provides a multifaceted exploration of Cuban history, culture and society from the period of Spanish colonialism, through the wars of independence and the Revolution, and into the \"special period\" of the 1990s, all the way to the present day.

The class will also be able to take advantage of local exhibits, performances, theatre, film, and other cultural events current during the spring. On the study trip, students will have an opportunity to experience life in Cuba and to interact with leading Cuban artists, writers, performers and scholars. Students are expected to keep a weekly journal with entries relating to assigned readings and guest lecturers. The final research paper and presentation is on an approved theme.
