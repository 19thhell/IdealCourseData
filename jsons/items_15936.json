During Orientation Week, the book serves as a catalyst to stimulate student-faculty conversations under debate, such as multiculturalism, racism, immigration, or environmental ethics, which allows students to explore divergent viewpoints. The goal of such summer reading programs, however, becomes more challenging when students in an entering class hail from 39 countries, speak 43 languages, and comprise the first class of a new university, NYU Abu Dhabi (NYUAD).   To help connect the incoming freshmen before they set foot on campus, the students took part in an interactive summer reading colloquium, Cosmopolitan Ideas for Global Citizens. It took advantage of established educational technology\u2014Blackboard, iTunes U, Second Life\u2014and relied on the immense support of several ITS groups to create a unique summer program to match an exceptional freshman class.   The beginning   The Summer Colloquium project began with a simple word that NYUAD has embraced to describe its students, faculty, and location: cosmopolitan. Senior members of NYUAD's admissions team selected Kwame Anthony Appiah's Cosmopolitanism: Ethics in a World of Strangers as the reading. With choice of reading settled, we then were left with the more difficult task of determining how best to meaningfully engage the students through a virtual experience. Under the leadership of NYUAD Vice Provost of International Education and Outreach Carol Brandt, faculty instructors Matthew Silverstein and Cyrus Patell, Associate Vice President of Global Technology Heather Stewart, and myself, it became clear that the project would benefit the students most if we drew on the many different forms of learning\u2014seeing, writing and discussing, and listening\u2014and incorporating those into an online interface.   Built on a wiki-based platform, the NYUAD Class of 2014 Summer Site allowed students to share and discuss their thoughts on Appiah's text using each sensory experience, as described below, via links to Blackboard, an Academic Gallery, and iTunes U.   Students were emailed the colloquium syllabus, which outlined the range of assignments and provided them with the web address and instructions on how to access the wiki (Figure 1). The wiki also served as a means to make important pre-departure announcements, provide updates, and answer frequently asked questions, as well as provide links to NYUAD social networking sites and blogs.   Seeing   After students completed Appiah's book, their first assignment was to go out into their local communities and take a photograph that they felt visually captured the meanings of cosmopolitanism. Through the Summer Site, they uploaded their photographs to Blackboard. In turn, the site administrator uploaded the photographs from Blackboard to the Academic Gallery on the wiki (Figure 2). The photographer and location of the captured image remained anonymous and only the title of the photograph was included. Students could then view and compare their fellow classmates' interpretations of the assignment.   The photographs then had a &quot;second life&quot; as both a virtual and physical exhibition. Liam Fry, manager of ITS Student Technology Services, designed a scale model of 19 Washington Square North, NYUAD's academic home on Washington Square, in the 3-D, virtual world of Second Life (Figure 3). That space was used to design an exhibition of a selection of the students' photographs. The virtual hanging was used as a diagram to hang the public exhibition that opened at 19 Washington Square North on January 4, 2011, in conjunction with the arrival of 34 NYUAD students taking January Term classes in New York, NYUAD's equivalent to NYU's Winter Session (Figure 4). This aspect of the project marks an innovative way to tangibly bridge the two campuses, and to make a final product of the summer colloquium available to colleagues here in New York.   Writing &amp; discussing   An important part of the colloquium was for students to learn the varying viewpoints of their internationally diverse classmates. Through Blackboard's chat tool, the students were divided into small chat groups of four to begin discussing overview questions provided in the syllabus (Figure 5).   Using the Group Chat function, each small group was asked to compose three questions for NYUAD professor of philosophy, Matthew Silverstein. Professor Silverstein then discussed the questions with the students during large chat group sessions, which consisted of four small chats groups. Of the 12 questions posed by each large chat group, one final question regarding Appiah's text was chosen to send on to NYUAD Associated Dean of Humanities Cyrus Patell, who prepared a final lecture based on that question.   Listening   Professor Patell's lecture was filmed at NYU TV's studio and reformatted as a podcast for iTunes U (Figure 6). Throughout the summer, students had the option of downloading supplemental lectures on cosmopolitanism, that had been filmed throughout the 2009-2010 academic year at 19 Washington Square North as part of NYUAD's sponsored lecture series, The Cosmopolitan Idea. After viewing the lectures, students were invited to continue to discussions in their small chat groups.   The Summer Colloquium came to a close during Marhaba (Welcome) Week, when students arrived in Abu Dhabi for the start of their freshman year. Professor Patell delivered a welcome speech that readdressed questions about cosmopolitanism and discussed Appiah's book with the students as a unified class. The Summer Colloquium proved to be a successful experiment in combining the best available educational technologies to create a single learning experience for students spread around the globe.   The future   As NYU continues to move forward with educational software that incorporates social networking into the learning process, summer colloquiums that take place virtually will become increasingly productive ways to unify culturally and geographically diverse students. While plans for next year's summer reading program have yet to be established, there are several lessons we can apply to future virtual colloquiums. The first is to make the chat sessions more engaging and interactive, ideally through live chats. This in itself is difficult considering the global locations of the students, but nevertheless it is a challenge that will be increasingly relevant as the Global Network University becomes an integral part of NYU. The second is to adopt tools from social network sites to make the colloquium more student friendly, which may mean moving away from a wiki platform. For example, offering the ability for students to &quot;friend&quot; students from other chat groups to enrich the dialogue. And finally, we will encourage students from the Class of 2014 to provide feedback on the Summer Colloquium to help us build on and improve the experience for the Class of 2015.   We hope some of the lessons learned from the Summer Colloquium will be applied this spring when NYUAD's inaugural Global Network Seminar takes place. NYU music professors Michael Beckerman and Martin Daughtry will co-teach the course Translation as Multimedia Practice and Metaphor. Professor Beckerman will lead a class in New York that will meet with Professor Daughtry's class in Abu Dhabi through video conferencing and digital connections. Students in both cities will collaborate with one another inside and outside of the classroom on a weekly basis.   The Summer Colloquium photography exhibition is open to the public and on view until February 18 at 19 Washington Square North.

During Orientation Week, the book serves as a catalyst to stimulate student-faculty conversations under debate, such as multiculturalism, racism, immigration, or environmental ethics, which allows students to explore divergent viewpoints. The goal of such summer reading programs, however, becomes more challenging when students in an entering class hail from 39 countries, speak 43 languages, and comprise the first class of a new university, NYU Abu Dhabi (NYUAD).   To help connect the incoming freshmen before they set foot on campus, the students took part in an interactive summer reading colloquium, Cosmopolitan Ideas for Global Citizens. It took advantage of established educational technology\u2014Blackboard, iTunes U, Second Life\u2014and relied on the immense support of several ITS groups to create a unique summer program to match an exceptional freshman class.   The beginning   The Summer Colloquium project began with a simple word that NYUAD has embraced to describe its students, faculty, and location: cosmopolitan. Senior members of NYUAD's admissions team selected Kwame Anthony Appiah's Cosmopolitanism: Ethics in a World of Strangers as the reading. With choice of reading settled, we then were left with the more difficult task of determining how best to meaningfully engage the students through a virtual experience. Under the leadership of NYUAD Vice Provost of International Education and Outreach Carol Brandt, faculty instructors Matthew Silverstein and Cyrus Patell, Associate Vice President of Global Technology Heather Stewart, and myself, it became clear that the project would benefit the students most if we drew on the many different forms of learning\u2014seeing, writing and discussing, and listening\u2014and incorporating those into an online interface.   Built on a wiki-based platform, the NYUAD Class of 2014 Summer Site allowed students to share and discuss their thoughts on Appiah's text using each sensory experience, as described below, via links to Blackboard, an Academic Gallery, and iTunes U.   Students were emailed the colloquium syllabus, which outlined the range of assignments and provided them with the web address and instructions on how to access the wiki (Figure 1). The wiki also served as a means to make important pre-departure announcements, provide updates, and answer frequently asked questions, as well as provide links to NYUAD social networking sites and blogs.   Seeing   After students completed Appiah's book, their first assignment was to go out into their local communities and take a photograph that they felt visually captured the meanings of cosmopolitanism. Through the Summer Site, they uploaded their photographs to Blackboard. In turn, the site administrator uploaded the photographs from Blackboard to the Academic Gallery on the wiki (Figure 2). The photographer and location of the captured image remained anonymous and only the title of the photograph was included. Students could then view and compare their fellow classmates' interpretations of the assignment.   The photographs then had a &quot;second life&quot; as both a virtual and physical exhibition. Liam Fry, manager of ITS Student Technology Services, designed a scale model of 19 Washington Square North, NYUAD's academic home on Washington Square, in the 3-D, virtual world of Second Life (Figure 3). That space was used to design an exhibition of a selection of the students' photographs. The virtual hanging was used as a diagram to hang the public exhibition that opened at 19 Washington Square North on January 4, 2011, in conjunction with the arrival of 34 NYUAD students taking January Term classes in New York, NYUAD's equivalent to NYU's Winter Session (Figure 4). This aspect of the project marks an innovative way to tangibly bridge the two campuses, and to make a final product of the summer colloquium available to colleagues here in New York.   Writing &amp; discussing   An important part of the colloquium was for students to learn the varying viewpoints of their internationally diverse classmates. Through Blackboard's chat tool, the students were divided into small chat groups of four to begin discussing overview questions provided in the syllabus (Figure 5).   Using the Group Chat function, each small group was asked to compose three questions for NYUAD professor of philosophy, Matthew Silverstein. Professor Silverstein then discussed the questions with the students during large chat group sessions, which consisted of four small chats groups. Of the 12 questions posed by each large chat group, one final question regarding Appiah's text was chosen to send on to NYUAD Associated Dean of Humanities Cyrus Patell, who prepared a final lecture based on that question.   Listening   Professor Patell's lecture was filmed at NYU TV's studio and reformatted as a podcast for iTunes U (Figure 6). Throughout the summer, students had the option of downloading supplemental lectures on cosmopolitanism, that had been filmed throughout the 2009-2010 academic year at 19 Washington Square North as part of NYUAD's sponsored lecture series, The Cosmopolitan Idea. After viewing the lectures, students were invited to continue to discussions in their small chat groups.   The Summer Colloquium came to a close during Marhaba (Welcome) Week, when students arrived in Abu Dhabi for the start of their freshman year. Professor Patell delivered a welcome speech that readdressed questions about cosmopolitanism and discussed Appiah's book with the students as a unified class. The Summer Colloquium proved to be a successful experiment in combining the best available educational technologies to create a single learning experience for students spread around the globe.   The future   As NYU continues to move forward with educational software that incorporates social networking into the learning process, summer colloquiums that take place virtually will become increasingly productive ways to unify culturally and geographically diverse students. While plans for next year's summer reading program have yet to be established, there are several lessons we can apply to future virtual colloquiums. The first is to make the chat sessions more engaging and interactive, ideally through live chats. This in itself is difficult considering the global locations of the students, but nevertheless it is a challenge that will be increasingly relevant as the Global Network University becomes an integral part of NYU. The second is to adopt tools from social network sites to make the colloquium more student friendly, which may mean moving away from a wiki platform. For example, offering the ability for students to &quot;friend&quot; students from other chat groups to enrich the dialogue. And finally, we will encourage students from the Class of 2014 to provide feedback on the Summer Colloquium to help us build on and improve the experience for the Class of 2015.   We hope some of the lessons learned from the Summer Colloquium will be applied this spring when NYUAD's inaugural Global Network Seminar takes place. NYU music professors Michael Beckerman and Martin Daughtry will co-teach the course Translation as Multimedia Practice and Metaphor. Professor Beckerman will lead a class in New York that will meet with Professor Daughtry's class in Abu Dhabi through video conferencing and digital connections. Students in both cities will collaborate with one another inside and outside of the classroom on a weekly basis.   The Summer Colloquium photography exhibition is open to the public and on view until February 18 at 19 Washington Square North.

major in Film and New Media emphasizes interdisciplinary and global approaches to film and new media. Students develop critical and interpretive skills for making and understanding documentary, experimental, narrative, and interactive styles of film and new media and learn the methods and theoretical models for analyzing film, new media and their histories.

Beginning with the wave of independence and anti-colonial movements in the region, this course will analyze wars and political violence as mediated moments that rely on communicative acts and technologies. Simultaneously, the course will analyze how various media technologies &ndash; including radio, film, satellite TV, and internet &ndash; are formed through moments of war, conflict, and violence. Through these analyses, students will gain an understanding of the experiences of, conflicts over, and representations of notions such as territory, landscape, body, nation, gender, memory, terror, freedom, and spectacle.

This course analyzes and puts into practice principles of different forms of dramatic and dynamic writing: classical, episodic, and parametric in narrative and documentary; rhythmic and contrapuntal in experimental film; episodes and attractions for web platforms; interactive and auto-generative in new media. Writing assignments include both critical analyses and creative exercises.

This course will explore human behavior in the context of evolutionary psychology, and develop that into a working screenplay. Readings and film screenings will focus on observing human behaviors and relationships. You will hopefully leave the class with a well-honed short script, anchored to a frank and honest look at our behaviors and relationships, and perhaps some greater questions and thoughts into the human condition.

Single Shot Cinema is a film method that re-interprets film language based on the technical developments and possibilities of filmmaking in the digital age. What was once only possible with cranes and Steadicams is now accessible to the low-budget filmmaker. Students discover how to block actions and characters in a scene and how to choreograph one single shot, using smooth and flexible camera movements that expresses the drama, emotion, and vision of the director.

Through the universal language of lenses and lighting we learn how these play a central role when working with a set. Students develop the skills to use a motion picture camera in order to tell a good story. The class structure reflects a working film set with emphasis on production. Learning to create a mood advances the ultimate goal of a filmmaker. The heart of visual storytelling is composition: camera placement, camera angles, camera movement, and lens choice. Together with the lighting style a film finds its own unique life. In each class we look at selected scenes from popular films and recreate them. We shoot exercises in the classroom or on location.

First, we trace the origin and variations of New Wave films from European through Latin American to East Asian nations. Then, we expand the scope to transnational crossroads including pan-Chinese, Balkan, South Asian, and African regions. Finally, we explore how contemporary cinema reflects sociopolitical and cultural phenomena in the age of globalization. Major trends and directors are introduced with close analysis of key films.

After examining the philosophical underpinnings of the New Wave in philosophical existentialism (Sartre, de Beauvoir) and the movement&rsquo;s theoretical underpinnings in the film criticism of Cahiers du Cin&eacute;ma, we examine a chronological series of films by Cahiers directors (Truffaut, Godard, Chabrol, Rohmer), Left Bank directors (Resnais, Duras, Varda, Marker), and Cin&eacute;ma V&eacute;rit&eacute; (Rouch, Morin). While focusing on the films themselves, we also take a cultural studies approach by seeing the films as part of a broader artistic and mediatic spectrum.

Through the genres of experimental, narrative, and documentary image-making, this course examines the work of women who have pioneered and re-imagined the methods, theories and ideas of the dominant culture. An eclectic and multi-cultural selection of feature length films, shorts, exhibitions, books, and iconic images will be screened and studied. During the semester students will sub-mit written responses and critiques to the work presented. Weekly exercises will help develop the students critical reading, thinking, and writing skills. Students will look to their own cultural milieu to make a final image based project in conjunction with a written essay, and create oral/visual presentations. Field trips outside of class are mandatory.

We will study closely the film style of film directors whose work exemplifies different elements of film style: mise-en-sc&egrave;ne and the long take with static camera (Antonioni, Tsai, Tarr); editing in space, shot/reverse shot cutting, eye-line matches, and point-of-view editing (Hitchcock, Ozu); camera movement (Ophuls, Fellini, Tarkovsky); and sound/image montage (Lang, Bresson, Godard). Based on identical scripts, students (working in groups) will be assigned four practical film-based exercises modeled upon the films of these directors.

FILMM-AD 154 Transtextuality: Adaptation Between Novel and Film                                                                              This course treats the theory, practice, and analysis of film adaptations of novels across a broad spectrum that includes novels by such figures as Defoe, Steinbeck, Nabokov, Flaubert, and Clarice Lispector. Combining close readings of the literary source-texts with close analysis of the films, the course will simultaneously explore the &ldquo;transtextuality&rdquo; theory that treats the complex and mutating relations between any single text and all the other texts, genres, media, and discourses with which it comes into dialogue. Through these contrapuntal analyses, the course will demonstrate the myriad ways that adaptation study can illuminate both media.

From the Libyan War of 1911-1912 onwards, film has been integral to shaping public consciousness of military events as they unfold and public memory of wars after the guns have fallen silent. The course looks at feature films and non-fiction, with government and clandestine short films shown as well as commercial entertainment films and independent documentaries. Topics to be addressed include how war&rsquo;s many violences are represented; the filmmakers&rsquo; circumstances (censorship, political agendas and pressures, physical danger, the politics of funding); national cinemas; the role of sound; the camera as weapon; the uses of history; and the operation of memory. Case studies may include the two World Wars, civil wars (Spain, Lebanon), anti-colonial wars, the fall of Communism, the war in Iraq, Vietnam, the Israel-Palestinian conflict; and the Egyptian revolution.    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

It will focus on strong visualization of story and camera techniques, as opposed to dialogue-based work. Students will develop skills in the elements of visual storytelling through the process of storyboarding and creating shot lists, then working in small crews to direct and shoot the projects. Students will gain knowledge of new photographic techniques, moving the camera dynamically, and the ways in which the craft of editing and sound design can be used to support story.

The course explores how documentary and fiction are combined throughout history and in different cultures. We will examine the work of ten filmmakers who have merged both formats creating singular hybrid films. Dramatic reconstructions, manipulated imagery or fictional interstitials are frequently incorporated into documentaries to elevate realism. Conversely, fiction occasionally crosses over into documentary to create a sense of authenticity or truthfulness. Lastly, the division is sometimes completely eradicated making it difficult to distinguish the reality from the imaginary. Over the course of the semester, students will create their own docu-fiction short films. They will bring together fiction and non-fiction story elements reflecting on how each form complements the other.

Beginning with recordings of oral tradition originating in the early empire of Mali to novels addressing the roles of African colonial intermediaries to music protesting apartheid in South Africa, students will engage with a variety of sources of cultural and artistic nature. The course will focus on historical developments such as the Atlantic and internal slave trades, the process of European colonization, religious practice, decolonization, genocide and migration, urbanization, and AIDS. We will also examine various themes, such as local and imposed notions of race and ethnicity, lived experiences of and Africans&rsquo; responses to colonialism on the continent, issues of gender and class, and political resistance. Our broad goal is to investigate to what extent long-term historical dynamics determine the present. Students will not only watch films, listen to music, and read literature, but also read reflections on the methods of using these sources as a way of studying the history of Africa. Course requirements provide students with a language and historical framework for understanding the dynamic history of the continent.

Thinking about how we interface with these tools beyond the mouse and keyboard, we can approach software and electronics as artists and designers and explore new paradigms of interaction with machines and each other. This introductory course will provide students hands-on experience with screen-based and physical interaction design through programming and electronics using microcontrollers, electronics, and writing our own software. Fundamentals of programming and circuit design will supplement readings on human-computer interaction and design theory. Weekly lab exercises encourage students to experiment freely, creating their own novel interfaces and controls for working with machines.

What is media&rsquo;s role in creating culture, influencing political events, forming communities, and archiving? What is ubiquitous computing, embedded computing, physical computing? How is cyberspace merging with physical space and how does participatory media change the face of cultural institutions, historical narratives, and mapping? Students are asked to consider the role of media in their own lives and consider where it both fails and succeeds.

In this course students design sound for ongoing theatrical productions, films by NYUAD students, or installation work, and learn how to approach sound design for these diverse media. Topics such as Automatic Dialog Replacement (ADR), Foley, post-synchronized sound and musique concr&egrave;te techniques are covered, and several examples of sound design for film and theatrical performance are analyzed and discussed in class, leading the students to develop their own conceptual approaches to sound design.    * Prerequiste: MUSIC-AD 106 and MUSIC-AD 120 or equivalent.

THEAT-AD 110 Fundamentals of Acting                                                                              Students begin to build a performance vocabulary by using a range of techniques for translating the actor&rsquo;s imagination into stage action. Students are introduced to the internal and external demands of turning psychology into behavior. Students explore acting fundamentals, such as investing yourself in the moment, genuinely listening, personalizing fictional material; and playing objectives are initially explored via games, improvisations, and exercises, followed by partnered scene work, ensemble technique, and solo performance.

Students build a directorial vocabulary for translating impulse and imagination into compelling narrative and non-narrative staged moments. Using techniques from Brecht, Brook, Grotowski, and Bogart, students learn to articulate ideas to actors in compelling and inspiring ways. Students explore physical exercises to increase their range as directors; tools with which to fuel actors physically and emotionally; and theories of collaboration and ensemble. The core of the class is the exploration of directing as a physical collaboration with actors within a landscape of thought, emotion, openness, and truth.
