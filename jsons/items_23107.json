The program develops the core competencies of content creation and editing, while also emphasizing the business, digital media, and marketing skills that are necessary to secure leadership roles in the industry.   With a goal of exposing you to &quot;real-world, real-workplace&quot; scenarios, the curriculum reflects the most current industry trends, including best practices in e-books, apps, and mobile platforms and video. Your studies begin with core courses that provide a comprehensive framework in the essential elements of the publishing process. Media specialization courses delve into the most critical business aspects of the industry and provide the expertise needed to master them.       The core course requirements are designed to provide you with an in-depth understanding of the most important elements of publishing. While completing the core courses, you also take courses from three media specializations: media content development, media marketing and distribution, and media profitability. Advanced seminars provide a thorough exploration of key industry topics. You complete the program with a capstone project that allows you to draw on the skills you\u2019ve acquired.   While rigorous coursework is key to your success in the program, you also will be provided with numerous opportunities to expand your publishing knowledge outside of the classroom. In addition to industry events and visits, the M.S. in Publishing: Digital and Print Media has developed a strong global program. As the publishing industry becomes not only more digital, but global, an understanding of international publishing practices is imperative. Students are invited to apply for trips to international book fairs and conferences, where they can volunteer their time in return for the opportunity to participate in global events and discussions. In recent years, students have served as marketing, publicity, and educational programming volunteers at the Frankfurt, London, Abu Dhabi, and Sharjah (UAE) international book fairs and at the FIPP International Magazine conference in Rome. These opportunities are underwritten by department grants for a select number of students.

With a focus on both the business and content aspects of the industry, the program offers students a range of courses with practical and real-life application. Courses deal with the marketing, finance, management, accounting, legal, and economic issues facing entertainment and media firms. Industries covered include, film, home video, television, cable, music, sports, and publishing.        &#8211; Message from the Directors          EMT is a unique program that examines the business side of the entertainment industry. The program has formally been in existence for over 10 years and has grown from a few course offerings in marketing to a wide range of courses in marketing, finance, accounting, economics, law, and management at both the graduate and undergraduate level.    EMT has a broad focus on various sectors of the entertainment industry, including film, home video, broadcast TV, cable networks, MSO\u2019s, DTH satellite, publishing (books, newspapers and magazines), sports, and music. Furthermore, the program looks broadly at the different business functions within the industry and how the digital revolution is dramatically challenging and changing existing business models. The MBA and B.S.B.A. curricula blend theory with practical applications. Courses are taught by regular Stern faculty as well as by adjunct professors from leading entertainment firms.    Students gain a broad understanding of the strategy and operating principles that drive the individual sectors of the entertainment industry. Classes are structured to encourage students to explore concepts, frameworks and models, and analyze industry data across multiple revenue streams. Students examine leading companies in the industry, such as Time Warner, Disney, News Corporation, Sony, CBS, Viacom, and Comcast/NBCU.    In a partnership with the Tisch School of the Arts Kanbar Institute of Film and Television, EMT established a dual MBA/MFA degree. This helps bridge the gap between the \u201ccreatives\u201d and the \u201csuits\" and puts NYU at the forefront of preparing the next generation of producers and studio executives.    EMT attracts truly exceptional students who have a passion for the entertainment industry. Organizations such as STEBA (Stern Tisch Entertainment Business Association) for undergraduates, and MESA (Media Entertainment and Sports Association) and TANG (Technology and New Media Group) for graduate students provide forums for networking and co-curricular activities. One such activity is the ProMotion Pictures Film Competition which brings together business and creative talent from MBAs at Stern and MFAs at Tisch to produce branded entertainment films for major companies. Past sponsors include Cisco, Volvo, Verizon, Unilever\u2019s Axe, Heineken, Johnnie Walker, I LOVE NY, and Vita Coco.    Our New York City location, combined with exceptional students, creates a vibrant and exciting learning environment. The faculty and I are committed to provide the very best educational experience to help launch students on challenging and rewarding careers in the entertainment industry.
