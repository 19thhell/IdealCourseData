INTERMEDIATE WORKSHOPS  The intermediate workshops offer budding prose writers and poets an opportunity to continue their pursuit of writing through workshops that focus on a specific genre. The workshops also integrate in-depth craft discussions and extensive outside reading to deepen students\u2019 understanding of the genre and broaden their knowledge of the evolution of literary forms and techniques.     Prerequisite for fiction : CRWRI-UA 815, OR CRWRI-UA 9815, OR CRWRI-UA.816, OR CRWRI-UA 818/819, OR CRWRI-UA 9818/9819, OR CRWRI-UA 9828/9829, OR CRWRI-UA 860, OR COSEM-UA 11 8 or equivalent.

CRWRI-UA.816.001 Intermediate Fiction Workshop Provisional Syllabus Sharon Mesmer , T 3:30-6:15pm Is it possible to write, as Clarice Lispector suggests, both \"squalidly   and structurally\"? I say yes. Both ends of the trajectory are possible   ... and necessary, really, in order to produce surprisingly inventive   writing. In this workshop, we will explore and exploit the fertile   (oftentimes untouched) mud of our imaginations through a series of five   writing exercises paired with model texts, each utilizing a different   prose form into which even the muddiest, most inchoate and problematic   ideas, images and language can be flowed. (Occasionally I will use my   own work to show you how I approached these forms . . . I never give   assignments that I myself haven't tried!) We will discuss the visible   and invisible architectures of these model texts, and how you can deploy   those architectures for your own purposes. Are you an absolute   beginner? an uncertain experimenter? a bitter literary world veteran?   Doesn't matter. The assignments + model texts can be used by anyone at   any level of proficiency. Additionally, having a varied mix of voices is   important, as Bitter Literary World Veteran can always learn something   from Absolute Beginner about (as Jack Kerouac said) being \"submissive to   everything, open, listening.\" Together we'll read, write, discuss,   dissect, experiment and create. Our objectives? 1.) To read, learn   about, and be inspired by, the writings of others, including our fellow   classmates; and 2.) to produce five fully alive pieces of prose that you   would feel confident submitting to magazines (if that's your goal) or   just proud to have written. Surprise!    CRWRI-UA.816.002 Intermediate Fiction Workshop Provisional Syllabus George Foy , R 3:30pm-6:15pm This is a workshop, which means it combines some imparting of alleged wisdom and pompous declaiming by the prof with the absolute best way to perfect your work, i.e., by doing it--writing, writing, writing. The workshop's philosophy is based on the premise that when a writer picks up a pen or opens a laptop to start a story, he or she breaks the connection with \"normal\" time and space to enter a storyworld in which anything is possible. Such a world, if well constructed, will like other complex systems start to generate and follow its own rules and acquire independent life. Too often writers are prevented from taking advantage of this freedom by straitjacket expectations or fear of failure. In this class the idea is to blow fear away, and use any technique or character as long as it works to create a believable world peopled by living characters, described in prose that takes wing and a voice that is recognizably yours. To that end students will be expected to submit 2-3 full-length short stories over the term's course; they will also complete writing exercises and microfictions, in class and on-assignment, every week. Readings are assigned on a regular basis, and readers' reports are due near term's end. We will of course discuss traditional issues in writing, such as elements of craft and ways to nurture and sustain, on the nuts and bolts plane, your writing practice. But we will also explore non-linear stories, illustrated narrative, fiction as street theater, and many other topics too numerous and amusing to list in a course catalogue. CRWRI-UA.816.003 Intermediate Fiction Workshop Provisional Syllabus Marie-Helene Bertino , M 6:20pm-9:05pm This class will explore the craft of fiction in three different ways. The first will be brief talks that address a different element of craft in each class. The second will be by reading and dissecting (like writers!) a broad range of contemporary fiction, from experimentalists like Etgar Keret and Aimee Bender, to whip smart traditionalists like Alice Munro, Charles Baxter, and Anton Chekov, to subtle post-modern visionaries like Raymond Carver, Denis Johnson, and Amy Hempel. The third and most important component of the class will be workshopping student work with this question in mind: where do I think this writer/story is trying to go? We will tailor our critiques toward the idea of helping the writer get there. We will have surprise guests by professional writers. We will eschew the idea that there is one way to write fiction. We will seek out the joy in our work and the work of others and will cultivate our personal, idiosyncratic voices.    CRWRI-UA.816.004 Intermediate Fiction Workshop Provisional Syllabus Adam Wilson , R 4:55pm-7:40pm This is a workshop-style class that will focus on the short story. Students will primarily be writing their own stories and critiquing the work of their peers. But we'll also read stories and short essays by both past masters and contemporary writers that demonstrate a variety of styles and strategies. We'll think about stories from the perspective of craft in an effort to better our understanding of how the short story works.    CRWRI-UA.816.005 Intermediate Fiction Workshop Provisional Syllabus Justin Taylor , T 6:20-9:05pm In this workshop, we'll focus on reading and writing short fiction. Since this is a workshop, we'll naturally devote most of our time to peer reading and critique, but we'll also read stories by acknowledged masters of the form, as well as newer work whose status remains to be determined--by us, perhaps. Whether we're reading published stories or student work our goals will be the same: to understand how a given story functions, to determine how and why it succeeds or fails (hopefully we won't all agree too much on this) and to identify techniques that we can adapt for use in our own fiction. We'll place a strong emphasis on editing and revision, so please come prepared to kill your darlings.    CRWRI-UA.816.006 Intermediate Fiction Workshop Syllabus Jeffery Renard Allen , M 11:00am-1:45pm In this workshop we will focus on the craft of fiction with the work of every writer in the class at the center. Therefore, a significant portion of every class session will be devoted to workshopping the original manuscripts of every writer in the class for the purpose of offering constructive feedback about these manuscripts. In addition, we will also read and discuss several assigned texts to engage in a writerly conversation about such important matters as the creative process and the imagination, the sources of fiction, and the importance of revision. As well, each week we will discuss a published story or novel to emphasize one fundamental fact, namely that most of what we learn about writing fiction comes from reading. So we will read some exemplary works to better our understanding of the elements of fiction such as conflict, character, setting, structure, and point of view.    CRWRI-UA.816.007 Intermediate Fiction Workshop Provisional Syllabus Katie Kitamura , M 4:55pm-7:40pm This is a workshop for anyone who wants to deepen their fiction writing skills. In-class exercises will help students learn the fundamentals of dialogue, setting, characterization and psychology. Reading attentively is a key part of writing; to that end we will look at novels and short stories from a range of writers including Marguerite Duras, Elfriede Jelinek, Roberto Bola\u00f1o, and Arkady and Boris Strugatsky. This workshop is for students who have taken the Creative Writing: Introduction to Poetry and Fiction course. Students will be expected to present their own work in class, and respond thoughtfully to the work of classmates. CRWRI-UA.816.008 Intermediate Fiction Workshop Provisional Syllabus Mira Jacob , F 11:00am-1:45pm Remember that last story or book you really loved? Well, there was a reason for it. Sure, it was compelling and original and all of that, but beyond that, it had a ticking plot, or a compelling narrator, or such fluid pacing that you could not help but fall into the spell that readers of fiction have for centuries. So let's go back into that story. Let's take it apart and see what you can glean from it and use for your own. Nothing is quite as fun as learning from the best, right? This is a course for those interested in getting actual nut-and-bolts knowledge about writing fiction. We will discuss basic elements \u2014 like character, plot development, voice, point of view, pacing, and structure, and read everyone from Junot Diaz and Katherine Mansfield to get a grip on our own craft. Come prepared to read carefully and write boldly.  CRWRI-UA.817.001 Intermediate Poetry Workshop Provisional Syllabus Arda Collins , W 3:30pm-6:15pm The poet Federico Garcia Lorca refers to it as \u201cblack sounds.\u201d Goethe describes it as \u201ca mysterious power which everyone senses and no philosopher explains.\u201d In a letter to his brothers, Keats arrived at calling it \u201cnegative capability.\u201d What can they possibly mean? The question is, where does poetry come from and what is it? To attempt an answer to this question, our workshop will focus on close reading, of published work and of course your own poems. As we create new work, our conversation will focus on understanding what our poems are doing and how. When you open your mouth, why are these the sounds ou make? The reading selections for this course are from a spectrum of time periods and traditions so that you will see what is possible in a poem and acquire a greater understanding of the formal elements of poetry. Writing exercises are way of exploring what we\u2019ve read to understand it more intimately, and to open new directions for your own work.    CRWRI-UA.817.002 Intermediate Poetry Workshop Provisional Syllabus Ada Lim\u00f3n , M 4:55pm-7:40pm Fortunately and unfortunately there is nothing simple or easy about poetry. As an art form it is complex, strange, frustrating, generous, mysterious, and electrifying. What makes it so powerful and yet so indescribable? In this workshop we'll learn to define poetry on our own terms while entering the larger literary conversation with those that came before us. With an emphasis on creating an open and supportive environment for presenting and discussing original work, this intermediate poetry workshop will be designed to make us all better writers, readers, and empathetic critics. Students can expect to read a wide range of both classic and contemporary poetry while exploring poetic structure, responding to unique writing prompts, and learning how to raise the stakes in their own work. CRWRI-UA.817.003 Intermediate Poetry Workshop Provisional Syllabus Robert Fitterman , T 3:30pm-6:15pm In 1871, Arthur Rimbaud declared that \"the invention of the unknown demands new forms,\" and for over 100 years innovative poets have been beckoned to uncover or invent forms for the unknown or for their own present condition. New times require new forms, and in the tradition of the avant-garde and experimental writing, this course will introduce you to several new poetic strategies and to the poets who employ them. In addition to workshopping, each week we will write poems in-class that are inspired by or modeled after the strategies we study. Some of these experiments might include: sampling, procedural writing, mixed media, collaboration, conceptual writing, appropriation, etc. The course also requires that you present your writing 2-3 times during the semester, participate in a collaborative project, and turn in a small \"book\" of your writing at the end of the term.

As an art form it is complex, strange, frustrating, generous, mysterious, and electrifying. What makes it so powerful and yet so indescribable? In this workshop we'll learn to define poetry on our own terms while entering the larger literary conversation with those that came before us. With an emphasis on creating an open and supportive environment for presenting and discussing original work, this intermediate poetry workshop will be designed to make us all better writers, readers, and empathetic critics. Students can expect to read a wide range of both classic and contemporary poetry while exploring poetic structure, responding to unique writing prompts, and learning how to raise the stakes in their own work. CRWRI-UA.817.005 Intermediate Poetry Workshop Provisional Syllabus Geoffrey Nutter , M 9:30am-12:15pm Surprising, disorienting, beautiful, lyrical, dream-like, fantastic, difficult, intense--a poem exists in a strange realm of ambiguity and can be all of these things at once. And poets in 14th century England, 10th century China, or 18th century Japan used the same raw materials as poets in 21st century America: dreams, strong or ambivalent emotions, the natural world, experience in its many forms, and language. In this class we will look with fresh eyes at some of the most amazing poems of the past, present, and future, asking not what they mean, but rather how they mean and what they do. We will also discuss the kinds of things that poems are uniquely capable of doing--those things that make poetry exceptional in the world of the creative arts. In other words, we will approach the reading of poems as writers of poems. Focused and rigorous discussions of our fellow students' poems will further help us hone our craft.    CRWRI-UA.825.001 Intermediate Creative Nonfiction Workshop Provisional Syllabus Charles Taylor , R 4:55pm-7:40pm I'm frequently asked why I don't write my memoirs, the film critic Pauline Kael said in the piece the closed out her years at the New Yorker. \"I think I have.\" The division between the critical and the personal essay seems to collapse when we allow that both are motivated by the writer's own unique sensibility. And that while each start in the personal, each suggests a breadth of concern and features a range of reference that goes beyond the insularity of \"I.\" Beginning with several memoirs-- I Remember by Joe Brainard; Men We Reaped by Jesmyn Ward; Low Down by A.J. Albany--we will see how the best memoirists address larger concerns than just themselves, and then how a personal sensibility is brought to bear on subjects that are not explicitly autobiographical. Through close reading, vigorous class discussion, and writing assignments which we will later workshop together, students will be encouraged to define their own sensibilities and apply them to subjects that are explicitly personal and those not traditionally considered personal. Each student will be required to write a personal essay, a cultural essay, and a sociopolitical essay. The great French filmmaker Francois Truffaut said that for him a movie must express an idea of the world and an idea of cinema. Substitute \"writing\" for cinema, and you have a succinct description of the territory this class will explore. CRWRI-UA.825.002 Intermediate Creative Nonfiction Workshop Provisional Syllabus  Clifford Thompson , W 3:30pm-6:15pm                       In this course students will read and discuss published essays that fall into three categories: \"The Personal in the Journalistic,\" or works that combine discussion of the writers' personal lives with discussions of outside subjects; \"Trouble,\" or essays that describe predicaments the writers faced; and \"People You Know,\" in which writers evoke figures from their lives. The published essays we discuss will be grouped in the order given above. As we conclude each grouping, students will turn in personal essays, at least 1,500 words in length, related to that particular topic. (As indicated below, \"Personal in the Journalistic\" essays are due February 18, \"Trouble\" essays April 8, and \"People You Know\" May 6, the last day of class.) In addition, each week two students will have pieces workshopped, according to a schedule to be handed out on the first day of class. Workshopped pieces do not have to fit in any of the three categories, but any workshopped piece may be revised and submitted as one of the three category essays. Workshopped pieces will also be at least 1,500 words. Finally, each week students will participate in an in-class exercise.              ADVANCED WORKSHOPS Advanced workshops provide emerging writers with the opportunity to hone their individual voice and experiment with different aesthetical strategies in a genre-specific workshop taught by an eminent writer in the field. The workshops focus on innovative revision techniques, the development of a sustainable writing process, and the broadening of students\u2019 literary knowledge of classical and contemporary masters. Each advanced workshop has a distinct emphasis and area of exploration\u2014students are advised to pay close attention to the course descriptions, which are available online prior to registration.

CRWRI-UA.820.001 Advanced Fiction Workshop Provisional Syllabus    Marcelle Clements , T 2:00pm-4:45pm What makes a story powerful? In this intensive course, we will explore the uses of emotion (or its absence), narrative intimacy, creating and sustaining ambiance by wielding resonant details, integrating eroticism, violence and vision. For models and inspiration, we will study the strategies of writers who thrill, seduce, move, disturb, or taunt the reader. In addition, we will attempt to improve the flow and consistency of our writing practice. Our class discussion is central to this enterprise, and participation is required, as are weekly assignments of writing and reading.  CRWRI-UA.820.002 Advanced Fiction Workshop Provisional Syllabus Charles Bock , M 11:00am-1:45pm Class is divided into lectures, exercises, and workshop. Lots of time will be spent on technical stuff, how characters work, the way in which a story develops, language, structure, etc. Weekly lectures start things off with an emphasis on craft, craft, craft. We'll build from the basics (because you can't break rules without knowing why you need to break them, and this requires knowing rules). We'll do exercises related to the lectures. Then workshops for the second half of the class. Workshops are structured so every student will comment on a story, and participation is a big part of a class. We care about improving stories and why they work and how they can be improved; we care about supporting our fellow students in their creative ventures and being daring and moving into uncharted narrative territories; however, please know, whether you like something matters to me not at all. In fact, during workshop, if someone says, \"I liked...\" the student (or teacher) will be responsible for bringing cupcakes to the next session (elements of a story either work or they don't work, we understand them or we don't, whereas all children blindly like a nice, sweet treat). If you don't care for this rule, or any of my other rules, I understand; there are other amazing teachers at NYU. Of course, we'll have weekly reading assignments--short stories, mostly from contemporary authors. There will be weekly one page assignments based on something from a lecture and/or short story. If I feel that students are not reading their homework assignments, I will quiz you and your grades will reflect the results. Students also will be chained to one novel for the entirety of the term, and will write occasional short essays on the various aspects of their novel (how action x was developed through the novel, the character trait that reminded me of y from my own life...). When you come out from the other side of this thrilling little amusement park ride, the matter inside your fused together skull is going to have a better understanding of how fiction works.  CRWRI-UA.820.003 Advanced Fiction Workshop Syllabus Elizabeth Gaffney , M 3:30pm-6:15pm Our goals are: to learn the writers process through studying a dozen masters of the form, write a page of new prose every day and, drawing from those pages, to create and revise a new short story. In this class: we will write \u2014 in class and out. We will read short stories \u2014 yours and those of a dozen renowned short story writers. We will analyze the writer's process \u2014 both yours and that of our writers, through reading \u2014 and occasionally conducting \u2014 interviews.  CRWRI-UA.830.001 Advanced Poetry Workshop Provisional Syllabus  Elaine Equi , F 2:00pm-4:45pm The goal of this course is to help you approach your writing in a more expansive way and to make you more prolific. This semester we'll draw on a variety of styles spanning from the engaging immediacy of performance poetry, to the startling juxtapositions of experimental writing. In the process, we'll touch on Surrealism, Objectivism, and The New York School for inspiration and techniques. I'm hoping that as a result, you'll gain a clearer sense of your own voice and interests, as well as a number of exciting ways to develop new work in the future. Weekly writing assignments will be a mix of traditional and invented forms. Possible topics include serial poems, ekphrastic poems, documentary and interview poems, poems about pop culture, the supernatural, and more. Critiques will focus on recognizing your strengths, creative strategies for revision, and preparing your work for publication. You can expect to write one poem per week, do an oral presentation, and keep a journal.  CRWRI-UA.830.002 Advanced Poetry Workshop Provisional Syllabus Catherine Barnett , W 8:00am-10:45am In this challenging workshop, we'll invent and re-invent and dodge and entertain and investigate \"the accursed questions\" as a way to generate new material for poems and to read more deeply. We'll consider James Baldwin's notion that \"the purpose of art is to lay bare the questions hidden by the answers\" and push for that which is \"not unforeseen enough.\" Through thinking about and playing with the resources of questions, we'll try to subvert conventional notions of what is important and unimportant; we'll try to redeem incongruities; discover the mysteries behind physical appearances; and find ways to apprehend the real without distorting \"the incomprehensibility of the real.\" We'll consider what Yeats has said: \"Only that which does not teach, which does not cry out, which does not persuade, which does not condescend, which does not explain, is irresistible.\" Students will be asked to write two poems every week and to respond generously and rigorously to each other's work. In addition, students will give a presentation on a poet/question of their choice and put together an anthology and a chapbook. CRWRI-UA.830.003 Advanced Poetry Workshop Provisional Syllabus Matthew Rohrer , M 11:00am-1:45pm This course is designed to plunge students head-first into the world of contemporary poetry. Besides workshopping each others\u2019 poems, students will read a different book of contemporary poetry each week, and present it to the class. We will discuss the book as writers, not literature students; we\u2019ll want to figure out what each poet is doing, how he or she does it, and how we can do that. Writing exercises derived from the readings will help us get into the poets\u2019 heads. This is an advanced course, and students will be expected to do all of the reading, participate in the discussions, and generally contribute towards that elusive thing which is a workshop environment that is constructive and critical and ultimately generative for everyone. The goal of the course is for students to engage with the work of their peers and their contemporaries in a critical and hungry manner which will lead to a greater understanding of how their own poetry is working.  CRWRI-UA.850.001 Advanced Creative Nonfiction Workshop Provisional Syllabus Marcelle Clements , R 2:00pm-4:45pm Confession, Autobiography and Auto-Fiction: In this intensive class we write at the intersection of fiction and non-fiction, criss-crossing various genres. The memoir and the faux-memoir, the letter, the diary, the short fiction in which the author's voice seems eerily authentic -- these are the forms that have transformed publishing in the last two decades. We will explore the possibilities of first-person narratives, all the while we continue to work hard at the level of the sentence and the paragraph. In addition, we will attempt to improve the flow and consistency of our writing practice. Our class discussion is central to this enterprise, and participation is required, as are weekly assignments of writing and reading.

CRWRI-UA.860.001 Master Class in Fiction Rick Moody , M 11:00am-1:40pm This is a workshop for people who have experience in workshops, but who are ready to experiment, think outside of the formulae for conventional fiction writing, and above all who are willing to work hard on rewriting and perfecting work in a supportive and collegial atmosphere. We'll be doing a lot of reading as well as short writing assignments for the first half of the semester--some of these assignments about story structure and some about voice and form--in order to prepare for writing a longer story or two as final projects. Solid attendance and contribution to class discussion a must, as well as attentiveness to grammar and paragraphing. CRWRI-UA.870.001 Master Class in Poetry Kimiko Hahn , T 11:00am-1:40pm Law-enforcement code for burglary, \"breaking-and-entering\" will be our strategy for reading, writing, revising, as well as critiquing. Readings will include Yusef Komunyakaa, Claudia Rankine, and Dorothy Lasky. CRWRI-UA.880.001 Master Class in Creative Nonfiction David Lipsky , T 11:00am-1:40pm How do we write non-fiction--how do we make what feels important to us (the necessary information that feels almost too big to not say) important to readers? In this workshop, we'll explore how to cut and pave that highway between other people and ourselves: how to make that information feel necessary on the other end. Lots of this will be the technical material of workshop: openings, drafts, editing peers, self-editing, the freedom of revision. We'll discuss how to report and what it's like to interview. And since every strong piece of writing includes its own DIY guide--for how to write and how to get inspired about the walk to the keyboard--we'll also look at memoirs and essays by some great non-fictionists: Martin Amis, Joan Didion, David Foster Wallace, Pauline Kael. We'll explore the practice the writing. (Lorrie Moore says the difference between a writer and a non-writer is the non-writer thinks she'll remember it in the morning.)

Do the trappings of &quot;literary fiction&quot; sometimes feel constraining to you as a writer? Do the settings feel too familiar, the conventions too tame for the story you want to tell? Could your story use a cowboy? A flesh-eating zombie? In this course, students will examine and write in different genres, from mystery to science fiction, western to horror. While the course will include close, textual readings of works by authors such as Stephen King, Kelly Link, Ursula K. Le Guin, Koji Suzuki, Walter Mosley, Karen Russell, Elmore Leonard, and Max Brooks, the majority of each class will be spent workshopping student fiction.

INTERMEDIATE WORKSHOPS  The intermediate workshops offer budding prose writers and poets an opportunity to continue their pursuit of writing through workshops that focus on a specific genre. The workshops also integrate in-depth craft discussions and extensive outside reading to deepen students\u2019 understanding of the genre and broaden their knowledge of the evolution of literary forms and techniques.     Prerequisite for fiction : CRWRI-UA 815, OR CRWRI-UA 9815, OR CRWRI-UA.816, OR CRWRI-UA 818/819, OR CRWRI-UA 9818/9819, OR CRWRI-UA 9828/9829, OR CRWRI-UA 860, OR COSEM-UA 11 8 or equivalent. Prerequisite for poetry : CRWRI-UA 815, OR CRWRI-UA 9815, OR CRWRI-UA.817, OR CRWRI-UA 818/819, OR CRWRI-UA 9818/9819, OR CRWRI-UA 9828/9829, OR CRWRI-UA.870, OR FRSEM-UA 38 8 or equivalent. Prerequisite for creative nonfiction : CRWRI-UA 815, OR CRWRI-UA 9815, OR CRWRI-UA 818/819, OR CRWRI-UA 9818/9819, OR CRWRI-UA 9828/9829, OR CRWRI-UA 825, OR CRWRI-UA.880 or equivalent. 4 points.  CRWRI-UA.816.001 Intermediate Fiction Workshop Provisional Syllabus Sharon Mesmer , T 3:30-6:15pm Is it possible to write, as Clarice Lispector suggests, both \"squalidly   and structurally\"? I say yes. Both ends of the trajectory are possible   ... and necessary, really, in order to produce surprisingly inventive   writing. In this workshop, we will explore and exploit the fertile   (oftentimes untouched) mud of our imaginations through a series of five   writing exercises paired with model texts, each utilizing a different   prose form into which even the muddiest, most inchoate and problematic   ideas, images and language can be flowed. (Occasionally I will use my   own work to show you how I approached these forms . . . I never give   assignments that I myself haven't tried!) We will discuss the visible   and invisible architectures of these model texts, and how you can deploy   those architectures for your own purposes. Are you an absolute   beginner? an uncertain experimenter? a bitter literary world veteran?   Doesn't matter. The assignments + model texts can be used by anyone at   any level of proficiency. Additionally, having a varied mix of voices is   important, as Bitter Literary World Veteran can always learn something   from Absolute Beginner about (as Jack Kerouac said) being \"submissive to   everything, open, listening.\" Together we'll read, write, discuss,   dissect, experiment and create. Our objectives? 1.) To read, learn   about, and be inspired by, the writings of others, including our fellow   classmates; and 2.) to produce five fully alive pieces of prose that you   would feel confident submitting to magazines (if that's your goal) or   just proud to have written. Surprise!    CRWRI-UA.816.002 Intermediate Fiction Workshop Provisional Syllabus George Foy , R 3:30pm-6:15pm This is a workshop, which means it combines some imparting of alleged wisdom and pompous declaiming by the prof with the absolute best way to perfect your work, i.e., by doing it--writing, writing, writing. The workshop's philosophy is based on the premise that when a writer picks up a pen or opens a laptop to start a story, he or she breaks the connection with \"normal\" time and space to enter a storyworld in which anything is possible. Such a world, if well constructed, will like other complex systems start to generate and follow its own rules and acquire independent life. Too often writers are prevented from taking advantage of this freedom by straitjacket expectations or fear of failure. In this class the idea is to blow fear away, and use any technique or character as long as it works to create a believable world peopled by living characters, described in prose that takes wing and a voice that is recognizably yours. To that end students will be expected to submit 2-3 full-length short stories over the term's course; they will also complete writing exercises and microfictions, in class and on-assignment, every week. Readings are assigned on a regular basis, and readers' reports are due near term's end. We will of course discuss traditional issues in writing, such as elements of craft and ways to nurture and sustain, on the nuts and bolts plane, your writing practice. But we will also explore non-linear stories, illustrated narrative, fiction as street theater, and many other topics too numerous and amusing to list in a course catalogue. CRWRI-UA.816.003 Intermediate Fiction Workshop Provisional Syllabus Marie-Helene Bertino , M 6:20pm-9:05pm This class will explore the craft of fiction in three different ways. The first will be brief talks that address a different element of craft in each class. The second will be by reading and dissecting (like writers!) a broad range of contemporary fiction, from experimentalists like Etgar Keret and Aimee Bender, to whip smart traditionalists like Alice Munro, Charles Baxter, and Anton Chekov, to subtle post-modern visionaries like Raymond Carver, Denis Johnson, and Amy Hempel. The third and most important component of the class will be workshopping student work with this question in mind: where do I think this writer/story is trying to go? We will tailor our critiques toward the idea of helping the writer get there. We will have surprise guests by professional writers. We will eschew the idea that there is one way to write fiction. We will seek out the joy in our work and the work of others and will cultivate our personal, idiosyncratic voices.    CRWRI-UA.816.004 Intermediate Fiction Workshop Provisional Syllabus Adam Wilson , R 4:55pm-7:40pm This is a workshop-style class that will focus on the short story. Students will primarily be writing their own stories and critiquing the work of their peers. But we'll also read stories and short essays by both past masters and contemporary writers that demonstrate a variety of styles and strategies. We'll think about stories from the perspective of craft in an effort to better our understanding of how the short story works.    CRWRI-UA.816.005 Intermediate Fiction Workshop Provisional Syllabus Justin Taylor , T 6:20-9:05pm In this workshop, we'll focus on reading and writing short fiction. Since this is a workshop, we'll naturally devote most of our time to peer reading and critique, but we'll also read stories by acknowledged masters of the form, as well as newer work whose status remains to be determined--by us, perhaps. Whether we're reading published stories or student work our goals will be the same: to understand how a given story functions, to determine how and why it succeeds or fails (hopefully we won't all agree too much on this) and to identify techniques that we can adapt for use in our own fiction. We'll place a strong emphasis on editing and revision, so please come prepared to kill your darlings.    CRWRI-UA.816.006 Intermediate Fiction Workshop Syllabus Jeffery Renard Allen , M 11:00am-1:45pm In this workshop we will focus on the craft of fiction with the work of every writer in the class at the center. Therefore, a significant portion of every class session will be devoted to workshopping the original manuscripts of every writer in the class for the purpose of offering constructive feedback about these manuscripts. In addition, we will also read and discuss several assigned texts to engage in a writerly conversation about such important matters as the creative process and the imagination, the sources of fiction, and the importance of revision. As well, each week we will discuss a published story or novel to emphasize one fundamental fact, namely that most of what we learn about writing fiction comes from reading. So we will read some exemplary works to better our understanding of the elements of fiction such as conflict, character, setting, structure, and point of view.    CRWRI-UA.816.007 Intermediate Fiction Workshop Provisional Syllabus Katie Kitamura , M 4:55pm-7:40pm This is a workshop for anyone who wants to deepen their fiction writing skills. In-class exercises will help students learn the fundamentals of dialogue, setting, characterization and psychology. Reading attentively is a key part of writing; to that end we will look at novels and short stories from a range of writers including Marguerite Duras, Elfriede Jelinek, Roberto Bola\u00f1o, and Arkady and Boris Strugatsky. This workshop is for students who have taken the Creative Writing: Introduction to Poetry and Fiction course. Students will be expected to present their own work in class, and respond thoughtfully to the work of classmates. CRWRI-UA.816.008 Intermediate Fiction Workshop Provisional Syllabus Mira Jacob , F 11:00am-1:45pm Remember that last story or book you really loved? Well, there was a reason for it. Sure, it was compelling and original and all of that, but beyond that, it had a ticking plot, or a compelling narrator, or such fluid pacing that you could not help but fall into the spell that readers of fiction have for centuries. So let's go back into that story. Let's take it apart and see what you can glean from it and use for your own. Nothing is quite as fun as learning from the best, right? This is a course for those interested in getting actual nut-and-bolts knowledge about writing fiction. We will discuss basic elements \u2014 like character, plot development, voice, point of view, pacing, and structure, and read everyone from Junot Diaz and Katherine Mansfield to get a grip on our own craft. Come prepared to read carefully and write boldly.  CRWRI-UA.817.001 Intermediate Poetry Workshop Provisional Syllabus Arda Collins , W 3:30pm-6:15pm The poet Federico Garcia Lorca refers to it as \u201cblack sounds.\u201d Goethe describes it as \u201ca mysterious power which everyone senses and no philosopher explains.\u201d In a letter to his brothers, Keats arrived at calling it \u201cnegative capability.\u201d What can they possibly mean? The question is, where does poetry come from and what is it? To attempt an answer to this question, our workshop will focus on close reading, of published work and of course your own poems. As we create new work, our conversation will focus on understanding what our poems are doing and how. When you open your mouth, why are these the sounds ou make? The reading selections for this course are from a spectrum of time periods and traditions so that you will see what is possible in a poem and acquire a greater understanding of the formal elements of poetry. Writing exercises are way of exploring what we\u2019ve read to understand it more intimately, and to open new directions for your own work.    CRWRI-UA.817.002 Intermediate Poetry Workshop Provisional Syllabus Ada Lim\u00f3n , M 4:55pm-7:40pm Fortunately and unfortunately there is nothing simple or easy about poetry. As an art form it is complex, strange, frustrating, generous, mysterious, and electrifying. What makes it so powerful and yet so indescribable? In this workshop we'll learn to define poetry on our own terms while entering the larger literary conversation with those that came before us. With an emphasis on creating an open and supportive environment for presenting and discussing original work, this intermediate poetry workshop will be designed to make us all better writers, readers, and empathetic critics. Students can expect to read a wide range of both classic and contemporary poetry while exploring poetic structure, responding to unique writing prompts, and learning how to raise the stakes in their own work. CRWRI-UA.817.003 Intermediate Poetry Workshop Provisional Syllabus Robert Fitterman , T 3:30pm-6:15pm In 1871, Arthur Rimbaud declared that \"the invention of the unknown demands new forms,\" and for over 100 years innovative poets have been beckoned to uncover or invent forms for the unknown or for their own present condition. New times require new forms, and in the tradition of the avant-garde and experimental writing, this course will introduce you to several new poetic strategies and to the poets who employ them. In addition to workshopping, each week we will write poems in-class that are inspired by or modeled after the strategies we study. Some of these experiments might include: sampling, procedural writing, mixed media, collaboration, conceptual writing, appropriation, etc. The course also requires that you present your writing 2-3 times during the semester, participate in a collaborative project, and turn in a small \"book\" of your writing at the end of the term.    CRWRI-UA.817.004 Intermediate Poetry Workshop Provisional Syllabus Ada Lim\u00f3n , M 11:00am-1:45pm Fortunately and unfortunately there is nothing simple or easy about poetry. As an art form it is complex, strange, frustrating, generous, mysterious, and electrifying. What makes it so powerful and yet so indescribable? In this workshop we'll learn to define poetry on our own terms while entering the larger literary conversation with those that came before us.

Students can expect to read a wide range of both classic and contemporary poetry while exploring poetic structure, responding to unique writing prompts, and learning how to raise the stakes in their own work. CRWRI-UA.817.005 Intermediate Poetry Workshop Provisional Syllabus Geoffrey Nutter , M 9:30am-12:15pm Surprising, disorienting, beautiful, lyrical, dream-like, fantastic, difficult, intense--a poem exists in a strange realm of ambiguity and can be all of these things at once. And poets in 14th century England, 10th century China, or 18th century Japan used the same raw materials as poets in 21st century America: dreams, strong or ambivalent emotions, the natural world, experience in its many forms, and language. In this class we will look with fresh eyes at some of the most amazing poems of the past, present, and future, asking not what they mean, but rather how they mean and what they do. We will also discuss the kinds of things that poems are uniquely capable of doing--those things that make poetry exceptional in the world of the creative arts. In other words, we will approach the reading of poems as writers of poems. Focused and rigorous discussions of our fellow students' poems will further help us hone our craft.    CRWRI-UA.825.001 Intermediate Creative Nonfiction Workshop Provisional Syllabus Charles Taylor , R 4:55pm-7:40pm I'm frequently asked why I don't write my memoirs, the film critic Pauline Kael said in the piece the closed out her years at the New Yorker. \"I think I have.\" The division between the critical and the personal essay seems to collapse when we allow that both are motivated by the writer's own unique sensibility. And that while each start in the personal, each suggests a breadth of concern and features a range of reference that goes beyond the insularity of \"I.\" Beginning with several memoirs-- I Remember by Joe Brainard; Men We Reaped by Jesmyn Ward; Low Down by A.J. Albany--we will see how the best memoirists address larger concerns than just themselves, and then how a personal sensibility is brought to bear on subjects that are not explicitly autobiographical. Through close reading, vigorous class discussion, and writing assignments which we will later workshop together, students will be encouraged to define their own sensibilities and apply them to subjects that are explicitly personal and those not traditionally considered personal. Each student will be required to write a personal essay, a cultural essay, and a sociopolitical essay. The great French filmmaker Francois Truffaut said that for him a movie must express an idea of the world and an idea of cinema. Substitute \"writing\" for cinema, and you have a succinct description of the territory this class will explore. CRWRI-UA.825.002 Intermediate Creative Nonfiction Workshop Provisional Syllabus  Clifford Thompson , W 3:30pm-6:15pm                       In this course students will read and discuss published essays that fall into three categories: \"The Personal in the Journalistic,\" or works that combine discussion of the writers' personal lives with discussions of outside subjects; \"Trouble,\" or essays that describe predicaments the writers faced; and \"People You Know,\" in which writers evoke figures from their lives. The published essays we discuss will be grouped in the order given above. As we conclude each grouping, students will turn in personal essays, at least 1,500 words in length, related to that particular topic. (As indicated below, \"Personal in the Journalistic\" essays are due February 18, \"Trouble\" essays April 8, and \"People You Know\" May 6, the last day of class.) In addition, each week two students will have pieces workshopped, according to a schedule to be handed out on the first day of class. Workshopped pieces do not have to fit in any of the three categories, but any workshopped piece may be revised and submitted as one of the three category essays. Workshopped pieces will also be at least 1,500 words. Finally, each week students will participate in an in-class exercise.              ADVANCED WORKSHOPS Advanced workshops provide emerging writers with the opportunity to hone their individual voice and experiment with different aesthetical strategies in a genre-specific workshop taught by an eminent writer in the field. The workshops focus on innovative revision techniques, the development of a sustainable writing process, and the broadening of students\u2019 literary knowledge of classical and contemporary masters. Each advanced workshop has a distinct emphasis and area of exploration\u2014students are advised to pay close attention to the course descriptions, which are available online prior to registration.    Prerequisite for fiction : CRWRI-UA 816, OR CRWRI-UA 818, OR CRWRI-UA 9818, OR CRWRI-UA 9828, OR CRWRI-UA 820, OR CRWRI-UA 860 or equivalent. Prerequisite for poetry : CRWRI-UA 817, OR CRWRI-UA 819, OR CRWRI-UA 9819, OR CRWRI-UA 9829, OR CRWRI-UA 830, OR CRWRI-UA 870 or equivalent . Prerequisite for creative nonfiction : CRWRI-UA 825, OR CRWRI-UA 850, OR CRWRI-UA 880 or equivalent. 4 points. CRWRI-UA.820.001 Advanced Fiction Workshop Provisional Syllabus    Marcelle Clements , T 2:00pm-4:45pm What makes a story powerful? In this intensive course, we will explore the uses of emotion (or its absence), narrative intimacy, creating and sustaining ambiance by wielding resonant details, integrating eroticism, violence and vision. For models and inspiration, we will study the strategies of writers who thrill, seduce, move, disturb, or taunt the reader. In addition, we will attempt to improve the flow and consistency of our writing practice. Our class discussion is central to this enterprise, and participation is required, as are weekly assignments of writing and reading.  CRWRI-UA.820.002 Advanced Fiction Workshop Provisional Syllabus Charles Bock , M 11:00am-1:45pm Class is divided into lectures, exercises, and workshop. Lots of time will be spent on technical stuff, how characters work, the way in which a story develops, language, structure, etc. Weekly lectures start things off with an emphasis on craft, craft, craft. We'll build from the basics (because you can't break rules without knowing why you need to break them, and this requires knowing rules). We'll do exercises related to the lectures. Then workshops for the second half of the class. Workshops are structured so every student will comment on a story, and participation is a big part of a class. We care about improving stories and why they work and how they can be improved; we care about supporting our fellow students in their creative ventures and being daring and moving into uncharted narrative territories; however, please know, whether you like something matters to me not at all. In fact, during workshop, if someone says, \"I liked...\" the student (or teacher) will be responsible for bringing cupcakes to the next session (elements of a story either work or they don't work, we understand them or we don't, whereas all children blindly like a nice, sweet treat). If you don't care for this rule, or any of my other rules, I understand; there are other amazing teachers at NYU. Of course, we'll have weekly reading assignments--short stories, mostly from contemporary authors. There will be weekly one page assignments based on something from a lecture and/or short story. If I feel that students are not reading their homework assignments, I will quiz you and your grades will reflect the results. Students also will be chained to one novel for the entirety of the term, and will write occasional short essays on the various aspects of their novel (how action x was developed through the novel, the character trait that reminded me of y from my own life...). When you come out from the other side of this thrilling little amusement park ride, the matter inside your fused together skull is going to have a better understanding of how fiction works.  CRWRI-UA.820.003 Advanced Fiction Workshop Syllabus Elizabeth Gaffney , M 3:30pm-6:15pm Our goals are: to learn the writers process through studying a dozen masters of the form, write a page of new prose every day and, drawing from those pages, to create and revise a new short story. In this class: we will write \u2014 in class and out. We will read short stories \u2014 yours and those of a dozen renowned short story writers. We will analyze the writer's process \u2014 both yours and that of our writers, through reading \u2014 and occasionally conducting \u2014 interviews.  CRWRI-UA.830.001 Advanced Poetry Workshop Provisional Syllabus  Elaine Equi , F 2:00pm-4:45pm The goal of this course is to help you approach your writing in a more expansive way and to make you more prolific. This semester we'll draw on a variety of styles spanning from the engaging immediacy of performance poetry, to the startling juxtapositions of experimental writing. In the process, we'll touch on Surrealism, Objectivism, and The New York School for inspiration and techniques. I'm hoping that as a result, you'll gain a clearer sense of your own voice and interests, as well as a number of exciting ways to develop new work in the future. Weekly writing assignments will be a mix of traditional and invented forms. Possible topics include serial poems, ekphrastic poems, documentary and interview poems, poems about pop culture, the supernatural, and more. Critiques will focus on recognizing your strengths, creative strategies for revision, and preparing your work for publication. You can expect to write one poem per week, do an oral presentation, and keep a journal.  CRWRI-UA.830.002 Advanced Poetry Workshop Provisional Syllabus Catherine Barnett , W 8:00am-10:45am In this challenging workshop, we'll invent and re-invent and dodge and entertain and investigate \"the accursed questions\" as a way to generate new material for poems and to read more deeply. We'll consider James Baldwin's notion that \"the purpose of art is to lay bare the questions hidden by the answers\" and push for that which is \"not unforeseen enough.\" Through thinking about and playing with the resources of questions, we'll try to subvert conventional notions of what is important and unimportant; we'll try to redeem incongruities; discover the mysteries behind physical appearances; and find ways to apprehend the real without distorting \"the incomprehensibility of the real.\" We'll consider what Yeats has said: \"Only that which does not teach, which does not cry out, which does not persuade, which does not condescend, which does not explain, is irresistible.\" Students will be asked to write two poems every week and to respond generously and rigorously to each other's work. In addition, students will give a presentation on a poet/question of their choice and put together an anthology and a chapbook. CRWRI-UA.830.003 Advanced Poetry Workshop Provisional Syllabus Matthew Rohrer , M 11:00am-1:45pm This course is designed to plunge students head-first into the world of contemporary poetry. Besides workshopping each others\u2019 poems, students will read a different book of contemporary poetry each week, and present it to the class. We will discuss the book as writers, not literature students; we\u2019ll want to figure out what each poet is doing, how he or she does it, and how we can do that. Writing exercises derived from the readings will help us get into the poets\u2019 heads. This is an advanced course, and students will be expected to do all of the reading, participate in the discussions, and generally contribute towards that elusive thing which is a workshop environment that is constructive and critical and ultimately generative for everyone. The goal of the course is for students to engage with the work of their peers and their contemporaries in a critical and hungry manner which will lead to a greater understanding of how their own poetry is working.  CRWRI-UA.850.001 Advanced Creative Nonfiction Workshop Provisional Syllabus Marcelle Clements , R 2:00pm-4:45pm Confession, Autobiography and Auto-Fiction: In this intensive class we write at the intersection of fiction and non-fiction, criss-crossing various genres. The memoir and the faux-memoir, the letter, the diary, the short fiction in which the author's voice seems eerily authentic -- these are the forms that have transformed publishing in the last two decades. We will explore the possibilities of first-person narratives, all the while we continue to work hard at the level of the sentence and the paragraph. In addition, we will attempt to improve the flow and consistency of our writing practice. Our class discussion is central to this enterprise, and participation is required, as are weekly assignments of writing and reading.           MASTER CLASSES These advanced workshops and craft seminars\u2014taught by acclaimed poets and prose writers\u2014are open to select NYU undergraduates. Master classes are limited to 12 students and provide intensive mentoring and guidance for serious and talented undergraduate writers.

CRWRI-UA.860.001 Master Class in Fiction Rick Moody , M 11:00am-1:40pm This is a workshop for people who have experience in workshops, but who are ready to experiment, think outside of the formulae for conventional fiction writing, and above all who are willing to work hard on rewriting and perfecting work in a supportive and collegial atmosphere. We'll be doing a lot of reading as well as short writing assignments for the first half of the semester--some of these assignments about story structure and some about voice and form--in order to prepare for writing a longer story or two as final projects. Solid attendance and contribution to class discussion a must, as well as attentiveness to grammar and paragraphing. CRWRI-UA.870.001 Master Class in Poetry Kimiko Hahn , T 11:00am-1:40pm Law-enforcement code for burglary, \"breaking-and-entering\" will be our strategy for reading, writing, revising, as well as critiquing. Readings will include Yusef Komunyakaa, Claudia Rankine, and Dorothy Lasky. CRWRI-UA.880.001 Master Class in Creative Nonfiction David Lipsky , T 11:00am-1:40pm How do we write non-fiction--how do we make what feels important to us (the necessary information that feels almost too big to not say) important to readers? In this workshop, we'll explore how to cut and pave that highway between other people and ourselves: how to make that information feel necessary on the other end. Lots of this will be the technical material of workshop: openings, drafts, editing peers, self-editing, the freedom of revision. We'll discuss how to report and what it's like to interview. And since every strong piece of writing includes its own DIY guide--for how to write and how to get inspired about the walk to the keyboard--we'll also look at memoirs and essays by some great non-fictionists: Martin Amis, Joan Didion, David Foster Wallace, Pauline Kael. We'll explore the practice the writing. (Lorrie Moore says the difference between a writer and a non-writer is the non-writer thinks she'll remember it in the morning.) Submissions, reading, and classroom discussion.
