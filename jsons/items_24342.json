About the VHA                 In 1994, Steven Spielberg established the Survivors of the Shoah Visual History Foundation with the goal of gathering video testimonies from survivors and witnesses of the Holocaust. Between 1994 and 1999 the Foundation recorded over 52,000 testimonies in 56 countries and in 32 languages. These testimonies have been digitized and indexed and are now accessible to educators, students, and researchers all over the world.   Interviews are broad-ranging and include: Jewish survivors, homosexual survivors, Jehovah's Witness survivors, liberators and liberation witnesses, political prisoners, rescuers and aid providers, Sinti and Roma survivors, survivors of Eugenics policies, and war crimes trials participants.    Since 2006, the Visual History Archive of the Shoah Foundation Institute has been a part of the College of Letters, Arts and Sciences at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles. Its mission is to &ldquo;overcome prejudice, intolerance, and bigotry&mdash;and the suffering they cause&mdash;through the educational use of the Institute&rsquo;s visual history testimonies.&rdquo;   For more information go to the Shoah Foundation Institute site           Comments (0)                                         The Archive in Research & Teaching                  Sampling of classes using the VHA  Selective list of publications that draw on the VHA            Comments (0)                                              close                                                                                                          Using the Visual History Archive @ NYU                                                                                  Guides for the VHA                 Some excellent guides to aid the in-depth researcher:  VHA User Manual 55 pages of information on using the Archive for in-depth research.

About the VHA                 In 1994, Steven Spielberg established the Survivors of the Shoah Visual History Foundation with the goal of gathering video testimonies from survivors and witnesses of the Holocaust. Between 1994 and 1999 the Foundation recorded over 52,000 testimonies in 56 countries and in 32 languages. These testimonies have been digitized and indexed and are now accessible to educators, students, and researchers all over the world.   Interviews are broad-ranging and include: Jewish survivors, homosexual survivors, Jehovah's Witness survivors, liberators and liberation witnesses, political prisoners, rescuers and aid providers, Sinti and Roma survivors, survivors of Eugenics policies, and war crimes trials participants.    Since 2006, the Visual History Archive of the Shoah Foundation Institute has been a part of the College of Letters, Arts and Sciences at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles. Its mission is to &ldquo;overcome prejudice, intolerance, and bigotry&mdash;and the suffering they cause&mdash;through the educational use of the Institute&rsquo;s visual history testimonies.&rdquo;   For more information go to the Shoah Foundation Institute site           Comments (0)                                         The Archive in Research & Teaching                  Sampling of classes using the VHA  Selective list of publications that draw on the VHA            Comments (0)                                              close                                                                                                          Using the Visual History Archive @ NYU                                                                                  Guides for the VHA                 Some excellent guides to aid the in-depth researcher:  VHA User Manual 55 pages of information on using the Archive for in-depth research.
