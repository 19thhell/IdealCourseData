Review the fees that will apply to you and be sure to check with an OGS advisor if you have any further questions.          SEVIS Fee   What is the SEVIS fee?   The SEVIS fee is a U.S. government fee that supports the operation of the Student Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS). SEVIS is the government database designed to allow various U.S. government agencies to see up-to-date information about F and J students, their academic activities, and their accompanying family members.   How much is it? How do I pay?   The SEVIS fee is $200 for F-1 students and $180 for J-1 exchange visitors, effective. There are two ways to pay the fee, either using a credit card at the SEVIS I-901 U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement webpage or by mailing an international money order or U.S. bank check. In either case, the fee must be accompanied by government form I-901.   Do all new students pay the SEVIS fee?   If you were issued an I-20 or DS-2019 for &quot;initial attendance&quot; at NYU and are applying for a visa or change of status, you will be required to pay the fee.   I am a Canadian citizen and do not need a visa. Do I pay the fee?   Yes, Canadians are also subject to this fee. You must ensure that the U.S. government has received your fee at least three business days before you apply for admission at a port of entry (land or border crossing).   Are my family members subject to the fee?   No, F-2 and J-2 dependents are not assessed the SEVIS fee, only F-1 and J-1 students.   When do I pay the fee?   You must wait until you have your I-20 (for F-1 students) or DS-2019 (for J-1 students) before you can pay the fee. You can schedule an appointment for the visa interview without having paid the fee. However, you must pay the fee at least three business days prior to your visa interview, and be able to show proof that you did pay the fee. If you are not traveling outside the U.S. for a new visa, speak to an OGS advisor for payment details.   Do I receive evidence to show I paid the fee?   Yes, there is a receipt which can be printed out at the time of on-line payment, or is sent by mail to the address provided on the form I-901. Not all U.S. Consulates and Embassies have access to the SEVIS database to verify that you paid, so it is vital that you are able to show the receipt at the time of your visa interview.   Can someone else pay the fee for me?   Yes, another person can pay the fee on your behalf. However, it is critical that this person obtains the receipt and mails it to you.   What happens if the consular official cannot confirm my fee payment through the information in the SEVIS database?   As long as you have a printed receipt to verify your payment, you should not be denied a visa based on this ground.   I am not a new student, will I be charged the SEVIS fee?   In general, a continuing student will NOT pay the SEVIS fee, even if you need to apply for new visa.   There are, however, exceptions to this. A student who has previously been enrolled WOULD need to pay the SEVIS fee under the following conditions:     When outside the U.S. for over five months and not maintaining registration with NYU (this does not apply to students on authorized study abroad)   When you have violated the terms of your F-1 status and will travel with an &quot;initial attendance&quot; I-20 in order to re-gain F-1 status   When applying for reinstatement and have been out of the U.S. for more than 5 months   When applying for a change of non-immigrant status to F-1 or J-1     I am a J-1 student. I was told that I do not have to pay the fee. Is that right?   J-1 students who are in government-sponsored exchange programs, such as the Fulbright program, are not required to pay the SEVIS fee. The organization issuing your DS-2019 can confirm if you have to pay the fee or not. J-1 students with a DS-2019 issued by NYU do have to pay the SEVIS fee, which is $180.                         International Student Fee Policy at NYU   How the Fee is Assessed   It is the policy of New York University that the International Student Fee ($90) is charged to an international student every time the student registers for class. This means the student will be charged for registration in the Fall Semester, and again in the Spring Semester. If the student chooses to enroll for Summer classes, the student will be charged only once for the summer.     Definition of International Student   NYU has officially adopted the following definition of \u201cinternational student\u201d not only pertinent to the International Student Fee, but also for purposes of accurate data collection related to the NYU international community:   At New York University, an \u201cinternational student\u201d is defined as any student who is not a United States Citizen, and not a United States Permanent Resident. Please note that refugees and asylees are not considered to be international students at NYU.    Visa Types Assessed the International Student Fee   The following visa types will be assessed the International Student Fee: A1, A2, A3, E1, E2, E3, F-1, F-2, F-3, G1, G2, G3, G4, H1, H2, H3, H4, I, J-1, J-2, J3, L1, L2, O1, O3, OF, OJ, P1, P2, P4, Q, R1, R2, TD, TN, and V1.

This increase may be reflected on the I-20 or DS-2019 you receive and therefore may not match precisely the amounts listed below. If you have questions about exact fees, check the NYU Bursar's Office website at www.nyu.edu/bursar .   Find your school at NYU in the column on the left. The columns to the right indicate the 2014-2015 full-time tuition of 24 credits (one academic year) plus service fees, estimated living expenses and health insurance. The total estimated expense plus any additional dependent expenses is what you must document for issuance of the I-20 or DS-2019. Full payment of tuition and fees is due upon registration for classes, which takes place in August/September for the fall semester and January for the spring semester.   Students must demonstrate that they have sufficient liquid assets to cover tuition and living expenses for at least one year of study.

SEVIS is the government database designed to allow various U.S. government agencies to see up-to-date information about F and J students, their academic activities, and their accompanying family members.   How much is it? How do I pay?   The SEVIS fee is $200 for F-1 students and $180 for J-1 exchange visitors, effective. There are two ways to pay the fee, either using a credit card at the SEVIS I-901 U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement webpage or by mailing an international money order or U.S. bank check. In either case, the fee must be accompanied by government form I-901.   Do all new students pay the SEVIS fee?   If you were issued an I-20 or DS-2019 for &quot;initial attendance&quot; at NYU and are applying for a visa or change of status, you will be required to pay the fee.   I am a Canadian citizen and do not need a visa. Do I pay the fee?   Yes, Canadians are also subject to this fee. You must ensure that the U.S. government has received your fee at least three business days before you apply for admission at a port of entry (land or border crossing).   Are my family members subject to the fee?   No, F-2 and J-2 dependents are not assessed the SEVIS fee, only F-1 and J-1 students.   When do I pay the fee?   You must wait until you have your I-20 (for F-1 students) or DS-2019 (for J-1 students) before you can pay the fee. You can schedule an appointment for the visa interview without having paid the fee. However, you must pay the fee at least three business days prior to your visa interview, and be able to show proof that you did pay the fee. If you are not traveling outside the U.S. for a new visa, speak to an OGS advisor for payment details.   Do I receive evidence to show I paid the fee?   Yes, there is a receipt which can be printed out at the time of on-line payment, or is sent by mail to the address provided on the form I-901. Not all U.S. Consulates and Embassies have access to the SEVIS database to verify that you paid, so it is vital that you are able to show the receipt at the time of your visa interview.   Can someone else pay the fee for me?   Yes, another person can pay the fee on your behalf. However, it is critical that this person obtains the receipt and mails it to you.   What happens if the consular official cannot confirm my fee payment through the information in the SEVIS database?   As long as you have a printed receipt to verify your payment, you should not be denied a visa based on this ground.   I am not a new student, will I be charged the SEVIS fee?   In general, a continuing student will NOT pay the SEVIS fee, even if you need to apply for new visa.   There are, however, exceptions to this. A student who has previously been enrolled WOULD need to pay the SEVIS fee under the following conditions:     When outside the U.S. for over five months and not maintaining registration with NYU (this does not apply to students on authorized study abroad)   When you have violated the terms of your F-1 status and will travel with an &quot;initial attendance&quot; I-20 in order to re-gain F-1 status   When applying for reinstatement and have been out of the U.S. for more than 5 months   When applying for a change of non-immigrant status to F-1 or J-1     I am a J-1 student. I was told that I do not have to pay the fee. Is that right?   J-1 students who are in government-sponsored exchange programs, such as the Fulbright program, are not required to pay the SEVIS fee. The organization issuing your DS-2019 can confirm if you have to pay the fee or not. J-1 students with a DS-2019 issued by NYU do have to pay the SEVIS fee, which is $180.                         International Student Fee Policy at NYU   How the Fee is Assessed   It is the policy of New York University that the International Student Fee ($90) is charged to an international student every time the student registers for class. This means the student will be charged for registration in the Fall Semester, and again in the Spring Semester. If the student chooses to enroll for Summer classes, the student will be charged only once for the summer.     Definition of International Student   NYU has officially adopted the following definition of \u201cinternational student\u201d not only pertinent to the International Student Fee, but also for purposes of accurate data collection related to the NYU international community:   At New York University, an \u201cinternational student\u201d is defined as any student who is not a United States Citizen, and not a United States Permanent Resident. Please note that refugees and asylees are not considered to be international students at NYU.    Visa Types Assessed the International Student Fee   The following visa types will be assessed the International Student Fee: A1, A2, A3, E1, E2, E3, F-1, F-2, F-3, G1, G2, G3, G4, H1, H2, H3, H4, I, J-1, J-2, J3, L1, L2, O1, O3, OF, OJ, P1, P2, P4, Q, R1, R2, TD, TN, and V1.

Anticipate that all costs related to study at NYU will increase approximately 5% for the 2015-2016 academic year and every subsequent year. This increase may be reflected on the I-20 or DS-2019 you receive and therefore may not match precisely the amounts listed below. If you have questions about exact fees, check the NYU Bursar's Office website at www.nyu.edu/bursar .   Find your school at NYU in the column on the left. The columns to the right indicate the 2014-2015 full-time tuition of 24 credits (one academic year) plus service fees, estimated living expenses and health insurance. The total estimated expense plus any additional dependent expenses is what you must document for issuance of the I-20 or DS-2019. Full payment of tuition and fees is due upon registration for classes, which takes place in August/September for the fall semester and January for the spring semester.   Students must demonstrate that they have sufficient liquid assets to cover tuition and living expenses for at least one year of study.

Supporting documents may include but are not limited to:     Personal funds, a current financial statement, printed on letterhead and signed by a bank official, dated within six months.   A personal loan, a pre-approval letter confirming amount for which the loan is approved. A loan application is not sufficient.   An individual sponsor, the OGS Affidavit of Support plus a bank statement and/or letter from employer confirming annual salary and sponsor's position. (The sponsor's annual salary should be at least 3 times the amount of money they are providing to the student).   If you will be staying somewhere where you will receive free room and board, you need to provide a letter from who you are staying with indicating the amount of support they will provide for you and the duration of time you will stay with them. The in-kind value of room and board is estimated to be $10,000 per year.    An organizational sponsor, a copy of an award letter from a sponsoring organization specifying the amount of the award, its duration, and the terms of renewal, or  NYU funding, a copy of an NYU award letter for an NYU scholarship, assistantship, or fellowship.     All financial documentation must be in English or have certified English translations attached to the original and must be dated from within the last six months.     We don't accept income tax documents or personal property deeds such as ownership of property, a car, jewelry, etc. as evidence of acceptable financial documentation.
