The first track is modern European history of concepts, with an emphasis on France and philosophy. My An Atheism that is not Humanist Emerges in French Thought (Stanford, 2010) studied the transformation of the concept of the human around the critiques of secular humanism in interwar and early postwar France. I am currently completing a second monograph in this field, The Matter with Transparency in Postwar France . Long a goal and ideal in philosophy and today once again a major political catchword, the concept was treated by philosophers, anthropologists, psychologists, filmmakers, and other intellectuals as profoundly problematic in 1945-1975 France. This book takes as its starting point the question raised by this rejection of transparency, whether as a social ideal (the aspiration to a transparent society or a transparent state), as an ethical priority (the traditional demand for personal purity and the romantic fantasy of the heart-to-heart), or as an epistemological ideal (the assertion of man\u2019s capacity to know the world).      The second track is in the history of the human sciences, starting out from the history of biology and related disciplines. In Experimente im Individuum (August/Walther K\u00f6nig Vlg, 2014), co-authored with Todd Meyers, we offered an account of the German-Jewish neuropsychiatrist Kurt Goldstein\u2019s influential elaboration of a concept of the individual premised upon his epistemological, experimental, and therapeutic work with on aphasia and tonic musculature in brain-injured patients. I have also been involved in two translations of books by Georges Canguilhem, Knowledge of Life (Fordham 2009) and Writings on Medicine (Fordham 2012), and have co-edited (with Richard Baxstrom) a collection of essays for the journal Republics of Letters on self-assertion and conflicts over territory and method in the human sciences. Todd Meyers and I co-edit the Forms of Living series at Fordham University Press and we are now completing a book-length study of the early-twentieth-century transformation of conceptions of the organism (and its consequences) in physiology and related sciences: The Whole on the Verge of Collapse: Integration, Disequilibrium, and the Sciences of the Body around WWI . This project traces the emphasis of organismic balance and disequilibrium that occurred during the period 1905-1930 across a transnational quasi-network of scholars. We are interested in problems like wound shock, aphasia, homeostasis, anaphylaxis, gastro-enteric distress, and especially the theorization of disequilibrium and collapse; in new or renewed concepts ranging from histamine response to \u201ccatastrophic reaction\u201d to the \u201cindividual\u201d patient.       My other current projects generally concern the intersections of aesthetics and politics with a continued focus on the history of concepts in Europe and of scientific and political languages concerning the body. The Scaffold of Sovereignty: Global and Aesthetic Perspectives on the History of a Concept , a volume co-edited with Zvi Ben-Dor Benite and Nicole Jerr, is under contract with Columbia University Press. In 2015-2016 I will be on leave, thanks to an ACLS Ryskamp Fellowship, to pursue research toward a history of conceptions of the \u201cNew Man\u201d in nineteenth- and early-twentieth-century Europe. This project concerns the dream of a transformation of human nature resulting from\u2014but often working against\u2014the advance of modernity; it brings together considerations of different scientific fields (anthropology, psychology, social hygiene, etc), competing figures of authority and power, aesthetic figurations of the motif, and the announcements, ever more frequent after World War I and especially in the National Socialist and Soviet regimes, of the impending or ongoing construction and supposedly redemptive promise of \u201cNew Men.\u201d      My teaching includes courses on the history of particular concepts, on moments in European philosophical and scientific thought, and on specific thinkers. Recent courses include The Origin of Humanity: A European Obsession, 1750-2000; Freud; European Culture and World War One ; and Structuralism: Language and Man in Postwar Europe .

The first track is modern European history of concepts, with an emphasis on France and philosophy. My An Atheism that is not Humanist Emerges in French Thought (Stanford, 2010) studied the transformation of the concept of the human around the critiques of secular humanism in interwar and early postwar France. I am currently completing a second monograph in this field, The Matter with Transparency in Postwar France . Long a goal and ideal in philosophy and today once again a major political catchword, the concept was treated by philosophers, anthropologists, psychologists, filmmakers, and other intellectuals as profoundly problematic in 1945-1975 France. This book takes as its starting point the question raised by this rejection of transparency, whether as a social ideal (the aspiration to a transparent society or a transparent state), as an ethical priority (the traditional demand for personal purity and the romantic fantasy of the heart-to-heart), or as an epistemological ideal (the assertion of man\u2019s capacity to know the world).      The second track is in the history of the human sciences, starting out from the history of biology and related disciplines. In Experimente im Individuum (August/Walther K\u00f6nig Vlg, 2014), co-authored with Todd Meyers, we offered an account of the German-Jewish neuropsychiatrist Kurt Goldstein\u2019s influential elaboration of a concept of the individual premised upon his epistemological, experimental, and therapeutic work with on aphasia and tonic musculature in brain-injured patients. I have also been involved in two translations of books by Georges Canguilhem, Knowledge of Life (Fordham 2009) and Writings on Medicine (Fordham 2012), and have co-edited (with Richard Baxstrom) a collection of essays for the journal Republics of Letters on self-assertion and conflicts over territory and method in the human sciences. Todd Meyers and I co-edit the Forms of Living series at Fordham University Press and we are now completing a book-length study of the early-twentieth-century transformation of conceptions of the organism (and its consequences) in physiology and related sciences: The Whole on the Verge of Collapse: Integration, Disequilibrium, and the Sciences of the Body around WWI . This project traces the emphasis of organismic balance and disequilibrium that occurred during the period 1905-1930 across a transnational quasi-network of scholars. We are interested in problems like wound shock, aphasia, homeostasis, anaphylaxis, gastro-enteric distress, and especially the theorization of disequilibrium and collapse; in new or renewed concepts ranging from histamine response to \u201ccatastrophic reaction\u201d to the \u201cindividual\u201d patient.       My other current projects generally concern the intersections of aesthetics and politics with a continued focus on the history of concepts in Europe and of scientific and political languages concerning the body. The Scaffold of Sovereignty: Global and Aesthetic Perspectives on the History of a Concept , a volume co-edited with Zvi Ben-Dor Benite and Nicole Jerr, is under contract with Columbia University Press. In 2015-2016 I will be on leave, thanks to an ACLS Ryskamp Fellowship, to pursue research toward a history of conceptions of the \u201cNew Man\u201d in nineteenth- and early-twentieth-century Europe. This project concerns the dream of a transformation of human nature resulting from\u2014but often working against\u2014the advance of modernity; it brings together considerations of different scientific fields (anthropology, psychology, social hygiene, etc), competing figures of authority and power, aesthetic figurations of the motif, and the announcements, ever more frequent after World War I and especially in the National Socialist and Soviet regimes, of the impending or ongoing construction and supposedly redemptive promise of \u201cNew Men.\u201d      My teaching includes courses on the history of particular concepts, on moments in European philosophical and scientific thought, and on specific thinkers. Recent courses include The Origin of Humanity: A European Obsession, 1750-2000; Freud; European Culture and World War One ; and Structuralism: Language and Man in Postwar Europe . This semester I am co-teaching an undergraduate colloquium with Larry Wolff on The Anthropological Encounter in European Intellectual History and a graduate course on Sovereignty: Twentieth-Century Ideas, Aesthetics, and Practices .

This course introduces students to the genre through readings of representative  novellas, demonstrating how the genre is often the home of supernatural events  such as demonic possession or a plague of spiders that materialize from  nowhere. Given that the novella is also the genre most closely associated with  literary realism, we will focus mainly on the 19th century and the relation  between the novella\u2019s strange status as bearer of the unexplainable and the era  of realism\u2019s taxonomic project of assembling and depicting data about the world  in an effort to produce coherence. This course is designed to provide advanced  students of German an opportunity to expand both their reading knowledge of  German and, through sustained projects) their writing skills in the language.     *This course will be  conducted in German.

Introduces students to representative authors  and exemplary works of German literature from the 18th to the 21st century.  Students learn about the basic conventions of literature and literary  interpretation, as well as strategies for the effective reading and discussion  of poetry, prose, and drama. Guided writing assignments focus on developing the  language skills necessary for effective written analysis and interpretation of  literary texts in German.  *This course will be  conducted in German.

The era\u2019s radical changes\u2014among them the traumas of war,  rapid industrialization and urbanization, shifting gender roles, and the  political and economic instability of the interwar years\u2014seemed to shake the  very bedrock upon which society had been built. The intellectual responses to  this pervasive sense of upheaval and angst , as well as  the challenges and changes themselves, form the focus of this course, as we  explore the relationship between modernity and crisis in early  twentieth-century Germany and Austria. Readings will include Nietzsche, Freud,  Simmel, Weber, Kracauer, Benjamin, and Heidegger. Taught in English.  GERM-UA249   (COLIT-UA249) T, R 2:00  \u2013 3:15  Introduction to  Theory \u2013 German Media Theory: From Aesthetics to Cultural Techniques    Chadwick Smith  This course presents a survey of the German strain of media theory from the  perspective of the persistent interchanges and parallels between it and social  thought and forms. We will follow a trajectory that can be roughly outlined by  four movements: 1) Media theory\u2019s ancestors in classical philosophy; 2) The  boom in aesthetic theory that took place in 18th-century German philosophy, one  still based in a humanistic understanding of the world; 3) late 20th-century  discussions of discourse networks and systems theory, which attempt to  de-center the human subject in favor of an understanding of the technical  forces that drive history; and 4) the contemporary understanding of the  intertwined nature of technical media and culture proposed in the school of  \u201ccultural techniques.\u201d Thus this course additionally addresses the ways in  which Media Studies provides a template for understanding the ethical, legal,  and social position of human subject in the \u201cdigital\u201d and technologically  mediated world. Taught in English.  GERM-UA377         M,  W 2:00 \u2013 3:15   Modern  German Drama: Theaters of War (Goethe to Brecht)  Christiane  Frey    When  military strategists speak of a \u201ctheater of operations,\u201d or when the  nineteenth-century war theorist Carl von Clausewitz coins the term \u201ctheater of  war,\u201d they are not just using an empty metaphor: we think of war as a kind of  drama played out within a bounded area over a certain period of time. It\u2019s thus  no accident that authors have turned to drama as a genre on which to reflect on  war \u2013 its dynamics, its causes, its seeming inevitability, its consequences,  its mediality. In this course, we will explore how theater stages war and  terror, beginning with plays written shortly before or after the French  Revolution \u2013 whose \u201creign of terror\u201d gave us our concept of \u201cterrorism\u201d \u2013 to 20th-century  modernist and experimental dramas of war. We will also explore various theoretical  approaches to war and terror. Plays by Goethe, Kleist, B\u00fcchner, Brecht, Peter  Weiss, Heiner M\u00fcller; theoretical writings by Clausewitz, Carl Schmitt, Freud,  Paul Virilio, and Friedrich Kittler. Requirements: oral presentation, take home  exam, three short papers.  *This course will be  conducted in German.
