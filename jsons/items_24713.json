Overview    Curriculum    Graduates of the Program    Admissions    Pre-requisites             Program Overview    The M.A. Program in Educational Psychology offers students a solid graduate foundation in the core areas of psychology, including developmental psychology, personality theories, social psychology, and measurement and research methods in the context of an individualized and goal-directed plan of study. During the course of study, students acquire a solid base in psychological theory and are challenged to consider the ways that basic psychological research might be applied to address the challenges faced by individuals in our society particularly those living in the multicultural environment of urban New York City.       Curriculum    In addition to taking foundation courses in applied psychology, students select a series of courses from one of two concentrations that match their specific interests and professional goals. Toward the end of the M.A. degree program, students apply their theoretical knowledge base to a relevant research experience under the supervision of a faculty member who shares a scholarly interest in the student&rsquo;s chosen topic. These independently pursued projects should be related to and emerge out of the student's studies in his or her selected areas of emphasis. Students may choose from two concentrations: general educational psychology and psychological measurement and evaluation.    Click here for the General Educational Psychology Curriculum    Click here for the Measurement and Evaluation Curriculum       Graduates of the Program    In addition to being a basic entry into doctoral study in psychology, the M.A. degree program in applied psychology offers the basic training for employment in areas such as research and data collection for hospitals and community agencies, advertising agencies, and private industry as well as for school systems and other learning environments. Students completing the Measurement and evaluation program will have a broad knowledge of measurement, test construction, and research methods, and will find these skills in high demand in the field.       Admissions Requirements    Students are admitted to the Educational Psychology program during the Fall semester only. In addition to the application form, students must submit the following:          2 letters of recommendation    Current CV or resume    Official transcripts from all colleges or universities attended    Personal statement (2-3 pages explaining why you want to enter this program and how your experience will lend itself to successful completion)             Pre-requisites    Applicants to the General Educational Psychology Concentration must complete a minimum of 18 undergraduate semester hours in behavioral sciences before entrance to the program.

Overview    Curriculum    Graduates of the Program    Admissions    Pre-requisites             Program Overview    The M.A. Program in Educational Psychology offers students a solid graduate foundation in the core areas of psychology, including developmental psychology, personality theories, social psychology, and measurement and research methods in the context of an individualized and goal-directed plan of study. During the course of study, students acquire a solid base in psychological theory and are challenged to consider the ways that basic psychological research might be applied to address the challenges faced by individuals in our society particularly those living in the multicultural environment of urban New York City.       Curriculum    In addition to taking foundation courses in applied psychology, students select a series of courses from one of two concentrations that match their specific interests and professional goals. Toward the end of the M.A. degree program, students apply their theoretical knowledge base to a relevant research experience under the supervision of a faculty member who shares a scholarly interest in the student&rsquo;s chosen topic. These independently pursued projects should be related to and emerge out of the student's studies in his or her selected areas of emphasis.

Click here for the General Educational Psychology Curriculum    Click here for the Measurement and Evaluation Curriculum       Graduates of the Program    In addition to being a basic entry into doctoral study in psychology, the M.A. degree program in applied psychology offers the basic training for employment in areas such as research and data collection for hospitals and community agencies, advertising agencies, and private industry as well as for school systems and other learning environments. Students completing the Measurement and evaluation program will have a broad knowledge of measurement, test construction, and research methods, and will find these skills in high demand in the field.       Admissions Requirements    Students are admitted to the Educational Psychology program during the Fall semester only.

Overview    Curriculum    Graduates of the Program    Admissions    Pre-requisites             Program Overview    The M.A. Program in Educational Psychology offers students a solid graduate foundation in the core areas of psychology, including developmental psychology, personality theories, social psychology, and measurement and research methods in the context of an individualized and goal-directed plan of study. During the course of study, students acquire a solid base in psychological theory and are challenged to consider the ways that basic psychological research might be applied to address the challenges faced by individuals in our society particularly those living in the multicultural environment of urban New York City.       Curriculum    In addition to taking foundation courses in applied psychology, students select a series of courses from one of two concentrations that match their specific interests and professional goals. Toward the end of the M.A. degree program, students apply their theoretical knowledge base to a relevant research experience under the supervision of a faculty member who shares a scholarly interest in the student&rsquo;s chosen topic. These independently pursued projects should be related to and emerge out of the student's studies in his or her selected areas of emphasis. Students may choose from two concentrations: general educational psychology and psychological measurement and evaluation.

Students completing the Measurement and evaluation program will have a broad knowledge of measurement, test construction, and research methods, and will find these skills in high demand in the field.
