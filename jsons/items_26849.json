Freda Call # 75862 Thursday 12:30 - 4:30pm This course explores the intersection of the Cold War and American film in the post-war period, covering genres as diverse as film noir, the western, comedy, documentary, political thriller, melodrama, and, of course, the science fiction film. We will analyze how the Cold War came to be expressed in often divergent and contradictory ways in these films, and how film (and specific generic frames) uniquely convey the tensions and fears which dominated American society during the period from the late forties till the early sixties.    The \"Cold War\" was many things: it was, first, a strategic policy of post-war containment of the Soviet Union through the reliance on nuclear superiority; on the other hand, it also describes the whole range of phenomena that might be called \"domestic containment\" as \"national security:\" ranging from the evisceration of the progressive politics of the New Deal by McCarthyism to the (often overlapping) disciplining of gender and sexuality. The Cold War describes both vulnerability (to foreign and domestic threats) and an assertive mastery grounded in the ideology of a victorious \"Americanism\" confirmed in consumer culture. These elements, along with many others (such as television, suburbanization, youth culture, and the car) are evidenced in the films of the period: a sample of the topics we will examine over the course of the semester includes: Hollywood and the Cold War; television and McCarthyism; The bomb and science fiction films; disciplining the Cold War body; the bomb shelter and the Cold War western; Coke and Communism; the presidential horror film. Films to be viewed include: High Noon, On the Waterfront, Invasion of the Body Snatchers, Force of Evil, Point of Order, Dr. Strangelove or: How I learned to stop worrying and love the bomb; The Manchurian Candidate, All that Heaven Allows, One, Two Three, The Day the Earth Stood Still, Fail Safe, Duck and Cover.
