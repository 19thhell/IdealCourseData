[{"detail": [{"content": "Arthurian Studies: The Legend                   The    Arthurian Legend (Merrie Haskell's version)            An Island Divided   In the years of upheaval after the Roman withdrawal , Britain became   an island of small, squabbling kingdoms. Legends indicate that one Aurelius   Ambrosius tried to unite the small kingdoms against their common enemies--   the Irish , the Picts and the Saxons . He was followed in his quest   by Uther Pendragon, who is commonly held to be the   father of Arthur.    Prior to this, however, was the business of Vortigern.   It was he who supposedly invited the Saxons into Britain, to aid in   repelling the invasions of the Picts. However, when   Vortigern's people (and most notably his sons) objected to the presence of   the Saxons, and saw how Vortigern favored them over his own people, they attempted   to expel the Saxons. Hengist and Horsa, the Saxon leaders, objected. Fighting   broke out. Vortigern tried to make a peace, but at a peace-making meeting,   Hengist and his Saxons pulled daggers from their boots and turned on the unarmed   Briton lords and petty kings, and slew them all. At this point, Vortigern   either conceded his lands to Hengist in exchange for his life, or was allowed   to live with the horror of what he had wrought-- either way, Vortigern was   spared and set free and fled to Wales .               \"There he assembled stonemasons from different parts of the country and    ordered them to build a tower for him. The masons gathered and began to    lay the foundations of their tower. However much they built one day the    earth swallowed up the next, in such a way that they had no idea where their    work had vanished to.\" (Geoffrey of Monmouth 166)                 Vortigern consulted his magicians, and they told him he should   find a boy without a father, and kill him and incorporate his bones and blood   into the foundations of the castle. Vortigern sent out messengers, who \"came   to a town which was afterwards called Kaermerdin and there they saw some lads   playing by the town gate.... a sudden quarrel broke out between the two lads,   whose names were Merlin and Dinabutius. As they argued, Dinabutius said to Merlin:   '...How can we two be equal in skill? I myself am of royal blood on both sides   of my family. As for you, nobody knows who you are, for you never had a father!'\"   (Geoffrey of Monmouth 167). Having found what they sought, the messengers dragged   the boy back with them to Vortigern.     Merlin   Merlin objected to being killed, of course, and thus   it was that when confronted with his death, he called Vortigern's great magicians   liars, and promised to solve the problem of the castle foundations himself.   He told the King that the foundations fell every night because there was a pool   beneath the earth they were lain on. He also told the King that beneath the   pool, two dragons lay sleeping. And when Vortigern dug under the foundations,   he found the pool. And when he drained the pool, the two dragons awoke, and   began to fight, and Merlin began to prophesy:           \"Alas for the Red Dragon, for its end is near. Its cavernous dens    shall be occupied by the White Dragon, which stands for the Saxons which    you have invited over. The Red Dragon represents the people of Britain,    who will be overrun by the White One...\" (Geoffrey of Monmouth 171)                   Merlin proceeded to warn Vortigern that Aurelius Ambrosius, the son of the man that Vortigern had betrayed   to assume the throne, would come to drive out the Saxons and to kill Vortigern.   Merlin then departed Vortigern's doomed presence, and went to Aurelius Ambrosius   and became his chief advisor, who succeeded in all the things that Merlin had   prophesied that he would, driving out the Saxons, and indeed, killing Vortigern.       Uther Pendragon   During the reign of Aurelius Ambrosius, a comet appeared   in the sky. Shortly thereafter, Aurelius was poisoned by an agent of one of   Vortigern's sons, and Uther Pendragon assumed the throne.   He was told by Merlin that the comet had signified   his rise to power. Uther continued to drive back the Saxons, and once victorious,   cast about him for a wife. Unfortunately, his eye settled upon a woman who was   already married, one Igraine, wife of Gorlois,   Duke of Cornwall. It was not long before Uther and Gorlois went to battle   over the woman, and once again, the island was at war.   Uther and Gorlois fought for some time, before Uther cornered Gorlois in   Cornwall, near Tintagel Castle. The night before   they were about to have the final battle, Uther demanded of Merlin that he   have Igraine. Merlin agreed for a price to be named at a future date. Merlin   disguised Uther as Gorlois by spellcraft, and sneaked him into the castle.   Igraine received him there, thinking Uther was her husband. She became pregnant   with Arthur from the night's work. The next day,   Uther took the field and killed Gorlois in battle. Igraine became Uther's   wife not long after.    In most versions of the story, Arthur was born to Igraine and taken away   from his parents secretly by Merlin for fostering. There are usually a variety   of reasons given for this-- that there were too many doubts about Arthur's   parentage (Igraine herself thought she lay with Gorlois on the night of Arthur's   conception), and thus Uther did not want to keep a son who might not be his;   that there were too many dangers to a child that might be Uther's or might   be Gorlois' in the political climate; or that this was the price Merlin had   requested from Uther for the night with Igraine. Whatever the reason, Arthur   was not usually represented to have grown up with his mother and father, nor   his half-sister, Morgan, the child from his mother's first marriage. He   was, instead, givKay.    In the meantime, the island fell to warring once more, for not all who were   loyal to Aurelius were so taken with his brother. Uther, constantly embattled,   grew ill with the stress of his wars, and his health began to fail. By the   time Arthur was a young man, Uther was near death.    In some stories, Arthur was then taken by his tutor Merlin to meet with   the dying king on the field of battle. Uther turned over the armies to Arthur's   command, and Arthur that day defeated the Saxons, and proved to his father's   armies that he was the rightful heir.   The Sword in the Stone   In other stories, Uther died without ever seeing his son, and the island   was left without a king. All the great lords of Britain turned out for a tournament,   whose victor would become the next King.   Kay, newly knighted, fought in the tournament, and   Arthur acted as his squire. As they left their lodgings   one morning for the tournament field, Arthur in his excitement forgot Kay's   sword. As they approached the field, Kay asked Arthur where it was, and when   he found out that Arthur had forgotten it, sent the boy back to fetch it with   all due haste. Arthur, trying to be as quick as possible, came across the   sword in a stone in the courtyard of an abbey. Without thought, he ran   up, grabbed the sword, pulled it out, and ran back to Kay. Kay was surprised   at Arthur's speed. He looked suspiciously at the sword-- and was amazed. He   recognized it as the sword in the stone. He showed it to his father, who eventually   got the truth from both Kay and Arthur, that Arthur had pulled it from the   stone. Written on the sword was \"whosoever shall pull me from the stone shall   be the next King of Britain.\"    Ector called an end to the tournament, and showed the lords of the realm   the sword that his foster son had pulled from the stone. Various tests were   imposed, but eventually it became clear that Arthur had indeed pulled the   sword from the stone, and was the next King of Britain.      The Young King   Young king Arthur was faced with difficulties   from the beginning. He had to drive the Saxons back. In order to do this,   though, he needed to unify the petty kings of Britain to fight the Saxons.   He also had to develop an effective fighting force, and somewhere along the   way, get married.    Depending on the version of the story, the unification of the petty kings   was as easy as forming a Round Table where everyone was equal in the   eyes of the King and had a voice in the affairs of the realm, or as difficult   as beating the rebellious leaders into submission. After this was accomplished,   the united forces of Romano-Celtic Britain began the long and arduous task   of fighting the Saxons. The famous Twelve Battles of Arthur, as listed first by Nennius , document the long, uphill struggle to free   the island-- or at least to drive back the Anglo-Saxon invaders. The battles   ended with the climax of the Battle of Badon , in   which Arthur is said to have worn the banner of the Virgin Mary on his shoulders   (see, Arthur and Christianity ).    After the Battle of Badon came peace, and the King cast about him for a   wife. His eye fell on Guinevere-- depending on the   version, once again, he married one, two or even three women by this name   (see, the Three Guineveres ). They did not meet before their marriage,   and Lancelot, Arthur's most trusted knight, went   to fetch her and bring her back to Camelot . Along the way, they are   supposed to have fallen in love. This courtly romance was doomed from   the beginning, of course, as courtly romances are supposed to be.    A time of peace finally settled on the land.      Sinister Things Afoot   In all the medieval romances, this early part of Arthur's reign was strange   and mysterious. The knights were kept busy with numerous quests, such as the    White Stag , the Loathly Lady and the Green Knight . In   older versions of the Matter, there were such diversions as Cullwch and   Olwen or the Cad Pagur . And in between times there were mundane   events such as tournaments to keep everyone entertained as well.    But at the same time, the evil half-sister was plotting her brother's demise.   In several stories, Morgan went to great lengths   to end Arthur's reign. Morgan's plots ranged from False Excalibur   to stirring up jealousy between the King and Lancelot to conceiving a son   ( Mordred ) with her brother.      The Holy Grail   As Arthur aged, Camelot went into decline. The evil work of Morgan began to   take over the once glorious kingdom; the knights became mean, lost their chivalry,   turned to in-fighting. Merlin, in an effort to save Camelot, suggested a grander   quest than any of the others he had previously created, and told the King to   send his knights to quest for the Holy Grail . The Grail, which brings   healing and eternal life, would be the key to lifting the King's spirits and   bringing his health back, and thus also the health of the realm (see, King   and Land ).   The knights scatter to the four corners of the earth. Perceval was caught in a wasteland belonging to a    maimed king ; Galahad , the most innocent of knights, the only   man pure enough to sit in the Perilous Seat , died on his quest; and   flawed Lancelot several times came close to finding the grail but always failed.   He returned a madman in some versions. In other versions, Galahad was successful,   but then disappeared from the mortal realm forever. The Grail was never brought   to Camelot, however.   The Imprisonment of Merlin   Morgan is sometimes credited for also thinking a method of disposing of Merlin,   though in other versions, Niniane acted alone.   Niniane wished to acquire all of Merlin's powers and secrets. She went to   great lengths to seduce him, and steal his powers while he slept; in some   versions, Merlin's celibacy that kept him powerful, in others it is merely   that with his guard down he could not defend himself against a lesser sorcerer.    When Niniane stripped him of his power, she imprisoned him in a crystal   cave or in an oak tree , for she was unable to kill him. Sometimes   she merely wished to usurp Merlin's place at Arthur's side; other times, she   eliminated Merlin on Morgan's behalf.   Mordred   Meanwhile, far from court, Morgan had raised her son to despise Arthur, and   sent him to his father when he reached adulthood. If his heritage was found   out, it made Arthur look bad, at the very least; at best, Mordred would work   to bring about the fall of Arthur.   In the medieval versions, the court of Camelot had declined substantially   in morals during Mordred's childhood and adolescence, and a general malaise   surrounded the King. Mordred would at that point only be aiding in the inevitable.   In older versions of the story, Mordred is not evil, and exemplifies the uncle/nephew   relationship of Celtic myth. In some modern versions, Mordred is merely   a mortal caught between the desires of his parents.   The Betrayal of Lancelot   Traditionally, Mordred noticed the relationship between Guinevere and Lancelot   off the bat, and tried to discredit both the King's wife and the King's best   friend, to create a niche for himself. When he found out that Lancelot and   Guinevere have gone off on a tryst together, he called together some of his   fathers loyal knights, and had them barge in on the lovers, having them both   taken prisoner. Lancelot managed to escape.   Sometimes Arthur is on the scene, and other times he is off negotiating or   fighting wars. Invariably, the decision is made that Guinevere must be executed   for her treachery upon the King's return. In at least one version, the scene   is very dramatic-- Guinevere is led to the stake to be burned for adultery;   Arthur looks on, stone-faced; Lancelot swoops in on his horse, rescues her,   and runs away with her to the Joyous Gard (his castle), where they live for   some time.    Arthur has no time to get her back, either by wooing or warfare. For on   the horizon, is war.      The Fall of Camelot   The versions are countless. Arthur is attacked by Romans, by Goths, by   Saxons, by Picts, by the French, by the Irish, by Lancelot, by Morgan le Fay,   by Mordred, by rebellious subject kings-- you name it, in some version, they   are the group that brings about the fall of Camelot. But of course, Camelot   had already fallen, in the betrayal of the King's wife and friend, and in the   deterioration of the moral values of the men in charge of guarding the kingdom.   The last battle, the battle of Camlann, marks the fall of the great King. He lies dying.   And while the details of Arthur's death are varied as well, one scene in   particular always stands out in my mind, so I will present it here as definitive.    The great king lay dying at the edge of the battle. Bedivere, his oldest   companion, knelt next to him, seeking to comfort his friend in his last moments.   \"My lord,\" he said, \"My king, Arthur, what can I do?\"    Arthur turned to him and said, \"Take my sword, Excalibur, and go to the   water's edge. Throw it in, and then return to tell me what you saw.\"    Bedivere agreed to do his bidding, and took Excalibur and walked down to   the water's edge. But when he lifted his hand to throw the sword into the   water, he found he could not. This was the sword of a great king; this was   the sword that should be passed on to the next king. If the next king were   a boy, as Arthur had been, or if there were some doubt amongst the people,   this sword could give them confidence that there was a worthy successor to   Arthur on the throne.    Bedivere hid the sword under a bush, and marked the spot, intending to retrieve   it later.   Bedivere returned to his king.   \"Have you done as I have asked?\"   \"Aye, my lord,\" Bedivere replied.   \"Tell me what you saw,\" the king commanded.   \"I saw nothing but the ripple of the water as the sword fell into it, and   heard the crying of the water birds.\"    At this, Arthur grew angry, and said, \"Friend, you have not done what I   asked. Go you forth and throw my sword Excalibur into the lake!\"   Troubled, Bedivere rose to his feet and returned to the place where he had   left the sword, and intending to do his liege's bidding, lifted the sword   over his head to throw it forth.    But his eyes were caught by the gleam of the setting sun on the blade, and   he thought how faithful the sword had been to the King in battle; surely the   blade deserved better than to be cast into the water, to rust and rot. So   Bedivere took the sword and hid it under a bush again, and marked the spot   so he might retrieve it later.   \"I have done your bidding, my lord,\" Bedivere said, when he returned to Arthur's   side.   \"And what did you see?\" the king asked.   \"I saw the splash when the sword hit the water, and the dying sun's rays   bright on the waves.\"   \"You have not done what I asked!\" the king said angrily. \"Go forth, Bedivere,   and if you love me, throw my sword Excalibur into the lake!\"    Bedivere, even more troubled, left his king, took the sword from its hiding   place, and went to the water's edge. Then he lifted it high over his head,   and hurled it out over the lake.   The sword did not have a chance to hit the water; for a hand rose from the   deep center of the lake, and caught the sword neatly. It saluted Bedivere   three times, and then sank beneath the surface, until all that was left were   the waves lapping at the bank, and the wind in the reeds.                  Bedivere returned to his king, and said, \"I have done your bidding.\"   \"What did you see?\"   \"I saw a hand rise from the lake and catch the sword; they saluted three   times, and disappeared beneath the water, and left nothing more than the lapping   of the water at the bank, and the sound of the wind in the reeds.\"   \"Thank you, my friend,\" Arthur said, and closed his eyes.    And Bedivere stayed with his mortally wounded friend, as the sun set, and   the stars came out. And from the darkness came nine women dressed like queens.   Bedivere was frozen at the sight of them. The tenderly lifted the dying king   from his rough bed on the ground, and bore him off. Bedivere was anxious to   see where they were going, so he followed as quickly as he could. But it was   as though lead weighted his feet, and he did not catch up with them until   the nine queens had loaded Arthur onto a barge and had sailed half-way across   the lake.       Bedivere returned to the battlefield, and found his brother, and together,   they went back to the world."}]},
{"detail": [{"content": "Arthurian Studies: The Legend                   The    Arthurian Legend (Merrie Haskell's version)            An Island Divided   In the years of upheaval after the Roman withdrawal , Britain became   an island of small, squabbling kingdoms. Legends indicate that one Aurelius   Ambrosius tried to unite the small kingdoms against their common enemies--   the Irish , the Picts and the Saxons . He was followed in his quest   by Uther Pendragon, who is commonly held to be the   father of Arthur.    Prior to this, however, was the business of Vortigern.   It was he who supposedly invited the Saxons into Britain, to aid in   repelling the invasions of the Picts. However, when   Vortigern's people (and most notably his sons) objected to the presence of   the Saxons, and saw how Vortigern favored them over his own people, they attempted   to expel the Saxons. Hengist and Horsa, the Saxon leaders, objected. Fighting   broke out. Vortigern tried to make a peace, but at a peace-making meeting,   Hengist and his Saxons pulled daggers from their boots and turned on the unarmed   Briton lords and petty kings, and slew them all. At this point, Vortigern   either conceded his lands to Hengist in exchange for his life, or was allowed   to live with the horror of what he had wrought-- either way, Vortigern was   spared and set free and fled to Wales .               \"There he assembled stonemasons from different parts of the country and    ordered them to build a tower for him. The masons gathered and began to    lay the foundations of their tower. However much they built one day the    earth swallowed up the next, in such a way that they had no idea where their    work had vanished to.\" (Geoffrey of Monmouth 166)                 Vortigern consulted his magicians, and they told him he should   find a boy without a father, and kill him and incorporate his bones and blood   into the foundations of the castle. Vortigern sent out messengers, who \"came   to a town which was afterwards called Kaermerdin and there they saw some lads   playing by the town gate.... a sudden quarrel broke out between the two lads,   whose names were Merlin and Dinabutius. As they argued, Dinabutius said to Merlin:   '...How can we two be equal in skill? I myself am of royal blood on both sides   of my family. As for you, nobody knows who you are, for you never had a father!'\"   (Geoffrey of Monmouth 167). Having found what they sought, the messengers dragged   the boy back with them to Vortigern.     Merlin   Merlin objected to being killed, of course, and thus   it was that when confronted with his death, he called Vortigern's great magicians   liars, and promised to solve the problem of the castle foundations himself.   He told the King that the foundations fell every night because there was a pool   beneath the earth they were lain on. He also told the King that beneath the   pool, two dragons lay sleeping. And when Vortigern dug under the foundations,   he found the pool. And when he drained the pool, the two dragons awoke, and   began to fight, and Merlin began to prophesy:           \"Alas for the Red Dragon, for its end is near. Its cavernous dens    shall be occupied by the White Dragon, which stands for the Saxons which    you have invited over. The Red Dragon represents the people of Britain,    who will be overrun by the White One...\" (Geoffrey of Monmouth 171)                   Merlin proceeded to warn Vortigern that Aurelius Ambrosius, the son of the man that Vortigern had betrayed   to assume the throne, would come to drive out the Saxons and to kill Vortigern.   Merlin then departed Vortigern's doomed presence, and went to Aurelius Ambrosius   and became his chief advisor, who succeeded in all the things that Merlin had   prophesied that he would, driving out the Saxons, and indeed, killing Vortigern.       Uther Pendragon   During the reign of Aurelius Ambrosius, a comet appeared   in the sky. Shortly thereafter, Aurelius was poisoned by an agent of one of   Vortigern's sons, and Uther Pendragon assumed the throne.   He was told by Merlin that the comet had signified   his rise to power. Uther continued to drive back the Saxons, and once victorious,   cast about him for a wife. Unfortunately, his eye settled upon a woman who was   already married, one Igraine, wife of Gorlois,   Duke of Cornwall. It was not long before Uther and Gorlois went to battle   over the woman, and once again, the island was at war.   Uther and Gorlois fought for some time, before Uther cornered Gorlois in   Cornwall, near Tintagel Castle. The night before   they were about to have the final battle, Uther demanded of Merlin that he   have Igraine. Merlin agreed for a price to be named at a future date. Merlin   disguised Uther as Gorlois by spellcraft, and sneaked him into the castle.   Igraine received him there, thinking Uther was her husband. She became pregnant   with Arthur from the night's work. The next day,   Uther took the field and killed Gorlois in battle. Igraine became Uther's   wife not long after.    In most versions of the story, Arthur was born to Igraine and taken away   from his parents secretly by Merlin for fostering. There are usually a variety   of reasons given for this-- that there were too many doubts about Arthur's   parentage (Igraine herself thought she lay with Gorlois on the night of Arthur's   conception), and thus Uther did not want to keep a son who might not be his;   that there were too many dangers to a child that might be Uther's or might   be Gorlois' in the political climate; or that this was the price Merlin had   requested from Uther for the night with Igraine. Whatever the reason, Arthur   was not usually represented to have grown up with his mother and father, nor   his half-sister, Morgan, the child from his mother's first marriage. He   was, instead, givKay.    In the meantime, the island fell to warring once more, for not all who were   loyal to Aurelius were so taken with his brother. Uther, constantly embattled,   grew ill with the stress of his wars, and his health began to fail. By the   time Arthur was a young man, Uther was near death.    In some stories, Arthur was then taken by his tutor Merlin to meet with   the dying king on the field of battle. Uther turned over the armies to Arthur's   command, and Arthur that day defeated the Saxons, and proved to his father's   armies that he was the rightful heir.   The Sword in the Stone   In other stories, Uther died without ever seeing his son, and the island   was left without a king. All the great lords of Britain turned out for a tournament,   whose victor would become the next King.   Kay, newly knighted, fought in the tournament, and   Arthur acted as his squire. As they left their lodgings   one morning for the tournament field, Arthur in his excitement forgot Kay's   sword. As they approached the field, Kay asked Arthur where it was, and when   he found out that Arthur had forgotten it, sent the boy back to fetch it with   all due haste. Arthur, trying to be as quick as possible, came across the   sword in a stone in the courtyard of an abbey. Without thought, he ran   up, grabbed the sword, pulled it out, and ran back to Kay. Kay was surprised   at Arthur's speed. He looked suspiciously at the sword-- and was amazed. He   recognized it as the sword in the stone. He showed it to his father, who eventually   got the truth from both Kay and Arthur, that Arthur had pulled it from the   stone. Written on the sword was \"whosoever shall pull me from the stone shall   be the next King of Britain.\"    Ector called an end to the tournament, and showed the lords of the realm   the sword that his foster son had pulled from the stone. Various tests were   imposed, but eventually it became clear that Arthur had indeed pulled the   sword from the stone, and was the next King of Britain.      The Young King   Young king Arthur was faced with difficulties   from the beginning. He had to drive the Saxons back. In order to do this,   though, he needed to unify the petty kings of Britain to fight the Saxons.   He also had to develop an effective fighting force, and somewhere along the   way, get married.    Depending on the version of the story, the unification of the petty kings   was as easy as forming a Round Table where everyone was equal in the   eyes of the King and had a voice in the affairs of the realm, or as difficult   as beating the rebellious leaders into submission. After this was accomplished,   the united forces of Romano-Celtic Britain began the long and arduous task   of fighting the Saxons. The famous Twelve Battles of Arthur, as listed first by Nennius , document the long, uphill struggle to free   the island-- or at least to drive back the Anglo-Saxon invaders. The battles   ended with the climax of the Battle of Badon , in   which Arthur is said to have worn the banner of the Virgin Mary on his shoulders   (see, Arthur and Christianity ).    After the Battle of Badon came peace, and the King cast about him for a   wife. His eye fell on Guinevere-- depending on the   version, once again, he married one, two or even three women by this name   (see, the Three Guineveres ). They did not meet before their marriage,   and Lancelot, Arthur's most trusted knight, went   to fetch her and bring her back to Camelot . Along the way, they are   supposed to have fallen in love. This courtly romance was doomed from   the beginning, of course, as courtly romances are supposed to be.    A time of peace finally settled on the land.      Sinister Things Afoot   In all the medieval romances, this early part of Arthur's reign was strange   and mysterious. The knights were kept busy with numerous quests, such as the    White Stag , the Loathly Lady and the Green Knight . In   older versions of the Matter, there were such diversions as Cullwch and   Olwen or the Cad Pagur . And in between times there were mundane   events such as tournaments to keep everyone entertained as well.    But at the same time, the evil half-sister was plotting her brother's demise.   In several stories, Morgan went to great lengths   to end Arthur's reign. Morgan's plots ranged from False Excalibur   to stirring up jealousy between the King and Lancelot to conceiving a son   ( Mordred ) with her brother.      The Holy Grail   As Arthur aged, Camelot went into decline. The evil work of Morgan began to   take over the once glorious kingdom; the knights became mean, lost their chivalry,   turned to in-fighting. Merlin, in an effort to save Camelot, suggested a grander   quest than any of the others he had previously created, and told the King to   send his knights to quest for the Holy Grail . The Grail, which brings   healing and eternal life, would be the key to lifting the King's spirits and   bringing his health back, and thus also the health of the realm (see, King   and Land ).   The knights scatter to the four corners of the earth. Perceval was caught in a wasteland belonging to a    maimed king ; Galahad , the most innocent of knights, the only   man pure enough to sit in the Perilous Seat , died on his quest; and   flawed Lancelot several times came close to finding the grail but always failed.   He returned a madman in some versions. In other versions, Galahad was successful,   but then disappeared from the mortal realm forever. The Grail was never brought   to Camelot, however.   The Imprisonment of Merlin   Morgan is sometimes credited for also thinking a method of disposing of Merlin,   though in other versions, Niniane acted alone.   Niniane wished to acquire all of Merlin's powers and secrets. She went to   great lengths to seduce him, and steal his powers while he slept; in some   versions, Merlin's celibacy that kept him powerful, in others it is merely   that with his guard down he could not defend himself against a lesser sorcerer.    When Niniane stripped him of his power, she imprisoned him in a crystal   cave or in an oak tree , for she was unable to kill him. Sometimes   she merely wished to usurp Merlin's place at Arthur's side; other times, she   eliminated Merlin on Morgan's behalf.   Mordred   Meanwhile, far from court, Morgan had raised her son to despise Arthur, and   sent him to his father when he reached adulthood. If his heritage was found   out, it made Arthur look bad, at the very least; at best, Mordred would work   to bring about the fall of Arthur.   In the medieval versions, the court of Camelot had declined substantially   in morals during Mordred's childhood and adolescence, and a general malaise   surrounded the King. Mordred would at that point only be aiding in the inevitable.   In older versions of the story, Mordred is not evil, and exemplifies the uncle/nephew   relationship of Celtic myth. In some modern versions, Mordred is merely   a mortal caught between the desires of his parents.   The Betrayal of Lancelot   Traditionally, Mordred noticed the relationship between Guinevere and Lancelot   off the bat, and tried to discredit both the King's wife and the King's best   friend, to create a niche for himself. When he found out that Lancelot and   Guinevere have gone off on a tryst together, he called together some of his   fathers loyal knights, and had them barge in on the lovers, having them both   taken prisoner. Lancelot managed to escape.   Sometimes Arthur is on the scene, and other times he is off negotiating or   fighting wars. Invariably, the decision is made that Guinevere must be executed   for her treachery upon the King's return. In at least one version, the scene   is very dramatic-- Guinevere is led to the stake to be burned for adultery;   Arthur looks on, stone-faced; Lancelot swoops in on his horse, rescues her,   and runs away with her to the Joyous Gard (his castle), where they live for   some time.    Arthur has no time to get her back, either by wooing or warfare. For on   the horizon, is war.      The Fall of Camelot   The versions are countless. Arthur is attacked by Romans, by Goths, by   Saxons, by Picts, by the French, by the Irish, by Lancelot, by Morgan le Fay,   by Mordred, by rebellious subject kings-- you name it, in some version, they   are the group that brings about the fall of Camelot. But of course, Camelot   had already fallen, in the betrayal of the King's wife and friend, and in the   deterioration of the moral values of the men in charge of guarding the kingdom.   The last battle, the battle of Camlann, marks the fall of the great King. He lies dying.   And while the details of Arthur's death are varied as well, one scene in   particular always stands out in my mind, so I will present it here as definitive.    The great king lay dying at the edge of the battle. Bedivere, his oldest   companion, knelt next to him, seeking to comfort his friend in his last moments.   \"My lord,\" he said, \"My king, Arthur, what can I do?\"    Arthur turned to him and said, \"Take my sword, Excalibur, and go to the   water's edge. Throw it in, and then return to tell me what you saw.\"    Bedivere agreed to do his bidding, and took Excalibur and walked down to   the water's edge. But when he lifted his hand to throw the sword into the   water, he found he could not. This was the sword of a great king; this was   the sword that should be passed on to the next king. If the next king were   a boy, as Arthur had been, or if there were some doubt amongst the people,   this sword could give them confidence that there was a worthy successor to   Arthur on the throne.    Bedivere hid the sword under a bush, and marked the spot, intending to retrieve   it later.   Bedivere returned to his king.   \"Have you done as I have asked?\"   \"Aye, my lord,\" Bedivere replied.   \"Tell me what you saw,\" the king commanded.   \"I saw nothing but the ripple of the water as the sword fell into it, and   heard the crying of the water birds.\"    At this, Arthur grew angry, and said, \"Friend, you have not done what I   asked. Go you forth and throw my sword Excalibur into the lake!\"   Troubled, Bedivere rose to his feet and returned to the place where he had   left the sword, and intending to do his liege's bidding, lifted the sword   over his head to throw it forth.    But his eyes were caught by the gleam of the setting sun on the blade, and   he thought how faithful the sword had been to the King in battle; surely the   blade deserved better than to be cast into the water, to rust and rot. So   Bedivere took the sword and hid it under a bush again, and marked the spot   so he might retrieve it later.   \"I have done your bidding, my lord,\" Bedivere said, when he returned to Arthur's   side.   \"And what did you see?\" the king asked.   \"I saw the splash when the sword hit the water, and the dying sun's rays   bright on the waves.\"   \"You have not done what I asked!\" the king said angrily. \"Go forth, Bedivere,   and if you love me, throw my sword Excalibur into the lake!\"    Bedivere, even more troubled, left his king, took the sword from its hiding   place, and went to the water's edge. Then he lifted it high over his head,   and hurled it out over the lake.   The sword did not have a chance to hit the water; for a hand rose from the   deep center of the lake, and caught the sword neatly. It saluted Bedivere   three times, and then sank beneath the surface, until all that was left were   the waves lapping at the bank, and the wind in the reeds.                  Bedivere returned to his king, and said, \"I have done your bidding.\"   \"What did you see?\"   \"I saw a hand rise from the lake and catch the sword; they saluted three   times, and disappeared beneath the water, and left nothing more than the lapping   of the water at the bank, and the sound of the wind in the reeds.\"   \"Thank you, my friend,\" Arthur said, and closed his eyes.    And Bedivere stayed with his mortally wounded friend, as the sun set, and   the stars came out. And from the darkness came nine women dressed like queens.   Bedivere was frozen at the sight of them. The tenderly lifted the dying king   from his rough bed on the ground, and bore him off. Bedivere was anxious to   see where they were going, so he followed as quickly as he could. But it was   as though lead weighted his feet, and he did not catch up with them until   the nine queens had loaded Arthur onto a barge and had sailed half-way across   the lake.       Bedivere returned to the battlefield, and found his brother, and together,   they went back to the world."}, {"content": "NYU &gt; Ireland House &gt; Oral History of Irish America            Glucksman Ireland House, NYU  Ireland House Oral History Collection    Top   A  B  C  D  E  F  G     H  I  J  K  L  M  N     O  P  Q  R  S  T  V     W  Heritage and ethnic studies are enhanced through the collection of historical data,   documentation, and oral history. \"Irish\" has had multiple meanings and various degrees of relevancy for men and   women living in the United States, depending upon whether the individual is an immigrant or removed by several   generations from Ireland. Nevertheless, who we think or say we are remains hugely important for the understanding of   American history. Since 2005, in partnership with the Archives of Irish America, the central research initiative   of Glucksman Ireland House, the Center for Irish Studies at New York University, has been an Oral History of Irish   America Project.

The principal interviewers are Dr. Linda   Dowling Almeida, Dr. Marion R. Casey, Dr. Miriam A. Nyhan, Dr. de O'Carroll, Dr. Danielle Zach and Virginia Ferris. The interviews that form this collection are usually full life histories   which are recorded using digital technology. These audio files are then archived and opened to researchers by   appointment through the Archives of Irish America in NYU's Division of Libraries.

{"detail": [{"content": "Arthurian Studies: The Legend                   The    Arthurian Legend (Merrie Haskell's version)            An Island Divided   In the years of upheaval after the Roman withdrawal , Britain became   an island of small, squabbling kingdoms. Legends indicate that one Aurelius   Ambrosius tried to unite the small kingdoms against their common enemies--   the Irish , the Picts and the Saxons . He was followed in his quest   by Uther Pendragon, who is commonly held to be the   father of Arthur.    Prior to this, however, was the business of Vortigern.   It was he who supposedly invited the Saxons into Britain, to aid in   repelling the invasions of the Picts. However, when   Vortigern's people (and most notably his sons) objected to the presence of   the Saxons, and saw how Vortigern favored them over his own people, they attempted   to expel the Saxons. Hengist and Horsa, the Saxon leaders, objected. Fighting   broke out. Vortigern tried to make a peace, but at a peace-making meeting,   Hengist and his Saxons pulled daggers from their boots and turned on the unarmed   Briton lords and petty kings, and slew them all. At this point, Vortigern   either conceded his lands to Hengist in exchange for his life, or was allowed   to live with the horror of what he had wrought-- either way, Vortigern was   spared and set free and fled to Wales .               \"There he assembled stonemasons from different parts of the country and    ordered them to build a tower for him. The masons gathered and began to    lay the foundations of their tower. However much they built one day the    earth swallowed up the next, in such a way that they had no idea where their    work had vanished to.\" (Geoffrey of Monmouth 166)                 Vortigern consulted his magicians, and they told him he should   find a boy without a father, and kill him and incorporate his bones and blood   into the foundations of the castle. Vortigern sent out messengers, who \"came   to a town which was afterwards called Kaermerdin and there they saw some lads   playing by the town gate.... a sudden quarrel broke out between the two lads,   whose names were Merlin and Dinabutius. As they argued, Dinabutius said to Merlin:   '...How can we two be equal in skill? I myself am of royal blood on both sides   of my family. As for you, nobody knows who you are, for you never had a father!'\"   (Geoffrey of Monmouth 167). Having found what they sought, the messengers dragged   the boy back with them to Vortigern.     Merlin   Merlin objected to being killed, of course, and thus   it was that when confronted with his death, he called Vortigern's great magicians   liars, and promised to solve the problem of the castle foundations himself.   He told the King that the foundations fell every night because there was a pool   beneath the earth they were lain on. He also told the King that beneath the   pool, two dragons lay sleeping. And when Vortigern dug under the foundations,   he found the pool. And when he drained the pool, the two dragons awoke, and   began to fight, and Merlin began to prophesy:           \"Alas for the Red Dragon, for its end is near. Its cavernous dens    shall be occupied by the White Dragon, which stands for the Saxons which    you have invited over. The Red Dragon represents the people of Britain,    who will be overrun by the White One...\" (Geoffrey of Monmouth 171)                   Merlin proceeded to warn Vortigern that Aurelius Ambrosius, the son of the man that Vortigern had betrayed   to assume the throne, would come to drive out the Saxons and to kill Vortigern.   Merlin then departed Vortigern's doomed presence, and went to Aurelius Ambrosius   and became his chief advisor, who succeeded in all the things that Merlin had   prophesied that he would, driving out the Saxons, and indeed, killing Vortigern.       Uther Pendragon   During the reign of Aurelius Ambrosius, a comet appeared   in the sky. Shortly thereafter, Aurelius was poisoned by an agent of one of   Vortigern's sons, and Uther Pendragon assumed the throne.   He was told by Merlin that the comet had signified   his rise to power. Uther continued to drive back the Saxons, and once victorious,   cast about him for a wife. Unfortunately, his eye settled upon a woman who was   already married, one Igraine, wife of Gorlois,   Duke of Cornwall. It was not long before Uther and Gorlois went to battle   over the woman, and once again, the island was at war.   Uther and Gorlois fought for some time, before Uther cornered Gorlois in   Cornwall, near Tintagel Castle. The night before   they were about to have the final battle, Uther demanded of Merlin that he   have Igraine. Merlin agreed for a price to be named at a future date. Merlin   disguised Uther as Gorlois by spellcraft, and sneaked him into the castle.   Igraine received him there, thinking Uther was her husband. She became pregnant   with Arthur from the night's work. The next day,   Uther took the field and killed Gorlois in battle. Igraine became Uther's   wife not long after.    In most versions of the story, Arthur was born to Igraine and taken away   from his parents secretly by Merlin for fostering. There are usually a variety   of reasons given for this-- that there were too many doubts about Arthur's   parentage (Igraine herself thought she lay with Gorlois on the night of Arthur's   conception), and thus Uther did not want to keep a son who might not be his;   that there were too many dangers to a child that might be Uther's or might   be Gorlois' in the political climate; or that this was the price Merlin had   requested from Uther for the night with Igraine. Whatever the reason, Arthur   was not usually represented to have grown up with his mother and father, nor   his half-sister, Morgan, the child from his mother's first marriage. He   was, instead, givKay.    In the meantime, the island fell to warring once more, for not all who were   loyal to Aurelius were so taken with his brother. Uther, constantly embattled,   grew ill with the stress of his wars, and his health began to fail. By the   time Arthur was a young man, Uther was near death.    In some stories, Arthur was then taken by his tutor Merlin to meet with   the dying king on the field of battle. Uther turned over the armies to Arthur's   command, and Arthur that day defeated the Saxons, and proved to his father's   armies that he was the rightful heir.   The Sword in the Stone   In other stories, Uther died without ever seeing his son, and the island   was left without a king. All the great lords of Britain turned out for a tournament,   whose victor would become the next King.   Kay, newly knighted, fought in the tournament, and   Arthur acted as his squire. As they left their lodgings   one morning for the tournament field, Arthur in his excitement forgot Kay's   sword. As they approached the field, Kay asked Arthur where it was, and when   he found out that Arthur had forgotten it, sent the boy back to fetch it with   all due haste. Arthur, trying to be as quick as possible, came across the   sword in a stone in the courtyard of an abbey. Without thought, he ran   up, grabbed the sword, pulled it out, and ran back to Kay. Kay was surprised   at Arthur's speed. He looked suspiciously at the sword-- and was amazed. He   recognized it as the sword in the stone. He showed it to his father, who eventually   got the truth from both Kay and Arthur, that Arthur had pulled it from the   stone. Written on the sword was \"whosoever shall pull me from the stone shall   be the next King of Britain.\"    Ector called an end to the tournament, and showed the lords of the realm   the sword that his foster son had pulled from the stone. Various tests were   imposed, but eventually it became clear that Arthur had indeed pulled the   sword from the stone, and was the next King of Britain.      The Young King   Young king Arthur was faced with difficulties   from the beginning. He had to drive the Saxons back. In order to do this,   though, he needed to unify the petty kings of Britain to fight the Saxons.   He also had to develop an effective fighting force, and somewhere along the   way, get married.    Depending on the version of the story, the unification of the petty kings   was as easy as forming a Round Table where everyone was equal in the   eyes of the King and had a voice in the affairs of the realm, or as difficult   as beating the rebellious leaders into submission. After this was accomplished,   the united forces of Romano-Celtic Britain began the long and arduous task   of fighting the Saxons. The famous Twelve Battles of Arthur, as listed first by Nennius , document the long, uphill struggle to free   the island-- or at least to drive back the Anglo-Saxon invaders. The battles   ended with the climax of the Battle of Badon , in   which Arthur is said to have worn the banner of the Virgin Mary on his shoulders   (see, Arthur and Christianity ).    After the Battle of Badon came peace, and the King cast about him for a   wife. His eye fell on Guinevere-- depending on the   version, once again, he married one, two or even three women by this name   (see, the Three Guineveres ). They did not meet before their marriage,   and Lancelot, Arthur's most trusted knight, went   to fetch her and bring her back to Camelot . Along the way, they are   supposed to have fallen in love. This courtly romance was doomed from   the beginning, of course, as courtly romances are supposed to be.    A time of peace finally settled on the land.      Sinister Things Afoot   In all the medieval romances, this early part of Arthur's reign was strange   and mysterious. The knights were kept busy with numerous quests, such as the    White Stag , the Loathly Lady and the Green Knight . In   older versions of the Matter, there were such diversions as Cullwch and   Olwen or the Cad Pagur . And in between times there were mundane   events such as tournaments to keep everyone entertained as well.    But at the same time, the evil half-sister was plotting her brother's demise.   In several stories, Morgan went to great lengths   to end Arthur's reign. Morgan's plots ranged from False Excalibur   to stirring up jealousy between the King and Lancelot to conceiving a son   ( Mordred ) with her brother.      The Holy Grail   As Arthur aged, Camelot went into decline. The evil work of Morgan began to   take over the once glorious kingdom; the knights became mean, lost their chivalry,   turned to in-fighting. Merlin, in an effort to save Camelot, suggested a grander   quest than any of the others he had previously created, and told the King to   send his knights to quest for the Holy Grail . The Grail, which brings   healing and eternal life, would be the key to lifting the King's spirits and   bringing his health back, and thus also the health of the realm (see, King   and Land ).   The knights scatter to the four corners of the earth. Perceval was caught in a wasteland belonging to a    maimed king ; Galahad , the most innocent of knights, the only   man pure enough to sit in the Perilous Seat , died on his quest; and   flawed Lancelot several times came close to finding the grail but always failed.   He returned a madman in some versions. In other versions, Galahad was successful,   but then disappeared from the mortal realm forever. The Grail was never brought   to Camelot, however.   The Imprisonment of Merlin   Morgan is sometimes credited for also thinking a method of disposing of Merlin,   though in other versions, Niniane acted alone.   Niniane wished to acquire all of Merlin's powers and secrets. She went to   great lengths to seduce him, and steal his powers while he slept; in some   versions, Merlin's celibacy that kept him powerful, in others it is merely   that with his guard down he could not defend himself against a lesser sorcerer.    When Niniane stripped him of his power, she imprisoned him in a crystal   cave or in an oak tree , for she was unable to kill him. Sometimes   she merely wished to usurp Merlin's place at Arthur's side; other times, she   eliminated Merlin on Morgan's behalf.   Mordred   Meanwhile, far from court, Morgan had raised her son to despise Arthur, and   sent him to his father when he reached adulthood. If his heritage was found   out, it made Arthur look bad, at the very least; at best, Mordred would work   to bring about the fall of Arthur.   In the medieval versions, the court of Camelot had declined substantially   in morals during Mordred's childhood and adolescence, and a general malaise   surrounded the King. Mordred would at that point only be aiding in the inevitable.   In older versions of the story, Mordred is not evil, and exemplifies the uncle/nephew   relationship of Celtic myth. In some modern versions, Mordred is merely   a mortal caught between the desires of his parents.   The Betrayal of Lancelot   Traditionally, Mordred noticed the relationship between Guinevere and Lancelot   off the bat, and tried to discredit both the King's wife and the King's best   friend, to create a niche for himself. When he found out that Lancelot and   Guinevere have gone off on a tryst together, he called together some of his   fathers loyal knights, and had them barge in on the lovers, having them both   taken prisoner. Lancelot managed to escape.   Sometimes Arthur is on the scene, and other times he is off negotiating or   fighting wars. Invariably, the decision is made that Guinevere must be executed   for her treachery upon the King's return. In at least one version, the scene   is very dramatic-- Guinevere is led to the stake to be burned for adultery;   Arthur looks on, stone-faced; Lancelot swoops in on his horse, rescues her,   and runs away with her to the Joyous Gard (his castle), where they live for   some time.    Arthur has no time to get her back, either by wooing or warfare. For on   the horizon, is war.      The Fall of Camelot   The versions are countless. Arthur is attacked by Romans, by Goths, by   Saxons, by Picts, by the French, by the Irish, by Lancelot, by Morgan le Fay,   by Mordred, by rebellious subject kings-- you name it, in some version, they   are the group that brings about the fall of Camelot. But of course, Camelot   had already fallen, in the betrayal of the King's wife and friend, and in the   deterioration of the moral values of the men in charge of guarding the kingdom.   The last battle, the battle of Camlann, marks the fall of the great King. He lies dying.   And while the details of Arthur's death are varied as well, one scene in   particular always stands out in my mind, so I will present it here as definitive.    The great king lay dying at the edge of the battle. Bedivere, his oldest   companion, knelt next to him, seeking to comfort his friend in his last moments.   \"My lord,\" he said, \"My king, Arthur, what can I do?\"    Arthur turned to him and said, \"Take my sword, Excalibur, and go to the   water's edge. Throw it in, and then return to tell me what you saw.\"    Bedivere agreed to do his bidding, and took Excalibur and walked down to   the water's edge. But when he lifted his hand to throw the sword into the   water, he found he could not. This was the sword of a great king; this was   the sword that should be passed on to the next king. If the next king were   a boy, as Arthur had been, or if there were some doubt amongst the people,   this sword could give them confidence that there was a worthy successor to   Arthur on the throne.    Bedivere hid the sword under a bush, and marked the spot, intending to retrieve   it later.   Bedivere returned to his king.   \"Have you done as I have asked?\"   \"Aye, my lord,\" Bedivere replied.   \"Tell me what you saw,\" the king commanded.   \"I saw nothing but the ripple of the water as the sword fell into it, and   heard the crying of the water birds.\"    At this, Arthur grew angry, and said, \"Friend, you have not done what I   asked. Go you forth and throw my sword Excalibur into the lake!\"   Troubled, Bedivere rose to his feet and returned to the place where he had   left the sword, and intending to do his liege's bidding, lifted the sword   over his head to throw it forth.    But his eyes were caught by the gleam of the setting sun on the blade, and   he thought how faithful the sword had been to the King in battle; surely the   blade deserved better than to be cast into the water, to rust and rot. So   Bedivere took the sword and hid it under a bush again, and marked the spot   so he might retrieve it later.   \"I have done your bidding, my lord,\" Bedivere said, when he returned to Arthur's   side.   \"And what did you see?\" the king asked.   \"I saw the splash when the sword hit the water, and the dying sun's rays   bright on the waves.\"   \"You have not done what I asked!\" the king said angrily. \"Go forth, Bedivere,   and if you love me, throw my sword Excalibur into the lake!\"    Bedivere, even more troubled, left his king, took the sword from its hiding   place, and went to the water's edge. Then he lifted it high over his head,   and hurled it out over the lake.   The sword did not have a chance to hit the water; for a hand rose from the   deep center of the lake, and caught the sword neatly. It saluted Bedivere   three times, and then sank beneath the surface, until all that was left were   the waves lapping at the bank, and the wind in the reeds.                  Bedivere returned to his king, and said, \"I have done your bidding.\"   \"What did you see?\"   \"I saw a hand rise from the lake and catch the sword; they saluted three   times, and disappeared beneath the water, and left nothing more than the lapping   of the water at the bank, and the sound of the wind in the reeds.\"   \"Thank you, my friend,\" Arthur said, and closed his eyes.    And Bedivere stayed with his mortally wounded friend, as the sun set, and   the stars came out. And from the darkness came nine women dressed like queens.   Bedivere was frozen at the sight of them. The tenderly lifted the dying king   from his rough bed on the ground, and bore him off. Bedivere was anxious to   see where they were going, so he followed as quickly as he could. But it was   as though lead weighted his feet, and he did not catch up with them until   the nine queens had loaded Arthur onto a barge and had sailed half-way across   the lake.       Bedivere returned to the battlefield, and found his brother, and together,   they went back to the world."}, {"content": "NYU &gt; Ireland House &gt; Oral History of Irish America            Glucksman Ireland House, NYU  Ireland House Oral History Collection    Top   A  B  C  D  E  F  G     H  I  J  K  L  M  N     O  P  Q  R  S  T  V     W  Heritage and ethnic studies are enhanced through the collection of historical data,   documentation, and oral history. \"Irish\" has had multiple meanings and various degrees of relevancy for men and   women living in the United States, depending upon whether the individual is an immigrant or removed by several   generations from Ireland.
