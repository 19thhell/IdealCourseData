Doctoral students take advanced courses in their areas of  specialization, followed by a period of research and the preparation  and defense of the doctoral thesis.       The Graduate Department of Mathematics at the Courant Institute  offers balanced training in mathematics and its applications in the  broadest sense. The Department occupies a leading position in  pure and applied mathematics, especially in ordinary and partial  differential equations, probability theory and stochastic processes,  differential geometry, numerical analysis and scientific computation,  mathematical physics, material science, fluid dynamics, math biology,  Atmosphere and Ocean science, and Computational Biology.       Areas where there are special funding opportunities are:       Mathematics,  Mechanics and Materials Sciences       Number  Theory       Probability       Scientific Computing       The Ph.D. in Mathematics    Degree Requirements    A candidate for the Ph.D. degree in mathematics must fulfill a  number of different departmental requirements:       &#187; 72 points of credit;    &#187; a written comprehensive examination;    &#187; an oral preliminary examination;    &#187; an oral defense of the dissertation.       Coursework    All students in the Ph.D. program must complete 72 points of credits  (24 courses of 3 points each). It is possible, with departmental  permission, to take courses, relevant to students' course of study, in  other departments at NYU or at other universities. A base minimum of 32  points of credits must be completed at the Department of Mathematics.  Information on potential transfer of credit is contained in the  forthcoming section on GSAS and Departmental Policies and Procedures.    The Written Comprehensive  Examination    The examination tests the basic knowledge required for any serious  mathematical study. It consists of the three following sections:  Advanced Calculus, Complex Variables, and Linear Algebra. The  examination is given on two consecutive days, twice a year, in early  September and early January. Each section is allotted three hours and  is written at the level of a good undergraduate course. Samples of  previous examinations are available in the departmental office.  Cooperative preparation is encouraged, as it is for all examinations.  In the fall term, the Department offers a workshop, taught by an  advanced Teaching Assistant, to help students prepare for the written  examinations.    Entering students with a solid preparation are encouraged to  consider taking the examination in their first year of full-time study.  All students must take the examinations in order to be allowed to  register for coursework beyond 36 points of credit; it is recommended  that students attempt to take the examinations well before this  deadline. Graduate Assistants are required to take the examinations  during their first year of study.    For further details, consult the section on the Written  Comprehensive Examinations .    The Oral Preliminary Examination    This examination is usually (but not invariably) taken after two  years of full-time study. The purpose of the examination is to  determine if the candidate has acquired sufficient mathematical  knowledge and maturity to commence a dissertation. The phrase  \"mathematical knowledge\" is intended to convey rather broad  acquaintance with the basic facts of mathematical life, with emphasis  on a good understanding of the simplest interesting examples. In  particular, highly technical or abstract material is inappropriate, as  is the rote reproduction of information. What the examiners look for is  something a little different and less easy to quantify. It is conveyed  in part by the word \"maturity.\" This means some idea of how mathematics  hangs together; the ability to think a little on one's feet; some  appreciation of what is natural and important, and what is artificial.  The point is that the ability to do successful research depends on more  than formal learning, and it is part of the examiners' task to assess  these less tangible aspects of the candidate's preparation.    The orals are comprised of a general section and a special section,  each lasting one hour, and are conducted by two different panels of  three faculty members. The examination takes place three times a year:  fall, mid-winter and late spring. Cooperative preparation of often  helpful and is encouraged. Over-preparation is a common trap and your  advisor can provide perspective on this. The general section consists  of five topics, one of which may be chosen freely. The other four  topics are determined by field of interest, but often turn out to be  standard: complex variables, real variables, ordinary differential  equations, and partial differential equations. Here, the level of  knowledge that is expected is equivalent to that of a one or two term  course of the kind Courant normally presents. A brochure containing the  most common questions on the general oral examination, edited by  Courant students, is available at the Department Office.    The special section is usually devoted to a single topic at a more  advanced level and extent of knowledge. The precise content is  negotiated with he candidate's faculty advisor. Normally, the chosen  topic will have a direct bearing on the candidate's Ph.D. dissertation.    All students must take the oral examinations in order to be allowed  to register for coursework beyond 60 points of credit. It is  recommended that students attempt the examinations well before this  deadline.    The Dissertation Defense    The oral defense is the final examination on the student's  dissertation. The defense is conducted by a panel of five faculty  members (including the student's advisor) and generally lasts one to  two hours. The candidate presents his/her work to a mixed audience,  some expert in the student's topic, some not. Often, this presentation  is followed by a question-and-answer period and mutual discussion of  related material and directions for future work.    Summer Internships and Employment    The Department encourages Ph.D. students at any stage of their  studies, including the very early stage, to seek summer employment  opportunities at various government and industry facilities. In the  past few years, Courant students have taken summer internships at the  National Institute of Health, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Woods  Hole Oceanographic Institution, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory  and NASA, as well as Wall Street firms. Such opportunities can greatly  expand students' understanding of the mathematical sciences, offer them  possible areas of interest for thesis research, and enhance their  career options. The Director of Graduate Studies and members of the  faculty (and in particular the students' academic advisors) can assist  students in finding appropriate summer employment.    The Ph.D. in Atmosphere Ocean Science  and Mathematics    Coursework    The curriculum for the program provides a balance between  mathematics and physical science, and aims at preparing students for  research and teaching in all aspects of applied mathematics.   Please refer to the Center for  Atmosphere Ocean Science Graduate Program for further  information on coursework (including a detailed list of courses and  sample distribution of courses by term), degree examinations and other  aspects of the program.    The Ph.D in   Computational Biology    NYU now offers a Ph.D. program in Computational Biology.  Students can apply through one of the following departments:  Mathematics, Computer Science, Biology, Chemistry, and the Center for  Neural Sciences. For further information about the program, click here      Visiting Doctoral Students    Advanced doctoral students at other universities who wish to spend a  term at the Courant Institute's Department of Mathematics need to  provide the following documentation:      - a letter from the student's advisor requesting that the  student spend at term at the Courant Institute to conduct  research under the supervision of a faculty mentor;      - confirmation from the Courant Institute faculty in question  that he or she are willing to work with the visiting student;        - official documentation showing financial support of at least  $2,000 U.S. per month for the term of stay.       These students will have to submit an application for non-degree  studies to NYU's Graduate School of Arts and Science for the semeter  for their proposed visit. The application can be  downloaded from the Graduate Admission web page at  http://gsas.nyu.edu/page/grad.admissionsapplication, and sent in with  all transcripts, a statement of purpose and the application fee (GRE  tests or letters of recommendation are not required for non-degree  applications).       With this documentation, New York University will be able to sponsor  a J-1 visa for a visiting student.

The Program      The departments of mathematics and computer science at NYU's     Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences offer a master's     degree in scientific computing. The program provides broad yet     rigorous training in areas of mathematics and computer science     related to scientific computing. It aims to prepare people     with the right talents and background for a technical career     doing practical computing.      The program accommodates both full-time and part-time     students, with most courses meeting in the evening. The     program is self-contained and terminal, providing a complete     set of skills in a field where the need is greater than the     supply. The masters program focuses on computational science,     which includes modeling and numerical simulation as used in     engineering design, development, and optimization.           During the academic years of 2012 and 2013 a concentration in     data sciences existed within the scientific computing program;     this concentration has been discontinued as of 2014. Incoming     students interested in data sciences should consider the     recently-created Masters              of Science in Data Science within the NYU Center for Data     Science .           Starting Fall of 2014 the modified the program requirements     and guidelines listed below will apply to all incoming     students. The new list of required/approved courses includes     the previous list but gives additional flexibility for     students to tailor the list of courses to their background and     interests. Students presently enrolled in the Modeling and     Simulation track can choose to complete the program either     under the new or the old requirements. Students enrolled in     the Data Science concentration should consult the expanded     course options and modified requirements below since this     increases flexibility while maintaining consistency with the     previous requirements. These students should contact Professor     Esteban Tabak for help     in deciding on classes to take.                Scientific Computing:     Overview           Scientific computing is an indispensable part of almost all     scientific investigation and technological development at     universities, government laboratories, and within the private     sector. Typically a scientific computing team consists of     several people trained in some branch of mathematics, science,     statistics, or engineering. What is often lacking is expertise     in modern computing tools such as visualization, modern     programming paradigms, and high performance computing. The     master's program in scientific computing aims to satisfy these     needs, without omitting basic training in numerical analysis     and computer science. Many graduates of this program work at     technologically advanced institutions, especially in research     and development, where their skills and experience complement     those without interdisciplinary degrees. The program is also     open to students who will go on to pursue doctoral studies in     computer science, mathematics, or statistics.      The master's program in scientific computing focuses on the     mathematics and computer science related to advanced computer     modeling and simulation. The program is similar in structure     to terminal master's programs in engineering, combining     classroom training with practical experience. The coursework     ranges from foundational mathematics and fundamental     algorithms to such practical topics as data visualization and     software tools. Electives encourage the exploration of     specific application areas such as mathematical and     statistical finance, applications of machine learning, fluid     mechanics, finite element methods, and biomedical modeling.     The program culminates in a master's project, which serves to     integrate the classroom material.           Admission Requirements      The program requires least three semesters of Calculus     (including multivariate calculus), as well as linear algebra.     Experience with programming in a high-level language (e.g.,     Java, C, C++, Fortran. Python) as well as data structures,     equivalent to a first-year sequence in computer science,      is also required. It is highly desirable that applicants have     undergraduate major or significant experience in mathematics,     a quantitative science or engineering, or economics.      The deadline for application to the program is April 1st for     the fall semester. The program admits students both on a     full-time and on a part-time basis. The application process     takes place online via the Graduate School of Arts and     Sciences; please visit the Graduate     School Admissions site .

Concentration in Data     Science     This section is meant only for students presently enrolled in    the Data Science concentration; this concentration is no longer    offered. To graduate, students enrolled in the old concentration    are required to take the following core courses     in mathematics for the concentration in data science:                One of           MATH-GA              2962 Mathematical Statistics (spring semester),      DS-GA-1001 Introduction to Data Science (fall), or           DS-GA-1002 Statistical and Mathematical Methods                and either            MATH-GA              2043 Scientific Computing (fall and spring     semesters)                or both            MATH-GA              2010 Numerical Methods I (fall semester) and            MATH-GA              2020 Numerical Methods II (spring semester)           The following are the three required core courses      in computer science for the concentration in data science:            CSCI-GA              1170 Fundamental Algorithms (fall, spring and     summer terms)       CSCI-GA              3033 Open Source Tools (fall term)          and one of           CSCI-GA              2565 Machine Learning (fall term), or      DS-GA-1003 Machine Learning and Computational Statistics     (spring)          Students in the concentration in data science must complete 33    points points of course credit (11 courses), including core and    elective courses. They must also obtain 3 points from a master's    capstone project.          The Capstone Project      The master's program culminates in a capstone project. The     capstone project course is usually taken during the final year     of study. During the project, students go through the entire     process of solving a real-world problem, from collecting and     processing data to designing and fully implementing a     solution. The problems and data sets come from settings     identical to those encountered in industry, academia, or     government.           The following is a list of courses approved to meet the     capstone requirement:             MATH-GA.2011/ CSCI-GA.2945      Advanced topics: Data Science      CSCI-GA Advanced Topics: High-Performance Computing      DS-GA-1006 Capstone Project in Data Science      CSCI-GA Advanced Computer Graphics      CSCI-GA Multicore Processors: Architecture     &amp;Programming      CSCI-GA Software Engineering           Advanced students can obtain permission from the director of     the program to do an individual capstone project under the     supervision of a faculty member.                Computing Facilities      The Courant Institute makes available for graduate training     and coursework a network of workstations maintained by systems     administrators. All graduate students have computer accounts     for the duration of their studies. NYU also runs a     high-performance computing center with both shared-memory and     distributed-memory computers.

Academic Standards      To register for courses, students must maintain good academic     standing, fulfilling the following requirements:           Students must maintain an average of B or better over     their first twelve credits. Students who fail to achieve     this cannot continue in the master's program.      Students cannot obtain a master's degree unless they have     maintained an overall average of B or better. Students at     risk of failing to meet this requirement receive a warning     letter from the department.      Students cannot obtain more than four no-credit grades,     withdrawals, or unresolved incomplete grades during their     academic tenure, and no more than two such grades in the     first six courses for which they have registered.          Up to two core courses taken elsewhere can earn transfer credit,    subject to the normal NYU graduate school restrictions on    transfer of credit and the approval of the program director. At    least 30 credits must be taken at NYU.
