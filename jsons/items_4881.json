In addition to histories of gender and sexuality, she specializes in U.S. history, African American history, the African diaspora, and intellectual history. Her research interests also include the history of medicine. She has served as an elected member of the National Council of the American Studies Association (2009-2012) and was a member of the ASA\u2019s Executive Committee from 2010-2012. She recently completed her last year (2011-2014) on the Executive Board of the Organization of American Historians. The Organization of American Historians appointed her as a Distinguished Lecturer from 2010-2013.

Mitchell is now writing a book that is tentatively entitled Idle Anxieties: Youth, Race, and Sexuality during the Great Depression. Above and beyond considering myriad ways in which idleness among workers, transients, and the poor was deemed a threat to social order, Idle Anxieties will examine how concerns about youth and idleness were suffused with gendered, sexualized, raced, and classed meanings as it considers changing notions of time, productivity, and leisure during economically slack years.

In addition to histories of gender and sexuality, she specializes in U.S. history, African American history, the African diaspora, and intellectual history. Her research interests also include the history of medicine. She has served as an elected member of the National Council of the American Studies Association (2009-2012) and was a member of the ASA\u2019s Executive Committee from 2010-2012. She recently completed her last year (2011-2014) on the Executive Board of the Organization of American Historians. The Organization of American Historians appointed her as a Distinguished Lecturer from 2010-2013. In addition to being a 2001-2002 Schomburg Center & National Endowment for the Humanities Scholar-in-Residence at the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture (New York Public Library), Mitchell has received a range of fellowship support for her work. Mitchell has also worked as a researcher for two major documentary projects: \u201cBehind the Veil: Documenting African-American Life in the Jim Crow South\u201d (Duke University); and the Martin Luther King, Jr., Papers Project (Stanford University). Mitchell is now writing a book that is tentatively entitled Idle Anxieties: Youth, Race, and Sexuality during the Great Depression. Above and beyond considering myriad ways in which idleness among workers, transients, and the poor was deemed a threat to social order, Idle Anxieties will examine how concerns about youth and idleness were suffused with gendered, sexualized, raced, and classed meanings as it considers changing notions of time, productivity, and leisure during economically slack years.

She earned her BA in Women and Gender Studies from the University of California-Davis in 2008, and that year also opened up her own vintage shop with her twin sister in Sacramento, California. With her sister tending the shop, Jen pursued graduate studies at Cornell University and earned a MA in Apparel Design in 2011. Her Master's thesis entitled \"Thrifting: Trash to Treasure in the Goodwill 'Bins\" explored how Outlet thrift stores across the U.S. were appropriated as community spaces and found that these sites offered the raw resources for creative local and multinational ventures in the informal economy. Jen's dissertation project, tentatively titled, \"Circuits of Value: The Political Economy of Buying and Selling Vintage\" scales up from her MA work to examine how large corporate non-profits and small businesses that comprise the secondhand trade (thrift stores, flea markets, and buy-sell-trade clothing shops) relate to global developments in fashion and design. Her research interests include fashion, reuse, alternative economies, cultural geography, aesthetic economies, material culture, and immaterial labor.        A.J.

Sam Markwell is a first-year PhD student with an MA in American Studies from the University of New Mexico. His work is situated in the fields of historical materialism, anthropology, geography, Native studies, settler colonial studies, and ethnic studies. His research investigates the array of concepts and apparatuses of \"security\" that animate U.S. and Israeli settler colonial projects, specifically focusing on contestations over food and water infrastructures. By critiquing the roles played by the U.S. and Israel in shaping life in these regions, he aims to reorient the study of security away from the priorities and frameworks of the settler nation-state to alternative political and ethical geographies of the Americas and West Asia.

Brian Ray  is a third-year doctoral student in American Studies who works in the transnational history of capitalism and social movements, queer studies, science studies, and transnational religion studies. He holds a BA in Women's Studies and Philosophy from the University of Georgia. His dissertation project is a transdisciplinary study of gay conservative activism and thought in the U.S. and Mexico. Tentatively, he conceives of gay conservatism as a post-WWII political \"third-way\" movement that poses interesting questions regarding left/right political identification, subjectivity, and the structure of history. Drawing on immanent critique and biopolitical frameworks, his project is in conversation with reconfigurations of Thomas Frank's infamous \"What's the matter with Kansas?\", like Bethany Moreton's reversal \"What matters to Arkansas?\" As such, his project explores how some counterintuitive or seemingly frustrated political identifications, like gay conservatives, are made possible by mapping the ethical substance of self-proclaimed post-partisan politics. Without psychologizing them, neither right nor left, what motivates these political actors? In this endeavor, particular attention is given to transnational material formations that have inaugurated and facilitated gay conservative movements in particular but that speak questions of subjectivity and progress in broader ways. A few include: narco trafficking, aesthetics, atheistic and theistic Satanisms, BDSM, contemporary science, the HIV/AIDS crisis, prosperity gospel, and the rise of neoliberalism in the Americas.  James Rodriguez entered NYU's American Studies PhD program in 2012 following his graduation from Brooklyn College, where he obtained a BA in both English and Psychology.

Stuart Schrader is a sixth-year PhD candidate in American Studies. His dissertation is entitled \"American Streets, Foreign Territory: How Counterinsurgent Knowledge Militarized Policing and Criminalized Color,\" for which he was awarded the Mellon/American Council of Learned Societies Dissertation Completion Fellowship. The dissertation examines transformations in policing that occurred in response to 1960s political struggles in the United States. These transformations, often characterized as the War on Crime and the rise of the carceral state, relied, the dissertation argues, on transnational networks of social scientists and policing and counterinsurgency experts. He has published in American Quarterly, Social Text: Periscope, CITY: Analysis of Urban Trends, NACLA Report on the Americas, Brooklyn Rail, and Maximum Rocknroll.   Jackson Smith is a first-year doctoral student in American Studies. He is broadly concerned with how practices of dispossession shape urban futures. As an undergraduate he conducted original archival research on the squatters\u2019 movement on the gentrifying Lower East Side. This research culminated with his article in Perspectives on Anarchist Theory, as well as his participation from 2011 to 2014 with the Museum of Reclaimed Urban Space (MoRUS), a storefront museum about squatting and community gardening in the East Village. He was the co-founder and curator of the MoRUS Film Fest in 2013 and 2014. Although continuing to research urban redevelopment by asking how international investment practices materially transform the city, Jackson has recently taken up dispossession as a socio-legal problem. He is devising a research project on civil asset forfeiture, a legal device that enables law enforcement to seize currency and other property outside of criminal proceedings. Civil forfeiture is premised upon the legal culpability of objects rather than people and effectively terminates the due process rights of the liberal subject. His research on the phenomenon will chart its legal formation during the 1970s and 1980s and ethnographically investigate its utilization to seize homes in contemporary Philadelphia.
