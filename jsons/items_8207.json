This course introduces a selection of key ideas, experiences, and planning practices that shaped the contemporary city, and those that contend to shape the future city. In a lecture-seminar format, it examines important cases drawn from major cities around the world such as Mumbai, Paris, New York, Shanghai, and Detroit. Topics include megacities and megaslums, sustainable cities, \"cybercities,\" and some of the most important planning interventions and visions from the past. The aim of the course is three-fold: To develop a critical reading of a selection of urban spaces, planning efforts, and texts; to provide a vocabulary of some of the major urban plans, ideas, and spaces: and to identify crucial issues that planners and designers now confront.

Opperman Institute of Judicial Administration and the NYU Journal of Legislation and Public Policy (JLPP) will mark the fiftieth anniversary of the New York Civil Practice Laws and Rules. The CPLR was adopted by the New York Legislature in 1962 and went into effect on September 1, 1963. Although amended many times since its adoption, the CPLR has remained the primary source of civil procedure rules in New York for the past 50 years.    In this Symposium we will look back and examine both the process that yielded this remarkable statute and the major innovations it brought. We will take stock of the principal procedural arrangements effected by the CPLR and look ahead to future challenges.    Speakers will include Hon. Jack Weinstein, who was one of the principal architects of the CPLR in his role as Reporter to the Advisory Committee, Hon. Judith Kaye, Prof. William Nelson (NYU School of Law), Prof. Vincent C. Alexander (St. John's University School of Law) and David L. Ferstendig, Esq., and the program will be moderated by Prof. Oscar G. Chase (NYU School of Law).    A reception will follow the program.                                To register for this program...           ...please click here .
