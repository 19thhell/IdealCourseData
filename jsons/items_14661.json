We then ask how such departures can be formalized theoretically and how the resulting models can be tested empirically.    Political Economy (T)   ECON-UA 345 Prerequisite: Microeconomics (ECON-UA 11). Offered every year. 4 points.   Introduces the emerging field of formal political economy. The variety of ways in which economists and political scientists think about political science and the interplay of political science and economics are analyzed. The first part of the course focuses on the formal modeling of political behavior and political institutions; the theory of social choice (how groups of rational individuals make decisions) and collective action (how groups of rational individuals take action) are analyzed. The second part of the course discusses the connection between politics and economics and investigates the effect of political variables on the determination of economic outcomes. Some questions that are answered: How can special groups of individuals enhance their well-being by political action? What is lobbying? What is the effect of contributions on political outcomes?

Experimental Economics (P, T)   ECON-UA 360 Prerequisite: Intermediate Microeconomics (ECON-UA 10) or Microeconomics (ECON-UA 11). Offered every year. 4 points.    Experimental economics is predicated on the belief that economics, like other sciences, can be a laboratory science where economic theories are tested, rejected, and revised. This course reviews the methodology of doing such laboratory experiments and investigates the use of experiments in a wide variety of fields. These include competitive markets, auctions, public goods theory, labor economics, game theory, and individual choice theory. The course functions as a research seminar in which students present their work as it progresses during the semester. Students also get exposure to the experimental laboratory in the Department of Economics and the research performed there.

We then ask how such departures can be formalized theoretically and how the resulting models can be tested empirically.    Political Economy (T)   ECON-UA 345 Prerequisite: Microeconomics (ECON-UA 11). Offered every year. 4 points.   Introduces the emerging field of formal political economy. The variety of ways in which economists and political scientists think about political science and the interplay of political science and economics are analyzed. The first part of the course focuses on the formal modeling of political behavior and political institutions; the theory of social choice (how groups of rational individuals make decisions) and collective action (how groups of rational individuals take action) are analyzed. The second part of the course discusses the connection between politics and economics and investigates the effect of political variables on the determination of economic outcomes. Some questions that are answered: How can special groups of individuals enhance their well-being by political action? What is lobbying? What is the effect of contributions on political outcomes?

Experimental Economics (P, T)   ECON-UA 360 Prerequisite: Intermediate Microeconomics (ECON-UA 10) or Microeconomics (ECON-UA 11). Offered every year. 4 points.    Experimental economics is predicated on the belief that economics, like other sciences, can be a laboratory science where economic theories are tested, rejected, and revised. This course reviews the methodology of doing such laboratory experiments and investigates the use of experiments in a wide variety of fields. These include competitive markets, auctions, public goods theory, labor economics, game theory, and individual choice theory. The course functions as a research seminar in which students present their work as it progresses during the semester. Students also get exposure to the experimental laboratory in the Department of Economics and the research performed there.

Designed to familiarize students with a modern approach to industrial organization economics. The modern approach relies extensively on the use of game-theoretic tools to model strategic market behavior and the use of econometric methods for testing hypotheses regarding firm conduct and market performance. In particular, the course analyzes profit-maximizing business strategies of firms with market power, as well as strategic interactions among firms in various types of imperfectly competitive markets. The course addresses both static modes of competition as well as dynamic competition in research and development and product design. The course also examines the scope of effective public policies designed to improve market performance. Throughout the course, mathematical-based models are used to develop the relevant concepts and test the pertinent theories of firm behavior.    Economic Development (P, T)   ECON-UA 323 Prerequisites: Intermediate Microeconomics (ECON-UA 10), Intermediate Macroeconomics (ECON-UA 12), and International Economics (ECON-UA 238); or Microeconomics (ECON-UA 11) and Macroeconomics (ECON-UA 13).

The building blocks of economic theory are used to understand the historical experiences of these countries. Macroeconomic topics covered include economic growth, income distribution, and poverty, with particular emphasis on the concept of underdevelopment as a circular, self-reinforcing trap. Microeconomic topics include the study of particular markets that are especially relevant to developing countries: those for land, labor, and credit. Notions of market fragmentation, limited information, and incentive problems receive emphasis. Ends with international issues: trading patterns, capital flows, and global financial crises are studied from the viewpoint of developing countries.    Economics of Energy and the Environment (P, T)   ECON-UA 326 Prerequisite: Intermediate Microeconomics (ECON-UA 10) or Microeconomics (ECON-UA 11). Offered every year. 4 points.   Economic analysis of major policy issues in energy and the environment, both domestic and international. Emphasis on market solutions to various problems and market limitations in the allocation of environmental resources. Energy issues focus on OPEC and world oil markets, with attention to reducing oil import vulnerability; taxation and regulation of production and consumption; conservation of natural resources; and the transition to alternative energy sources. Environmental issues include policies to reduce pollution. Substantial attention is paid to global warming caused by consumption of fossil fuels.    Ownership and Corporate Control in Advanced and Transition Economies (P, T)   ECON-UA 340 Prerequisite: Intermediate Microeconomics (ECON-UA 10) or Microeconomics (ECON-UA 11). Offered every year. 4 points.   Discusses the conceptual foundations and empirical evidence concerning the effects of private ownership on corporate performance. The corporate control mechanisms in the United States, Germany, Japan, and the emerging market economies of Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union are reviewed. Particular attention is paid to the role of capital markets (takeovers and other shareholder control devices), banks and other financial institutions, and various corporate institutions (such as boards of directors and meetings of shareholders) in facilitating or hindering corporate control and the efficient allocation of resources.    Behavioral Economics (P)   ECON-UA 342 Prerequisites: Topics in Econometrics (ECON-UA 380) and Calculus II (MATH-UA 122) or Mathematics for Economics II (MATH-UA 212); or Microeconomics (ECON-UA 11) and Introduction to Econometrics (ECON-UA 266). Offered every year. 4 points.   Introduces students to the field of behavioral economics, which seeks to insert more behavioral realism into economic theory. Topics covered include, but are not restricted to, prospect theory, mental accounting, other-regarding preferences, and hyperbolic discounting. We usually approach a topic by examining evidence of some departure from the assumptions made in the canonical economic model. We then ask how such departures can be formalized theoretically and how the resulting models can be tested empirically.    Political Economy (T)   ECON-UA 345 Prerequisite: Microeconomics (ECON-UA 11). Offered every year. 4 points.   Introduces the emerging field of formal political economy. The variety of ways in which economists and political scientists think about political science and the interplay of political science and economics are analyzed. The first part of the course focuses on the formal modeling of political behavior and political institutions; the theory of social choice (how groups of rational individuals make decisions) and collective action (how groups of rational individuals take action) are analyzed. The second part of the course discusses the connection between politics and economics and investigates the effect of political variables on the determination of economic outcomes. Some questions that are answered: How can special groups of individuals enhance their well-being by political action? What is lobbying? What is the effect of contributions on political outcomes?    Labor Economics (P, T)   ECON-UA 351 Prerequisite: Intermediate Microeconomics (ECON-UA 10) or Microeconomics (ECON-UA 11). Offered every semester. 4 points.

In alternate years, stresses policy implications and the development of theory. Analysis of government economic policies and behavior. Normative and positive economics; the fundamental welfare theorems. What goods should the government provide (public goods)? When should the government tax private behavior (externalities)? Income redistribution and the welfare program. Who pays the tax (tax incidence)? The role of debt policy. On what should taxes be levied (optimal taxation)?    Experimental Economics (P, T)   ECON-UA 360 Prerequisite: Intermediate Microeconomics (ECON-UA 10) or Microeconomics (ECON-UA 11). Offered every year. 4 points.    Experimental economics is predicated on the belief that economics, like other sciences, can be a laboratory science where economic theories are tested, rejected, and revised. This course reviews the methodology of doing such laboratory experiments and investigates the use of experiments in a wide variety of fields. These include competitive markets, auctions, public goods theory, labor economics, game theory, and individual choice theory. The course functions as a research seminar in which students present their work as it progresses during the semester. Students also get exposure to the experimental laboratory in the Department of Economics and the research performed there.    Elements of Financial Economics (T)   ECON-UA 363 Prerequisite: Microeconomics (ECON-UA 11). Restriction: open to students from the Stern School of Business only if FINC-UB 43 has not been taken. Offered every year. 4 points.   Provides theoretical tools for understanding the operation and economic role of asset markets in the financial system. Develops the theory of decision making under uncertainty and techniques for portfolio choice and efficient risk sharing. Develops static and dynamic models of asset markets with applications to efficiency, arbitrage pricing, and the use and pricing of derivative securities.    Advanced Micro Theory (T)   ECON-UA 365 Prerequisite: Microeconomics (ECON-UA 11). Offered every other year. 4 points.   Designed to introduce students to some of the main model-building techniques that have been developed by microeconomists. Intended for advanced undergraduates who have taken the necessary preparatory courses in economics and mathematics. Three basic topics are covered. The first topic is the static theory of consumer behavior both in a certain world and in an uncertain world. The second topic is the theory of general equilibrium. The third topic is the theory of dynamic optimization. In addition to the coverage of the economics, the advanced mathematical techniques that are needed to understand the material are reviewed.    Advanced Macroeconomics and Finance (T)   ECON-UA 367 Prerequisites: Microeconomics (ECON-UA 11), Macroeconomics (ECON-UA 13), and Analytical Statistics (ECON-UA 20), or permission of the instructor. Offered every year. 4 points.   Studies dynamic theories of equilibrium with optimizing agents who face risky returns and uncertain government policies that influence their decisions. We study inflations and hyperinflations; theories of pricing bonds and equity and how well they work empirically; Social Security reform; causes and cures of financial panics; theories of optimal monetary and fiscal policy; and search theory and other applications of dynamic programming.    Financial Economics (P)   ECON-UA 368 Prerequisite: Intermediate Microeconomics (ECON-UA 10) and Intermediate Macroeconomics (ECON-UA 12). Restriction: not open to students from the Stern School of Business. Offered every year. 4 points.   Provides theoretical and practical tools for understanding the operation of financial markets, the meaning of risk, and its relation to financial return. Also develops concepts of systematic versus idiosyncratic risk, market efficiency, the equilibrium determination of interest rates both in the overnight, interbank lending market and in the market for corporate debt, term and default premia in the bond market, and average excess stock returns in the equity market.    Topics in Economic Theory (T)   ECON-UA 375 Prerequisites: Microeconomics (ECON-UA 11) and Macroeconomics (ECON-UA 13). May not be taken for credit in addition to ECON-UA 370. Offered every year. 4 points.   Explores issues in economic theory using the tools learned in macroeconomics and microeconomics. Focuses on a particular issue each term.    Topics in Economic Analysis II (P)   ECON-UA 390 Prerequisites: Intermediate Microeconomics (ECON-UA 10) and/or Intermediate Macroeconomics (ECON-UA 12). Offered every year. 4 points.   An advanced undergraduate elective course offered to encourage department or visiting faculty who wish to give courses in fields that are not in the permanent course offerings. The exact topic of this course is announced before registration each year. Such \"topics courses\" are not given regularly and a specific topic presented in any one semester is unlikely to be repeated. Students are allowed to count only one such topics course for the major.    Advanced Econometrics (P, T)   ECON-UA 402 Prerequisite: Introduction to Econometrics (ECON-UA 266) or Topics in Econometrics (ECON-UA 380). Offered every year. 4 points.   Covers a range of techniques in econometrics that are widely used in applied microeconomics, macroeconomics, and other fields. Although this is a course designed for honors economics majors, students who are not pursuing honors but still satisfy the GPA requirements (3.65 overall and in economics courses) and meet the prerequisite are encouraged to take this course. The class aims at preparing students for carrying out empirical research in economics, and there is emphasis on the relationship between economic models and observable data. We cover nonlinear methods, and a selection of topics in panel and time-series data.        Honors and Independent Study    Honors Tutorial (P, T)   ECON-UA 410 Prerequisites: Intermediate Microeconomics (ECON-UA 10), Intermediate Macroeconomics (ECON-UA 12) and Topics in Econometrics (ECON-UA 380); or Microeconomics (ECON-UA 11), Macroeconomics (ECON-UA 13), and Introduction to Econometrics (ECON-UA 266); 3.65 GPA in the major and the College; permission of the instructor required.

The course has three main objectives. First, students will be introduced to different theories of politics (e.g. how a state should be organized, what is the relationship between ruler/state and governed, how should polities be designed) and theories of political economy (e.g. how do politics and economics interrelate, how do states balance issues of equity and efficiency, what are the benefits and limits of markets, what is the proper role of the state in the economy). Second, the course has a major writing component and is designed to improve students&rsquo; writing abilities. Third, the course is designed to challenge students intellectually and asks them to analyze and debate ethical and moral issues created by different economic and political choices. This will help both enhance students&rsquo; logical reasoning skills and intellectual development                Teaching Philosophy          1. The first objective is to teach you many of the fundamental concepts in economic and political thought.          2. The second objective is to develop students &rsquo; writing ability. The ability to articulate one&rsquo;s view is a crucial one and this course has a substantial writing component to help achieve that objective.          3. A third objective derived from the first two is the ability to encourage critical thinking to aid you in your future careers. Students are expected to dissect many leading debates of the day. While exams and papers will feature some issues and readings from class and in the texts, they will also test your ability to explain, defend or criticize theories or concepts. Business leaders maintain their firms&rsquo; positions by applying their analytical reasoning skills to daily as well as strategic challenges. Political leaders similarly must understand complex, and often just emerging, issues. They are able to question conventional wisdoms other observers take for granted or apply common sense analysis to otherwise intractable problems. Even if students may not use all of the specific tools learned in this or other classes they take as part of their Stern education, the critical thinking skills imparted can last a lifetime.                        Course Requirements          The course requirements include course papers for the writing component of the course, a midterm and a final. Additionally, class participation is graded and the course will require your active participation every week. Doing the assigned readings and being prepared to contribute in class will, therefore, be an important part of your grade. Please also feel free to come to our meetings with questions, comments and topics that will generate interesting discussions.          As noted, there will also be a series of short papers related to the topics introduced in class. These papers will be reviewed by the teaching instructor and returned to you for rewrites and then grading. Writing is a craft and improves with practice and feedback. As such, and as noted, a major course objective will be to improve each student&rsquo;s ability to write clearly, concisely and persuasively.           Participation/Attendance          Students are expected to have done the readings prior to class. In some cases, class discussions will follow readings closely. In others, they will not. The course has a reasonable policy for excused absences for personal circumstances, providing you clear absences with me in advance . Otherwise you are allowed one unexcused absence, after which absences will affect your participation grade.

Assessment Components      Grading Guidelines             Papers            40%        Midterm         20%     Final examination      30%        Class participation:       10%          Grading      At NYU Stern we seek to teach challenging courses that allow students to demonstrate their mastery of the subject matter. In general, students in undergraduate core courses can expect a grading distribution where:              25-35% of students can expect to receive A&rsquo;s for excellent work         50-70% of students can expect to receive B&rsquo;s for good or very good work           5-15% of students can expect to receive C&rsquo;s or less for adequate or below work          Note that while the School uses these ranges as a guide, the actual distribution for this course and your own grade will depend upon how well you actually perform in this course.         Re-Grading     The process of assigning grades is intended to be one of unbiased evaluation. Students are encouraged to respect the integrity and authority of the professor&rsquo;s grading system and are discouraged from pursuing arbitrary challenges to it.     If you believe an inadvertent error has been made in the grading of an individual assignment or in assessing an overall course grade, a request to have the grade re-evaluated may be submitted. You must submit such requests in writing to me including a brief written statement of why you believe that an error in grading has been made.          Professional Responsibilities For This Course       Attendance                  Class attendance is essential to your success in this course and is part of your grade. An excused absence can only be granted in cases of serious illness, grave family emergencies, or religious observance and must be documented. Job interviews and incompatible travel plans are considered unexcused absences. Where possible, please notify me in advance of an excused absence.           Participation        In-class contribution is a significant part of your grade and an important part of our shared learning experience. Your active participation helps me to evaluate your overall performance.   You can excel in this area if you come to class on time and contribute to the course by:            Providing strong evidence of having thought through the material.        Advancing the discussion by contributing insightful comments and questions.        Listening attentively in class.        Demonstrating interest in your peers' comments, questions, and presentations.        Giving constructive feedback to your peers when appropriate.              Assignments                Late assignments will either not be accepted or will incur a grade penalty unless due to documented serious illness or family emergency. Exceptions to this policy for reasons of religious observance or civic obligation will only be made available when the assignment cannot reasonably be completed prior to the due date and you make arrangements for late submission in advance.           Classroom Norms                  Arrive to class on time and stay to the end of the class period. Chronically arriving late or leaving class early is unprofessional and disruptive to the entire class. Repeated tardiness will have an impact on your grade.         Turn off all electronic devices prior to the start of class. Laptops, cell phones and other electronic devices are a distraction to everyone.            Stern Policies       General Behavior    The School expects that students will conduct themselves with respect and professionalism toward faculty, students, and others present in class and will follow the rules laid down by the instructor for classroom behavior. Students who fail to do so may be asked to leave the classroom.        Collaboration on Graded Assignments    Students may not work together on graded assignment unless the instructor gives express permission.        Course Evaluations    Course evaluations are important to us and to students who come after you. Please complete them thoughtfully.         Academic Integrity      Integrity is critical to the learning process and to all that we do here at NYU Stern. As members of our community, all students agree to abide by the NYU Stern Student Code of Conduct, which includes a commitment to:              Exercise integrity in all aspects of one&#39;s academic work including, but not limited to, the preparation and completion of exams, papers and all other course requirements by not engaging in any method or means that provides an unfair advantage.         Clearly acknowledge the work and efforts of others when submitting written work as one&rsquo;s own.
