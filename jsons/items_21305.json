Where is my award?                                                       NYU students who apply for financial aid in accordance with our priority deadlines are evaluated for financial aid and notified about the specific types and amounts of aid offered.   Students will be awarded their financial aid online via NYU Albert . An email with the appropriate link will be sent to you once your financial aid award package is available. Information about how to secure your aid will be provided in your financial aid award package and on your &quot;To Do&quot; list on Self-Service. All communication regarding your financial aid will be available to you via &quot;self service&quot; on NYU Albert .   Award schedule:     New Freshmen: Early April   Returning Undergraduates: Beginning mid June   New Graduates: varies by school; generally April/May   Returning Graduates: mid July     Students should also review important information to ensure the proper disbursement of their financial aid awards .                                                                                                                                                                            How do I apply for financial aid?                                                       All students are encouraged to apply every year for financial assistance. NYU requires the CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE application (to be considered for institutional [non-government] financial aid), the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) (for new freshmen and continuing students, to be considered for federal financial aid), and, for residents of New York State, the New York State Tuition Assistance Program (TAP) application.

(And what is \"Work-Study\"?)                                                          Go to Student Employment                                                                                                                                                                            I have financial aid now, but what about next year? Is it necessary to apply again?                                                       Yes, you must apply every year by submitting the FAFSA to determine and renew your financial aid (including NYU scholarships).   Each year the U.S. Department of Education will send to you a renewal reminder containing important information about your Federal Student Aid PIN and the FAFSA application process. (If you included a valid e-mail address on your FAFSA last year, you will receive the reminder by e-mail. Otherwise it will be mailed to your permanent address.) You will need your Federal Student Aid PIN to access your pre-filled FAFSA on the Web application that contains much of your application data from last year.   Visit the PIN web site at www.pin.ed.gov to verify your existing PIN, to request a duplicate if you have forgotten your PIN, or to request a new PIN if you (and your parents, if applicable) don't have one. (You use the same PIN each year, so you probably have one already).   It is possible to submit the FAFSA online without a PIN, but you must provide answers to all questions on a new FAFSA and you must print, sign, and mail the signature page after you submit the application, which will slow the process.   After January 1 but not later than May 1, access your FAFSA on the FAFSA website and revise the information to reflect your income for the preceding year (and other information only if it has changed), then submit the application. Be sure that you specify NYU (federal school code 002785) as the recipient of your information.   You should receive your Student Aid Report (SAR) within a few weeks after submitting the FAFSA. Call 1-800-4-FED-AID (1-800-433-3243) if you don't receive it. You may also view your SAR on the FAFSA website and make changes if necessary.   If you apply correctly and on time you can expect your NYU financial aid award notification by mid June (for returning undergraduates), describing your aid package for the next academic year.   Remember that the FAFSA and all necessary signatures must be received and validated by the processor and released to NYU no later than May 1 (not postmarked May 1), or the department deadline specified by your NYU school, if different. If you delay, a loss of aid could result. Remember, you must apply each year to renew your financial aid. May 1 is the priority deadline for most schools at NYU. Applying late could make you ineligible for certain types of aid, and funds become more limited. If you submitted a FAFSA last year and received an NYU scholarship, you should submit the FAFSA again each year by the NYU deadline to ensure normal processing.   TAP GRANT:   If you are a New York resident and received a state TAP grant, you must renew your grant award for next year to ensure credit for TAP on your Bursar bill. Click here for more information about the TAP application process.   CSS/FINANCIAL AID PROFILE:   The CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE is NOT REQUIRED for U.S. citizen and eligible non-citizen returning undergraduate students, transfer students, and graduate students at NYU New York campus, or adult students applying to The Paul McGhee Division at the NYU School of Continuing and Professional Studies, New York campus.     The CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE is REQUIRED every year for international students at NYU New York campus.     The CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE is REQUIRED every year for all students at NYU Abu Dhabi. (NOTE: it is not required for Emirati nationals, who will be automatically evaluated for Exceptional Emirati Scholarship upon acceptance.)     The CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE is REQUIRED every year for all students at NYU Shanghai. (NOTE: it is not required for Chinese nationals who complete the Gaokao college entrance examination instead of the SAT college admission test).                                                                                                                                                                        How do I get more financial aid?                                                       Review your FAFSA   Most student aid is based upon financial need, which is determined by the results of your FAFSA. The first step you should take is to ensure that the information you submitted on your FAFSA is correct. If your initial submission contained errors, you should correct your data on the FAFSA website at www.fafsa.gov . If your original data was correct when first submitted but your financial circumstances have changed since you filed the FAFSA, then, depending upon your situation, you may be eligible for review through a process called Professional Judgment. This process allows a financial aid administrator, under specific circumstances, to review your FAFSA eligibility based on new documentation, which will possibly change your eligibility for federal student aid. To determine if you are eligible, you should complete and submit the Professional Judgment Worksheet, available on our Applications and Forms menu . We will review your circumstances and notify you about opportunities for additional grants, federal loans, and alternative loans.   Change in Eligibility Increase   If you have enrolled for additional credit points and your tuition and/or fees have increased, if your housing status has changed (i.e. &quot;off campus&quot; vs. &quot;on campus&quot;), or if your grade level has changed, then your eligibility for federal loans (and possibly other types of student aid) may be reevaluated. Contact the Office of Financial Aid or send an e-mail message to explain your status change at NYU and to request that your aid be reviewed and/or your federal loan amount be increased if you are deemed eligible. If so, we will certify the additional amount(s) and send you a revised financial aid award notification. (Please note that annual and aggregate maximum borrowing limits apply to the Federal Stafford Loan .)   This change may also affect your eligibility for private student loans. Once you have maximized your federal loan eligibility then you may apply for additional private loan amounts to meet the cost of attendance. (See our information about Private Loans .) Once we have received approval from your lender, the Office of Financial Aid will certify the private loan and then notify you accordingly.   Individual Budget Appeal   If you find that your miscellaneous education-related expenses for the academic year (e.g. books and supplies, computer equipment, etc.) will exceed those projected in NYU's estimated budget for your total cost of attendance (see Tuition, Fees, and Expenses ), please submit the Budget Appeal form, also available on our Applications and Forms menu.   General Scholarship Increase Request   Returning undergraduate students who have submitted their FAFSA and wish to increase or add scholarship funding to their financial aid package may do so via the annual appeal process. During appeal season, our online Appeal Form for Returning Undergraduates is available on the Applications and Forms menu. Students must meet the specified appeal deadline and include an explanation of why they are seeking additional funding. Appeal results are typically based on financial need and academic performance. The amount of appeal funds available varies each year, and individual NYU schools work closely with the Office of Financial Aid throughout the process to make the appeal determination.   NYU graduate students should consult with the admissions/financial aid representative in their school or program department (see &quot;School Financial Aid Contacts&quot; on our alphabetical list of References and Resources .   Conclusion   Regardless of your status, we strongly encourage all students to explore the many private scholarships available.   You also may find NYU Payment Plans to be helpful. Although they are not a form of financial aid, NYU Payment Plans provide a good way to budget and plan your payments for each semester.                                                                                                                                                                        I will attend NYU in the summer. Is there any student aid available then?                                                       Usually yes. To be considered for ANY type of financial aid in the summer you must submit the NYU Summer Financial Aid Application, which is available on our Applications and Forms menu beginning in February. A Summer Financial Aid Application is also available for visiting non-NYU students.                                                                                                                                                                          I will enroll in a January Term course. Is financial aid available?                                                       NYU Undergraduate Students :   NYU New York undergraduates enrolling for January Term either in New York or at an NYU Study Away site will automatically be reviewed for additional scholarship eligibility. No application is needed. The review will be based upon financial need and the number of credits the student is enrolled for in January. The amount of scholarship awarded will be proportional to the amount of tuition the students' scholarship covered during an academic year semester. Students will be reviewed within a week after they register and will be notified via Albert accordingly. Students who do not have scholarship during the academic year are not eligible for January Term scholarship consideration.   Students needing additional financial aid for January Term will be able to seek out alternative loans, as additional federal loans are not available. Students seeking alternative loans are encouraged to relay to their potential lender the number of credits they will be taking, as some have minimum enrollment criteria. Private loan eligibility cannot exceed the cost of attendance for January term minus any other aid students may receive for the term. NYU cannot recommend or endorse any particular private lender. Students are encouraged to research their options carefully.   Students who change January Term enrollment or who do not attend in January will have their January award adjusted or cancelled.   NYU Graduate Students :   Generally, grants/scholarships are not available to NYU graduate students for the January Term, although graduate students should consult with their school's student services office or financial aid contact if they have questions.   Visiting non-NYU Students :   NYU grants/scholarships are not available to visiting non-NYU students for the January Term. However, visiting non-NYU students currently receiving federal financial aid at their home school may be able to apply a portion of it to their attendance at NYU by implementing a Consortium Agreement. Please consult with the financial aid office at your home school to determine if you can complete a Consortium Agreement for New York University.     In addition, visiting non-NYU students who are receiving institutional scholarship or grant funds from their home school while attending January Term at NYU must notify New York University.   Visiting non-NYU students will receive further information and instructions upon registration for January Term at NYU.   All students :   All students (NYU and visiting non-NYU) may apply for a private (non-federal) alternative loan for the January Term.                                                                                                                                                                        I have deferred my enrollment at NYU. How does this affect my financial aid?                                                         Go to Eligibility for Financial Aid: Deferred Enrollment                                                                                                                                                                            I will graduate at the end of the fall semester. Can I have aid awarded for the following spring semester applied to my fall account?                                                       No.   Most financial aid, such as Federal Direct Loans, Federal Direct PLUS Loans, TAP, Pell Grant, Perkins Loan, and NYU scholarship, is based on full academic year attendance, so if you are enrolled for one semester only, you will be awarded the appropriate portion for which you are eligible.                                                                                                                                                                        My grade level will advance in the spring. Will I be eligible for more financial aid once I become a Sophomore/Junior/Senior?                                                       You might be eligible for more Federal Subsidized or Federal Unsubsidized Loans. Once your grades have been posted on the Student Information System after the fall semester, if your grade level has increased from a Freshman level to a Sophomore level (32 points earned), or has changed from the Sophomore level to a Junior level (64 points earned) you may be eligible for more Federal Subsidized Loan or Federal Unsubsidized Loan. If you would like your eligibility for a loan increase to be reviewed, send an e-mail message to the Office of Financial Aid from your NYU email account with your specific request. If you are eligible, the loan amount will be increased and you will receive a notice to log on the Student Center and accept that amount. A new loan application is not required. Funds will be disbursed to your Bursar account in accordance with federal disbursement schedules. Also, please note that the increase could affect your loan eligibility for the upcoming summer if you plan to attend and receive federal loans in the summer.                                                                                                                                                                        I am an Undergraduate student considering an internal transfer to another NYU school in the spring. How will my financial aid be affected?                                                       In most cases the amount of financial aid you receive will not be affected. If your total credit points, your housing status, and your financial aid application information is the same as it was for the fall semester, the amount of financial aid you receive should remain the same.   PLEASE NOTE:     Departmental scholarships are not transferable to another school.   School of Continuing and Professional Studies (SCPS) students enrolled full-time in the General Studies Program, McGhee Division, the Hotel and Tourism Management Program, or the Recreation and Leisure Studies Program may transfer to another undergraduate school at NYU without affecting their financial aid.     If you are uncertain of your status, send an e-mail message to the Office of Financial Aid.                                                                                                                                                                        Who do I speak to about a question or problem with my bill?                                                       Billing transactions and associated student account issues are administered by the NYU Office of the Bursar .    See also NYU Albert to view your billing information record, including financial aid credits.    If some financial aid items are not listed on your bill, please make sure you do not have any \u2018holds\u2019 listed on your account and you are registered for the appropriate number of credits Financial Aid has anticipated for you. Also, please be sure you have accepted the item you wanted on Albert, completed all the necessary paperwork and allow 3-5 business days for this to reflect on your Bursar account.    Keep in mind that you will not receive an updated bill until your scheduled billing date . However, current changes and adjustments are visible on NYU Albert .    It is important to note that in some cases the student aid information initially shown on Albert may not exactly match the official Financial Aid Awards you subsequently receive.                                                                                                                                                                         How do I apply for a loan?                                                         Go to Direct Loan Instructions .                                                                                                                                                                          What are alternative loans, and why would I apply for such a loan?                                                         Go to Private (Non-Federal) Alternative Loans .                                                                                                                                                                          I received a Sub/Unsub loan/Perkins Loan/PLUS Loan that I do not want. Do I have to sign the Promissory Note(s) for these loans?                                                       If you were offered ANY aid you do not wish to use, please \u2018decline\u2019 the aid on NYU Albert. This will remove the item from your \u2018To Do\u2019 List.   If you have received loan promissory note, and you do not wish to use the loan, you DO NOT have to sign the promissory note. Please disregard the loans promissory notes.                                                                                                                                                                        My student application for a Federal Graduate PLUS Loan has been denied. What now?                                                         If you are not initially approved for a Federal Graduate PLUS Loan, you will receive an endorser packet directly from the U.S. Department of Education. This packet explains that a PLUS Loan may still be acquired if someone else with an acceptable credit rating -- such as your spouse, a relative, or friend -- agrees to endorse or cosign the loan. Contact the Office of Financial Aid for further instructions.   Please note that if you receive the Federal Direct PLUS Loan based on a credit-worthy endorser, the PLUS Master Promissory Note (MPN) that you have completed will expire with that endorsed loan. A new PLUS MPN will be required for any subsequent PLUS Loan for which you apply.   Graduate students who are originally credit denied for a Direct PLUS Loan, but have obtained approval by appeal or endorser, are required to complete a new PLUS Loan Counseling session. The federal Department of Education will contact the borrower in these cases and direct them to studentloans.gov to complete PLUS Loan Counseling. Your PLUS Loan cannot disburse to your Bursar bill until you have completed the PLUS Loan Counseling.   The U.S. Department of Education does not inform the NYU Office of Financial Aid about the specific reason for the denial of a Federal PLUS Loan. If you feel that there are extenuating circumstances and you wish to appeal the credit denial, you must contact the Direct Loan Origination Center toll-free at 1-800-557-7394.                                                                                                                                                                          How long do federal Direct PLUS Loan credit decisions remain valid?                                                       Credit approval is valid for 90 days. Your credit is evaluated by Direct Loans every time you request a new loan unless you have had a credit decision within the preceding 90 days.                                                                                                                                                                        How can I consolidate my student loans?                                                         Go to References and Resources for information about Loan Consolidation, Loan Deferment, Loan Forgiveness, and Loan Repayment.                                                                                                                                                                          My parents don't support me and won't contribute to my education, so why am I still considered a \"dependent\" student?                                                       It's a federal definition.   There are basic requirements a student must meet to be considered an independent student (see The Guide to Federal Student Aid for criteria). If you do not meet these requirements but you still believe you are truly independent of your parents, you may appeal for a \"dependency override\" with our office. The example below describes the conditions of an acceptable override, but if your situation is different please bring it to our attention for review.   INVOLUNTARY DISSOLUTION OF FAMILY   To demonstrate the \"involuntary dissolution\" of your family you must present:     A letter written by you which states that you do not and cannot have contact with your parents and also explains what precipitated the dissolution of the family.   A letter from a third party (someone not related to you) stating that you do not and cannot have contact with your parents. The letter must be written by someone:     who is professional (preferably your social worker or case worker, a member of the clergy, or a lawyer who has been represented you in legal proceedings), and;   who has personal, first-hand knowledge of your familial situation.     A copy of your completed FAFSA, which must be submitted as if you were an independent student.     If you can provide the appropriate documentation, a dependency override will be considered for you and your financial aid award may be changed based upon an independent status. (Note that just because a student is considered \"independent\" does not necessarily mean a student's aid will increase.)                                                                                                                                                                        What academic standards must I maintain at NYU to be eligible for financial aid?                                                         Go to Satisfactory Academic Progress .                                                                                                                                                                          Why hasn't financial aid been credited on my Bursar bill?                                                       If no student aid of any kind has been deducted from your bill, chances are you did not submit the required financial aid applications , or, if you did, you may have applied later than NYU's priority deadline (see sidebar above right), which may have affected your aid eligibility. If you have already applied and received your Student Aid Report (SAR) from the federal processors, in most cases you should have received a notice from us to view your financial aid award on NYU Albert. Verify on NYU Albert that your FAFSA data has been &quot;received&quot; by us (it will be listed in your &quot;To Do&quot; list as received if it is truly received by NYU).   If your FAFSA information was received by NYU more than 3 weeks ago and you have not received a financial aid award, you should first refer to NYU Albert to see if there are any &quot;holds&quot; on your account. A hold on your account may delay your financial aid awards. If there is a hold, please rectify that situation. The delay could be caused by circumstances concerning your aid eligibility. For example, you may not be meeting the satisfactory academic progress standards required to maintain student aid, or further documents may be required from you before we are able to process your award. If there are no holds, and if your award still seems delayed, then contact the Office of Financial Aid . Our counselors can discuss details with you and estimate when you can expect an award.                                                                                                                                                                        I haven't yet applied, but my bill is due soon. I know processing takes several weeks from start to finish. Is there any type of interim aid I can have while I wait?                                                       There is no interim aid. Students often ask if they can take out private, non-federal loans while they wait for their financial aid application to be processed and their federal loans to be disbursed. Students are discouraged from pursuing this because it also takes a few weeks to receive alternative loans, and if you take out alternative loans in advance of your federal loans, you may inadvertently take out too much private loan, which you would then have to return. This can be costly. Or, if you didn't want to return the private loan funds your federal aid eligibility could be adversely affected. The best strategy is to apply for financial aid as soon as possible, and, in the interim, work out a payment plan with the Bursar. If you're eligible for financial aid and you've already made a payment to the Bursar, you will be refunded the amount of overpayment.                                                                                                                                                                         When can I expect my loan refund?                                                       Loan refunds are administered through the NYU Office of the Bursar , and there are important elements to consider if you are anticipating a credit balance. For example, because your loans can not be released to NYU before your designated disbursement date, and because once they are disbursed certain basic enrollment criteria must first be verified (e.g. you normally must be enrolled for at least 6 points) before the loan amount is applied to your account balance, a refund resulting from your student loan will usually not be confirmed and processed until a few days after your disbursement date.                                                                                                                                                                        My financial aid award was based on anticipated credits and housing status, but my plans have changed. What do I do?                                                       Contact the Office of Financial Aid if any of the conditions of your initial award has changed. Depending on the changes, your aid may or may not be affected, but it is always better to inform the Office of Financial Aid of your plans so adjustments can be made, if necessary, early in the semester. If you fail to inform the Office of Financial Aid, then any discrepancies that exist between your anticipated and actual registered credit points will appear during enrollment audit and adjustments will be made at that time. It is the obligation of the Office of Financial Aid to adjust aid according to University policy and federal regulations.                                                                                                                                                                        Why has my citizenship status been requested? What are the citizenship requirements for federal aid?                                                       Students may be required to verify their U.S. citizenship status to confirm eligibility for some federal grant programs, and non-citizens are subject to different regulations which may require supporting documentation, depending upon the type of financial aid sought.       Go to Citizenship Documentation                                                                                                                                                                            Is it too late to apply for aid now that NYU's priority deadline has passed? Is there any aid I can get while I'm waiting for my federal aid eligibility?                                                       You are strongly encouraged to apply for financial aid even if you missed the NYU priority deadline (see Financial Aid Deadlines in the column above right). You may not qualify for the same amounts or types of funds if you did not apply on time. However, there are still alternatives available. For example, you will likely be eligible for some form of federal loan, and possibly federal grants and Federal Work-Study.                                                                                                                                                                         I have been asked to provide verification of my financial aid eligibility. What now?

NYU does not have an ROTC program on campus. However, NYU students can participate in ROTC through other schools in New York while attending NYU.

There is some financial aid credited on my bill this semester, but I was also expecting other credits. What happened to my TAP Grant?                                                       If you are a New York State resident, submitted a FAFSA, and applied for TAP using either TAP on the Web or a printed Express TAP Application (ETA), you should have received a TAP award certificate from the New York State Higher Education Services Corporation (HESC) . Contact HESC at 1-888-NYS-HESC (1-888-697-4372) if more than a few weeks have passed without notification after submitting the FAFSA.   HESC will also advise the NYU Office of the Bursar about your eligibility. If you have received your TAP award certificate but credit has not yet been applied to your bill, write a note on the bill and pay the appropriate remaining balance.                                                                                                                                                                        There is some financial aid credited on my bill this semester, but I was also expecting other credits. What happened to my Pell Grant?                                                       To be eligible for a Pell Grant you must be an undergraduate, have not earned a prior degree, and have an Estimated Family Contribution (as calculated by the government) of $5,273 or less. If you were eligible for Pell last year, you may not be eligible this year \u2014 it can vary depending upon your family and your resources. If you think you are Pell eligible and you subsequently received a request from NYU for documents to verify your FAFSA data, your Pell Grant may not be applied to your bill until the verification review is complete. Use NYU Albert to see if you have any outstanding document requests (please check the To Do list). Also, if you changed your Student Aid Report (SAR) to update any information the changes could have affected your Pell eligibility.                                                                                                                                                                        There is some financial aid credited on my bill this semester, but I was also expecting other credits. What happened to my scholarship?                                                       If you filed a FAFSA last year and received a scholarship, but didn't submit the FAFSA again this year, your scholarship amount could be affected. Most scholarships at NYU are based on a combination of need and merit. Review the letter that you received from our office when you were initially awarded. If you have not already submitted the FAFSA and you need to, do so right away. Depending on the availability of funding, late filers may not get their full scholarship.                                                                                                                                                                        There is some financial aid credited on my bill this semester, but I was also expecting other credits. What happened to my Perkins Loan?                                                       If the federal processors received your FAFSA later than the March 1 deadline (see sidebar above right), you may not have been offered a Perkins Loan. There is a limited amount of federal Perkins funding available to New York University and we must give priority to those who apply on time.    There are a few other reasons why your loan may not be on your bill. On Albert you need to accept your Perkins loan and wait 1 day. After 1 day has passed you must then e-sign your MPN, and print, sign, and mail your Perkins Rights and Responsibilities/Entrance Interview and you Truth-in-Lending in order to receive credit for this loan. Credit will be posted to your Bursar account 24 to 48 hours after you have completed all these steps and after we have received the printed documents.                                                                                                                                                                         There is some financial aid credited on my bill this semester, but I was also expecting other credits. What happened to my Federal Stafford Loan and/or Federal PLUS Loan?                                                       Be sure that you have completed the acceptance process for the Federal Stafford Loan and/or the Federal PLUS Loan to ensure the proper disbursement of funds. If a Stafford and/or PLUS Loan amount was suggested on your financial aid award letter, follow the instructions to secure your loan(s) and then deduct the pending loan amount from your bill (minus the origination fee) and pay the remainder.                                                                                                                                                                        There is some financial aid credited on my bill this semester, but I was also expecting other credits. What happened to my Private Loans?                                                       Your private loan must be approved by the lender and certified by NYU before you will be given credit for that loan. If it has been approved since the date of your bill, simply deduct the semester portion of the approved loan from your bill.                                                                                                                                                                        There is some financial aid credited on my bill this semester, but I was also expecting other credits. What happened to my Federal Work-Study?                                                       Federal Work-Study is not credited on your bill because it represents a potential amount yet to be earned in bi-weekly paychecks during the year. If suggested Work-Study is included in your financial aid package, it means you are eligible to participate in the Federal Work-Study Program .

Frequently Asked Questions                                                                                                                            I just accepted my Direct Loan(s), but now I want to change the amount. How can I make changes to my loan amounts?                                                       Once you have accepted your Direct Loan amounts on NYU Albert you cannot make further changes online. Please notify us to make adjustments to your awards:     Email to the Office of Financial Aid .

I have just been offered an increase or an additional Federal Direct Loan on my award letter. Do I have to complete all of the steps again?                                                       Each loan type (undergraduate/graduate Federal Direct Loan, Federal Direct Parent PLUS Loan and Graduate PLUS Loan) requires its own Master Promissory Note, or MPN, and Entrance Counseling (except Parent PLUS). So, if your increase is to an existing loan type you do NOT need to complete the MPN and Entrance Counseling again. However, you will still need to accept your increase on NYU Albert . If your increase or additional loan is a loan type you were not previously awarded, you WILL need to complete the MPN and Entrance Counseling (except Parent PLUS) in addition to accepting it on NYU Albert .                                                                                                                                                                        How/when do my Direct Loans get posted to my tuition account?                                                       Once you accept your loans on NYU Albert ,  sign your MPN, and complete Entrance Counseling, credit is then posted  to your account. The credit is provisional and does not change to real  credit until 10 days before the start of the loan period.                                                                                                                                                                        What if I want to return some loan funds after I have received a disbursement from Direct Loans?                                                       Within 120 Days of Disbursement:   You have the right to  cancel all or part of any disbursement of a Federal Direct Loan without  being charged interest and other loan fees as long as the cancellation  is processed within 120 days of the original disbursement date. The  disbursement date is the date the funds were applied to your NYU Bursar  bill during any given semester.   To request a cancellation, you must make your request through the NYU Bursar\u2019s Office by completing a Request to Return Loan Funds Form and submitting it to the Bursar as instructed on the form.   More Than 120 Days After Disbursement:   If  you wish to cancel all or part of any disbursement of your loan more  than 120 days after it was disbursed, you are actually repaying part of  your loan and you must pay any accrued interest and/or fees. You cannot  cancel your loan, but you can make a payment directly to your federal  loan servicer. Borrowers are assigned to one of the five servicers,  which include ACS, Great Lakes, NelNet, PHEAA, and Sallie Mae. If you  are not sure which of the five centers is your assigned servicer, visit  and log into the federal government\u2019s National Student Loan Data System to determine your servicer. You may also call 1-800-4-FED-AID to locate your servicer.                                                                                                                                                                        When can I expect my Direct Loan refund?                                                       Loan refunds are administered through the Office of the Bursar ,  and there are important elements to consider if you are anticipating a  credit balance. For example, because your loans can not be released to  NYU before your designated disbursement date, and because once they are  disbursed certain basic enrollment criteria must first be verified (e.g.  you normally must be enrolled for at least 6 points) before the loan  amount is applied to your account balance, a refund resulting from your  student loan will usually not be confirmed and processed until a few  days after your disbursement date.   IMPORTANT for Summer students :   Please note that if you are eligible for loans in the summer, those  loans do not disburse until July 1, and for those eligible for a refund,  you should not rely on those funds until at least one week after  disbursement.                                                                                                                                                                        How can I reduce my federal loans?                                                       If you have completed the acceptance process for a Federal Direct Loan and/or a Federal Direct PLUS Loan but no longer want to borrow the full amount, contact the Office of Financial Aid as soon as possible to authorize a reduction.   Once you have accepted your Direct Loan amounts on NYU Albert you cannot make further changes online. Please notify us to make adjustments to your awards:     Email to the Office of Financial Aid .

My parent's application for a Federal PLUS Loan has been denied. What now?                                                         If the parent borrower is not initially approved for a Federal PLUS Loan, they will receive an endorser packet directly from the U.S. Department of Education. This packet explains that a PLUS Loan may still be acquired if someone else with an acceptable credit rating -- such as the parent applicant's spouse, a relative, or friend -- agrees to endorse or cosign the loan. Contact Direct Loans Applicant Services at 1-800-557-7394 for additional instructions for endorsers.   Parents also have the option to appeal the Department of Education\u2019s PLUS denial. For instructions on how to appeal, please contact the Department of Education\u2019s Applicant Services at 1-800-557-7394.   Please note that if the parent borrower receives the Federal PLUS Loan based on a credit-worthy endorser, the PLUS Master Promissory Note (MPN) that the parent completed will expire with that endorsed loan. A new PLUS MPN will be required for any subsequent PLUS Loan for which the parent applies.   Parent borrowers who are originally credit denied for a Direct PLUS Loan, but have obtained approval by appeal or endorser, are required to complete a new PLUS Loan Counseling session. The federal Department of Education will contact the borrower in these cases and direct them to studentloans.gov to complete PLUS Loan Counseling. Your PLUS Loan cannot disburse to your Bursar bill until you have completed the PLUS Loan Counseling.   The U.S. Department of Education does not inform the NYU Office of Financial Aid about the specific reason for the denial of a Federal PLUS Loan. To appeal for reconsideration, contact the Direct Loan Origination Center toll-free at 1-800-557-7394.   In the event a denial is final, the student may contact the Office of Financial Aid to request consideration for an additional Federal Direct Unsubsidized Loan. Freshman and Sophomores may be eligible for a maximum of $4,000 in additional funds, and Juniors and Seniors may be eligible for a maximum of $5,000 in additional funds. Please note: if at a later time during the academic year a parent becomes eligible or is approved with a co-signor for a Parent PLUS loan, the additional Unsubsidized Loan will be canceled.                                                                                                                                                                          I completed my Subsidized/Unsubsidized Master Promissory Note (MPN) on www.studentloans.gov. Why is it still requested on my Albert To Do list?                                                       Usually, this occurs when the subsidized and/or unsubsidized loans have not yet originated. Origination means that your loan data is being sent to the Department of Education for processing. The checklist item for the MPN will not update to a received status until the loan(s) successfully originate.                                                                                                                                                                          I am a transfer student and I completed my Subsidized/Unsubsidized MPN for my previous school. Do I have to do a new one for NYU?                                                       No, your completed Subsidized/Unsubsidized MPN can be used for your loans at NYU, provide they are still valid and in an active status.                                                                                                                                                                          I am a transfer student and I completed my Undergraduate Entrance Counseling for my previous school. Do I have to do a new one for NYU?                                                       No, your completed Undergraduate Entrance Counseling session can be used for your loans at NYU. However, you must contact NYU\u2019s Office of Financial Aid to let us know. Otherwise, we would not know that you ever completed one in the past and your Entrance Counseling checklist item on your Albert To Do list would stay in a requested status. Once we confirm that a counseling session was completed previously we will update your NYU records.                                                                                                                                                                          How does my parent borrower apply for a Federal Direct Parent PLUS Loan?                                                       You, the student, must start the process by accepting the offered Federal Direct Parent PLUS Loan on your Albert account. You can do so by logging in to Albert and then clicking on the Accept/Decline Financial Aid link and following the instructions.   Your parent borrower will be asked to complete the Federal Direct PLUS Loan Request and Master Promissory Note by visiting the Direct Loan Web site at www.studentloans.gov . They must sign in using the same PIN number that was assigned to them to access your FAFSA. If they do not remember their PIN, they may request a duplicate from the Official PIN site .   The U.S. Department of Education will conduct a credit check that is valid for only 90 days. Your parent borrower should not apply more than 90 days before the start of fall semester to avoid credit expiration.   Shortly after the PLUS Loan originates to the Department of Education, an email from the NYU Office of Financial Aid will be sent to the parent borrower (only if the PLUS Loan was credit approved). The approved parent must complete the PLUS Loan process by logging in to the NYU Student System as instructed in this email and by providing the dollar amount of the Parent PLUS Loan that is desired and the parent must actively accept the PLUS Loan on the same page.                                                                                                                                                                          Who completes the Master Promissory Note for my parent borrower\u2019s endorsed (co-signed) Parent PLUS Loan -- my parent or the endorser?                                                       Even if your parent borrower has had to obtain an endorser for their Federal Direct PLUS Loan, they are still the borrower on the loan. Therefore, the parent borrower must complete the MPN.                                                                                                                                                                          My parent borrower was approved for a Parent PLUS Loan by completing the PLUS Loan Request on www.studentloans.gov. Why did they receive an email from the Office of Financial Aid asking them to complete a PLUS Loan confirmation process?                                                       Federal regulations require a parent borrower to actively accept each Parent PLUS Loan and indicate the final amount they wish to accept for each loan. The email with instructions on completing the final PLUS Loan confirmation is sent to the parent borrower after the loan has been originated and we are in receipt of the approved credit decision. This is your parent borrower\u2019s opportunity to accept the loan for the amount that was originated or reduce the amount if they do not need the entire loan.   For subsequent PLUS Loans in your undergraduate career, your parent borrower may not be required to complete a new PLUS Loan Request on www.studentloans.gov , but they will be required to complete the final PLUS Loan confirmation process through our site.                                                                                                                                                                          Does my parent borrower have to complete a new Federal Direct PLUS Loan Master Promissory Note if . . .                                                       . . . they already did one for a previous school?   No, if your parent borrower has already completed a PLUS Loan MPN for any school (without an endorser) they do not have to complete a new one.   . . . they already did one for my PLUS loan from last year?   No, if your parent borrower was credit approved on their own for a Federal Direct PLUS Loan in a previous semester or year they do not have to complete a new one.   . . . their previous PLUS Loan was approved with an endorser (co-signer)?   Yes, if their previous PLUS Loan required an endorser for credit approval they must complete a new Master Promissory Note for the next PLUS Loan. This is because each endorsed (co-signed) Parent PLUS Loan must have its own MPN \u2013 the MPN for an endorsed loan cannot be used for any subsequent loan.                                                                                                                                                                          My parent borrower received a refund from the Parent PLUS Loan. Can they return the refund check if they do not need the funds?                                                       Yes. Parent borrowers have the right to cancel all or part of any disbursement of a federal Parent PLUS Loan without being charged interest and other loan fees as long as the cancellation is processed within 120 days of the original disbursement date. The disbursement date is the date the funds were applied to your NYU Bursar bill during any given semester.   To request a cancellation, they must make the request through the NYU Bursar\u2019s Office by completing a Request to Return Loan Funds Form and submitting it to the Bursar as instructed on the form.   If they wish to cancel all or part of any disbursement of their loan more than 120 days after it was disbursed, they are actually repaying part of their loan and they must pay any accrued interest and/or fees. They cannot cancel their loan, but they can make a payment directly to your federal loan servicer. Borrowers are assigned to one of the five servicers, which include ACS, Great Lakes, NelNet, PHEAA, and Sallie Mae. If they are not sure which of the five centers is their assigned servicer, visit and log into the federal government\u2019s National Student Loan Data System to determine their servicer. They may also call 1-800-4-FED-AID to locate your servicer.                                                                                                                                                                          I received a refund from my Subsidized/Unsubsidized loan. Can I return the refund check if I do not need the funds?                                                       Yes -- please see the FAQ above regarding parent borrowers returning refunds from a Parent PLUS Loan.

Where is my award?                                                       NYU students who apply for financial aid in accordance with our priority deadlines are evaluated for financial aid and notified about the specific types and amounts of aid offered.   Students will be awarded their financial aid online via NYU Albert . An email with the appropriate link will be sent to you once your financial aid award package is available. Information about how to secure your aid will be provided in your financial aid award package and on your &quot;To Do&quot; list on Self-Service. All communication regarding your financial aid will be available to you via &quot;self service&quot; on NYU Albert .   Award schedule:     New Freshmen: Early April   Returning Undergraduates: Beginning mid June   New Graduates: varies by school; generally April/May   Returning Graduates: mid July     Students should also review important information to ensure the proper disbursement of their financial aid awards .                                                                                                                                                                            How do I apply for financial aid?                                                       All students are encouraged to apply every year for financial assistance. NYU requires the CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE application (to be considered for institutional [non-government] financial aid), the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) (for new freshmen and continuing students, to be considered for federal financial aid), and, for residents of New York State, the New York State Tuition Assistance Program (TAP) application.

(And what is \"Work-Study\"?)                                                          Go to Student Employment                                                                                                                                                                            I have financial aid now, but what about next year? Is it necessary to apply again?                                                       Yes, you must apply every year by submitting the FAFSA to determine and renew your financial aid (including NYU scholarships).   Each year the U.S. Department of Education will send to you a renewal reminder containing important information about your Federal Student Aid PIN and the FAFSA application process. (If you included a valid e-mail address on your FAFSA last year, you will receive the reminder by e-mail. Otherwise it will be mailed to your permanent address.) You will need your Federal Student Aid PIN to access your pre-filled FAFSA on the Web application that contains much of your application data from last year.   Visit the PIN web site at www.pin.ed.gov to verify your existing PIN, to request a duplicate if you have forgotten your PIN, or to request a new PIN if you (and your parents, if applicable) don't have one. (You use the same PIN each year, so you probably have one already).   It is possible to submit the FAFSA online without a PIN, but you must provide answers to all questions on a new FAFSA and you must print, sign, and mail the signature page after you submit the application, which will slow the process.   After January 1 but not later than May 1, access your FAFSA on the FAFSA website and revise the information to reflect your income for the preceding year (and other information only if it has changed), then submit the application. Be sure that you specify NYU (federal school code 002785) as the recipient of your information.   You should receive your Student Aid Report (SAR) within a few weeks after submitting the FAFSA. Call 1-800-4-FED-AID (1-800-433-3243) if you don't receive it. You may also view your SAR on the FAFSA website and make changes if necessary.   If you apply correctly and on time you can expect your NYU financial aid award notification by mid June (for returning undergraduates), describing your aid package for the next academic year.   Remember that the FAFSA and all necessary signatures must be received and validated by the processor and released to NYU no later than May 1 (not postmarked May 1), or the department deadline specified by your NYU school, if different. If you delay, a loss of aid could result. Remember, you must apply each year to renew your financial aid. May 1 is the priority deadline for most schools at NYU. Applying late could make you ineligible for certain types of aid, and funds become more limited. If you submitted a FAFSA last year and received an NYU scholarship, you should submit the FAFSA again each year by the NYU deadline to ensure normal processing.   TAP GRANT:   If you are a New York resident and received a state TAP grant, you must renew your grant award for next year to ensure credit for TAP on your Bursar bill. Click here for more information about the TAP application process.   CSS/FINANCIAL AID PROFILE:   The CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE is NOT REQUIRED for U.S. citizen and eligible non-citizen returning undergraduate students, transfer students, and graduate students at NYU New York campus, or adult students applying to The Paul McGhee Division at the NYU School of Continuing and Professional Studies, New York campus.     The CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE is REQUIRED every year for international students at NYU New York campus.     The CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE is REQUIRED every year for all students at NYU Abu Dhabi. (NOTE: it is not required for Emirati nationals, who will be automatically evaluated for Exceptional Emirati Scholarship upon acceptance.)     The CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE is REQUIRED every year for all students at NYU Shanghai. (NOTE: it is not required for Chinese nationals who complete the Gaokao college entrance examination instead of the SAT college admission test).                                                                                                                                                                        How do I get more financial aid?                                                       Review your FAFSA   Most student aid is based upon financial need, which is determined by the results of your FAFSA. The first step you should take is to ensure that the information you submitted on your FAFSA is correct. If your initial submission contained errors, you should correct your data on the FAFSA website at www.fafsa.gov . If your original data was correct when first submitted but your financial circumstances have changed since you filed the FAFSA, then, depending upon your situation, you may be eligible for review through a process called Professional Judgment. This process allows a financial aid administrator, under specific circumstances, to review your FAFSA eligibility based on new documentation, which will possibly change your eligibility for federal student aid. To determine if you are eligible, you should complete and submit the Professional Judgment Worksheet, available on our Applications and Forms menu . We will review your circumstances and notify you about opportunities for additional grants, federal loans, and alternative loans.   Change in Eligibility Increase   If you have enrolled for additional credit points and your tuition and/or fees have increased, if your housing status has changed (i.e. &quot;off campus&quot; vs. &quot;on campus&quot;), or if your grade level has changed, then your eligibility for federal loans (and possibly other types of student aid) may be reevaluated. Contact the Office of Financial Aid or send an e-mail message to explain your status change at NYU and to request that your aid be reviewed and/or your federal loan amount be increased if you are deemed eligible. If so, we will certify the additional amount(s) and send you a revised financial aid award notification. (Please note that annual and aggregate maximum borrowing limits apply to the Federal Stafford Loan .)   This change may also affect your eligibility for private student loans. Once you have maximized your federal loan eligibility then you may apply for additional private loan amounts to meet the cost of attendance. (See our information about Private Loans .) Once we have received approval from your lender, the Office of Financial Aid will certify the private loan and then notify you accordingly.   Individual Budget Appeal   If you find that your miscellaneous education-related expenses for the academic year (e.g. books and supplies, computer equipment, etc.) will exceed those projected in NYU's estimated budget for your total cost of attendance (see Tuition, Fees, and Expenses ), please submit the Budget Appeal form, also available on our Applications and Forms menu.   General Scholarship Increase Request   Returning undergraduate students who have submitted their FAFSA and wish to increase or add scholarship funding to their financial aid package may do so via the annual appeal process. During appeal season, our online Appeal Form for Returning Undergraduates is available on the Applications and Forms menu. Students must meet the specified appeal deadline and include an explanation of why they are seeking additional funding. Appeal results are typically based on financial need and academic performance. The amount of appeal funds available varies each year, and individual NYU schools work closely with the Office of Financial Aid throughout the process to make the appeal determination.   NYU graduate students should consult with the admissions/financial aid representative in their school or program department (see &quot;School Financial Aid Contacts&quot; on our alphabetical list of References and Resources .   Conclusion   Regardless of your status, we strongly encourage all students to explore the many private scholarships available.   You also may find NYU Payment Plans to be helpful. Although they are not a form of financial aid, NYU Payment Plans provide a good way to budget and plan your payments for each semester.                                                                                                                                                                        I will attend NYU in the summer. Is there any student aid available then?                                                       Usually yes. To be considered for ANY type of financial aid in the summer you must submit the NYU Summer Financial Aid Application, which is available on our Applications and Forms menu beginning in February. A Summer Financial Aid Application is also available for visiting non-NYU students.                                                                                                                                                                          I will enroll in a January Term course. Is financial aid available?                                                       NYU Undergraduate Students :   NYU New York undergraduates enrolling for January Term either in New York or at an NYU Study Away site will automatically be reviewed for additional scholarship eligibility. No application is needed. The review will be based upon financial need and the number of credits the student is enrolled for in January. The amount of scholarship awarded will be proportional to the amount of tuition the students' scholarship covered during an academic year semester. Students will be reviewed within a week after they register and will be notified via Albert accordingly. Students who do not have scholarship during the academic year are not eligible for January Term scholarship consideration.   Students needing additional financial aid for January Term will be able to seek out alternative loans, as additional federal loans are not available. Students seeking alternative loans are encouraged to relay to their potential lender the number of credits they will be taking, as some have minimum enrollment criteria. Private loan eligibility cannot exceed the cost of attendance for January term minus any other aid students may receive for the term. NYU cannot recommend or endorse any particular private lender. Students are encouraged to research their options carefully.   Students who change January Term enrollment or who do not attend in January will have their January award adjusted or cancelled.   NYU Graduate Students :   Generally, grants/scholarships are not available to NYU graduate students for the January Term, although graduate students should consult with their school's student services office or financial aid contact if they have questions.   Visiting non-NYU Students :   NYU grants/scholarships are not available to visiting non-NYU students for the January Term. However, visiting non-NYU students currently receiving federal financial aid at their home school may be able to apply a portion of it to their attendance at NYU by implementing a Consortium Agreement. Please consult with the financial aid office at your home school to determine if you can complete a Consortium Agreement for New York University.     In addition, visiting non-NYU students who are receiving institutional scholarship or grant funds from their home school while attending January Term at NYU must notify New York University.   Visiting non-NYU students will receive further information and instructions upon registration for January Term at NYU.   All students :   All students (NYU and visiting non-NYU) may apply for a private (non-federal) alternative loan for the January Term.                                                                                                                                                                        I have deferred my enrollment at NYU. How does this affect my financial aid?                                                         Go to Eligibility for Financial Aid: Deferred Enrollment                                                                                                                                                                            I will graduate at the end of the fall semester. Can I have aid awarded for the following spring semester applied to my fall account?                                                       No.   Most financial aid, such as Federal Direct Loans, Federal Direct PLUS Loans, TAP, Pell Grant, Perkins Loan, and NYU scholarship, is based on full academic year attendance, so if you are enrolled for one semester only, you will be awarded the appropriate portion for which you are eligible.                                                                                                                                                                        My grade level will advance in the spring. Will I be eligible for more financial aid once I become a Sophomore/Junior/Senior?                                                       You might be eligible for more Federal Subsidized or Federal Unsubsidized Loans. Once your grades have been posted on the Student Information System after the fall semester, if your grade level has increased from a Freshman level to a Sophomore level (32 points earned), or has changed from the Sophomore level to a Junior level (64 points earned) you may be eligible for more Federal Subsidized Loan or Federal Unsubsidized Loan. If you would like your eligibility for a loan increase to be reviewed, send an e-mail message to the Office of Financial Aid from your NYU email account with your specific request. If you are eligible, the loan amount will be increased and you will receive a notice to log on the Student Center and accept that amount. A new loan application is not required. Funds will be disbursed to your Bursar account in accordance with federal disbursement schedules. Also, please note that the increase could affect your loan eligibility for the upcoming summer if you plan to attend and receive federal loans in the summer.                                                                                                                                                                        I am an Undergraduate student considering an internal transfer to another NYU school in the spring. How will my financial aid be affected?                                                       In most cases the amount of financial aid you receive will not be affected. If your total credit points, your housing status, and your financial aid application information is the same as it was for the fall semester, the amount of financial aid you receive should remain the same.   PLEASE NOTE:     Departmental scholarships are not transferable to another school.   School of Continuing and Professional Studies (SCPS) students enrolled full-time in the General Studies Program, McGhee Division, the Hotel and Tourism Management Program, or the Recreation and Leisure Studies Program may transfer to another undergraduate school at NYU without affecting their financial aid.     If you are uncertain of your status, send an e-mail message to the Office of Financial Aid.                                                                                                                                                                        Who do I speak to about a question or problem with my bill?                                                       Billing transactions and associated student account issues are administered by the NYU Office of the Bursar .    See also NYU Albert to view your billing information record, including financial aid credits.    If some financial aid items are not listed on your bill, please make sure you do not have any \u2018holds\u2019 listed on your account and you are registered for the appropriate number of credits Financial Aid has anticipated for you. Also, please be sure you have accepted the item you wanted on Albert, completed all the necessary paperwork and allow 3-5 business days for this to reflect on your Bursar account.    Keep in mind that you will not receive an updated bill until your scheduled billing date . However, current changes and adjustments are visible on NYU Albert .    It is important to note that in some cases the student aid information initially shown on Albert may not exactly match the official Financial Aid Awards you subsequently receive.                                                                                                                                                                         How do I apply for a loan?                                                         Go to Direct Loan Instructions .                                                                                                                                                                          What are alternative loans, and why would I apply for such a loan?                                                         Go to Private (Non-Federal) Alternative Loans .                                                                                                                                                                          I received a Sub/Unsub loan/Perkins Loan/PLUS Loan that I do not want. Do I have to sign the Promissory Note(s) for these loans?                                                       If you were offered ANY aid you do not wish to use, please \u2018decline\u2019 the aid on NYU Albert. This will remove the item from your \u2018To Do\u2019 List.   If you have received loan promissory note, and you do not wish to use the loan, you DO NOT have to sign the promissory note. Please disregard the loans promissory notes.                                                                                                                                                                        My student application for a Federal Graduate PLUS Loan has been denied. What now?                                                         If you are not initially approved for a Federal Graduate PLUS Loan, you will receive an endorser packet directly from the U.S. Department of Education. This packet explains that a PLUS Loan may still be acquired if someone else with an acceptable credit rating -- such as your spouse, a relative, or friend -- agrees to endorse or cosign the loan. Contact the Office of Financial Aid for further instructions.   Please note that if you receive the Federal Direct PLUS Loan based on a credit-worthy endorser, the PLUS Master Promissory Note (MPN) that you have completed will expire with that endorsed loan. A new PLUS MPN will be required for any subsequent PLUS Loan for which you apply.   Graduate students who are originally credit denied for a Direct PLUS Loan, but have obtained approval by appeal or endorser, are required to complete a new PLUS Loan Counseling session. The federal Department of Education will contact the borrower in these cases and direct them to studentloans.gov to complete PLUS Loan Counseling. Your PLUS Loan cannot disburse to your Bursar bill until you have completed the PLUS Loan Counseling.   The U.S. Department of Education does not inform the NYU Office of Financial Aid about the specific reason for the denial of a Federal PLUS Loan. If you feel that there are extenuating circumstances and you wish to appeal the credit denial, you must contact the Direct Loan Origination Center toll-free at 1-800-557-7394.                                                                                                                                                                          How long do federal Direct PLUS Loan credit decisions remain valid?                                                       Credit approval is valid for 90 days. Your credit is evaluated by Direct Loans every time you request a new loan unless you have had a credit decision within the preceding 90 days.                                                                                                                                                                        How can I consolidate my student loans?                                                         Go to References and Resources for information about Loan Consolidation, Loan Deferment, Loan Forgiveness, and Loan Repayment.                                                                                                                                                                          My parents don't support me and won't contribute to my education, so why am I still considered a \"dependent\" student?                                                       It's a federal definition.   There are basic requirements a student must meet to be considered an independent student (see The Guide to Federal Student Aid for criteria). If you do not meet these requirements but you still believe you are truly independent of your parents, you may appeal for a \"dependency override\" with our office. The example below describes the conditions of an acceptable override, but if your situation is different please bring it to our attention for review.   INVOLUNTARY DISSOLUTION OF FAMILY   To demonstrate the \"involuntary dissolution\" of your family you must present:     A letter written by you which states that you do not and cannot have contact with your parents and also explains what precipitated the dissolution of the family.   A letter from a third party (someone not related to you) stating that you do not and cannot have contact with your parents. The letter must be written by someone:     who is professional (preferably your social worker or case worker, a member of the clergy, or a lawyer who has been represented you in legal proceedings), and;   who has personal, first-hand knowledge of your familial situation.     A copy of your completed FAFSA, which must be submitted as if you were an independent student.     If you can provide the appropriate documentation, a dependency override will be considered for you and your financial aid award may be changed based upon an independent status. (Note that just because a student is considered \"independent\" does not necessarily mean a student's aid will increase.)                                                                                                                                                                        What academic standards must I maintain at NYU to be eligible for financial aid?                                                         Go to Satisfactory Academic Progress .                                                                                                                                                                          Why hasn't financial aid been credited on my Bursar bill?                                                       If no student aid of any kind has been deducted from your bill, chances are you did not submit the required financial aid applications , or, if you did, you may have applied later than NYU's priority deadline (see sidebar above right), which may have affected your aid eligibility. If you have already applied and received your Student Aid Report (SAR) from the federal processors, in most cases you should have received a notice from us to view your financial aid award on NYU Albert. Verify on NYU Albert that your FAFSA data has been &quot;received&quot; by us (it will be listed in your &quot;To Do&quot; list as received if it is truly received by NYU).   If your FAFSA information was received by NYU more than 3 weeks ago and you have not received a financial aid award, you should first refer to NYU Albert to see if there are any &quot;holds&quot; on your account. A hold on your account may delay your financial aid awards. If there is a hold, please rectify that situation. The delay could be caused by circumstances concerning your aid eligibility. For example, you may not be meeting the satisfactory academic progress standards required to maintain student aid, or further documents may be required from you before we are able to process your award. If there are no holds, and if your award still seems delayed, then contact the Office of Financial Aid . Our counselors can discuss details with you and estimate when you can expect an award.                                                                                                                                                                        I haven't yet applied, but my bill is due soon. I know processing takes several weeks from start to finish. Is there any type of interim aid I can have while I wait?                                                       There is no interim aid. Students often ask if they can take out private, non-federal loans while they wait for their financial aid application to be processed and their federal loans to be disbursed. Students are discouraged from pursuing this because it also takes a few weeks to receive alternative loans, and if you take out alternative loans in advance of your federal loans, you may inadvertently take out too much private loan, which you would then have to return. This can be costly. Or, if you didn't want to return the private loan funds your federal aid eligibility could be adversely affected. The best strategy is to apply for financial aid as soon as possible, and, in the interim, work out a payment plan with the Bursar. If you're eligible for financial aid and you've already made a payment to the Bursar, you will be refunded the amount of overpayment.                                                                                                                                                                         When can I expect my loan refund?                                                       Loan refunds are administered through the NYU Office of the Bursar , and there are important elements to consider if you are anticipating a credit balance. For example, because your loans can not be released to NYU before your designated disbursement date, and because once they are disbursed certain basic enrollment criteria must first be verified (e.g. you normally must be enrolled for at least 6 points) before the loan amount is applied to your account balance, a refund resulting from your student loan will usually not be confirmed and processed until a few days after your disbursement date.                                                                                                                                                                        My financial aid award was based on anticipated credits and housing status, but my plans have changed. What do I do?                                                       Contact the Office of Financial Aid if any of the conditions of your initial award has changed. Depending on the changes, your aid may or may not be affected, but it is always better to inform the Office of Financial Aid of your plans so adjustments can be made, if necessary, early in the semester. If you fail to inform the Office of Financial Aid, then any discrepancies that exist between your anticipated and actual registered credit points will appear during enrollment audit and adjustments will be made at that time. It is the obligation of the Office of Financial Aid to adjust aid according to University policy and federal regulations.                                                                                                                                                                        Why has my citizenship status been requested? What are the citizenship requirements for federal aid?                                                       Students may be required to verify their U.S. citizenship status to confirm eligibility for some federal grant programs, and non-citizens are subject to different regulations which may require supporting documentation, depending upon the type of financial aid sought.       Go to Citizenship Documentation                                                                                                                                                                            Is it too late to apply for aid now that NYU's priority deadline has passed? Is there any aid I can get while I'm waiting for my federal aid eligibility?                                                       You are strongly encouraged to apply for financial aid even if you missed the NYU priority deadline (see Financial Aid Deadlines in the column above right). You may not qualify for the same amounts or types of funds if you did not apply on time. However, there are still alternatives available. For example, you will likely be eligible for some form of federal loan, and possibly federal grants and Federal Work-Study.                                                                                                                                                                         I have been asked to provide verification of my financial aid eligibility. What now?

NYU does not have an ROTC program on campus. However, NYU students can participate in ROTC through other schools in New York while attending NYU.

There is some financial aid credited on my bill this semester, but I was also expecting other credits. What happened to my TAP Grant?                                                       If you are a New York State resident, submitted a FAFSA, and applied for TAP using either TAP on the Web or a printed Express TAP Application (ETA), you should have received a TAP award certificate from the New York State Higher Education Services Corporation (HESC) . Contact HESC at 1-888-NYS-HESC (1-888-697-4372) if more than a few weeks have passed without notification after submitting the FAFSA.   HESC will also advise the NYU Office of the Bursar about your eligibility. If you have received your TAP award certificate but credit has not yet been applied to your bill, write a note on the bill and pay the appropriate remaining balance.

To be eligible for a Pell Grant you must be an undergraduate, have not earned a prior degree, and have an Estimated Family Contribution (as calculated by the government) of $5,273 or less. If you were eligible for Pell last year, you may not be eligible this year \u2014 it can vary depending upon your family and your resources. If you think you are Pell eligible and you subsequently received a request from NYU for documents to verify your FAFSA data, your Pell Grant may not be applied to your bill until the verification review is complete. Use NYU Albert to see if you have any outstanding document requests (please check the To Do list). Also, if you changed your Student Aid Report (SAR) to update any information the changes could have affected your Pell eligibility.                                                                                                                                                                        There is some financial aid credited on my bill this semester, but I was also expecting other credits. What happened to my scholarship?                                                       If you filed a FAFSA last year and received a scholarship, but didn't submit the FAFSA again this year, your scholarship amount could be affected. Most scholarships at NYU are based on a combination of need and merit. Review the letter that you received from our office when you were initially awarded. If you have not already submitted the FAFSA and you need to, do so right away. Depending on the availability of funding, late filers may not get their full scholarship.                                                                                                                                                                        There is some financial aid credited on my bill this semester, but I was also expecting other credits. What happened to my Perkins Loan?                                                       If the federal processors received your FAFSA later than the March 1 deadline (see sidebar above right), you may not have been offered a Perkins Loan. There is a limited amount of federal Perkins funding available to New York University and we must give priority to those who apply on time.    There are a few other reasons why your loan may not be on your bill. On Albert you need to accept your Perkins loan and wait 1 day. After 1 day has passed you must then e-sign your MPN, and print, sign, and mail your Perkins Rights and Responsibilities/Entrance Interview and you Truth-in-Lending in order to receive credit for this loan. Credit will be posted to your Bursar account 24 to 48 hours after you have completed all these steps and after we have received the printed documents.                                                                                                                                                                         There is some financial aid credited on my bill this semester, but I was also expecting other credits. What happened to my Federal Stafford Loan and/or Federal PLUS Loan?                                                       Be sure that you have completed the acceptance process for the Federal Stafford Loan and/or the Federal PLUS Loan to ensure the proper disbursement of funds. If a Stafford and/or PLUS Loan amount was suggested on your financial aid award letter, follow the instructions to secure your loan(s) and then deduct the pending loan amount from your bill (minus the origination fee) and pay the remainder.                                                                                                                                                                        There is some financial aid credited on my bill this semester, but I was also expecting other credits. What happened to my Private Loans?                                                       Your private loan must be approved by the lender and certified by NYU before you will be given credit for that loan. If it has been approved since the date of your bill, simply deduct the semester portion of the approved loan from your bill.                                                                                                                                                                        There is some financial aid credited on my bill this semester, but I was also expecting other credits. What happened to my Federal Work-Study?                                                       Federal Work-Study is not credited on your bill because it represents a potential amount yet to be earned in bi-weekly paychecks during the year. If suggested Work-Study is included in your financial aid package, it means you are eligible to participate in the Federal Work-Study Program .

Frequently Asked Questions                                                                                                                            I just accepted my Direct Loan(s), but now I want to change the amount. How can I make changes to my loan amounts?                                                       Once you have accepted your Direct Loan amounts on NYU Albert you cannot make further changes online. Please notify us to make adjustments to your awards:     Email to the Office of Financial Aid .

I have just been offered an increase or an additional Federal Direct Loan on my award letter. Do I have to complete all of the steps again?                                                       Each loan type (undergraduate/graduate Federal Direct Loan, Federal Direct Parent PLUS Loan and Graduate PLUS Loan) requires its own Master Promissory Note, or MPN, and Entrance Counseling (except Parent PLUS). So, if your increase is to an existing loan type you do NOT need to complete the MPN and Entrance Counseling again. However, you will still need to accept your increase on NYU Albert . If your increase or additional loan is a loan type you were not previously awarded, you WILL need to complete the MPN and Entrance Counseling (except Parent PLUS) in addition to accepting it on NYU Albert .                                                                                                                                                                        How/when do my Direct Loans get posted to my tuition account?                                                       Once you accept your loans on NYU Albert ,  sign your MPN, and complete Entrance Counseling, credit is then posted  to your account. The credit is provisional and does not change to real  credit until 10 days before the start of the loan period.                                                                                                                                                                        What if I want to return some loan funds after I have received a disbursement from Direct Loans?                                                       Within 120 Days of Disbursement:   You have the right to  cancel all or part of any disbursement of a Federal Direct Loan without  being charged interest and other loan fees as long as the cancellation  is processed within 120 days of the original disbursement date. The  disbursement date is the date the funds were applied to your NYU Bursar  bill during any given semester.   To request a cancellation, you must make your request through the NYU Bursar\u2019s Office by completing a Request to Return Loan Funds Form and submitting it to the Bursar as instructed on the form.   More Than 120 Days After Disbursement:   If  you wish to cancel all or part of any disbursement of your loan more  than 120 days after it was disbursed, you are actually repaying part of  your loan and you must pay any accrued interest and/or fees. You cannot  cancel your loan, but you can make a payment directly to your federal  loan servicer. Borrowers are assigned to one of the five servicers,  which include ACS, Great Lakes, NelNet, PHEAA, and Sallie Mae. If you  are not sure which of the five centers is your assigned servicer, visit  and log into the federal government\u2019s National Student Loan Data System to determine your servicer. You may also call 1-800-4-FED-AID to locate your servicer.                                                                                                                                                                        When can I expect my Direct Loan refund?                                                       Loan refunds are administered through the Office of the Bursar ,  and there are important elements to consider if you are anticipating a  credit balance. For example, because your loans can not be released to  NYU before your designated disbursement date, and because once they are  disbursed certain basic enrollment criteria must first be verified (e.g.  you normally must be enrolled for at least 6 points) before the loan  amount is applied to your account balance, a refund resulting from your  student loan will usually not be confirmed and processed until a few  days after your disbursement date.   IMPORTANT for Summer students :   Please note that if you are eligible for loans in the summer, those  loans do not disburse until July 1, and for those eligible for a refund,  you should not rely on those funds until at least one week after  disbursement.                                                                                                                                                                        How can I reduce my federal loans?                                                       If you have completed the acceptance process for a Federal Direct Loan and/or a Federal Direct PLUS Loan but no longer want to borrow the full amount, contact the Office of Financial Aid as soon as possible to authorize a reduction.   Once you have accepted your Direct Loan amounts on NYU Albert you cannot make further changes online. Please notify us to make adjustments to your awards:     Email to the Office of Financial Aid .

My parent's application for a Federal PLUS Loan has been denied. What now?                                                         If the parent borrower is not initially approved for a Federal PLUS Loan, they will receive an endorser packet directly from the U.S. Department of Education. This packet explains that a PLUS Loan may still be acquired if someone else with an acceptable credit rating -- such as the parent applicant's spouse, a relative, or friend -- agrees to endorse or cosign the loan. Contact Direct Loans Applicant Services at 1-800-557-7394 for additional instructions for endorsers.   Parents also have the option to appeal the Department of Education\u2019s PLUS denial. For instructions on how to appeal, please contact the Department of Education\u2019s Applicant Services at 1-800-557-7394.   Please note that if the parent borrower receives the Federal PLUS Loan based on a credit-worthy endorser, the PLUS Master Promissory Note (MPN) that the parent completed will expire with that endorsed loan. A new PLUS MPN will be required for any subsequent PLUS Loan for which the parent applies.   Parent borrowers who are originally credit denied for a Direct PLUS Loan, but have obtained approval by appeal or endorser, are required to complete a new PLUS Loan Counseling session. The federal Department of Education will contact the borrower in these cases and direct them to studentloans.gov to complete PLUS Loan Counseling. Your PLUS Loan cannot disburse to your Bursar bill until you have completed the PLUS Loan Counseling.   The U.S. Department of Education does not inform the NYU Office of Financial Aid about the specific reason for the denial of a Federal PLUS Loan. To appeal for reconsideration, contact the Direct Loan Origination Center toll-free at 1-800-557-7394.   In the event a denial is final, the student may contact the Office of Financial Aid to request consideration for an additional Federal Direct Unsubsidized Loan. Freshman and Sophomores may be eligible for a maximum of $4,000 in additional funds, and Juniors and Seniors may be eligible for a maximum of $5,000 in additional funds. Please note: if at a later time during the academic year a parent becomes eligible or is approved with a co-signor for a Parent PLUS loan, the additional Unsubsidized Loan will be canceled.                                                                                                                                                                          I completed my Subsidized/Unsubsidized Master Promissory Note (MPN) on www.studentloans.gov. Why is it still requested on my Albert To Do list?                                                       Usually, this occurs when the subsidized and/or unsubsidized loans have not yet originated. Origination means that your loan data is being sent to the Department of Education for processing. The checklist item for the MPN will not update to a received status until the loan(s) successfully originate.                                                                                                                                                                          I am a transfer student and I completed my Subsidized/Unsubsidized MPN for my previous school. Do I have to do a new one for NYU?                                                       No, your completed Subsidized/Unsubsidized MPN can be used for your loans at NYU, provide they are still valid and in an active status.                                                                                                                                                                          I am a transfer student and I completed my Undergraduate Entrance Counseling for my previous school. Do I have to do a new one for NYU?                                                       No, your completed Undergraduate Entrance Counseling session can be used for your loans at NYU. However, you must contact NYU\u2019s Office of Financial Aid to let us know. Otherwise, we would not know that you ever completed one in the past and your Entrance Counseling checklist item on your Albert To Do list would stay in a requested status. Once we confirm that a counseling session was completed previously we will update your NYU records.                                                                                                                                                                          How does my parent borrower apply for a Federal Direct Parent PLUS Loan?                                                       You, the student, must start the process by accepting the offered Federal Direct Parent PLUS Loan on your Albert account. You can do so by logging in to Albert and then clicking on the Accept/Decline Financial Aid link and following the instructions.   Your parent borrower will be asked to complete the Federal Direct PLUS Loan Request and Master Promissory Note by visiting the Direct Loan Web site at www.studentloans.gov . They must sign in using the same PIN number that was assigned to them to access your FAFSA. If they do not remember their PIN, they may request a duplicate from the Official PIN site .   The U.S. Department of Education will conduct a credit check that is valid for only 90 days. Your parent borrower should not apply more than 90 days before the start of fall semester to avoid credit expiration.   Shortly after the PLUS Loan originates to the Department of Education, an email from the NYU Office of Financial Aid will be sent to the parent borrower (only if the PLUS Loan was credit approved). The approved parent must complete the PLUS Loan process by logging in to the NYU Student System as instructed in this email and by providing the dollar amount of the Parent PLUS Loan that is desired and the parent must actively accept the PLUS Loan on the same page.                                                                                                                                                                          Who completes the Master Promissory Note for my parent borrower\u2019s endorsed (co-signed) Parent PLUS Loan -- my parent or the endorser?                                                       Even if your parent borrower has had to obtain an endorser for their Federal Direct PLUS Loan, they are still the borrower on the loan. Therefore, the parent borrower must complete the MPN.                                                                                                                                                                          My parent borrower was approved for a Parent PLUS Loan by completing the PLUS Loan Request on www.studentloans.gov. Why did they receive an email from the Office of Financial Aid asking them to complete a PLUS Loan confirmation process?                                                       Federal regulations require a parent borrower to actively accept each Parent PLUS Loan and indicate the final amount they wish to accept for each loan. The email with instructions on completing the final PLUS Loan confirmation is sent to the parent borrower after the loan has been originated and we are in receipt of the approved credit decision. This is your parent borrower\u2019s opportunity to accept the loan for the amount that was originated or reduce the amount if they do not need the entire loan.   For subsequent PLUS Loans in your undergraduate career, your parent borrower may not be required to complete a new PLUS Loan Request on www.studentloans.gov , but they will be required to complete the final PLUS Loan confirmation process through our site.                                                                                                                                                                          Does my parent borrower have to complete a new Federal Direct PLUS Loan Master Promissory Note if . . .                                                       . . . they already did one for a previous school?   No, if your parent borrower has already completed a PLUS Loan MPN for any school (without an endorser) they do not have to complete a new one.   . . . they already did one for my PLUS loan from last year?   No, if your parent borrower was credit approved on their own for a Federal Direct PLUS Loan in a previous semester or year they do not have to complete a new one.   . . . their previous PLUS Loan was approved with an endorser (co-signer)?   Yes, if their previous PLUS Loan required an endorser for credit approval they must complete a new Master Promissory Note for the next PLUS Loan. This is because each endorsed (co-signed) Parent PLUS Loan must have its own MPN \u2013 the MPN for an endorsed loan cannot be used for any subsequent loan.                                                                                                                                                                          My parent borrower received a refund from the Parent PLUS Loan. Can they return the refund check if they do not need the funds?                                                       Yes. Parent borrowers have the right to cancel all or part of any disbursement of a federal Parent PLUS Loan without being charged interest and other loan fees as long as the cancellation is processed within 120 days of the original disbursement date. The disbursement date is the date the funds were applied to your NYU Bursar bill during any given semester.   To request a cancellation, they must make the request through the NYU Bursar\u2019s Office by completing a Request to Return Loan Funds Form and submitting it to the Bursar as instructed on the form.   If they wish to cancel all or part of any disbursement of their loan more than 120 days after it was disbursed, they are actually repaying part of their loan and they must pay any accrued interest and/or fees. They cannot cancel their loan, but they can make a payment directly to your federal loan servicer. Borrowers are assigned to one of the five servicers, which include ACS, Great Lakes, NelNet, PHEAA, and Sallie Mae. If they are not sure which of the five centers is their assigned servicer, visit and log into the federal government\u2019s National Student Loan Data System to determine their servicer. They may also call 1-800-4-FED-AID to locate your servicer.                                                                                                                                                                          I received a refund from my Subsidized/Unsubsidized loan. Can I return the refund check if I do not need the funds?                                                       Yes -- please see the FAQ above regarding parent borrowers returning refunds from a Parent PLUS Loan. The same rules apply to your Subsidized/Unsubsidized loan.

The only items highlighted on this form are those that students commonly have questions on or are confused about. Please review each item carefully to ensure your I-765 is filled out correctly. Each item discussed is highlighted in the image as to where it appears on the actual form I-765. We recommend you fill out the pdf online and then print the form to sign it once completed. Be sure to sign the form in blue ink.              I am applying for:   Check the box \u201cPermission to accept employment.\u201d If you lost your EAD and are applying for a new card, select the second box. If you are applying to continue your current OPT, select the third box.                                     Item 1:   Enter your family name first and be sure to spell it in all capital letters. Enter your first name second. Your first name should not be entered in all capital letters. Include your middle name if you have one.                                     Item 3:   Enter your street address. This must be a U.S. address and it should be valid three months into the future. If you believe you will change addresses within the next three months you are advised to instead list the address of a trusted friend or family member. If you choose to enter your friend\u2019s or family member\u2019s address, you must also include a \u201ccare of\u201d name. This is indicated by writing \u201cc/o\u201d and then the name of your friend/family member before the street address.                                     Item 10:   Enter your I-94 number. This number is 11 digits long and can be found on your I-94 card, which should be stapled into your passport.                                                            Item 11:   Select \u201cYes\u201d if you have previously applied for OPT, or ever submitted the I-765 for work authorization to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. Select \u201cNo\u201d if you have only ever worked on campus or been authorized for CPT, or if you have not previously worked.   If you selected \u201cyes\u201d, enter the USCIS office that handled your previous employment authorization application. For most of you this will be the Vermont Service Center (receipt number would start with EAC).   Enter the date(s) you were approved/denied for employment authorization.                                     Item 12:   Enter the last date you entered the U.S. For most of you this should be the date stamped on your I-94 card.                                     Item 13:   Enter the place you entered the U.S. This should be indicated by the three digit code stamped on your I-94 card. For example, if you entered JFK, the stamp on your I-94 card should indicate \u201cNYC\u201d. If you entered through Newark, the stamp on your I-94 card should indicate \u201cNEW\u201d.                                     Item 15:   Your current status should be F-1 Student.

Your NetID password is not the same as your NYU Google Apps password; see About Your NYU Password(s) below for details.       You are required to reset your NetID NYU password at least once each year; NYU Google Apps passwords do not currently have an annual reset policy.       For security reasons, you can not reuse passwords that you've used before.                                  related pages            Tips for Choosing a Strong Password       NetID &amp; Password FAQs       About NYUHome       NYU Email                        About Your NYU NetID   Activate Your NYU NetID   About Your NetID Password   How to Set or Change Your NetID Password   About Your Google Apps Password   How to Set or Change Your Google Apps Password   Services Affected by Password Changes   Forgotten Password   Troubleshooting Tips         About Your NYU NetID   All NYU faculty and staff members, as well as students enrolled in degree or diploma programs, are  provided with an NYU NetID ( Net work ID entification). Your NetID is a combination of your initials  and a few random numbers, e.g., aqe123, and is usually printed on the back of your NYUCard. It is  different from your University ID, which is also printed on your NYUCard, but is a longer string of numbers  and starts with an \"N\". Once activated (see below), your NetID is your key to many NYU online resources,  including, for eligible community members, NYUHome .  Your NetID is also used to create your default NYU email address (e.g., aqe123@nyu.edu).      Activate Your NYU NetID   You can activate your NetID at any time, from any Internet-connected computer, using the NYU Start  Page ( start.nyu.edu ).  If you know your NetID (it is usually printed on the back of your NYU ID Card), enter it in the appropriate  field and click START! ; if not, follow the instructions at the top of the page. Then, complete the  steps for setting up a NetID password (visit the Security pages for password tips ,  and see below for an explanation of the difference between your NetID password and your Google Apps password).  If you encounter any problems, contact the IT Service Desk .      About Your NetID Password   Your NetID password is used to log into NYUHome, NYURoam Wireless, and many other NYU services. This password must be changed annually  (or more often, if you wish).    Note that you may need to set a separate NYU Google Apps password if you access  NYU Email with a desktop email program like Outlook or Thunderbird or access NYU Google Apps for Education using a mobile device like an iPad, iPhone  or Android. See below for a table that outlines the different services the two passwords allow you to access .      My NetID password is about to expire--what should I do?   For security reasons, NYU requires that you change your NetID password at least once  each year (no exceptions). You will receive email notifications from ITS when your NetID password  is about to expire; if you do not change your password in time, you will not lose any data stored on NYU systems, but you will  not be able to access that data or any NetID password-protected  services until you follow the instructions below to change your password.    You may need to update saved password information in your browsers or mobile  devices (e.g., iPad, iPhone, Android, Blackberry) once you've updated your password; see the   table below for a summary of affected services.      How to Set or Change Your NetID Password   For instructions on how to change your NetID password, please see Setting and changing your NetID password .      About Your Google Apps Password   If you wish to use a method other than the web interface (e.g., email.nyu.edu )  to access NYU Google Apps for Education&mdash;such as a desktop email program like Outlook or Thunderbird or certain email or calendar apps  on mobile devices like an iPhone, iPad, or other PDA&mdash;you must set a separate Google password.    If you use the web interfaces (e.g., email.nyu.edu ) or   NYUHome to access NYU Google Apps for Education, you can use your NetID and NetID password to log in,  and do not need to set a Google Apps password.        How to Set or Change Your Google Apps Password   For instructions on how to change your Google Apps password, please see Setting and changing your Google Apps password .      Services Affected by Password Changes   As described above, there are two passwords that are associated with the various services offered by ITS:  the NetID password and the Google Apps password. When you change your NetID password, this does not  change your Google Apps password, and vice versa.      NOTE: Mobile Device or Email Program Updates   When you change a password, you may need to update saved password information in your mobile device (e.g., iPhone,  iPad, Android, Blackberry), web browser, or desktop email program (e.g., Outlook or Thunderbird). Search the ServiceLink knowledge base for   setup instructions .      This table offers a summary of the services that are affected by each password:     Service NetID Password   Google Apps Password     NYU Email   Yes    Yes, if you use a desktop email program or mobile device app (e.g., certain apps on iPhone, iPad, Android, Blackberry, etc.) to access your NYU Email       NYU Calendar   Yes    Yes, if you use a mobile device app (e.g., certain apps on iPhone, iPad, Android, Blackberry, etc.) to access your NYU Calendar       Other Google Apps for Education (Documents, Sites, Groups)   Yes    Yes, if you use a mobile device app to access them        NYUHome   Yes    No        NYURoam wireless   Yes    No        VPN    Yes    No        Access to i4 and i5 accounts   Yes    No        NYU-NET Proxy   Yes    No       NYU-NET Computer Registration System   Yes   No        ResNet/Ethernet connections   No    No       Desktop computer administrator passwords  Yes, if the computer is registered with Active Directory; if the computer is not on Active Directory, it will not be affected by a NetID password change    No            Forgotten Password   If you forget your password, visit the NYU Start page  ( start.nyu.edu ),  enter your NetID, and click the START! button. On the next screen,  click the Forgot Your Password? link at the right then follow the instructions.  Contact the IT Service Desk if you encounter any issues.       Troubleshooting Tips     If you try to log in to an NYU website with your NetID and NetID password and receive  an error message telling your that your ID or password is incorrect, try logging  in again, making sure that you have typed your NetID and password correctly.  All NYU NetIDs are in lower case. Check to make sure Caps Lock isn't on by accident,  and you're using the NetID that is usually printed on the back of your NYUCard.   If you try again and you still can't log in, follow the forgotten password instructions  above.   If this still doesn't work, please contact the IT Service Desk for further instructions.

Where is my award?                                                       NYU students who apply for financial aid in accordance with our priority deadlines are evaluated for financial aid and notified about the specific types and amounts of aid offered.   Students will be awarded their financial aid online via NYU Albert . An email with the appropriate link will be sent to you once your financial aid award package is available. Information about how to secure your aid will be provided in your financial aid award package and on your &quot;To Do&quot; list on Self-Service. All communication regarding your financial aid will be available to you via &quot;self service&quot; on NYU Albert .   Award schedule:     New Freshmen: Early April   Returning Undergraduates: Beginning mid June   New Graduates: varies by school; generally April/May   Returning Graduates: mid July     Students should also review important information to ensure the proper disbursement of their financial aid awards .                                                                                                                                                                            How do I apply for financial aid?                                                       All students are encouraged to apply every year for financial assistance. NYU requires the CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE application (to be considered for institutional [non-government] financial aid), the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) (for new freshmen and continuing students, to be considered for federal financial aid), and, for residents of New York State, the New York State Tuition Assistance Program (TAP) application.

(And what is \"Work-Study\"?)                                                          Go to Student Employment                                                                                                                                                                            I have financial aid now, but what about next year? Is it necessary to apply again?                                                       Yes, you must apply every year by submitting the FAFSA to determine and renew your financial aid (including NYU scholarships).   Each year the U.S. Department of Education will send to you a renewal reminder containing important information about your Federal Student Aid PIN and the FAFSA application process. (If you included a valid e-mail address on your FAFSA last year, you will receive the reminder by e-mail. Otherwise it will be mailed to your permanent address.) You will need your Federal Student Aid PIN to access your pre-filled FAFSA on the Web application that contains much of your application data from last year.   Visit the PIN web site at www.pin.ed.gov to verify your existing PIN, to request a duplicate if you have forgotten your PIN, or to request a new PIN if you (and your parents, if applicable) don't have one. (You use the same PIN each year, so you probably have one already).   It is possible to submit the FAFSA online without a PIN, but you must provide answers to all questions on a new FAFSA and you must print, sign, and mail the signature page after you submit the application, which will slow the process.   After January 1 but not later than May 1, access your FAFSA on the FAFSA website and revise the information to reflect your income for the preceding year (and other information only if it has changed), then submit the application. Be sure that you specify NYU (federal school code 002785) as the recipient of your information.   You should receive your Student Aid Report (SAR) within a few weeks after submitting the FAFSA. Call 1-800-4-FED-AID (1-800-433-3243) if you don't receive it. You may also view your SAR on the FAFSA website and make changes if necessary.   If you apply correctly and on time you can expect your NYU financial aid award notification by mid June (for returning undergraduates), describing your aid package for the next academic year.   Remember that the FAFSA and all necessary signatures must be received and validated by the processor and released to NYU no later than May 1 (not postmarked May 1), or the department deadline specified by your NYU school, if different. If you delay, a loss of aid could result. Remember, you must apply each year to renew your financial aid. May 1 is the priority deadline for most schools at NYU. Applying late could make you ineligible for certain types of aid, and funds become more limited. If you submitted a FAFSA last year and received an NYU scholarship, you should submit the FAFSA again each year by the NYU deadline to ensure normal processing.   TAP GRANT:   If you are a New York resident and received a state TAP grant, you must renew your grant award for next year to ensure credit for TAP on your Bursar bill. Click here for more information about the TAP application process.   CSS/FINANCIAL AID PROFILE:   The CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE is NOT REQUIRED for U.S. citizen and eligible non-citizen returning undergraduate students, transfer students, and graduate students at NYU New York campus, or adult students applying to The Paul McGhee Division at the NYU School of Continuing and Professional Studies, New York campus.     The CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE is REQUIRED every year for international students at NYU New York campus.     The CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE is REQUIRED every year for all students at NYU Abu Dhabi. (NOTE: it is not required for Emirati nationals, who will be automatically evaluated for Exceptional Emirati Scholarship upon acceptance.)     The CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE is REQUIRED every year for all students at NYU Shanghai. (NOTE: it is not required for Chinese nationals who complete the Gaokao college entrance examination instead of the SAT college admission test).                                                                                                                                                                        How do I get more financial aid?                                                       Review your FAFSA   Most student aid is based upon financial need, which is determined by the results of your FAFSA. The first step you should take is to ensure that the information you submitted on your FAFSA is correct. If your initial submission contained errors, you should correct your data on the FAFSA website at www.fafsa.gov . If your original data was correct when first submitted but your financial circumstances have changed since you filed the FAFSA, then, depending upon your situation, you may be eligible for review through a process called Professional Judgment. This process allows a financial aid administrator, under specific circumstances, to review your FAFSA eligibility based on new documentation, which will possibly change your eligibility for federal student aid. To determine if you are eligible, you should complete and submit the Professional Judgment Worksheet, available on our Applications and Forms menu . We will review your circumstances and notify you about opportunities for additional grants, federal loans, and alternative loans.   Change in Eligibility Increase   If you have enrolled for additional credit points and your tuition and/or fees have increased, if your housing status has changed (i.e. &quot;off campus&quot; vs. &quot;on campus&quot;), or if your grade level has changed, then your eligibility for federal loans (and possibly other types of student aid) may be reevaluated. Contact the Office of Financial Aid or send an e-mail message to explain your status change at NYU and to request that your aid be reviewed and/or your federal loan amount be increased if you are deemed eligible. If so, we will certify the additional amount(s) and send you a revised financial aid award notification. (Please note that annual and aggregate maximum borrowing limits apply to the Federal Stafford Loan .)   This change may also affect your eligibility for private student loans. Once you have maximized your federal loan eligibility then you may apply for additional private loan amounts to meet the cost of attendance. (See our information about Private Loans .) Once we have received approval from your lender, the Office of Financial Aid will certify the private loan and then notify you accordingly.   Individual Budget Appeal   If you find that your miscellaneous education-related expenses for the academic year (e.g. books and supplies, computer equipment, etc.) will exceed those projected in NYU's estimated budget for your total cost of attendance (see Tuition, Fees, and Expenses ), please submit the Budget Appeal form, also available on our Applications and Forms menu.   General Scholarship Increase Request   Returning undergraduate students who have submitted their FAFSA and wish to increase or add scholarship funding to their financial aid package may do so via the annual appeal process. During appeal season, our online Appeal Form for Returning Undergraduates is available on the Applications and Forms menu. Students must meet the specified appeal deadline and include an explanation of why they are seeking additional funding. Appeal results are typically based on financial need and academic performance. The amount of appeal funds available varies each year, and individual NYU schools work closely with the Office of Financial Aid throughout the process to make the appeal determination.   NYU graduate students should consult with the admissions/financial aid representative in their school or program department (see &quot;School Financial Aid Contacts&quot; on our alphabetical list of References and Resources .   Conclusion   Regardless of your status, we strongly encourage all students to explore the many private scholarships available.   You also may find NYU Payment Plans to be helpful. Although they are not a form of financial aid, NYU Payment Plans provide a good way to budget and plan your payments for each semester.                                                                                                                                                                        I will attend NYU in the summer. Is there any student aid available then?                                                       Usually yes. To be considered for ANY type of financial aid in the summer you must submit the NYU Summer Financial Aid Application, which is available on our Applications and Forms menu beginning in February. A Summer Financial Aid Application is also available for visiting non-NYU students.                                                                                                                                                                          I will enroll in a January Term course. Is financial aid available?                                                       NYU Undergraduate Students :   NYU New York undergraduates enrolling for January Term either in New York or at an NYU Study Away site will automatically be reviewed for additional scholarship eligibility. No application is needed. The review will be based upon financial need and the number of credits the student is enrolled for in January. The amount of scholarship awarded will be proportional to the amount of tuition the students' scholarship covered during an academic year semester. Students will be reviewed within a week after they register and will be notified via Albert accordingly. Students who do not have scholarship during the academic year are not eligible for January Term scholarship consideration.   Students needing additional financial aid for January Term will be able to seek out alternative loans, as additional federal loans are not available. Students seeking alternative loans are encouraged to relay to their potential lender the number of credits they will be taking, as some have minimum enrollment criteria. Private loan eligibility cannot exceed the cost of attendance for January term minus any other aid students may receive for the term. NYU cannot recommend or endorse any particular private lender. Students are encouraged to research their options carefully.   Students who change January Term enrollment or who do not attend in January will have their January award adjusted or cancelled.   NYU Graduate Students :   Generally, grants/scholarships are not available to NYU graduate students for the January Term, although graduate students should consult with their school's student services office or financial aid contact if they have questions.   Visiting non-NYU Students :   NYU grants/scholarships are not available to visiting non-NYU students for the January Term. However, visiting non-NYU students currently receiving federal financial aid at their home school may be able to apply a portion of it to their attendance at NYU by implementing a Consortium Agreement. Please consult with the financial aid office at your home school to determine if you can complete a Consortium Agreement for New York University.     In addition, visiting non-NYU students who are receiving institutional scholarship or grant funds from their home school while attending January Term at NYU must notify New York University.   Visiting non-NYU students will receive further information and instructions upon registration for January Term at NYU.   All students :   All students (NYU and visiting non-NYU) may apply for a private (non-federal) alternative loan for the January Term.                                                                                                                                                                        I have deferred my enrollment at NYU. How does this affect my financial aid?                                                         Go to Eligibility for Financial Aid: Deferred Enrollment                                                                                                                                                                            I will graduate at the end of the fall semester. Can I have aid awarded for the following spring semester applied to my fall account?                                                       No.   Most financial aid, such as Federal Direct Loans, Federal Direct PLUS Loans, TAP, Pell Grant, Perkins Loan, and NYU scholarship, is based on full academic year attendance, so if you are enrolled for one semester only, you will be awarded the appropriate portion for which you are eligible.                                                                                                                                                                        My grade level will advance in the spring. Will I be eligible for more financial aid once I become a Sophomore/Junior/Senior?                                                       You might be eligible for more Federal Subsidized or Federal Unsubsidized Loans. Once your grades have been posted on the Student Information System after the fall semester, if your grade level has increased from a Freshman level to a Sophomore level (32 points earned), or has changed from the Sophomore level to a Junior level (64 points earned) you may be eligible for more Federal Subsidized Loan or Federal Unsubsidized Loan. If you would like your eligibility for a loan increase to be reviewed, send an e-mail message to the Office of Financial Aid from your NYU email account with your specific request. If you are eligible, the loan amount will be increased and you will receive a notice to log on the Student Center and accept that amount. A new loan application is not required. Funds will be disbursed to your Bursar account in accordance with federal disbursement schedules. Also, please note that the increase could affect your loan eligibility for the upcoming summer if you plan to attend and receive federal loans in the summer.                                                                                                                                                                        I am an Undergraduate student considering an internal transfer to another NYU school in the spring. How will my financial aid be affected?                                                       In most cases the amount of financial aid you receive will not be affected. If your total credit points, your housing status, and your financial aid application information is the same as it was for the fall semester, the amount of financial aid you receive should remain the same.   PLEASE NOTE:     Departmental scholarships are not transferable to another school.   School of Continuing and Professional Studies (SCPS) students enrolled full-time in the General Studies Program, McGhee Division, the Hotel and Tourism Management Program, or the Recreation and Leisure Studies Program may transfer to another undergraduate school at NYU without affecting their financial aid.     If you are uncertain of your status, send an e-mail message to the Office of Financial Aid.                                                                                                                                                                        Who do I speak to about a question or problem with my bill?                                                       Billing transactions and associated student account issues are administered by the NYU Office of the Bursar .    See also NYU Albert to view your billing information record, including financial aid credits.    If some financial aid items are not listed on your bill, please make sure you do not have any \u2018holds\u2019 listed on your account and you are registered for the appropriate number of credits Financial Aid has anticipated for you. Also, please be sure you have accepted the item you wanted on Albert, completed all the necessary paperwork and allow 3-5 business days for this to reflect on your Bursar account.    Keep in mind that you will not receive an updated bill until your scheduled billing date . However, current changes and adjustments are visible on NYU Albert .    It is important to note that in some cases the student aid information initially shown on Albert may not exactly match the official Financial Aid Awards you subsequently receive.                                                                                                                                                                         How do I apply for a loan?                                                         Go to Direct Loan Instructions .                                                                                                                                                                          What are alternative loans, and why would I apply for such a loan?                                                         Go to Private (Non-Federal) Alternative Loans .                                                                                                                                                                          I received a Sub/Unsub loan/Perkins Loan/PLUS Loan that I do not want. Do I have to sign the Promissory Note(s) for these loans?                                                       If you were offered ANY aid you do not wish to use, please \u2018decline\u2019 the aid on NYU Albert. This will remove the item from your \u2018To Do\u2019 List.   If you have received loan promissory note, and you do not wish to use the loan, you DO NOT have to sign the promissory note. Please disregard the loans promissory notes.                                                                                                                                                                        My student application for a Federal Graduate PLUS Loan has been denied. What now?                                                         If you are not initially approved for a Federal Graduate PLUS Loan, you will receive an endorser packet directly from the U.S. Department of Education. This packet explains that a PLUS Loan may still be acquired if someone else with an acceptable credit rating -- such as your spouse, a relative, or friend -- agrees to endorse or cosign the loan. Contact the Office of Financial Aid for further instructions.   Please note that if you receive the Federal Direct PLUS Loan based on a credit-worthy endorser, the PLUS Master Promissory Note (MPN) that you have completed will expire with that endorsed loan. A new PLUS MPN will be required for any subsequent PLUS Loan for which you apply.   Graduate students who are originally credit denied for a Direct PLUS Loan, but have obtained approval by appeal or endorser, are required to complete a new PLUS Loan Counseling session. The federal Department of Education will contact the borrower in these cases and direct them to studentloans.gov to complete PLUS Loan Counseling. Your PLUS Loan cannot disburse to your Bursar bill until you have completed the PLUS Loan Counseling.   The U.S. Department of Education does not inform the NYU Office of Financial Aid about the specific reason for the denial of a Federal PLUS Loan. If you feel that there are extenuating circumstances and you wish to appeal the credit denial, you must contact the Direct Loan Origination Center toll-free at 1-800-557-7394.                                                                                                                                                                          How long do federal Direct PLUS Loan credit decisions remain valid?                                                       Credit approval is valid for 90 days. Your credit is evaluated by Direct Loans every time you request a new loan unless you have had a credit decision within the preceding 90 days.                                                                                                                                                                        How can I consolidate my student loans?                                                         Go to References and Resources for information about Loan Consolidation, Loan Deferment, Loan Forgiveness, and Loan Repayment.                                                                                                                                                                          My parents don't support me and won't contribute to my education, so why am I still considered a \"dependent\" student?                                                       It's a federal definition.   There are basic requirements a student must meet to be considered an independent student (see The Guide to Federal Student Aid for criteria). If you do not meet these requirements but you still believe you are truly independent of your parents, you may appeal for a \"dependency override\" with our office. The example below describes the conditions of an acceptable override, but if your situation is different please bring it to our attention for review.   INVOLUNTARY DISSOLUTION OF FAMILY   To demonstrate the \"involuntary dissolution\" of your family you must present:     A letter written by you which states that you do not and cannot have contact with your parents and also explains what precipitated the dissolution of the family.   A letter from a third party (someone not related to you) stating that you do not and cannot have contact with your parents. The letter must be written by someone:     who is professional (preferably your social worker or case worker, a member of the clergy, or a lawyer who has been represented you in legal proceedings), and;   who has personal, first-hand knowledge of your familial situation.     A copy of your completed FAFSA, which must be submitted as if you were an independent student.     If you can provide the appropriate documentation, a dependency override will be considered for you and your financial aid award may be changed based upon an independent status. (Note that just because a student is considered \"independent\" does not necessarily mean a student's aid will increase.)                                                                                                                                                                        What academic standards must I maintain at NYU to be eligible for financial aid?                                                         Go to Satisfactory Academic Progress .                                                                                                                                                                          Why hasn't financial aid been credited on my Bursar bill?                                                       If no student aid of any kind has been deducted from your bill, chances are you did not submit the required financial aid applications , or, if you did, you may have applied later than NYU's priority deadline (see sidebar above right), which may have affected your aid eligibility. If you have already applied and received your Student Aid Report (SAR) from the federal processors, in most cases you should have received a notice from us to view your financial aid award on NYU Albert. Verify on NYU Albert that your FAFSA data has been &quot;received&quot; by us (it will be listed in your &quot;To Do&quot; list as received if it is truly received by NYU).   If your FAFSA information was received by NYU more than 3 weeks ago and you have not received a financial aid award, you should first refer to NYU Albert to see if there are any &quot;holds&quot; on your account. A hold on your account may delay your financial aid awards. If there is a hold, please rectify that situation. The delay could be caused by circumstances concerning your aid eligibility. For example, you may not be meeting the satisfactory academic progress standards required to maintain student aid, or further documents may be required from you before we are able to process your award. If there are no holds, and if your award still seems delayed, then contact the Office of Financial Aid . Our counselors can discuss details with you and estimate when you can expect an award.                                                                                                                                                                        I haven't yet applied, but my bill is due soon. I know processing takes several weeks from start to finish. Is there any type of interim aid I can have while I wait?                                                       There is no interim aid. Students often ask if they can take out private, non-federal loans while they wait for their financial aid application to be processed and their federal loans to be disbursed. Students are discouraged from pursuing this because it also takes a few weeks to receive alternative loans, and if you take out alternative loans in advance of your federal loans, you may inadvertently take out too much private loan, which you would then have to return. This can be costly. Or, if you didn't want to return the private loan funds your federal aid eligibility could be adversely affected. The best strategy is to apply for financial aid as soon as possible, and, in the interim, work out a payment plan with the Bursar. If you're eligible for financial aid and you've already made a payment to the Bursar, you will be refunded the amount of overpayment.                                                                                                                                                                         When can I expect my loan refund?                                                       Loan refunds are administered through the NYU Office of the Bursar , and there are important elements to consider if you are anticipating a credit balance. For example, because your loans can not be released to NYU before your designated disbursement date, and because once they are disbursed certain basic enrollment criteria must first be verified (e.g. you normally must be enrolled for at least 6 points) before the loan amount is applied to your account balance, a refund resulting from your student loan will usually not be confirmed and processed until a few days after your disbursement date.                                                                                                                                                                        My financial aid award was based on anticipated credits and housing status, but my plans have changed. What do I do?                                                       Contact the Office of Financial Aid if any of the conditions of your initial award has changed. Depending on the changes, your aid may or may not be affected, but it is always better to inform the Office of Financial Aid of your plans so adjustments can be made, if necessary, early in the semester. If you fail to inform the Office of Financial Aid, then any discrepancies that exist between your anticipated and actual registered credit points will appear during enrollment audit and adjustments will be made at that time. It is the obligation of the Office of Financial Aid to adjust aid according to University policy and federal regulations.                                                                                                                                                                        Why has my citizenship status been requested? What are the citizenship requirements for federal aid?                                                       Students may be required to verify their U.S. citizenship status to confirm eligibility for some federal grant programs, and non-citizens are subject to different regulations which may require supporting documentation, depending upon the type of financial aid sought.       Go to Citizenship Documentation                                                                                                                                                                            Is it too late to apply for aid now that NYU's priority deadline has passed? Is there any aid I can get while I'm waiting for my federal aid eligibility?                                                       You are strongly encouraged to apply for financial aid even if you missed the NYU priority deadline (see Financial Aid Deadlines in the column above right). You may not qualify for the same amounts or types of funds if you did not apply on time. However, there are still alternatives available. For example, you will likely be eligible for some form of federal loan, and possibly federal grants and Federal Work-Study.                                                                                                                                                                         I have been asked to provide verification of my financial aid eligibility. What now?

NYU does not have an ROTC program on campus. However, NYU students can participate in ROTC through other schools in New York while attending NYU.

There is some financial aid credited on my bill this semester, but I was also expecting other credits. What happened to my TAP Grant?                                                       If you are a New York State resident, submitted a FAFSA, and applied for TAP using either TAP on the Web or a printed Express TAP Application (ETA), you should have received a TAP award certificate from the New York State Higher Education Services Corporation (HESC) . Contact HESC at 1-888-NYS-HESC (1-888-697-4372) if more than a few weeks have passed without notification after submitting the FAFSA.   HESC will also advise the NYU Office of the Bursar about your eligibility. If you have received your TAP award certificate but credit has not yet been applied to your bill, write a note on the bill and pay the appropriate remaining balance.                                                                                                                                                                        There is some financial aid credited on my bill this semester, but I was also expecting other credits. What happened to my Pell Grant?                                                       To be eligible for a Pell Grant you must be an undergraduate, have not earned a prior degree, and have an Estimated Family Contribution (as calculated by the government) of $5,273 or less. If you were eligible for Pell last year, you may not be eligible this year \u2014 it can vary depending upon your family and your resources. If you think you are Pell eligible and you subsequently received a request from NYU for documents to verify your FAFSA data, your Pell Grant may not be applied to your bill until the verification review is complete. Use NYU Albert to see if you have any outstanding document requests (please check the To Do list). Also, if you changed your Student Aid Report (SAR) to update any information the changes could have affected your Pell eligibility.                                                                                                                                                                        There is some financial aid credited on my bill this semester, but I was also expecting other credits. What happened to my scholarship?                                                       If you filed a FAFSA last year and received a scholarship, but didn't submit the FAFSA again this year, your scholarship amount could be affected. Most scholarships at NYU are based on a combination of need and merit. Review the letter that you received from our office when you were initially awarded. If you have not already submitted the FAFSA and you need to, do so right away. Depending on the availability of funding, late filers may not get their full scholarship.                                                                                                                                                                        There is some financial aid credited on my bill this semester, but I was also expecting other credits. What happened to my Perkins Loan?                                                       If the federal processors received your FAFSA later than the March 1 deadline (see sidebar above right), you may not have been offered a Perkins Loan. There is a limited amount of federal Perkins funding available to New York University and we must give priority to those who apply on time.    There are a few other reasons why your loan may not be on your bill. On Albert you need to accept your Perkins loan and wait 1 day. After 1 day has passed you must then e-sign your MPN, and print, sign, and mail your Perkins Rights and Responsibilities/Entrance Interview and you Truth-in-Lending in order to receive credit for this loan. Credit will be posted to your Bursar account 24 to 48 hours after you have completed all these steps and after we have received the printed documents.                                                                                                                                                                         There is some financial aid credited on my bill this semester, but I was also expecting other credits. What happened to my Federal Stafford Loan and/or Federal PLUS Loan?                                                       Be sure that you have completed the acceptance process for the Federal Stafford Loan and/or the Federal PLUS Loan to ensure the proper disbursement of funds. If a Stafford and/or PLUS Loan amount was suggested on your financial aid award letter, follow the instructions to secure your loan(s) and then deduct the pending loan amount from your bill (minus the origination fee) and pay the remainder.                                                                                                                                                                        There is some financial aid credited on my bill this semester, but I was also expecting other credits. What happened to my Private Loans?                                                       Your private loan must be approved by the lender and certified by NYU before you will be given credit for that loan. If it has been approved since the date of your bill, simply deduct the semester portion of the approved loan from your bill.                                                                                                                                                                        There is some financial aid credited on my bill this semester, but I was also expecting other credits. What happened to my Federal Work-Study?                                                       Federal Work-Study is not credited on your bill because it represents a potential amount yet to be earned in bi-weekly paychecks during the year. If suggested Work-Study is included in your financial aid package, it means you are eligible to participate in the Federal Work-Study Program .

Frequently Asked Questions                                                                                                                            I just accepted my Direct Loan(s), but now I want to change the amount. How can I make changes to my loan amounts?                                                       Once you have accepted your Direct Loan amounts on NYU Albert you cannot make further changes online. Please notify us to make adjustments to your awards:     Email to the Office of Financial Aid .

I have just been offered an increase or an additional Federal Direct Loan on my award letter. Do I have to complete all of the steps again?                                                       Each loan type (undergraduate/graduate Federal Direct Loan, Federal Direct Parent PLUS Loan and Graduate PLUS Loan) requires its own Master Promissory Note, or MPN, and Entrance Counseling (except Parent PLUS). So, if your increase is to an existing loan type you do NOT need to complete the MPN and Entrance Counseling again. However, you will still need to accept your increase on NYU Albert . If your increase or additional loan is a loan type you were not previously awarded, you WILL need to complete the MPN and Entrance Counseling (except Parent PLUS) in addition to accepting it on NYU Albert .                                                                                                                                                                        How/when do my Direct Loans get posted to my tuition account?                                                       Once you accept your loans on NYU Albert ,  sign your MPN, and complete Entrance Counseling, credit is then posted  to your account. The credit is provisional and does not change to real  credit until 10 days before the start of the loan period.                                                                                                                                                                        What if I want to return some loan funds after I have received a disbursement from Direct Loans?                                                       Within 120 Days of Disbursement:   You have the right to  cancel all or part of any disbursement of a Federal Direct Loan without  being charged interest and other loan fees as long as the cancellation  is processed within 120 days of the original disbursement date. The  disbursement date is the date the funds were applied to your NYU Bursar  bill during any given semester.   To request a cancellation, you must make your request through the NYU Bursar\u2019s Office by completing a Request to Return Loan Funds Form and submitting it to the Bursar as instructed on the form.   More Than 120 Days After Disbursement:   If  you wish to cancel all or part of any disbursement of your loan more  than 120 days after it was disbursed, you are actually repaying part of  your loan and you must pay any accrued interest and/or fees. You cannot  cancel your loan, but you can make a payment directly to your federal  loan servicer. Borrowers are assigned to one of the five servicers,  which include ACS, Great Lakes, NelNet, PHEAA, and Sallie Mae. If you  are not sure which of the five centers is your assigned servicer, visit  and log into the federal government\u2019s National Student Loan Data System to determine your servicer. You may also call 1-800-4-FED-AID to locate your servicer.                                                                                                                                                                        When can I expect my Direct Loan refund?                                                       Loan refunds are administered through the Office of the Bursar ,  and there are important elements to consider if you are anticipating a  credit balance. For example, because your loans can not be released to  NYU before your designated disbursement date, and because once they are  disbursed certain basic enrollment criteria must first be verified (e.g.  you normally must be enrolled for at least 6 points) before the loan  amount is applied to your account balance, a refund resulting from your  student loan will usually not be confirmed and processed until a few  days after your disbursement date.   IMPORTANT for Summer students :   Please note that if you are eligible for loans in the summer, those  loans do not disburse until July 1, and for those eligible for a refund,  you should not rely on those funds until at least one week after  disbursement.                                                                                                                                                                        How can I reduce my federal loans?                                                       If you have completed the acceptance process for a Federal Direct Loan and/or a Federal Direct PLUS Loan but no longer want to borrow the full amount, contact the Office of Financial Aid as soon as possible to authorize a reduction.   Once you have accepted your Direct Loan amounts on NYU Albert you cannot make further changes online. Please notify us to make adjustments to your awards:     Email to the Office of Financial Aid .

My parent's application for a Federal PLUS Loan has been denied. What now?                                                         If the parent borrower is not initially approved for a Federal PLUS Loan, they will receive an endorser packet directly from the U.S. Department of Education. This packet explains that a PLUS Loan may still be acquired if someone else with an acceptable credit rating -- such as the parent applicant's spouse, a relative, or friend -- agrees to endorse or cosign the loan. Contact Direct Loans Applicant Services at 1-800-557-7394 for additional instructions for endorsers.   Parents also have the option to appeal the Department of Education\u2019s PLUS denial. For instructions on how to appeal, please contact the Department of Education\u2019s Applicant Services at 1-800-557-7394.   Please note that if the parent borrower receives the Federal PLUS Loan based on a credit-worthy endorser, the PLUS Master Promissory Note (MPN) that the parent completed will expire with that endorsed loan. A new PLUS MPN will be required for any subsequent PLUS Loan for which the parent applies.   Parent borrowers who are originally credit denied for a Direct PLUS Loan, but have obtained approval by appeal or endorser, are required to complete a new PLUS Loan Counseling session. The federal Department of Education will contact the borrower in these cases and direct them to studentloans.gov to complete PLUS Loan Counseling. Your PLUS Loan cannot disburse to your Bursar bill until you have completed the PLUS Loan Counseling.   The U.S. Department of Education does not inform the NYU Office of Financial Aid about the specific reason for the denial of a Federal PLUS Loan. To appeal for reconsideration, contact the Direct Loan Origination Center toll-free at 1-800-557-7394.   In the event a denial is final, the student may contact the Office of Financial Aid to request consideration for an additional Federal Direct Unsubsidized Loan. Freshman and Sophomores may be eligible for a maximum of $4,000 in additional funds, and Juniors and Seniors may be eligible for a maximum of $5,000 in additional funds. Please note: if at a later time during the academic year a parent becomes eligible or is approved with a co-signor for a Parent PLUS loan, the additional Unsubsidized Loan will be canceled.                                                                                                                                                                          I completed my Subsidized/Unsubsidized Master Promissory Note (MPN) on www.studentloans.gov. Why is it still requested on my Albert To Do list?                                                       Usually, this occurs when the subsidized and/or unsubsidized loans have not yet originated. Origination means that your loan data is being sent to the Department of Education for processing. The checklist item for the MPN will not update to a received status until the loan(s) successfully originate.                                                                                                                                                                          I am a transfer student and I completed my Subsidized/Unsubsidized MPN for my previous school. Do I have to do a new one for NYU?                                                       No, your completed Subsidized/Unsubsidized MPN can be used for your loans at NYU, provide they are still valid and in an active status.                                                                                                                                                                          I am a transfer student and I completed my Undergraduate Entrance Counseling for my previous school. Do I have to do a new one for NYU?                                                       No, your completed Undergraduate Entrance Counseling session can be used for your loans at NYU. However, you must contact NYU\u2019s Office of Financial Aid to let us know. Otherwise, we would not know that you ever completed one in the past and your Entrance Counseling checklist item on your Albert To Do list would stay in a requested status. Once we confirm that a counseling session was completed previously we will update your NYU records.                                                                                                                                                                          How does my parent borrower apply for a Federal Direct Parent PLUS Loan?                                                       You, the student, must start the process by accepting the offered Federal Direct Parent PLUS Loan on your Albert account. You can do so by logging in to Albert and then clicking on the Accept/Decline Financial Aid link and following the instructions.   Your parent borrower will be asked to complete the Federal Direct PLUS Loan Request and Master Promissory Note by visiting the Direct Loan Web site at www.studentloans.gov . They must sign in using the same PIN number that was assigned to them to access your FAFSA. If they do not remember their PIN, they may request a duplicate from the Official PIN site .   The U.S. Department of Education will conduct a credit check that is valid for only 90 days. Your parent borrower should not apply more than 90 days before the start of fall semester to avoid credit expiration.   Shortly after the PLUS Loan originates to the Department of Education, an email from the NYU Office of Financial Aid will be sent to the parent borrower (only if the PLUS Loan was credit approved). The approved parent must complete the PLUS Loan process by logging in to the NYU Student System as instructed in this email and by providing the dollar amount of the Parent PLUS Loan that is desired and the parent must actively accept the PLUS Loan on the same page.                                                                                                                                                                          Who completes the Master Promissory Note for my parent borrower\u2019s endorsed (co-signed) Parent PLUS Loan -- my parent or the endorser?                                                       Even if your parent borrower has had to obtain an endorser for their Federal Direct PLUS Loan, they are still the borrower on the loan. Therefore, the parent borrower must complete the MPN.                                                                                                                                                                          My parent borrower was approved for a Parent PLUS Loan by completing the PLUS Loan Request on www.studentloans.gov. Why did they receive an email from the Office of Financial Aid asking them to complete a PLUS Loan confirmation process?                                                       Federal regulations require a parent borrower to actively accept each Parent PLUS Loan and indicate the final amount they wish to accept for each loan. The email with instructions on completing the final PLUS Loan confirmation is sent to the parent borrower after the loan has been originated and we are in receipt of the approved credit decision. This is your parent borrower\u2019s opportunity to accept the loan for the amount that was originated or reduce the amount if they do not need the entire loan.   For subsequent PLUS Loans in your undergraduate career, your parent borrower may not be required to complete a new PLUS Loan Request on www.studentloans.gov , but they will be required to complete the final PLUS Loan confirmation process through our site.                                                                                                                                                                          Does my parent borrower have to complete a new Federal Direct PLUS Loan Master Promissory Note if . . .                                                       . . . they already did one for a previous school?   No, if your parent borrower has already completed a PLUS Loan MPN for any school (without an endorser) they do not have to complete a new one.   . . . they already did one for my PLUS loan from last year?   No, if your parent borrower was credit approved on their own for a Federal Direct PLUS Loan in a previous semester or year they do not have to complete a new one.   . . . their previous PLUS Loan was approved with an endorser (co-signer)?   Yes, if their previous PLUS Loan required an endorser for credit approval they must complete a new Master Promissory Note for the next PLUS Loan. This is because each endorsed (co-signed) Parent PLUS Loan must have its own MPN \u2013 the MPN for an endorsed loan cannot be used for any subsequent loan.                                                                                                                                                                          My parent borrower received a refund from the Parent PLUS Loan. Can they return the refund check if they do not need the funds?                                                       Yes. Parent borrowers have the right to cancel all or part of any disbursement of a federal Parent PLUS Loan without being charged interest and other loan fees as long as the cancellation is processed within 120 days of the original disbursement date. The disbursement date is the date the funds were applied to your NYU Bursar bill during any given semester.   To request a cancellation, they must make the request through the NYU Bursar\u2019s Office by completing a Request to Return Loan Funds Form and submitting it to the Bursar as instructed on the form.   If they wish to cancel all or part of any disbursement of their loan more than 120 days after it was disbursed, they are actually repaying part of their loan and they must pay any accrued interest and/or fees. They cannot cancel their loan, but they can make a payment directly to your federal loan servicer. Borrowers are assigned to one of the five servicers, which include ACS, Great Lakes, NelNet, PHEAA, and Sallie Mae. If they are not sure which of the five centers is their assigned servicer, visit and log into the federal government\u2019s National Student Loan Data System to determine their servicer. They may also call 1-800-4-FED-AID to locate your servicer.                                                                                                                                                                          I received a refund from my Subsidized/Unsubsidized loan. Can I return the refund check if I do not need the funds?                                                       Yes -- please see the FAQ above regarding parent borrowers returning refunds from a Parent PLUS Loan.

The only items highlighted on this form are those that students commonly have questions on or are confused about. Please review each item carefully to ensure your I-765 is filled out correctly. Each item discussed is highlighted in the image as to where it appears on the actual form I-765. We recommend you fill out the pdf online and then print the form to sign it once completed. Be sure to sign the form in blue ink.              I am applying for:   Check the box \u201cPermission to accept employment.\u201d If you lost your EAD and are applying for a new card, select the second box. If you are applying to continue your current OPT, select the third box.                                     Item 1:   Enter your family name first and be sure to spell it in all capital letters. Enter your first name second. Your first name should not be entered in all capital letters. Include your middle name if you have one.                                     Item 3:   Enter your street address. This must be a U.S. address and it should be valid three months into the future. If you believe you will change addresses within the next three months you are advised to instead list the address of a trusted friend or family member. If you choose to enter your friend\u2019s or family member\u2019s address, you must also include a \u201ccare of\u201d name. This is indicated by writing \u201cc/o\u201d and then the name of your friend/family member before the street address.                                     Item 10:   Enter your I-94 number. This number is 11 digits long and can be found on your I-94 card, which should be stapled into your passport.                                                            Item 11:   Select \u201cYes\u201d if you have previously applied for OPT, or ever submitted the I-765 for work authorization to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. Select \u201cNo\u201d if you have only ever worked on campus or been authorized for CPT, or if you have not previously worked.   If you selected \u201cyes\u201d, enter the USCIS office that handled your previous employment authorization application. For most of you this will be the Vermont Service Center (receipt number would start with EAC).   Enter the date(s) you were approved/denied for employment authorization.                                     Item 12:   Enter the last date you entered the U.S. For most of you this should be the date stamped on your I-94 card.                                     Item 13:   Enter the place you entered the U.S. This should be indicated by the three digit code stamped on your I-94 card. For example, if you entered JFK, the stamp on your I-94 card should indicate \u201cNYC\u201d. If you entered through Newark, the stamp on your I-94 card should indicate \u201cNEW\u201d.                                     Item 15:   Your current status should be F-1 Student.                                     Item 16:     If you are applying for pre completion OPT enter the codes (c ) (3 ) (A)   For post completion OPT enter the codes (c ) (3) (B)   For the 17 month extension, STEM OPT enter the codes (c ) (3) (c)                                       Item 17:   This item only needs to be completed by those students applying for the 17 month extension, STEM OPT. For all others, this item can be left blank.                                     Your Signature:   Be sure to sign the form in blue ink between the two lines.                                                                    Looking for the        I-765 Form?

Your NetID password is not the same as your NYU Google Apps password; see About Your NYU Password(s) below for details.       You are required to reset your NetID NYU password at least once each year; NYU Google Apps passwords do not currently have an annual reset policy.       For security reasons, you can not reuse passwords that you've used before.                                  related pages            Tips for Choosing a Strong Password       NetID &amp; Password FAQs       About NYUHome       NYU Email                        About Your NYU NetID   Activate Your NYU NetID   About Your NetID Password   How to Set or Change Your NetID Password   About Your Google Apps Password   How to Set or Change Your Google Apps Password   Services Affected by Password Changes   Forgotten Password   Troubleshooting Tips         About Your NYU NetID   All NYU faculty and staff members, as well as students enrolled in degree or diploma programs, are  provided with an NYU NetID ( Net work ID entification). Your NetID is a combination of your initials  and a few random numbers, e.g., aqe123, and is usually printed on the back of your NYUCard. It is  different from your University ID, which is also printed on your NYUCard, but is a longer string of numbers  and starts with an \"N\". Once activated (see below), your NetID is your key to many NYU online resources,  including, for eligible community members, NYUHome .  Your NetID is also used to create your default NYU email address (e.g., aqe123@nyu.edu).      Activate Your NYU NetID   You can activate your NetID at any time, from any Internet-connected computer, using the NYU Start  Page ( start.nyu.edu ).  If you know your NetID (it is usually printed on the back of your NYU ID Card), enter it in the appropriate  field and click START! ; if not, follow the instructions at the top of the page. Then, complete the  steps for setting up a NetID password (visit the Security pages for password tips ,  and see below for an explanation of the difference between your NetID password and your Google Apps password).  If you encounter any problems, contact the IT Service Desk .      About Your NetID Password   Your NetID password is used to log into NYUHome, NYURoam Wireless, and many other NYU services. This password must be changed annually  (or more often, if you wish).    Note that you may need to set a separate NYU Google Apps password if you access  NYU Email with a desktop email program like Outlook or Thunderbird or access NYU Google Apps for Education using a mobile device like an iPad, iPhone  or Android. See below for a table that outlines the different services the two passwords allow you to access .      My NetID password is about to expire--what should I do?   For security reasons, NYU requires that you change your NetID password at least once  each year (no exceptions). You will receive email notifications from ITS when your NetID password  is about to expire; if you do not change your password in time, you will not lose any data stored on NYU systems, but you will  not be able to access that data or any NetID password-protected  services until you follow the instructions below to change your password.    You may need to update saved password information in your browsers or mobile  devices (e.g., iPad, iPhone, Android, Blackberry) once you've updated your password; see the   table below for a summary of affected services.      How to Set or Change Your NetID Password   For instructions on how to change your NetID password, please see Setting and changing your NetID password .      About Your Google Apps Password   If you wish to use a method other than the web interface (e.g., email.nyu.edu )  to access NYU Google Apps for Education&mdash;such as a desktop email program like Outlook or Thunderbird or certain email or calendar apps  on mobile devices like an iPhone, iPad, or other PDA&mdash;you must set a separate Google password.    If you use the web interfaces (e.g., email.nyu.edu ) or   NYUHome to access NYU Google Apps for Education, you can use your NetID and NetID password to log in,  and do not need to set a Google Apps password.        How to Set or Change Your Google Apps Password   For instructions on how to change your Google Apps password, please see Setting and changing your Google Apps password .      Services Affected by Password Changes   As described above, there are two passwords that are associated with the various services offered by ITS:  the NetID password and the Google Apps password. When you change your NetID password, this does not  change your Google Apps password, and vice versa.      NOTE: Mobile Device or Email Program Updates   When you change a password, you may need to update saved password information in your mobile device (e.g., iPhone,  iPad, Android, Blackberry), web browser, or desktop email program (e.g., Outlook or Thunderbird). Search the ServiceLink knowledge base for   setup instructions .      This table offers a summary of the services that are affected by each password:     Service NetID Password   Google Apps Password     NYU Email   Yes    Yes, if you use a desktop email program or mobile device app (e.g., certain apps on iPhone, iPad, Android, Blackberry, etc.) to access your NYU Email       NYU Calendar   Yes    Yes, if you use a mobile device app (e.g., certain apps on iPhone, iPad, Android, Blackberry, etc.) to access your NYU Calendar       Other Google Apps for Education (Documents, Sites, Groups)   Yes    Yes, if you use a mobile device app to access them        NYUHome   Yes    No        NYURoam wireless   Yes    No        VPN    Yes    No        Access to i4 and i5 accounts   Yes    No        NYU-NET Proxy   Yes    No       NYU-NET Computer Registration System   Yes   No        ResNet/Ethernet connections   No    No       Desktop computer administrator passwords  Yes, if the computer is registered with Active Directory; if the computer is not on Active Directory, it will not be affected by a NetID password change    No            Forgotten Password   If you forget your password, visit the NYU Start page  ( start.nyu.edu ),  enter your NetID, and click the START! button. On the next screen,  click the Forgot Your Password? link at the right then follow the instructions.  Contact the IT Service Desk if you encounter any issues.       Troubleshooting Tips     If you try to log in to an NYU website with your NetID and NetID password and receive  an error message telling your that your ID or password is incorrect, try logging  in again, making sure that you have typed your NetID and password correctly.  All NYU NetIDs are in lower case. Check to make sure Caps Lock isn't on by accident,  and you're using the NetID that is usually printed on the back of your NYUCard.   If you try again and you still can't log in, follow the forgotten password instructions  above.   If this still doesn't work, please contact the IT Service Desk for further instructions.
