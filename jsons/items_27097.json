As the only studio training actors, directors, designers, playwrights and creators of devised work in a single setting, Playwrights Horizons offers students an unparalleled opportunity for the cross-fertilization of skills, a commitment to the collaborative nature of theater and a dedication to the principle that each student is a whole artist to be nurtured, challenged and celebrated. Rigorous training with our diverse faculty of professional artists working in traditional, global and avant-garde performance styles, challenges each student to discover and bring forth the artist within. As the student progresses through the program, the balance shifts from projects that support foundational class work, to class work that supports the needs of the artist in the development and production of actual work. Projects offer the opportunity to collaborate with fellow students, recent alumni, faculty professionals and guest mentors creating a network of feedback and support that serves as a bridge to the world beyond studio walls. Our project-driven methodology ensures that students emerge from the program with the physical, emotional and intellectual strength and flexibility their work requires. Our students develop, as well, a deep connection to their own personal vision and appetite for artistic risk that will enable them to define their own unique path as artists, citizens and human beings. The school is part of Playwrights Horizons Theater, one of New York\u2019s most successful off-Broadway nonprofit theaters and producer of such shows as the Tony nominated Grey Gardens, the Pulitzer Prize-winning Sunday in the Park with George, Driving Miss Daisy and I Am My Own Wife, as well as the Obie Award-winning Circle, Mirror, Transformation and Clybourne Park.
