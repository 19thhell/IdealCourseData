Colloquium: Pirates and Buccaneers: Seaborne Terrorism in the Early Modern World HIST-UA 369 Offered every year. 4 points. This course will sort out the myths and realities of the \u201cGolden Age of Piracy.\u201d The emergence of Spain as a political and economic superpower in the early sixteenth century bred waves of French, English, and Dutch interlopers, contraband slave traders, seaborne raiders, freebooters, and privateers eager to thwart her attempt at hegemony and expropriate her wealth. Their success gave rise to a multinational and cross-cultural underworld of violence and crime on the high seas that flourished nearly unchecked from the mid-seventeenth century until its suppression in the early decades of the eighteenth century. The response of the early modern world to piracy and buccaneering is embedded in the \u201cLaw of Nations\u201d and the \u201cLaw of the Sea,\u201d progenitors of modern international law. Participants in this course will engage a rich body of primary and secondary historical sources to reconstruct and interpret the multiple contexts within which piracy and buccaneering operated.

By completing assignments that teach them how to conduct  archival research and engage in historical analysis, students come to  understand how historians engage in their craft, how they construct  historical narratives, and how they ensure their accuracy. The course  culminates in a 15- to 20-page research paper. The second purpose of  this course is to learn about U.S. labor history, which includes not  only the study of the workplace but also how families interacted and  reacted to labor conditions as they lived their domestic lives.      Seminar: Writing  American History   HIST-UA 417 Offered  every year. Bender. 4 points.   Explores the history of  history writing in the United States, examining national histories  written in the 19th and 20th centuries as part of American  intellectual history. Focuses on theme, interpretation, points of  view, and style in the work of past historians.    Liberalism and Conservatism since the New Deal HIST-UA 418 Offered every year. 4 points. This seminar investigates the historical development of the key ideologies of postwar American politics and their differing engagements with the central historical developments of that time period: the Cold War, civil rights movement, metropolitan development, feminism, environmentalism, and fiscal and monetary policy. It will investigate how liberalism and conservatism reshaped American society and politics at the various scales of American governance: grass-roots, state, regional, and national. As a research seminar, students will be expected to complete a piece of original research, on a topic of their choosing, over the course of the semester.    Seminar: Unbordered and Bordered Lands: North American Borderlands History HIST-UA 663 Offered every other year. 4 points. In this reading seminar, students will explore the major themes and historiographical approaches to the study of North American borderlands history. A rapidly expanding and vibrant field, borderlands history focuses on the interactions of peoples, nations, and empires across the boundaries of Mexico, the United States, and Canada. Beginning with the earliest European claims to the continent, this course will explore recent writings on the interactions of Europeans and Native peoples as Spain, Britain, and France attempted to conquer North America. In the second half of the class, we will turn to the transition from empires to nation-states in North America and explore how Mexico, the United States, and Canada worked to assert state power and create national space and citizens in the borderlands between nations.      Seminar: Reading and  Writing Experimental History   HIST-UA 672 Hodes. 4  points.   Investigates and  evaluates the ways in which scholars attempt to expand the boundaries  of writing history. Focuses on the relationship between historical  evidence and the writing of history in new ways; relation between  scholar and subject; connections between history and speculation; use  of unconventional voices; re-creation of past worlds and lives; and  connections between history and storytelling.      Seminar: Constructions  of Race in U.S. History   HIST-UA 680 Hodes. 4  points.   Explores the ideas of  race and how racial classifications have changed over time and across  regions and cultures in the United States. Themes include language,  color, law, science, slavery, mixed ancestries, and white identity.      Seminar: Race, Civil  War, Reconstruction   HIST-UA 683 Hodes. 4  points.   The American Civil War  punctuated the 19th century and transformed the nation. This seminar  explores the experiences of slaves and former slaves, politicians and  community leaders, civilians and families, soldiers and veterans, and  proceeds from the premise that slavery and race were central to the  war\u2019s causes and consequences.      Seminar: Ideology and  Social Change in American History   HIST-UA 684 Offered  every other year. 4 points.   Explores classical  arguments in American history concerning social behavior. Central  themes: the power of cultural conditioning, the role of schooling and  other acculturating institutions, the uses of \u201cuplifting\u201d reform  and organizational benevolence, and the intervention of professional  experts into social policymaking. Special attention to the role of  ethnic and racial leaders, proponents of success and socialization,  critical investigations of family and femininity, and analysis of  distinctive generational responses to these and related issues.      Seminar: The New Deal   HIST-UA 686 Offered  every year. Katz. 4 points.   Explores the historical  issues of the Great Depression and the New Deal years, 1933\u20131941,  by discussing several relevant works on this period. Students choose  a research project, which they report on both orally and in a seminar  paper. Colloquium: Twentieth Century U.S. History in Film HIST-UA 694 Offered every other spring. 4 points. The purpose of this course is two-fold: to engage in critical examination of film and to analyze how film either captures or portrays specific moments in twentieth-century U.S. history. Throughout the semester, we will discuss major historical eras and events\u2014including the Great Depression, the Second World War, McCarthyism, the Cold War, the Civil Rights movement, Vietnam, and Watergate\u2014as we explore major film genres such as the social problem film, screwball comedy, the \u201cwoman\u2019s film,\u201d film noir, and Gen-X cinema. In terms of documentaries, we will view newsreels, government-produced films, historical documentaries, cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9, and \u201cdocu-ganda.\u201d We will not necessarily focus upon whether filmic representations are historically accurate in fine detail. Rather, we shall carefully consider the ways in which filmic representations do\u2014and do not\u2014comment upon complex political, social, cultural, and historical dynamics. Lastly, we shall also consider key developments in cinema over the course of the twentieth century. Women, the Entertainment Industry, and the Blacklist Era HIST-UA 695 Offered every fall. 4 points. One of the darker epochs of American history were the years most commonly known as the McCarthy era, although the senator from Wisconsin played only a small part in the investigations of the entertainment industry. History also chooses to remember only the men whenever discussions of this period are presented. Long forgotten, more accurately ignored, many women were named, appeared before the Committees, and were victims of the blacklist. This course reviews the history of this period, and the women of the entertainment industry who appeared before the various Un-American Activities Committees from 1938-1958. Here is an opportunity to examine an important piece of the American story through a new lens, giving a fascinating group of women their place in the history of this period.    Seminar: Sport and Film  in American History   HIST-UA 698 Sammons. 4  points.   Investigates how a  visual medium (film), subject to the conventions of drama and  fiction, and a popular activity/institution (sport), often associated  with frivolity, violence, and puerility, might be used as serious  vehicles for conceptualizing and analyzing the past. Seminar: Histories of the U.S.-Mexico Border HIST-UA 756 4 points. The border between the United States and Mexico is both a meeting ground and a dividing line between two nations, cultures, and people. It has been a site of conflict and coexistence from the time it was created until the present. In the media the border most often appears as a site of controversy, violence, and national control that is defined by U.S. and Mexican policies concerning trade, immigration, and national security. But the border is more than this; it is a place where individuals, families, and communities have made their lives. The history of the border then is found not only in the pages of government reports and statistics, but in the memories, songs, and stories of border people. In this class we will explore some of the many histories of the border. A wide array of course materials\u2014including historical monographs, journalistic reports, oral histories, folk songs, and documentary and feature films\u2014will introduce students to the many ways that people use and make sense of the past. In the process we will seek not just to better understand the contemporary political issues focused on the border today, but the longer and richer history of the U.S.-Mexico border and the people who have lived along and across it.     History of Asia, Africa, and Latin America      Seminar: Capitalism in  South Asia   HIST-UA 327 Offered  every year. Sartori. 4 points.   Is capitalism a set of  global arrangements superimposed on a set of local cultures, a  long-term tendency of South Asian societies, or something that has  entered into the very structure of modern South Asian society? This  course explores a series of topics including the Indian Ocean trading  world; \u201cproto-industrialization\u201d in pre-colonial India; the East  India Company; deindustrialization, peasantization, and  traditionalization; continuity and transformation in peasant society;  developmentalist theories and pro-industrialization policies;  nationalism, decolonization, and political economy; and  neo-liberalism.

Examines 20th-century  Taiwan and China in their interrelationship and their divergent  paths. It is not a diplomatic or international history course.  Rather, it takes up crucial issues in the history of each polity and  society, focusing primarily on Taiwan, thus allowing students to gain  an understanding of the complexities of Taiwanese history and society  and of this contested region of the world. The reading and writing  load are heavy, and students are expected to participate in class.  Some background in China\u2019s or Taiwan\u2019s history is desirable and  presumed.      Seminar: Topics in  Eurasian History   HIST-UA 533 Offered  every year. 4 points.   Focuses on major  historical issues and problems in the history of Eurasia, which is  the largest landmass in the world but is rarely treated as a region  or unit of historical analysis. Responds to recent shifts in the  field of history that emphasize frameworks larger than the  \u201cnation-state\u201d for historical research and analysis. Possible  topics: The Mongol Empire and Its Legacy; Early Modern Empires:  China, Russia, and the Ottomans; Scientific and Technological  Exchanges, 1225\u20132000; Eurasian Militaries; and Nomads and Nomadism  in Eurasia.

The war is dealt with in two senses: its meaning  for Japan\u2019s international history and its impact on the domestic  landscape. Readings are drawn from both primary and secondary sources  so that interpretative controversies as well as texts may be  discussed. Thematically, the course divides into sections: (1) the  great debates over Japanese fascism and ultranationalism; (2) the  China War; (3) the Pacific War; (4) the Coprosperity Sphere; (5) the  atom bomb, surrender, and occupation; and (6) issues of public memory  and war responsibility.

Many assume that bodies are ahistorical, unchanging, but this is not true. This seminar examines historical changes in physical bodies, perception of bodies, and treatment of the body over time; how social class, race, sex and region have contributed to these changes and to bodily diversity; and how national and international inequalities have affected the human body. Colloquium: Biography and History HIST-UA 669 Offered every other fall. 4 points. In this course, we will explore the ways in which the art and craft of biography can serve the study of history. Reading critically and thoughtfully, we will explore both conventional and unconventional biographies, by both academics and non-academics, treating subjects ranging from the well-known to the unknown, and beyond. Around the seminar table, we will ask how each work illuminates the study of history, with attention to such topics as research methods, sources, evidence, argument, style, voice, and the relationship between writer and subject. Throughout the semester, students will make their own forays into biography, sharing their work and reflecting on one another\u2019s efforts.

Europe in the early  Middle Ages was created out of a mixture of ingredients: the legacy  of the Roman Empire; the growth and development of Christianity;  invading peoples who settled within the boundaries of the former  Roman Empire; and the clash of competing languages, religions, and  legal systems. This tumultuous time forged a new entity, medieval  Europe, whose development, growing pains, and creative successes this  course examines. Uses the records and artifacts of the period itself  as central elements for investigating the period.      The Crusades   HIST-UA 113 Identical  to MEDI-UA 113. Offered every other year. 4 points.

We investigate Mao\u2019s thought and  theories, as well as his revolutionary practice, not as biographical  artifacts but as products of and contributors to the revolutionary  situation in China and the world in the 20th century. We end with  Mao\u2019s afterlives. The majority of the readings are drawn from Mao\u2019s  own writings. Students will learn to read Mao\u2019s texts intensively  and extensively.

Colloquium: 20th Century European Capitalism HIST-UA 272 Offered every other year. 4 points. Nineteenth   century Europe was the birthplace of economic liberalism. The gold   standard, the night watchman state, and the writings of the classical   economists laid the foundation for a golden age of laissez-faire   capitalism. More than a century later we see Europe as the birthplace of   the modern welfare state, a pioneer of organized capitalism, and the   center for a supra-national experiment in economic cooperation: the   European Union.

Colloquium: Pirates and Buccaneers: Seaborne Terrorism in the Early Modern World HIST-UA 369 Offered every year. 4 points. This course will sort out the myths and realities of the \u201cGolden Age of Piracy.\u201d The emergence of Spain as a political and economic superpower in the early sixteenth century bred waves of French, English, and Dutch interlopers, contraband slave traders, seaborne raiders, freebooters, and privateers eager to thwart her attempt at hegemony and expropriate her wealth. Their success gave rise to a multinational and cross-cultural underworld of violence and crime on the high seas that flourished nearly unchecked from the mid-seventeenth century until its suppression in the early decades of the eighteenth century. The response of the early modern world to piracy and buccaneering is embedded in the \u201cLaw of Nations\u201d and the \u201cLaw of the Sea,\u201d progenitors of modern international law. Participants in this course will engage a rich body of primary and secondary historical sources to reconstruct and interpret the multiple contexts within which piracy and buccaneering operated.

Ortolano.  4 points.   Assists students in  writing archivally-based research papers about a single topic in  recent British history. Since the end of the Second World War,  Britain has faced many of the challenges typical of Western  societies, as well as more particular obstacles resulting from its  status as a recent imperial power. British history since 1945 has  thus been characterized by the creation of the welfare state, the end  of the British Empire, immigration and racial conflict, \u201cSwinging  London\u201d and 1960s second-wave feminism, labor unrest and the  decline of heavy industry, neo-liberal economics, and Tony Blair\u2019s  New Labour.

Beginning with the earliest European claims to the continent, this course will explore recent writings on the interactions of Europeans and Native peoples as Spain, Britain, and France attempted to conquer North America. In the second half of the class, we will turn to the transition from empires to nation-states in North America and explore how Mexico, the United States, and Canada worked to assert state power and create national space and citizens in the borderlands between nations.      Seminar: Reading and  Writing Experimental History   HIST-UA 672 Hodes. 4  points.   Investigates and  evaluates the ways in which scholars attempt to expand the boundaries  of writing history.

The purpose of this course is two-fold: to engage in critical examination of film and to analyze how film either captures or portrays specific moments in twentieth-century U.S. history. Throughout the semester, we will discuss major historical eras and events\u2014including the Great Depression, the Second World War, McCarthyism, the Cold War, the Civil Rights movement, Vietnam, and Watergate\u2014as we explore major film genres such as the social problem film, screwball comedy, the \u201cwoman\u2019s film,\u201d film noir, and Gen-X cinema. In terms of documentaries, we will view newsreels, government-produced films, historical documentaries, cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9, and \u201cdocu-ganda.\u201d We will not necessarily focus upon whether filmic representations are historically accurate in fine detail. Rather, we shall carefully consider the ways in which filmic representations do\u2014and do not\u2014comment upon complex political, social, cultural, and historical dynamics. Lastly, we shall also consider key developments in cinema over the course of the twentieth century. Women, the Entertainment Industry, and the Blacklist Era HIST-UA 695 Offered every fall. 4 points. One of the darker epochs of American history were the years most commonly known as the McCarthy era, although the senator from Wisconsin played only a small part in the investigations of the entertainment industry. History also chooses to remember only the men whenever discussions of this period are presented. Long forgotten, more accurately ignored, many women were named, appeared before the Committees, and were victims of the blacklist. This course reviews the history of this period, and the women of the entertainment industry who appeared before the various Un-American Activities Committees from 1938-1958. Here is an opportunity to examine an important piece of the American story through a new lens, giving a fascinating group of women their place in the history of this period.    Seminar: Sport and Film  in American History   HIST-UA 698 Sammons. 4  points.   Investigates how a  visual medium (film), subject to the conventions of drama and  fiction, and a popular activity/institution (sport), often associated  with frivolity, violence, and puerility, might be used as serious  vehicles for conceptualizing and analyzing the past. Seminar: Histories of the U.S.-Mexico Border HIST-UA 756 4 points. The border between the United States and Mexico is both a meeting ground and a dividing line between two nations, cultures, and people. It has been a site of conflict and coexistence from the time it was created until the present. In the media the border most often appears as a site of controversy, violence, and national control that is defined by U.S. and Mexican policies concerning trade, immigration, and national security. But the border is more than this; it is a place where individuals, families, and communities have made their lives. The history of the border then is found not only in the pages of government reports and statistics, but in the memories, songs, and stories of border people. In this class we will explore some of the many histories of the border. A wide array of course materials\u2014including historical monographs, journalistic reports, oral histories, folk songs, and documentary and feature films\u2014will introduce students to the many ways that people use and make sense of the past. In the process we will seek not just to better understand the contemporary political issues focused on the border today, but the longer and richer history of the U.S.-Mexico border and the people who have lived along and across it.     History of Asia, Africa, and Latin America      Seminar: Capitalism in  South Asia   HIST-UA 327 Offered  every year. Sartori. 4 points.

Seminar: Topics in  Eurasian History   HIST-UA 533 Offered  every year. 4 points.   Focuses on major  historical issues and problems in the history of Eurasia, which is  the largest landmass in the world but is rarely treated as a region  or unit of historical analysis. Responds to recent shifts in the  field of history that emphasize frameworks larger than the  \u201cnation-state\u201d for historical research and analysis. Possible  topics: The Mongol Empire and Its Legacy; Early Modern Empires:  China, Russia, and the Ottomans; Scientific and Technological  Exchanges, 1225\u20132000; Eurasian Militaries; and Nomads and Nomadism  in Eurasia.

Global and Special  Topics Seminars    History of the Body HIST-UA 310 Offered every two years. 4 points. History of the Body from Birth to Death. Many assume that bodies are ahistorical, unchanging, but this is not true. This seminar examines historical changes in physical bodies, perception of bodies, and treatment of the body over time; how social class, race, sex and region have contributed to these changes and to bodily diversity; and how national and international inequalities have affected the human body. Colloquium: Biography and History HIST-UA 669 Offered every other fall. 4 points. In this course, we will explore the ways in which the art and craft of biography can serve the study of history. Reading critically and thoughtfully, we will explore both conventional and unconventional biographies, by both academics and non-academics, treating subjects ranging from the well-known to the unknown, and beyond. Around the seminar table, we will ask how each work illuminates the study of history, with attention to such topics as research methods, sources, evidence, argument, style, voice, and the relationship between writer and subject. Throughout the semester, students will make their own forays into biography, sharing their work and reflecting on one another\u2019s efforts.

Undergraduate Courses     Anthropology      Topical Seminar: Formations of Indigeneity     ANTH-UA320.001     Spring 2012     Myers     Through a case study of materials concerning indigenous people in Australia and North America, this course will investigate the consequences (cultural, sociological, policy) of a development that has taken place throughout the world. Many of the peoples in whom anthropologists have long been interested\u2013those organized into small-scale societies, kinship based\u2013have been encapsulated as indigenous minorities within nation states dominated by other cultural traditions. In this context, the capacity and practices of these peoples, who some have characterized as \u201cFourth World peoples,\u201d to reproduce themselves and their traditions in their own terms has been limited, undermined, co-opted and, on occasion, ironically reinforced .     Topical Seminar: Memory, Heritage, History and Narrative     ANTH-UA320.002     Spring 2012     Abercrombie      Topical Seminar: Latino Expressive Culture and Literature      ANTH-UA320.003     Spring 2012     Rosaldo      Human Society and Culture     ANTH-UA 1     Abercrombie, Beidelman, D\u00e1vila, Ganti, Grant, Khan, Myers, Rapp, Rogers, Siu.     Surveys the general aims, methods, and findings of modern cultural anthropology and its ties with the humanities and social sciences. Economic, political, and family organizations and systems of thought, including religion, are covered with equal attention to \u201cprimitive,\u201d traditional, and modern complex societies, particularly non-Western societies.      Anthropology of Language     ANTH-UA 17     Prerequisite: ANTH-UA 1 or permission of the instructor. Schieffelin.     Taking an anthropological perspective on the role of language in contemporary social life, introduces students to theories and methods for studying communicative practices across a range of societies and settings. Ethnographic studies focus on the role of language in regulating social relations, identity formation, power and politics, verbal art and performance, literacy and education in multilingual and multicultural settings, and the development of new media.      Salvation and Revolution     ANTH-UA 34     Prerequisite: ANTH-UA 1 or permission of the instructor. Beidelman, Myers.     Examines revolutionary movements in both traditional and industrial societies in terms of how violence, coercion, prophecy, and radical thought impel social change. Analyzes utopian communities, prophetic movements, cargo cults, religious sects, and terrorism from various social scientific perspectives.     Family and Kinship     ANTH-UA 41     Prerequisite: ANTH-UA 1. Abercrombie, Beidelman, Ginsburg, Khan, Martin, Myers, Rapp, Rogers.     Explores cross-cultural diversity in the organization of family life and kin relationships. Discusses how anthropology\u2019s cross-cultural perspective helps illuminate new or controversial family arrangements in Western societies.     Cultural Symbols     ANTH-UA 48     Prerequisite: ANTH-UA 1 or permission of the instructor. Abercrombie, Beidelman, Ginsburg, Myers.     Surveys the various symbolic systems employed by the world\u2019s people, considering their use in myth, ritual, literature, and art and the kinds of anthropological theories applied to explain their power and forms. Approaches theory through case studies, providing a diverse view of world cultures. Uses materials from all continents; emphasizes non-Western, nonliterate societies though some material from the West is also used.     Peoples of Latin America     ANTH-UA 103     Prerequisite: ANTH-UA 1 or permission of the instructor. Abercrombie, D\u00e1vila, Rosaldo, Stout.     Surveys Latin American societies and cultures, placing special emphasis on class, ethnicity, and nationhood. Examines some of the fundamental characteristics of Ibero-American civilization both in its historical development and in its transformations across a variety of regional and class contexts. Discusses the complex interrelationships between country and city and between \u201cpopular\u201d and \u201celite\u201d culture by examining ethnographic case material and a few general interpretative works.     Visual Anthropology     ANTH-UA 122 Formerly Transcultural Cinema.     Prerequisite: ANTH-UA 1 or permission of the instructor. Ganti, Ginsburg, Stout.     Explores the history and development of anthropology\u2019s relationship to visual practices, focusing on, but not limited to, photography and film, both as a mode for representing culture and as a site of cultural practice. Examines the emergence of, as well as the contestations around, the genre known as ethnographic film and its relationship to wider debates about documentary and nonfictional film practice. One of the central themes of the course is the relationship between representation, power, and knowledge as manifest in cross-cultural representation.     Anthropology of Media     ANTH-UA 123     Prerequisite: ANTH-UA 1 or permission of the instructor. Ganti, Ginsburg, Stout.     Examines the social and political life of media and how it makes a difference in the daily lives of people as a practice\u2014in production, reception, or circulation. Introduces some key concepts in social theory such as ideology, hegemony, the public sphere, and the nation, which have been critical to the study of the media across disciplines. Provides an overview of the increasing theoretical attention paid to the mass media by anthropologists and focuses on concrete ethnographic examples. Examines cross-culturally how the mass media have become the primary means for the circulation of symbolic forms across time and space and crucial to the constitution of subjectivities, collectivities, and histories in the contemporary world. Topics include the role of media in constituting and contesting national identities, in forging alternative political visions, in transforming religious practice, and in creating subcultures.      Anthropology of Art     ANTH-UA 125     Prerequisite: ANTH-UA 1 or permission of the instructor. Geismar, Myers.     Introduces students to the \u201cclassic\u201d literature within the anthropology of art, charts the development and interests of this subdiscipline of anthropology, and uses this material to develop an \u201canthropological\u201d perspective on art that can be used as a key form of critical inquiry into diverse art forms\u2014even those not conventionally explored in the history of anthropology. The starting point for the anthropology of art is to ask, what is art? in comparative cultural perspective. Analyzes, among other things, the idea of aesthetics in cross-cultural context; the notion of style; the relation between art, technology, and skill; the entanglement of primitivism and modernity; the role of class and taste in appreciating art; art and value in the marketplace; art and museum practice; tourist art and the value of authenticity; and colonial and postcolonial art.     Race, \u201cDifference,\u201d and Social Inequality     ANTH-UA 323 Identical to SCA-UA 323.     Prerequisite: ANTH-UA 1 or permission of the instructor. Khan, Siu.     Human beings have always grappled with some notion of identity, asking questions about who they are, about who others distinguished from themselves are, and about the ways that perceived similarities and differences are meaningful and important (or not) in social relationships. Examines how historical, social, and cultural contexts shape the forms that identities take, looking in particular at ideas about race and racial identity. We work with two     premises: (1) race must be understood in relation to other identity categories: gender, class, sexuality, ethnicity, and so on and (2) race is expressed in both obvious and subtle ways; thus, racial identity is implicit as well as explicitly expressed. We also consider whether race must necessarily be understood as stigma; discuss nonfiction, fiction, and films; and may visit public exhibitions.     Reimagining Community: Race, Nation, and the Politics of Belonging     ANTH-UA 325 Identical to SCA-UA 200.     Prerequisite: ANTH-UA 1 or permission of the instructor. D\u00e1vila, Siu.     Critically examines and evaluates the various approaches to studying and interpreting different community formations. Examines different notions of \u201ccommunity\u201d through a variety of disciplinary lenses. Readings are drawn from anthropology, history, feminist studies, cultural studies, ethnic studies, and philosophy. Students are encouraged to examine these texts both as theoretical representations of \u201ccommunity\u201d as well as historically embedded artifacts that are part of the larger machinery in the production of knowledge.     Language and Law     ANTH-UA 329     Prerequisite: ANTH-UA 1 or permission of the instructor. Schieffelin.     Arguments and conflicts are part of everyday life, and language is central to both their instigation and resolution. Explores how speakers ranging from small children to litigants in courts attempt to settle their differences. Comparative materials illustrate theories of disputes and dispute resolution, examining the power of language and the language of power in a variety of settings (e.g., mediation, arbitration, trials). Class includes fieldwork trips to small claims court. Students audio record cases and transcribe and analyze them according to different analytic perspectives. Bilingual students are encouraged to focus on cases that use interpreters.     Human Rights and Culture      ANTH-UA 331     Prerequisite: ANTH-UA 1 or permission of the instructor.     Offers an overview of the human rights system, looking at its basic elements and studying how it works. Focuses on the relationships between human rights and culture. Human rights campaigns frequently encounter resistance in the name of protecting cultural differences. This is particularly common with issues concerning women, children, and the family. Explores several issues that raise questions of human rights and culture, such as female genital cutting, honor killing, trafficking of persons, and indigenous people\u2019s rights to culture. Using these examples, considers how the human rights system deals with tensions between global standards and local ways of life. Examines the meanings of rights and of culture in these debates and shows the implications of adopting an anthropological analysis of these situations. The goal of the course is developing an understanding of human rights in practice.     Culture Through Food     ANTH-UA 410     Prerequisite: ANTH-UA 1 or permission of the instructor. Abercrombie, Rogers.     Explores some of the ways that people use food, cuisines, and eating to organize and engage with social worlds. This focus provides a concrete means for deepening our understanding of alternative models of social explanation. Drawing on ethnographic material from a wide range of cultures, as well as feature films and our own observations and interviews, we consider topics such as the material dimensions of food production, distribution, and consumption (e.g., how food scarcity or abundance shapes collective possibilities, expectations, and values; the causes, consequences, forms, and myths of globalization) and the cultural meanings and social distinctions encoded in food practices (e.g., how food is used cross-culturally as a marker of social identity\u2014class, gender, and ethnicity\u2014and source of meaning\u2014nostalgia, anxiety, and so on).     Medical Anthropology     ANTH-UA 35     Sprig 2012     Analyzes medical beliefs and practices in African, Asian, and Latin American societies. Studies the coexistence of different kinds of medical specialists (e.g., shamans, herbalists, bonesetters, midwives, physicians trained in indigenous and cosmopolitan medicine), with particular reference to the structures of health resources available to laymen and problems of improving health care.     Art History      Topics in Latin American Art: Colonial to Modern     ARTH-UA 316     Prerequisites: ARTH-UA 2, ARTH-UA 5, and ARTH-UA 6, or a score of 5 on the AP Art History exam. Offered periodically.     Focuses on trends, movements, and individuals in the art of Latin America from the 16th to the 20th century. This course is not a survey; it attempts to situate works of art within their social, historical, and theoretical contexts. Chronological focus of this course may vary from term to term.     North American Indian Arts      ARTH-UA 570     Offered periodically.     This course is an introductory survey of North American Indian and Eskimo art. It covers the following art-producing areas and cultures: Northwest Coast (Ozette, Salish, Nootka, Haida, Kwakiutl, Tlingit); Alaska (Old Bering Sea, Ipiutak, and Yupik Eskimo); Southwest (Hohokam, Mogollon, Anasazi, Hopi, Navajo); Plains (Arapaho, Kiowa, Mandan, Sioux); Woodlands (Adena, Hopewell, Mississippian, Ojibwa, Iroquois); and contemporary art (tradition and innovation in contemporary Native American and Eskimo art).     Reading the City     ARTH-UA 677 Prerequisites: ARTH-UA 601, ARTH-UA 661, and permission of the program director. Offered every year.     The course focuses on observation and documentation of a historical section of New York City from its foundation to the present. Students participate in field walks and attend in-class lectures and discussions. A principal objective of the course is to have students learn to read the historical stratigraphy of the city by using primary and secondary sources such as maps, prints, and panoramas, as well as City Council minutes and other printed documents. The goal is to have them deepen their understanding of phenomena that they have observed firsthand.     Classics     Special Topics: Archaeologies of Daily Life     CLASS-UA 293.001     Spring 2012     Joan Connelly     This seminar examines the daily life of Greeks and Romans through consideration of objects in the NYU Classics Department Collections. The role of art in ancient society, the functions that it served, as well as the values and assumptions that it reflects, will be explored through individual objects in the Collections. Students will prepare oral and power point presentations of objects in materials that include ceramics, terracotta, marble, bronze, and glass. From altar pieces to inscribed plaques, from Attic black-figured vases to Roman course ware pots, from bronze coins to candelabra, from glass bottles to terracotta votive figurines, objects in the Classics Dept. Collections provide case studies through which larger social issues can be examined. The capstone project of the course will be student generated design and installation of objects for display as well as the creation of information panels and brochures to accompany their \u201cmini-exhibitions.\u201d     Comparative Literature      Topics in Film and Literature: South by South: Ideological Maps And Fictions of Uneven Development     COLIT-UA 300.001, SPAN-UA 551.002     Spring 2012     Dopico     This course considers the \u201cidea of the South\u201d as geopolitical territory, imaginary landscape and ideological map: a fictive and creative topos where regional mythology, racial divisions, national contests, and cultural imperialism together produce extraordinary narratives and alternative histories. Reading comparatively, south by south, we discover a dynamic cultural genealogy from the global South\u2019s western hemisphere that precedes the urgency of current debates about uneven development and the problems of North and South. We will encounter artists who manipulate and contest the political imaginary and the fictive qualities assigned to the South and its subjects. Engaging works that exalt or decry that ideological geography, we will examine how these artists remake \u201cthe South,\u201d and how they engage the North and its fictions.     Lectures and section discussions will consider works that reflect on different Souths and consider how they portray seductive, dangerous, infantile, charming, backward, or even criminal cultures. In texts, visual art, and films from Europe and the Americas, we will consider how realities and fantasies of the South are represented, how a global South becomes a true fiction, and how writers from \u201cSouthern\u201d places respond to the realities of uneven development and to their own barbarous, childlike, or exotic status on political maps and cultural markets. We will question why writers explore lost worlds, or belatedly return to a region\u2019s buried history to fictively rework and revive the past. We will consider why outsiders, children, and outlaws are central tropes. We will think about the exceptional \u201crepresentational burden\u201d of Southern artists and consider how they negotiate their double bind -- how they engage the biases and appetites of the North and at the same time respond to the weight of history, self-hatred and loyalty in the South.     English     American Literature I      ENGL-UA 230     Prerequisite: ENGL-UA 200 or equivalent approved by the course instructor. .     A survey of American literature and literary history, from the early colonial period to the eve of the Civil War. The goal is to acquire a grasp of the expanding canon of American literature by reading both established, canonical masterpieces and texts traditionally considered marginal. Topics include the relation between history and cultural mythology, the rise of \u201cliterature\u201d as a discipline unto itself, the meaning of American individualism, the mythology of American exceptionalism, the dialectic of freedom and slavery in American rhetoric, the American obsession with race, the ideology of domesticity and its link to the sentimental, and the nature of the \u201cAmerican Renaissance.\u201d     Colonialism and the Rise of Modern African Literature     ENGL-UA 707 Identical to COLIT-UA 850.         Topics: Cross Cultural Encounters on the Renaissance Stage      x-ENGL-UA 252.004     Spring 2012     Instructor: Forman     The Renaissance witnessed both an explosion in theatrical innovation and an increasingly global world--the beginnings of global trade, the \u2015discovery of the New World, and bouts of both conflict and cooperation among the world\u2018s powers. By reading plays that stage encounters between Europeans from different countries and of different religions, between Europeans and the Ottoman Empire, among natives of \u2015India, and among Europeans, Native Americans, and African slaves, we will explore how and why the stage became such a significant site for the representation of cross-cultural encounters. Some questions we will explore include: how do these plays represent conflict\u2014between self and other and over goods and territory\u2014and what possibilities for reconciliation do they imagine? How do these plays understand the differences encountered as a result of travel, trade, and exploration? Why did the theatre develop a fascination with the exotic (for example, with cannibals and pirates)? In what ways did what it means to be European, Christian, or even a good wife or husband get defined and altered by these encounters? In keeping with the theme of encounters, this course will stage a number of creative encounters from the period: between works from different European nations; between plays and the prose works with which they were in dialogue; and between written and visual materials, for example, engravings of the New World and its inhabitants. In the cases where translations exist, we will also read accounts of how non-Europeans viewed Europe. Likely authors include, Shakespeare, Marlowe, Cervantes, Montaigne, Behn, Fletcher, DeBry, and Massinger.     Topics: 19th C American Lit: American Wilderness     ENGL-UA 961.001     Spring 2012     Baker     This course will examine the literary construction of the American wilderness from the colonial era to the present day. We will begin with a study of several modes of colonial writing: the early promotional tract, which linked wilderness with economic opportunity; the Puritan spiritual narrative, which viewed wilderness as a place of savagery and temptation; and the Enlightenment travel narrative, which sought to bring order to nature by means of classification and analysis. Taking up writings of the nineteenth century, we will then examine how Romantic and Transcendentalist writers revised these earlier views of nature, depicting nature as a retreat from commerce as well as a place where humans could restore themselves (or, in the words of John Muir, wash their sprits clean). Our study of nineteenth-century writing will also consider the figure of the Native American as an embodiment of wildness in both positive and negative senses; the growing awareness of America\u2018s limited natural resources; and the impact of evolutionary biology on the American understanding of animality and human nature. We will conclude the course by examining the construction of wilderness in the literature of twentieth-century counter-cultural movements and contemporary environmentalism.     History      American Natives in Early American History   HIST-UA 602   Kupperman. Offered every year.

Explores the ways in which migration from abroad has impacted on American history. Organized chronologically, this course examines immigrations to the United States from the 17th century to present times and the ways in which immigrants and their descendants constructed ethnic communities and practices. Furthermore, the course looks at changing American attitudes toward immigration as reflected in popular culture and public policy and seeks to understand the influence of American reactions on the process of ethnic cultural formation.     History of Colonial Latin America      HIST-UA 743     Thomson. Offered every other year.     Introduces students to the colonial origins of the Latin American region and the ways they have shaped the present.

A comparative survey of Latin American social, economic, cultural, and political history from 1800 to the present.     History of Mexico and Central America     HIST-UA 752     Grandin. Offered every other year.     A survey of Mexican social and cultural history, including a brief sketch of indigenous societies and civilizations on the eve of the Spanish Conquest, an examination of the conquest as a protracted process and of the establishment of regionally distinct colonial societies, and an exploration of the formation and subsequent development of specific patterns of social life (urban society and rural hinterlands, characteristic agrarian institutions, and interracial and interethnic relations). Special attention paid to moments of real or apparent rupture in the social and political system, when these characteristic patterns and institutions were challenged or threatened: the Wars of Independence, the Revolution, and the recent conflict and crisis in Chiapas.     Power and Poverty     HIST-UA 743     Ludden. Offered every year.     This lecture/discussion course explores entanglements of power and poverty by focusing on dynamics of inequality during economic development under globalization. The course has four parts; each presents a particular angle of analysis. We begin with Amartya Sen\u2019s entitlement approach to famine. We then consider contemporary global issues. Our third project is to bring health into understandings of poverty and power. Last, we consider political struggles as potentially productive forces inside inequality environments.     Seminar: Constructions of Race in U.S. History     HIST-UA 680 Hodes.     Explores the ideas of race and how racial classifications have changed over time and across regions and cultures in the United States. Themes include language, color, law, science, slavery, mixed ancestries, and white identity.     Empires and Political Imagination     MAP-UA 552     Spring 2012     Burbank/Cooper     Throughout history, few people lived for very long under a polity that consisted entirely or even mainly of people with whom they shared a language and culture. Any examination of the variety of human cultures must take account of the political structures within which people tried to make their way, sometimes seeking higher degrees of autonomy, sometimes accommodating to rulers' authority, sometimes trying to extend their own power over others. Empires\u2013polities which maintained and enhanced social and cultural distinction even as they incorporated different people\u2013have been one of the most common and durable forms of political association. This course will focus on the comparative study of empires from the Romans and the Chinese to the present, and upon the variety of ways in which empires have inspired and constrained their subjects' ideas of rights, belonging, and power. The study of empire expands our ideas of citizenship and challenges the notion that the nation-state is &quot;natural&quot; and necessary.     Students in this course will explore historians' approaches to studying empires. We will investigate how empires were held together\u2013and where they were weak\u2013from perspectives that focus on political and economic connections over long distances and long time periods.     Readings will include historical scholarship on the Roman, Chinese, Mongol, Ottoman, Spanish, Russian, French, British, and American empires, as well as primary sources produced by people living in these and other imperial polities.     Colonial North America      HIST-UA 601     Spring 2012     Eustace     No further information.     Writing Stories / Making History     HIST-UA-569     Spring 2012     Eustace     Who killed the old widow in colonial Rhode Island? Her resentful adult son or her angry Indian servant? What can her death tell us about the tensions of early American patriarchy or the extent of interracial antagonisms in the colonies? Practitioners of microhistory use detailed retellings of the stories of ordinary people and events to try to reveal with sharpened clarity the issues that characterize whole cultures and societies. In this class, we will read a number of model microhistories, primarily based in early America. Doing so will familiarize students with key themes in early American history, while also helping them to think seriously about the strategic choices involved in producing stories and arguments around those themes.     History of Colonial Latin America      HIST-UA 743. 001     Spring 2012     Eineigel     The purpose of this course is to introduce students to the colonial origins of the Latin American region from the sixteenth-century conquest through the early nineteenth-century wars of independence. The course will focus on the ramifications of colonial social conflict and dynamics of gender, race, and class. Course materials will include primary and secondary historical texts and visual sources including film and documentaries. All these sources are intended to stimulate critical thinking and historical imagination about colonial Latin America.     Travel and Discovery in World History     13644 HIST-UA 830     Spring 2012     Ben-Dor     This seminar explores the development of travel and travel narratives in the early modern period, and their relationship to religion, trade, empires, myth, and naval history. Among the topics we will be thinking about are: pilgrimage, geography, cartography, cosmography, ethnography, scholars, missionaries (mostly Jesuits), and more. We will pay special attention to the history of the connection between travel writing and geography in the early modern and modern period before 20th century.     Italian Studies      Italian Colonialism     ITAL UA 167     Spring 2012     Ben-Ghiat     Studies Italian colonialism from the late 19th century through decolonization. Through readings of colonial travel literature, films, novels, diaries, memoirs, and histories, we address the meaning of colonialism within Italian history and culture, the specificities of Italian colonialism, and the legacies of colonialism in contemporary Italy. Syllabus     Journalism      Journalism &amp; Society: Minorities in the Media     JOUR-UA 503.002     Spring 2012     Pamela Newkirk     It has been 40 years since President Johnson\u2019s National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders released its findings on the civil unrest that erupted in urban areas across the nation. The panel, commonly referred to as the Kerner Commission, concluded that we are living in two nations, \u201cblack, white, separate and unequal,\u201d and devoted an entire chapter to the impact the media had on the nation\u2019s race relations. \u201cWe believe that the media have thus far failed to report adequately on the causes and consequences of civil disorders and the underlying problems of race relations,\u201d the report said. It added: \u201cThe media report and write from the standpoint of a white man\u2019s world. The ills of the ghetto, the difficulties of life there, the Negro\u2019s burning sense of grievance, are seldom conveyed.\u201d     The report criticized as \u201cshockingly backward\u201d the industry\u2019s failure to hire, train and promote African Americans. At the time, fewer than five percent of the newsroom jobs in the United States were held by African Americans. Today, despite the progress that\u2019s been made in the hiring and coverage of African Americans and other so-called minorities, many critics say that the Kerner Report findings continue to resonate today. With the report as a backdrop, we will examine the portrayals of racial and ethnic minorities in the media, paying particular attention to African Americans \u2013 the subject of the Kerner Report \u2013 but also others, including Latinos, Asians, women, and gays and lesbians. Syllabus (PDF)     Perspectives on Race and Class     JOUR-GA 1281.002     Spring 2012     Susie Linfield     This seminar examines the ways in which some of the major writers of the 20th and early 21st-centuries have reported on the key and ever-controversial issues of race and class. We will look at how these issues have, historically, been written about, and at how some of today's best reporters and essayists are approaching them; and we will explore how concepts of class and race have changed over the last century. Among the writers whose works we'll study are W.E.B. Du Bois, James Agee, George Orwell, James Baldwin, Jamaica Kincaid, Henry Louis Gates, Jr., William Finnegan, Anthony Lewis., and Orlando Patterson. We'll explore controversial issues such as affirmative action, the increasing polarization of wealth, and the legacy of slavery. This is an intensive reading course with a major final project. Syllabus (PDF)     Linguistics      Language in Latin America      LING-UA 30.001 (8615), SCA-UA 850-001     Spring 2012     Guy     Latin America is so-called because it was colonized by speakers of languages descended from Latin: Spanish, Portuguese and French. These languages have flourished and diversified in the Americas: Spanish is the national language of 19 New World countries, and Portuguese is the language of 200 million Brazilians. They have also changed: Brazilian Portuguese is markedly different from its European source, and Spanish in the Americas shows collective differences from European Spanish, as well as marked contrasts between regions and countries. These changes are partly a result of contact with the other languages currently or formerly spoken in Latin America, especially African languages like Yoruba and Kimbundu, and indigenous (Native American) languages like Quechua, Guarani, and Nahuatl. This course examines the linguistic variety of Latin America. We look at national and dialectal differences in Latin American Spanish and Portuguese; we also consider social diversity in language use: the ways of speaking of people of different class and ethnic backgrounds. Indigenous languages, and contact languages and creoles such as Media Lengua, Papiamentu, and Haitian Creole are also considered. Finally, we study the linguistic history of Latin America: how did the languages spoken there spread, develop, and interact, and what caused the changes that they experienced.     Music     The Art of Listening     MUSIC-UA 3     Spring 2012     Anoosua Mukherjee     This course is intended for students who are interested in the parallels between modern music and visual art. In this class, we will focus our attention on the ways in which listening and seeing are comparable, the relationship that exists between sound culture and visual art in the 20th-Century, and the complex interplay between the disciplines of musicology and art history. We will explore the challenges that modern composers and visual artists face and we will analyze the conceptual, stylistic, and geographical shifts that have taken place. As viewers and critics, we will also address questions about the modalities of making and appreciating music and visual art. How do we attribute meaning to the works that we experience? And how is this process affected by the space in which we encounter these works, namely the gallery and the concert hall?     We will begin our journey at the critical moment of transition from Romanticism to Modernism with an investigation of primitivism in painting and music at the turn of the 20th century. From there, we will proceed chronologically and thematically, taking care to address those pivotal moments such as the rise of feminism, the maturation of popular aesthetics and the evolution of cultural politics. We will examine the work of notable composers, artists and thinkers such as Paul Gaugain, Erik Satie, Aaron Copland, Takashi Murakami, Clement Greenberg and the members of the New York School. The course will conclude with a study of postmodernism and a discussion as to the future of modernism.     Topics in 20th-Century Music: In Search of the Authentic     MUSIC-UA 111     Spring 2012     David Samuels     This course will explore the near-simultaneous emergence of ethnomusicology, the folk music revival, and the historical performance movement as overlapping and interwoven 20th-century responses to Romanticism. All three rejected aspects of earlier aesthetic precepts in a search for new formulations of what might constitute &quot;authentic expression.&quot; We will explore the historical, cultural, and aesthetic importance of these interwoven musical and aesthetic practices.     Politics      Civil Liberties     POL-UA 332     Spring 2012     Khan     Interpretation of the Bill of Rights, the Civil War amendments, and other rights in the U.S. Constitution through the reading of Supreme Court opinions. Topics include freedom of speech and press; free exercise of religion and separation of church and state; the right of privacy; rights of the criminally accused; equal protection of the law against race, gender, and other discrimination; and the rights of franchise and citizenship.     Minority Representation in American Politics     V53.0380     Offered every year.     Explores whether and how racial and ethnic minorities are able to organize effectively and press their demands through the American political system. Specifically, focuses on the political behavior of minority citizens, the relative strength and effect of these groups at the polls and in political office, the theory and practice of group formation as it applies to minority groups, the responsiveness of elected officials, and the legal and constitutional obstacles and instruments that provide context and shape these phenomena.          Wealth, Power, and Status: Inequity in Society     V93.0137     Offered every year.     Sociological overview of the causes and consequences of social inequality. Topics include the concepts, theories, and measures of inequality; race, gender, and other caste systems; social mobility and social change; institutional supports for stratification, including family, schooling, and work; political power and the role of elites; and comparative patterns of inequality, including capitalist, socialist, and postsocialist societies.          Inequality: Social Stratification in a Changing World     V93.9137     Professor Rulikova          Seminar: Authoritarian Regimes &amp; Reversal     G53.3501     Professor Kancha Chandra          Social and Cultural Analysis      Intersections: Gender, Race, and Sexuality in U.S. History and Politics       SCA-UA 230 Can be substituted for SCA-UA 201.     Offered every year.     Draws on the histories of African, Asian, European, Latino, and Native Americans of both genders and many sexualities to explore the complex and important intersection of gender, race, and sexuality in the United States from the 17th century through the 20th, in historically related case studies. Starting in the period of European imperialism in the Americas, examines the ways that gender, race, and sexuality shaped cultural and political policies and debates surrounding the Salem witch trials; slavery, abolition, and lynching; U.S. imperialism in Puerto Rico and Hawaii; the politics of welfare and reproduction; cultural constructions of manliness, masculinity, and citizenship; and responses to the AIDS pandemic in a global context.     Postmodern Travel Fictions      SCA-UA 572     Offered in the spring.     This is a study of travel narratives by post\u2013World War II authors/filmmakers of the Americas. Designed to investigate relationships existing between travel narratives and legacy of colonialism in the Americas; between the concept of \u201cfreedom\u201d embodied in travel writing and the ideology of conquest engraved in historical memory; and between lost idealism of youth and melancholic romps across continents; and between literary representation and the perpetuation of racialized myths about North and South America. Emphasis on gendered dynamic of travel writing. How are notions of freedom and mobility tied to sexuality? Why do the protagonists of novels and films\u2014white, black, Latino, Asian American, or indigenous\u2014\u201cgo West,\u201d South, East, or North? Why do they ping-pong among these geographic and symbolic poles? What are the evaluative meanings assigned to the cartographically given spaces these protagonists choose to visit and these authors/directors choose to revise in their novels and films?     Concepts in Social and Cultural Analysis     SCA-UA 1     Offered every semester.     A gateway to all majors offered by SCA. Focuses on the core concepts that intersect the constituent programs of SCA: Africana Studies, American Studies, Asian/Pacific/ American Studies, Gender and Sexuality Studies, Latino Studies, and Metropolitan Studies. Surveys basic approaches to a range of significant analytical concepts (for example, property, work, technology, nature, popular culture, consumption, knowledge), each one considered within a two-week unit.     Empire for Liberty: The United States in the 19th Century     SCA-UA 231 Identical to HIST-UA 618.     Johnson. Offered every other year.     Tells the story of how the welter of social and cultural tendencies and tensions that characterized the first half of the 19th century in the United States was channeled into a war between two regions, the North and the South. The course is expansive in its framing of the Civil War era and broad in its treatment of the international dimensions of U.S. history. By seeking to place the central event of the century in a history of diplomacy and warfare that also included the War of 1812, the Mexican-American War, illegal invasions of Cuba and Nicaragua in the 1850s, and the Spanish-American War, it attempts to illuminate the imperial causes and consequences of this domestic conflict. And by embedding the conflict over slavery in the United States into the histories of the Haitian Revolution, the Louisiana Purchase, Indian removal, the Atlantic cotton economy, and the hemispheric history of antislavery, it seeks to call into question the nationalist and regionalist framing of the event that has dominated most mainstream accounts.     Ethnicity and the Media     SCA-UA 232     Offered every other year.     Examines media images in relation to the making of ethnic and racial identities in the United States. Surveys some of the theoretical approaches to the study of images, paying particular attention to the intersection of history and ideologies or representation. Looks into the nature and politics of stereotypes; inquires into their reproduction through discourses, representations, and practices; and then moves to a comparative examination of media images in relation to the making of African American, Asian, Latino, and Native American images in the media, looking specifically at changes and continuities in the representation of these four minority groups in the media.     Multiethnic New York     SCA-UA 363     Offered every two years.     As a global city, New York is one of the most ethnically and culturally diverse places in the world. In particular, the growth of migrant populations from Asia, Latin America, and the Caribbean is driving the transformation of New York\u2019s economic, social, and political landscape. This course both explores the global socioeconomic conditions that facilitate and sustain these migrations and examines the cultural practices, imaginaries, and strategies of migrants as they become part of the city.     Race and Rumors of Race     SCA-UA 154     Offered every year.     A multidisciplinary reading, writing, and discussion course on the concept of race. Though the focus is on \u201cblackness\u201d and \u201cwhiteness\u201d in the United States, there is some comparison to Brazil. We also pay some attention to those who have traditionally rejected the racial identities imposed on them and have suffered the consequences. The name of the course is borrowed from the title of a book written by Howard Washington Odum and published by the University of North Carolina Press in 1943.     The Postcolonial City     SCA-UA 166     Offered once every year.     Cities have played an important role throughout African history and in various Afrodiasporic contexts: from the metropolises of ancient Egypt and the urban centers of well-known West African civilizations (such as Ghana, Mali, and Songhai) to cities such as Port-au-Prince, Havana, and Georgetown in the Caribbean and the urban enclaves in the United States. In attending to the way actors constitute wealth and power\u2014in accounting for the way proximity structures interpersonal experiences\u2014this course uses ethnographic, sociological, historical, and literary texts to theorize the Afrodiasporic city. We explore the contours of these urban matrices through special attention to historical categories that prepare us to theorize the way Afrodiasporic populations have experienced and lived history (e.g., the precolonial, the colonial, and the postcolonial). As part of our mission, we consider the historical emergence of the Third World as not simply a broad rubric for African and Asian postcolonies, but instead, a project to reverse the course of European exploitation. Instead of proceeding strictly chronologically, students consider the Afrodiasporic urban experience thematically, through a diverse array of readings.     Approaches to American Studies     SCA-UA 201     Offered every year.     Offers a survey of American studies as a dynamic field of scholarship. Using a schedule of keywords, the course engages key themes and concerns, including war\u2019s role in social and political development, the meaning of borders, the politics of entertainment, public interest in private affairs, and the interplay of goods and labor in shaping national (and transnational) conditions of fulfillment and dignity. It is intended to serve as a gateway to lines of inquiry and analysis currently animating interdisciplinary study of \u201cAmerica\u201d; as an opportunity to relate current debates to respective historical contexts; and as an occasion to interrogate presumptions of the United States\u2019 exceptionality, at a time when its interrelation with broader worlds becomes ever more clear.          W. E. B. Du Bois and the Roots of Critical Race Thinking     SCA-UA 223     Offered every other year.     Addresses the work of the black thinker and leader W. E. B. Du Bois, who has long been acclaimed as the preeminent thinker in the African American tradition. Increasingly, though, he is seen as an indispensable modern intellectual, one whose ideas shape current lives and concerns. In examining Du Bois, we pursue changing ideas of intellectual responsibility in the modern world; clarify the unique way Du Bois merged self-, racial, and historical awareness into critical method; and relate his tendency to see race as a social construction, an approach that is transforming intellectual, social, and cultural life in the United States.          Comparative U.S. Ethnic Studies     SCA-UA 224     Offered every fifth semester.     Serves as an introduction to the interdisciplinary study of race and ethnicity in the United States and to the range of identities and issues inherent in American culture. No previous knowledge of ethnic studies is presumed, but the goal of the class is to create a framework for thoughtful discussion and analysis of race and ethnicity for students to use long after the completion of the class.          The Constitution and People of Color     SCA-UA 366 Identical to POL-UA 801, LWSOC-UA 327.     Offered every year.     Examines how the American legal system decided constitutional challenges affecting the empowerment of African, Latino, and Asian American communities from the 19th century to the present. Topics include the denial of citizenship and naturalization to slaves and immigrants, government-sanctioned segregation, the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II, the prison industry, police brutality, post-9/11 detention issues, and voting rights. Course requirements include attendance at a community function involving constitutional issues, a midterm, and an interactive oral and written final project comparing a present-day issue affecting racial minorities in New York City and proposing measures to collectively address the issue.     Reading Race and Representation     SCA-UA 368     Parikh. Offered every year.     Much contemporary public discourse characterizes race as a problem that some individuals \u201chave,\u201d or, even, a \u201ccard\u201d that some people \u201cplay.\u201d It is rarely recognized as a structural or material dimension that comprises everyday experience and knowledge. In this course, we ask what it means to \u201cread\u201d race in objects, spaces, and events that for the most part do not seem to be \u201cabout\u201d race per se. The course is organized around a series of such topics, which we consider from an interdisciplinary perspective, engaging historical and legal texts, literature, and film, as well as scholarship from anthropology, sociology, and history. Over the course of the semester, we address concepts and themes related to U.S. ethnic studies and critical race theory, including citizenship, rights, segregation, whiteness, colonialism, labor, migration, and alienness. The course provides an introduction to critical American studies as a field of scholarship that challenges our sense of the nation as socially and politically exceptional by asking what is forgotten or excluded in such a self-image.     Gender, Nation, and the Colonial Condition     SCA-UA 480 Prerequisite: SCA-UA 401 or permission of the instructor.     Advanced-level course. An interdisciplinary and comparative inquiry into the historical and contemporary linkages between gender dynamics, the culture of nationalism, and the politics of colonialism on an international scale. Studies different perspectives on the national question\u2014as a liberation movement, as a political ideology, and as a mechanism for inclusion/exclusion.     Latino/a Art and Performance in New York City     SCA-UA 532     Looks at the history of Latino/a art and performance in the context of New York City. In particular, students study Latino/a aesthetic practices within and against the social-political environment of their enactment. Latinos\u2019 role in the continually redefined realm of hip-hop, the extensive history of Latino contributions to the artistic vitality of the Lower East Side, and the theatrical production of Latino-specific community theatres represent a few of the areas that are explored. Students consider contemporary Latino art, and the institutions that support it, from the perspective of the changing Latino demographic of New York City. Furthermore, students examine and analyze the specific ways that artists utilize the city as a site for artistic possibility. This course brings together both an investigation of the aesthetics of Latino performance and an investigation of democratic possibilities of urban space. In addition to the weekly seminar meeting, students are required to attend several perfor-mances, visit art galleries, and execute a research project profiling a particular artist or institution.     Community Empowerment     SCA-UA 613     Offered in the spring.     Empowerment is defined as those processes, mechanisms, strategies, and tactics through which people, as well as organizations and communities, gain mastery over their lives. It is personal as well as institutional and organizational. This course addresses these issues in a wide variety of community settings. The course is designed to be challenging and rewarding to those students interested in helping people work together to improve their lives.          Culture of the City     SCA-UA 620     Offered in the spring.     Urban culture is a complex, fantastic part of daily life, encompassing everything from vaudeville, the public library, opera, and dance to the local bar, social club, and graffiti. By considering cities to be sources of cultural invention, this course explores, through literature, history, social science, and student experience, the evolution of high and popular culture, both modernist and postmodernist. Emphasis is on how cultures create bonds between specific interest groups and on how culture becomes the arena for acting out or resolving group conflict.     Urban Environmentalism     SCA-UA 631     Offered every other year.     Examines some of the many environmental issues facing people living in cities and towns around the world. It focuses on the practical, everyday realities of these issues, why they exist, and what can and should be done to change them. It uses these particularities to consider larger questions about the relationship between human society and the natural world in the urban context. Employing the analytic tools of sociology, the course grapples with ideas from economics, political science, philosophy, geography, and natural science to develop a theoretical framework for understanding environmental issues facing cities today.

Hip Hop and Politics     SCA-UA 280.001     A dominant thrust of contemporary political theory in the U.S. targets the \u201chip hop generation.\u201d From political commentary of Adolph Reed to the comedy of Bill Cosby one finds a critique of the \u201chip hop generation\u201d so dismissive it might be a useful point of departure for further historical and theoretical inquiry. This course mixes a diverse set of readings with music and film to interrogate the specific generational tensions that structure popular and intellectual discourses concerning the \u201chip hop generation\u201d and the perceived demise of progressive politics. (AF, AM, MET)     Sociology      The Family      S     OC-UA 451 Identical to SCA-UA 0724.     Gerson. Offered every year.     Introduction to the sociology of family life.

Offered every year     What is 'race' exactly? Defining the concept presents a real challenge. This class explores what race and ethnicity mean, beginning with historical ideas about human difference. Comparing American beliefs and practices to those found in other societies, we will pay special attention to the particular notions and hierarchies of race that emerge in different times and places. The course also investigates the roles that institutions like the media, the arts, the state, and the sciences play in shaping our understandings of race and ethnicity. We will conclude by considering the predictions that scholars have made about the future of racial stratification in the United States.

The American Ghetto     SOC-UA 139     Offered every spring.     This course examines the concept of the \u201cghetto,\u201d with particular focus on urban communities in the post World War II era. We will use empirical research, literature and other forms of text and media to consider the following questions: What is a ghetto, and what forms has the ghetto taken in the United States? Is there something unique about urban, African-American ghettos? How and why did urban ghettos emerge, and how have they changed over time? What, if any, are the consequences of the American ghetto for racial and economic inequality in America? What role has the state played in the production, maintenance or dismantling of the ghetto, and what role can/should it play?

Morse Academic Plan (MAP)      Texts and Ideas: Topics\u2014On Liberation      MAP-UA 400     Fall 2011     Prof. Watson (English)     What is liberation? What is the political form that allows for maximum freedom, and how is it to be achieved? How have the concepts of freedom, slavery and oppression been articulated by thinkers from Plato to Gandhi? We examine these enduring questions through a wide historical and cultural lens, aiming to understand and map out competing ideas around the conditions for freedom (and unfreedom). To this end, we read seminal works theorizing the relationship between the individual and the collective, ideas of sovereignty, the ideal state and the revolutionary nation, and arguments for violence and non-violence. While grounded in Western thought on the topic, we also pay attention to how the struggles and theorizations of the non-West (the Haitian Revolution, the Algerian and Indian independence struggles, postcolonialism and the Tricontinental) have shaped our inquiry into the nature and promise of liberation. Reading: Epictetus\u2019 Handbook, Plato\u2019s Republic, Equiano\u2019s Life, Shakespeare\u2019s Tempest, Rousseau\u2019s Discourse on Inequality, Mill\u2019s On Liberty, selections from Marx, James\u2019 Black Jacobins, Cesaire\u2019s Discourse on Colonialism, Gandhi\u2019s Hind Swaraj, Freire\u2019s Pedagogy of the Oppressed. syllabus          Texts and Ideas: Topics\u2014The Deliberating Citizens     MAP-UA 400     FALL 2011     Prof. Connolly (Classics)     What capacities help us function as citizens\u2014members of a community larger than ourselves, our friends, and our families? Some argue we must develop our capacities of reason and argument; others advocate a transformed conception of the individual. Some focus on the management of emotions, especially affection and sympathy; still others insist on the importance of belief in God, cultivating the imagination, or remembering the past. We read philosophers (Plato, Locke, Kant, Adam Smith, John Dewey, Hannah Arendt), a historian (Thucydides), and scripture (Genesis and Exodus), and also examine works that address the role of art and music in creating and critiquing civic values: Euripides\u2019 Bacchae, Vergil\u2019s Aeneid, Melville\u2019s \u201cBartleby the Scrivener,\u201d and John Ford\u2019s Westerns. syllabus          Texts and Ideas: Topics\u2014Freedom and Oppression     MAP-UA 400     SPRING 2012     Prof. Kunhardt (History)     Examines the human quest for freedom\u2014freedom from slavery, from sexual oppression, and from the shackling of the mind\u2014as these three came to a crisis in nineteenth century America. We begin with a critical reading of formative biblical texts and ideas; touch down on the passionate thought-world of the American founders; and culminate in a close look at mid-nineteenth century reform efforts, and the ideas of freedom that animated them. Exploring the dawn of biblical humanism, the embrace of the secular, and efforts to widen the circles of inclusion, we pay particular attention to the writings of Abraham Lincoln and his generation, as he and others, both allies and critics, worked to eradicate slavery from American society. Why did the Bible condone slavery, helping Americans justify continuing the practice? In what ways are competing ideas of freedom to be judged? How is the idea of freedom related to that of human equality? Readings: Genesis, Exodus, Psalms, Isaiah, Matthew, Luke; and works by Paine, Jefferson, Madison, Garrison, Douglass, Sumner, Stanton, Anthony, Rose, Emerson, Thoreau, Whitman, Parker, Mill, Ingersoll, Lincoln. syllabus     Cultures and Contexts: Indigenous Australia      MAP-UA 536     Fall 2011     Prof. Myers (Anthropology)     The indigenous people of Australia have long been the subject of interest and imagination by outsiders for their cultural formulations of kinship, ritual, art, gender, and politics, and they have entered into representations as distinctively &quot;Other&quot;\u2014whether in negative or positive formulations of the &quot;Primitive.&quot; These representations\u2014in feature films about them such as Walkabout and Rabbit Proof Fence, in New Age Literature, or museum exhibitions\u2014are now also in dialogue with their own forms of cultural production. At the same time, Aboriginal people have struggled to reproduce themselves and their traditions in their own terms, asserting their right to forms of cultural autonomy and self-determination. We explore the historical and geographical range of Aboriginal Australian forms of social being through ethnographic texts, art, novels, autobiographies, film and other media, and consider the ways in which identity is being challenged and constructed. syllabus     Cultures and Contexts: New World Encounters      MAP-UA 541     Fall 2011     Prof. Ben-Dor Benite (History/Middle Eastern and Islamic Studies)     We discover the ways in which people \u201cdiscovered\u201d the world during the 15th and 16th centuries and ask what gave that period the title: \u201cThe Age of Discovery.\u201d We ask why do people \u201cexplore.\u201d We investigate the ways in which people have created, traveled to, encountered, and reported on \u201cnew-worlds.\u201d We read the accounts of sailors, pirates, merchants, explorers, missionaries and pilgrims. We discuss the themes of history, religion, geography, and imagination and see how they shaped the ways in which people encountered new worlds. We ask how \u201cfrontiers\u201d are created and we focus on issues such as: distances and altitudes, culture, modes of travel, food, sex, music, and many others. syllabus          Cultures and Contexts: New World Encounters      MAP-UA 541     Fall2011     Prof. Lane (Spanish &amp; Portuguese)     What was America before it was called America? How did indigenous cultures understand and document their first encounters with Europeans? We focus on peoples, events, and cultural expressions associated with the conquest and colonization of the Americas, concentrating on three key areas: central Mexico, home to a several pre-Columbian societies, most notably the Aztec Empire, and later the seat of Spanish power in northern Latin America (the Viceroyalty of New Spain); the central Andes, home of the Incas and later the site of Spanish power in southern Latin America (the Viceroyalty of Peru); and finally, early plantation societies of the Caribbean, where the violent history of enslaved Africans in the new world unfolded. On one hand, we explore how those subjugated by conquest and colonialism interpreted, resisted, and recorded their experience. On the other, we ask what new cultural forms emerged from these violent encounters, and consider their role in the foundation of &quot;Latin American&quot; cultures. Readings balance a range of primary documents and art created during the &quot;age of encounter,&quot; including maps, letters, paintings, and testimonials, along with historical and theoretical texts. syllabus          Cultures and Contexts: Globalizing the Americas     MAP-UA 550     Fall 2011     Prof. Khan (Anthropology)     The idea of \u201cAmerica\u201d has long been dissected and reconstituted by a number of ideologues, theorists, policymakers, artists, activists, and ordinary people. Each has sought to craft a new existence that distinguished itself from \u201cOld World\u201d tyranny and tensions, significantly through the creation of imagined communities of identity and belonging, based on various cultural, political-economic, and social criteria. We focus on studies of selected communities (e.g., the concept and experience of race in Brazil, homophobia in the West Indies) and historical events (e.g., 19th-20th century migrations of Asians to Central America) and explore how global visions and international movements as, for example, Negritude, Pan-Americanism, Pan-Africanism, cosmopolitanism, and mestizaje/creolite emerge from local currents and practices. syllabus          Religious studies      Topics in Religious Studies: Religion, Health &amp; Medicine     RELST-UA 650     Spring 2012     Petro Does prayer help the sick heal faster? Does positive thinking ward off illness? Should faith play a role in modern medicine? These questions permeate contemporary discussions of health and medicine. In this course, we examine questions about the proper relationship between religion and medicine by assaying the historical and cultural contexts out of which they have arisen in the first place. That is: Why do we think about religion, health, and medicine today in the ways that we do? To answer this, we trace the religious roots of modern medicine in the nineteenth century alongside the development of new forms of faith healing and alternatuve medicine over the past century. This course will investigate how religious and moral narratives have informed our very understandings of disease, our conceptions of health and the body, and our approaches to contemporary medicine. Readings will focus especially on Christian, Jewish, and New Age currents in the United States and will draw from religious studies, medical anthropology, and the history of medicine.     Undergraduate- Gallatin School of Individualized Study     Indigenous Culture and Cultural Authenticity      IDSEM-UG1684     Spring 2012     Luke Fleming     Even as indigenous groups have found themselves subjugated by centuries of colonialism, they are increasingly finding that they must prove their \u201cindigeneity\u201d to legal, national, or colonial authorities so as to gain territorial, cultural and political rights. Here, national and colonial authorities are concerned to distinguish inauthentic from authentic cultural practice and tradition. But what does it mean for a culture to be \u201cauthentic\u201d? What are the criteria by which cultures are evaluated as legitimate or spurious, and who judges? This course interrogates the relationship between discourses of cultural authenticity and performances of indigenous identity as a lens through which to understand the particularly post-colonial (and post-modern) predicaments of indigenous peoples today. The course will look at how the concept of indigeneity as a globalized identity-category has emerged historically out of conditions of settler colonialism. We examine common strains in colonial, anthropological, missionary and tourist encounters with local linguistic and cultural communities in order to better understand how indigenous peoples have been represented and constructed as social \u201cOthers\u201d, and how indigenous \u201cculture\u201d\u2014as a set of objectified practices\u2014has been discovered, documented, and often prohibited through these encounters. An aim of this course is to understand the double-bind that indigenous groups face: they must publically display signs of \u201ctraditional\u201d indigenous culture in order to gain recognition, but in performing \u201cindigeneity\u201d they are then accused of being fakes. Readings may include: James Clifford, The Predicament of Culture; Jean &amp; John Comaroff, Ethnicity, Inc. ; Kirk Dombrowski, Against Culture: Development, Politics, and Religion in Indian Alaska; Jean Jackson &amp; Warren Kay (eds.), Indigenous Movements, Self-Representation, and the State in Latin America ; and Elizabeth Povinelli, The Cunning of Recognition: Indigenous Alterities and the Making of Australian Multiculturalism .     World Dance     ARTS-UG1212     Spring 2012     Ze'eva Cohen     Dance reflects cultural heritage and is a key to understanding diverse societies. In this arts workshop, students will explore dance as it appears on several continents. Dance can be seen as encoded forms of a society's religious, artistic, political, economic, and familial values. Readings cover issues of globalization, fusion and authenticity. Migration, missionaries, trade routes and the diaspora have led to the creation of new dance forms like &quot;Bollywood&quot; and &quot;Tribal&quot; that are a synthesis of earlier forms. Students will be introduced to different dance forms through selected readings, rich collection of video footage and studio practice often lead by various guest artists. After a brief warm-up, the class will learn simple steps, floor plans and rhythms from the music and dance cultures being studied. Students will chose a dance form as their project and themselves become researchers, performers and creators of new forms.     First-Year Research Seminar: Storytelling and Collective Identity     FIRST-UG733     Spring 2012     Sharon Fulton     Sharing stories may draw together two friends, inspire a political party to action, sway a jury, delight an audience, instruct a congregation, or unite a tribe, race, or nation. In this research and writing course, students will define \u201cthe story\u201d using narrative theory, study the relationship between storytelling and identity formation by analyzing recent psychological findings, and finally learn how stories foster a sense of community by evaluating anthropological and sociological articles. With this critical background, we will examine the formative storytelling in selections from Boccaccio\u2019s Decameron and Geoffrey Chaucer\u2019s Canterbury Tales for a historical perspective before looking at contemporary Native American communities that preserve collective identity through oral histories and stories. We conclude by exploring popular movements such as The Moth live storytelling performances and poetry slams. Students will debate how groups organized to create and appreciate stories offer a sense of identity in the modern world. For their research projects, students may pursue a variety of topics related to storytelling, such as political speech and propaganda; advertising strategies; ancient epic traditions; preaching and religious parable; folklore; mythology; survivors\u2019 tales; and oral history projects. Students may also wish to conduct more research about the literary, psychological, or anthropological approaches to storytelling that we reviewed earlier in the semester.      First-Year Research Seminar: Memory and the City     FIRST-UG737     Joanna Scutts     How does a city \u2018remember\u2019 the past lives of its inhabitants? How do the peculiar characteristics of a city like New York\u2014its population density, cultural diversity, and constant evolution\u2014affect the memories of the individuals and groups who live there? This seminar will explore the interplay between memory and the city through the study and analysis of literary texts, photographs, monuments, maps and movies. A wide range of theoretical readings will provide us with a working critical vocabulary for investigating questions of cultural memory and memorialization. The research paper will explore some aspect of the creation, ideology and reception of a commemorative site in New York City. Sites could include major memorials such as the National September 11 Memorial and Museum, Ellis Island, or the Irish Hunger Memorial; a smaller museum or commemorative site such as the Lower East Side Tenement Museum, the African Burial Grounds, the Stonewall Inn, or the statues in a city park; or an unofficial, virtual, or erased memorial. Writers and artists may include Sigmund Freud, Walter Benjamin, James Young, Art Spiegelman, Jane Jacobs, E.B. White, Susan Sontag, Tony Kushner, and Woody Allen.     Of Fire and Blood: Art-making, Culture and Mythology in Mexico      ARTS-UG1431     Spring 2012     Jaime Arredondo     A rich landscape of art and culture flourished in Mexico for thousands of years beginning with the Olmec civilization at around the second millennium before Christ. With the arrival of the Spaniards in 1519, a new hybrid culture resulted from the fusion of two different worlds, the Iberian and the Native American: a fusion which continues to exist and grow to the present day. This interdisciplinary workshop will closely examine the art, culture and mythology of Mexico, both before and after the conquest, and combine our study of it with hands on art making. The course will begin with a brief overview of the major Mexican muralists, Rivera, Orozco, and Siquieros, and American artists who were influenced by them such as Guston, O'keefe, and Pollock. It will then move chronologically from the Olmec culture occurring 4,000 years ago; Teotihuacan, or the City of the Gods; the Toltecs of Tula, from which emerged Quetzalcoatl the &quot;Feathered Serpent&quot;, a figure that inspired art for centuries; the hyper-religious Aztecs; the large and complex Mayan culture; and lastly, the new hybrid art formed by the synthesis of Spanish and Native American cultures. Topics to be covered will include: astrology/astronomy; religion and shamanism; mythology; and human sacrifice. Museum trips, slide shows, videos, and the reading of rare texts such as the Popul Vuh will also be scheduled.     Cultural Mapping for Social Change     CLI-UG1422     Spring 2012     Jaime Martinez     Where do forces of gentrification intersect with grassroots efforts to preserve the cultural identity of a marginalized community? How are demographics used as a tool by political activists to organize campaigns? How is mapping being used in campaigns to affect social change? This course explores how to use Geographic Information Systems (GIS), a powerful application in mapping technology, as a tool for cultural documentation, community engagement, and public policy analysis. We will explore the effectiveness of GIS as a mapping tool to help understand historical patterns of demographics, and empower community members to become informed citizens in the decision-making process. Specific skills we&amp;apos;ll learn include how to geocode addresses, do a spatial analysis, and use census data to map the racial and income composition of New York neighborhoods. You will also work with local community based organizations to understand how community non-profits are using GIS mapping as a tool for research and strategic planning.     Policy, Community, and Self     CLI-UG1466     Sprig 2012     Eric Brettschneider     Intended to introduce policy, this course will include an internship at a policy and /or advocacy organization. Community building, service integration and child welfare will be featured in readings, discussion, and internships. Through examples such as ethnic matching placements in foster care, zero tolerance approaches to drug abuse, or public financing of political campaigns, students will come to understand how government, schools, gangs, religious institutions and families can, with varying degrees of explicitness and formality, all make policy. Students will at the course conclusion be able to: identify policies within their lives; argue all sides of a policy question; appreciate the importance of evidence; and distinguish implementation from formulation. Readings will include Bowling Alone, by Robert Putnam, and The Lost Children of Wilder, by Nina Bernstein. Students will be helped to connect meetings they attend and the policy concepts taught and discussed in class. The goal is to leave no student unaware of the importance of policy in their own and their community's life. The course will focus on policies that are empowering. Assignments will include an internship journal.     First-Year Research Seminar: Identity and the Cultural Construction of Race and Ethnicity     FIRST-UG738     Spring 2012     Laurie Woodard     Identity: the ways in which we see our selves; the ways in which others see us; the dynamic relationship between these two seemingly distinct and often irreconcilable poles is the underlying theme of this first-year research seminar. We will focus specifically on the ways in which we create, build, rebuild, and live our racial identities in constant dialogue with contemporary American societal constructions of race and ethnicity. Questions we will explore include: what is race? Is it immutable? How do we know it when we see it? How is it distinct from ethnicity? What is gained and/or lost by considering or not considering race today? In what ways do other facets of identity, for example gender, sexuality, and class inform, challenge, reconstruct, or deconstruct our racial identities? We will employ historical, sociological, and cultural lenses. Several short written assignments will help students formulate, research, and respond to questions about racial identity in a longer final research paper. Text will include fiction, plays, theory and criticism including Lorraine Hansberry\u2019s A Raisin in the Sun , The Elephant Vanishes by Haruki Murakami, Julia Alvarez\u2019s How the Garcia Girls Lost Their Accents , \u201cSlavery, Race, and Ideology in the United States by Barbara Fields, Stuart Hall\u2019s \u201cWhat is This Black in Black Popular Culture,\u201d Kip Fulbeck\u2019s What Are You? , Heid E. Erdrich and Laura Tohe collection Sister Nations: Native American Women Writers On Community , Edward Said\u2019s Orientalism , Matthew Jacobson\u2019s Whiteness of a Different Color , and Off with  Her Head!: The Denial of Women's Identity in Myth, Religion, and Culture edited by Howard Eilberg-Schwartz and Wendy Doniger.          First-Year Research Seminar: Adventure Narratives     FIRST-UG730     Spring 2012     Tara Gellene     Adventure narratives have been a popular sub-genre of both fiction and non-fiction for over a century. In such narratives, men and women typically seek out, or are thrust into, unfamiliar spaces where they confront elemental forces. Some adventurers traverse dramatic natural environments--The Arctic and Antarctic Poles, Mt. Everest\u2014while others explore spaces of dramatic cultural difference. We will explore how and why these spaces are represented as staging grounds for conflicts with principles of gender, power, and moral life. Students will write three analytic essays and a longer research essay as they explore some of the following questions: Why are these conflicts desirable to adventurers and to those who admire them? How do these often masculine narratives represent women and domesticity, especially when dealing with women adventurers? How do they represent the people who populate the adventurous landscape? Are adventurers ultimately imperial or anti-social? Theoretical sources may include Immanuel Kant, Sigmund Freud, Mariana Torgovnick, William Cronon, and Frederick Jackson Turner. Other readings may include works by H. Rider Haggard, Rudyard Kipling, Amelia Earhart, Richard Burton, Ernest Shackleton, Jon Krakauer, Joseph Conrad, Cormac McCarthy, Jamyang Norbu, and Charles Johnson.     Narrating Memory, History and Place     IDSEM-UG1568     Spring 2012     Marie Cruz Soto     This course examines how people imagine a place of their own through narrations of the past. The past, after all, is a contested terrain open to divergent interpretations that shape common understandings of places. The meanings bestowed on places dictate who can use them, and how. Thus, the ways through which people narrate the past can transform places. This course, therefore, explores the broad interplay between narrations of memory, history and place. It focuses, however, on the politics of historical narrations in struggles of disempowered communities to claim a place of their own. Course readings include literary and other scholarly texts like Jamaica Kincaid\u2019s A Small Place, Michel-Rolph Trouillot\u2019s Silencing the Past and Michel De Certeau\u2019s The Practice of Everyday Life as well as writings by Edward Said, William Cronon, Diana Taylor, Steven Hoelscher and Doreen Massey.     Barbarians: Ancient Conceptions of the Outsider     IDSEM-UG1593     Spring 2012     Hallie Franks     The conceptions of people outside of one's own culture are complex and multi-layered, and this was as true in the ancient world as it is today. From the conquered Elamites that were depicted on the palace walls of the Neo-Assyrian Assurbanipal, to the mythical Ethiopians of Homer's epics, or to the Gauls with whom Julius Caesar did battle, representations of other kinds of people serve as a backdrop against which a distinctive sense of cultural identity is clarified or reinforced. This seminar explores the representation of &quot;foreign&quot; peoples in the visual arts and literature of the ancient Near Eastern, Greek, and Roman worlds. Using visual (reliefs, vase-painting, sculpture, mosaics, and wall-painting) and written (inscriptions, epic poetry, drama, histories, novels) sources, we pursue the following questions: What role do local ideals play in the construction and definition of another culture? What are the political or social motivations for the representations of foreigners in ancient art and literature? To what extent does the definition of an &quot;other&quot; reflect an already defined identity, and to what extent is identity constituted by imagining difference? Readings may include Simone de Beauvoir, Clifford Geertz, Euripides Medea, Aeschylus The Persians, Herodotus, Caesar The Gallic Wars, Heliodorus Aethiopika (The Ethiopian Romance).     Between Rights and Justice in Latin America     IDSEM-UG1580     Spring 2012     Alejandro Velasco     What is the relationship between human rights and social justice? Do both always operate in conjunction? Are they ever mutually exclusive\u2014one sacrificed at the expense of the other? This course explores key questions around the theory and practice of human rights promotion, surveying specialized literature and founding documents to consider the promise and challenge of existing human rights frameworks as they work for, but sometimes clash with, the promotion of social justice. We ask, are there universal rights? If so, how are these defined, and by whom? What is the relationship between &quot;political&quot; and &quot;human&quot; rights, between individual and collective rights? Can human rights be in conflict, and if so, how are such conflicts to be resolved? In regions rife with inequality\u2014political, social, and economic\u2014is promoting a global human rights agenda unrealistic, or more necessary than ever? After exploring these general questions, we will focus on Latin America, in particular on Argentina, Guatemala, Chile, Bolivia, Colombia, and Mexico. How do human rights struggles in these countries change our view of the prevailing human rights regime? How do legacies of colonialism in these countries affect both the protection and violation of human rights in the present? Do these countries reveal a political tension social justice and human rights? Readings will draw from Bartolom\u00e9 de las Casas, Ariel Dorfman, Elena Poniatowska, Alison Brysk, and Greg Grandin, among others.     American Narratives I: American Literature, Race and Politics     IDSEM-UG1592     Spring 2012     George Shulman     The premise of this course is that there is no great political philosophy in the American tradition\u2014the Federalist Papers do not rival Plato or Marx\u2014but that profound thinking about politics does occur\u2014in the literary art of Melville, Faulkner, Ellison, Mailer, and Morrison among others. Moreover, formally &quot;political\u201d writers, like Madison and Hamilton, present a world that seems antithetical to the world presented by, say, Melville and Morrison: one depicts rational bargaining and self-interested contracts among men in markets and legislatures, whereas the other depicts racial and sexual violence, rape and slavery, in claustrophobic domestic spaces or in nature on frontiers. One depicts rationality and progress, the other madness and tragedy. The literature thus makes visible what is made invisible by prevailing forms of political science and American political thought, not only the constitutive power of race, gender, and sex, but also the deep narrative forms structuring the culture. We therefore ask several basic questions. First, what accounts for this difference and how shall we understand it? Second, what can we learn about (American) political life if we read literature as a form of political theory? But third, do we lose what is precious about literary art if we reduce it to an argument about politics? Or is the literary/aesthetic character of a work\u2014the ways it uses language and narrative to create both ambiguity and meaning\u2014an important part of what it can teach us about politics and political theorizing? To pursue these questions we focus on Alexis de Tocqueville\u2019s Democracy in America , Herman Melville\u2019s Moby Dick , and Toni Morrison\u2019s Playing in the Dark and Beloved .     Health and Human Rights in the World Community     IDSEM-UG1641     Spring 2012     Allen Keller     This course focuses on the relationship between health and human rights. First, it provides an overview of human rights violations in the world and it offers an analysis of the health consequences of human rights abuses. Second, it explores how individual and community health can be improved by protecting and promoting human rights. Third, it evaluates the ethical obligations of health professionals in the face of human rights violations, and it explores their role in caring for the victims. Intended for non-science as well as science majors, we use presentations and discussion to explore the link between health and human rights. Readings include Claude and Weston, Human Rights in the World Community: Issues and Actions, and Martin and Rangaswamy, eds., Twenty Five Human Rights Documents.     Dangerous and Intermingled II: Subaltern New York     IDSEM-UG1667     Spring 2012     Jack Tchen     In the world of political moralists, intermingled New York has and still represents the epitome of danger and evil about the American experiment\u2014the public intermixture of classes, genders, races, sexualities, spiritualisms, and the-devil-knows-what-else!#? As elite Protestants created a refined European-affected \u201chigh brow\u201d culture, they also created myriad \u201cothers\u201d\u2014a transgressive, lowly polyglot city of shadows, miscegenation, and impurity. The docks, the Bowery, The Five Points, Greenwich Village, LES/Loisaida, Chinatown, and Harlem were all forged against the repressed imaginings of the powerful and the distinguished. This peoples\u2019 Gotham, this disdained intertwined underworld of music, slang, jokes, songs, stories, foodways, and marvels of people will be the focus of this advanced research seminar. Course materials will include: Wallace &amp; Burrow\u2019s Gotham, Burn\u2019s documentary New York, Smith\u2019s Decolonizing Methodologies, and a course reader. Research walks and visits off campus will be held during lab hours on Fridays. Students will learn how to conduct a case study using primary sources.     * This professor is reccomended     The Politics of Food     IDSEM-UG1674     Spring 2012     Myisha Priest     In this class we will explore food as an explicitly political space, one that demarcates racial and cultural boundaries and shapes identities. We will address these core concerns, in part, by engaging works of literature that examine the relationship between food and the expression of culture, history and trauma. Course texts may include novels like Nervous Conditions, Breath Eyes Memory, Beloved , and Black Boy . Nowhere is food more politically and culturally charged than in NYC, so the city will also be our classroom. We negotiate the porous yet enduring boundaries of race and culture as often as we eat, walk or shop in Little Italy or Little India, Koreatown or Chinatown, Le Petite Senegal or Harlem. None of these places or cuisines is in any way associated with contemporary American food culture, which has historically harkened to preserving what is &quot;authentically&quot; American. These difference can be understood as forms of exclusion as well as cultural preservation\u2014 but either way they are lines of demarcation that make legible forms of power. We will use a variety of texts to investigate dynamics of power represented in and by food. Who is food for? How does the representation of food reify and negotiate the boundaries of race and culture?     Cross-Cultural Encounters on the Renaissance Stage      IDSEM-UG1687     Spring 2012     Valerie Forman     The Renaissance witnessed both an explosion in theatrical innovation and an increasingly global world--the beginnings of global trade, the \u201cdiscovery\u201d of the New World, and bouts of both conflict and cooperation among the world\u2019s powers. By reading plays that stage encounters between Europeans from different countries and of different religions, between Europeans and the Ottoman Empire, among natives of \u201cIndia,\u201d and among Europeans, Native Americans, and African slaves, we will explore how and why the stage became such a significant site for the representation of cross-cultural encounters. Some questions we will explore include: how do these plays represent conflict\u2014between self and other and over goods and territory\u2014and what possibilities for reconciliation do they imagine? How do these plays understand the differences encountered as a result of travel, trade, and exploration? Why did the theatre develop a fascination with the exotic (for example, with cannibals and pirates)? In what ways did what it means to be European, Christian, or even a good wife or husband get defined and altered by these encounters? In keeping with the theme of encounters, this course will stage a number of creative encounters from the period: between works from different European nations; between plays and the prose works with which they were in dialogue; and between written and visual materials, for example, engravings of the New World and its inhabitants. In the cases where translations exist, we will also read accounts of how non-Europeans viewed Europe. Likely authors include, Shakespeare, Marlowe, Cervantes, Montaigne, Behn, Fletcher, DeBry, and Massinger.     Writing your Ancestry     K30.1336     Nancy Agabian     This workshop will give students the opportunity to practice elements of creative nonfiction through a multi-faceted approach to writing on ancestry and cultural heritage. The main goal will be a written exploration of the self to consider wider issues of history, community, identity, place, and family. The major assignments will be structured around various tasks: a personal essay will help to define themes and set scenes in the present; memoir writing will involve mining your memories of family to identify possible leads into the past; a reported piece will entail interviews of family members, archival research, and/or a visit to an ancestral site. These essays will be developed gradually with the help of shorter at-home assignments and in-class exercises on style, structure, and strategy. Revision will be built into the process, and we will read each other's work and give supportive feedback throughout the semester. Likely authors to be read and discussed for inspiration will include Ian Frazier, Honor Moore, Lawrence Weschler, Sarah Vowell, Bliss Broyard, Brenda Lin, Tara Bray Smith, and D.J. Waldie     Native American Film and Video: Performing Self-Representation through Media      ARTS-UG 1604     This course will study the ways that Indigenous peoples and independent Native artists in the Americas have turned to film, video, and digital arts to dispute ethnographic and Hollywood imagery, and create their own audiovisual media \u201cfrom within.\u201d We will explore notions of Third and Fourth cinema, indigenous self-representation, collective authorship, Indigenous people\u2019s representation, in mainstream films, photography, and exhibition sites such as museums. We will research specific authors and media projects, and discuss the roles of the institutions that present this work through exhibitions, events, festivals, and publications. The course features guest lecturers and requires class viewing of films and videos that are otherwise unavailable on the market. Central readings may include Through Navajo Eyes: An Exploration in Film and Communication and Anthropology (1997), by Sol Worth and John Adair, Unthinking Eurocentrism: Multiculturalism and the Media (1994), by Ella Shohat and Robert Stam, Wiping the War Paint Off the Lens: Native American Film and Video (2001), by Beverly Singer, and Global Indigenous Media: Cultures, Poetics and Politics, by Pamela Wilson and Michelle Stewart (2008). Films will include works by Victor Masayesva, Jr. (Hopi), Dante Cerano (Purepecha), Zacharias Kunuk (Inuit), and works from the Video in the Villages project in Brazil.     Oral History, Cultural Identity, and the Arts     K40.1045     Professor Sloan     Oral History is a complex process in the creation of artistic projects across the disciplines: documentary film, theatre, book arts, exhibitions, web art, public radio, etc. This course offers training in interviewing and editing techniques, and looks at the impact of &quot;truth-telling&quot; on the people we interview, their families and friends, ourselves and the culture at large. Research explores the balance in accurately reflecting the realities and integrity of the people represented while staying true to the vision of the artist/creator and addresses some of the following questions: Who has a right to a story? How do we represent people with different experiences than our own? What are the nuances in understanding needed for representing people in our own culture and identity or those from a different cultural or class background? Readings include (but are not limited to): Greg Halpern's Harvard Works Because We Do; Art Spiegelman's Maus I &amp; II; Ira Berlin, et.al (eds) Remembering Slavery; Warren Lehrer and Judith Sloan's Crossing the BLVD; Jim Fricke and Charlie Ahearn's Oral History of Hip-Hop's First Decade Yes Yes Y'all; as well as works by Studs Terkel, Anna Deveare-Smith, and articles and theory on oral history as a field of study. Guest lectures by filmmakers, book artists, theatre artists as well as viewing of films and listening to public radio projects will be included in the weekly class sessions. For final projects students create collaborative or solo work in the discipline of their own training; theatre, artist books, photography, poetry, music, radio, audio art, film or video.     First-Year Interdisciplinary Seminar: What is &quot;Development?&quot;     FIRST-UG 76     From Bono to indigenous community activists in the Amazon, everyone is talking about 'development.' The term, however, means different things to different people and has a long and contentious history. This class provides an introduction to the study of international development and poverty from an interdisciplinary perspective. To begin, it examines the different measures of the state of development, from conventional economic metrics like Gross Domestic Product to notions of &quot;Development as Freedom.&quot; Building on this, it then explores some of the most influential contemporary voices in the process of development. Of central importance here will be a consideration of the central development actors, including multilateral institutions like the UN and World Bank, as well as states, NGOs, and community groups. Finally, it will explore some of the key themes in contemporary development policy, including gender, the environment, and human rights. The goal is to provide a clear sense of the chief objects, processes, actors, and policies of international development in order to grapple with the important stakes held by these different approaches to combating global poverty. Readings may include: Amartya Sen, Joseph Stiglitz, Jeff Sachs, Bill Easterly, and Dambisa Moyo          Media, Culture, and Communication      Space and Place in Human Communication     MCC-UE 1002     This course will build on a core concept of Lewis Mumford who understood media ecology as a component of spatial and urban ecology. Emphasis will be given on how space socially organizes human meaning and on the inscription of space. How do people, through their practices and their being in the world, form relationships with the locales they occupy (both the natural world and the build environment)? How do they attach meaning to spaces to create places? And how do the experiences of inhabiting, viewing, and hearing those places shape their meanings, communicative practices, cultural performances, memories, and habits? Course themes include: mapping and the imagination; vision and space, soundscape, architecture and landscape, new media and space/time compression; space and identity; spatial violence; spatialization of memory.     Youth Media: Communication, Community, &amp; Social Change     MCC-UE 1017     This course explores the theory, practice, and impact of the non-profit youth media organizations and school-based programs working in this field locally and around the world. Students will also use media production to conduct fieldwork in the New York City area that further builds the subfields of youth media/youth development, teaching and learning, and community building. Research projects will document and investigate how youth media is supporting the development of young people's capacities for 21st century skills of digital communication, critical literacy, and civic engagement.     Media and Identity     MCC-UE 1019     Study and exploration of the relationship between the media and the construction of both individual and social identities. Examines the ways in which human identity is increasingly influenced by media representations and the social and personal consequences of this trend.     Race and Media     MCC-UE 1025     America's founding principles of equality and equal opportunity have long been the subject of interpretation, debate, national angst and widespread (often violent) conflict. No more is this the case than when we talk about the issue of race. While biological notions of race have lost their scientific validity, race remains a salient issue in American life as a social and political reality sustained through a wide variety of media forms. The broad purpose of this course is to better understand how notions of race have been defined and shaped in and through these mediated forms. Specific attention may be given to the ways that race is articulated in forms of mass media and popular culture.      Screening History: The Construction of American History in Hollywood Films     MCC-UE 1140     This course explores the ways in which popular Hollywood films construct the historical past, the ensuing battles among historians and the public over Hollywood\u2019s version of American history, and the ways that such films can be utilized as historical documents themselves. We will consider films as products of the culture industry; as visions of popularly understood history and national mythology; as evidence for how social conflicts have been depicted; and as evidence of how popular understanding and interpretations of the past have been revised from earlier eras to the present.     * This course is recommended     Postcolonial Visual Culture     MCC-UE 1403     This courses addresses how colonialism and postcolonialism are shaped and mediated through images and the gaze. The dynamics of colonial history motivate and shape colonial and postcolonial perceptions and influence their patterns of global circulation when the boundary between the world out there and the nation at home is increasingly blurred. We will survey a range of image texts through various media (photography, television, cinema) and sites (war, the harem, refugee camps, prisons, disasters): nationalist mobilization, counter-insurgency, urban conflict, disaster management, the prison system, and the war on terror.     Tisch- Dance      History of Dance     DANC-UT.106     A study of the function of dance as art and ritual, social activity, spectacle, and entertainment through a survey of ethnic dance forms and the history of European tradition.     Tisch- Cinema Studies Cinema Studies often has relevant courses, but posts new courses late in the semester. See their site for more information.     Tisch- Art and Public Policy      Creative Response: Public Interventions     ASPP - UT/GT.1028/ 2028     Alfredo Jaar     This intensive workshop considers visual practices as an integral part of a network of social and cultural relationships. It considers the city of New York as laboratory: a social, political and cultural landscape where participants will be encouraged to create their own interventions in a series of intensive exercises.     We will consider context, site, audience and presentation (communication) as an essential, structural aspect of the artistic production process. The objective of the workshop is to offer a first approach and basic understanding of the complexities of interventions in public spaces. Different contemporary strategies will be presented and analyzed in class, with a particular focus on critical and alternative productions in the fields of visual arts and architecture.     The sessions will be structured integrating both practical and theoretical considerations and will encourage students to explore ways in which conceptual ideas can be developed creatively. This course is intended for students interested in working outside of the white cube and in strategies of communication in public space.     Language as Action     ASPP - UT/ GT.1070/ 2070     Kathy Engel     This is a close reading and craft writing class that will look at the poetry, essays, and narratives of writers who traverse forms, their work inextricably related to community and social engagement. We will look at the question of what constitutes \u201caction\u201d or \u201cactivism\u201d and how writing and language can be those transformative engagements, deconstructing clich\u00e9\u2019s that suggest the contrary. At the same time we will discuss the relationship of writing to other forms of action and the complex ways conditions mandate form. We will explore the work from the perspectives of craft, impact, identity, \u201cscripting,\u201d community, the relationship of personal to political, memory, and boundary breaking, to begin with. We will examine the texts to understand the connection to community and activism, looking at the complexities and conflicts that arise in the context of making art and working to make an impact on public life. We will interrogate questions of quality and aesthetics, popular culture, compromise, truth, authenticity, voice, beauty, responsibility, fact, and translation as a world view in the 21st Century.     While studying the work of June Jordan, Martin Espada, Mahmoud Darwish, Alexis De Veaux, Eduardo Galeano, D.A. Powell, Gloria Anzaldua, Joy Harjo, Patricia Smith, Muriel Rukeyser, Adrienne Rich, Cornelius Eady, Valzhyna Mort, Suheir Hammad, and Tina Chang, the students will concurrently delve deeply into their own writing processes.     We will explore questions related to the work of the scribe, the teller or artist, to a given community, event, and history itself, the ethical issues involved in \u201ctruth\u201d and \u201cstory,\u201d how writers and social narrators deal with plural and counter narratives and some of the problems inherent, and the many traditions within telling. We will examine questions of voice, power, silence, the question of \u201cpersona\u201d writing, inhabiting another\u2019s experience.     The Media of Displacement: Postcolonial Culture     H48.1055     We are here because you were there\u201d has become a common slogan for postcolonial diasporas in the metropolitan \u201ccenters\u201d of the West. With the growing numbers of immigrants and refugees from the Middle East/North Africa in cities such as London, Paris, Berlin, New York, Los Angeles, Montreal, and Sao Paulo, the construction of \u201cus\u201d versus \u201cthem\u201d can no longer correspond to one geography, simplistically imagined as \u201cover there.\u201d This seminar will study questions of displacement as represented, mediated and narrated in diverse cultural realms, especially cinema, media, visual culture and writing. How such texts have confronted exclusionary and essentialist discourses with a rich cultural production that foregrounds a complex understanding of such issues as \u201chome,\u201d \u201chomeland,\u201d \u201cexile,\u201d \u201chybridity\u201d and \u201cminorities.\u201d We will look at the past few decades of artistic work within the larger context of post-independence and globalization politics. We will mainly look examine the ways films/videos, novels, memoirs, and visual work have represented dislocations that have come in the wake of colonial partitions, and of regional, ethnic and religious conflicts; as well as into the ways they challenge traditional genres about immigration, transcending the neat divisions among the social documentary, the ethnographic media, the experimental autobiography, and the fictional narrative. We will also examine these texts in relation to contemporary cyber diasporic practices, problematizing especially such issues as \u201cnostalgia\u201d and \u201creturn\u201d in the context of new communication technologies.     Art and Art Professions      Interdisciplinary Undergraduate Projects in Studio Art: Building an Activist Knowledge Base     ART-UE 1985     This course is for students who wish to learn about &amp; study the effectiveness of a wide range of activist practices &amp; techniques. They should be largely self-directed &amp; self-motivated, as there are no sophisticated research or action tools thus far available for much of the course material. Creativity will play a large role, especially when examining creative resistance actions that took place with minimal or no documentation, which is the case for most of them. Course goals are to build useful databases &amp; acquaint students with the depth &amp; breadth of activist practice.     Interdisciplinary Undergraduate Projects in Studio Art: Visionaries and Saboteur     ART-UE 1982     This interdisciplinary course focuses on how artists engage with ?institutions? in contemporary culture. These many ?institutions?: fashion, the museum, the store, the government, the home, &amp; music among them, are all structures, which make up the world in which we live. We will look at how artists utilize these structure as a means to change the way we experience life &amp; living. Each week will be geared towards a specific institution through slide lectures, screenings of films, field trips, &amp; guest artists. There will also be presentations &amp; critiques of student work as well as special topics of interest.     Postcolonial Practices in Studio Art     ART-UE 0801     Exploration of post-colonial theories of identity, representation, &amp; culture as they are expressed in contemporary art. Students will meet regularly with visiting African painters, sculptors, &amp; designers in intimate workshop settings for lectures, critiques, &amp; demonstrations. The class will include field trips to galleries as well as artists\u2019 residences &amp; studios in urban &amp; rural settings.      Graduate Level Courses     Anthropology      New Formations of Property     ANTH-GA 3393     Spring 2012     Geismar.     This class traces the history of anthropological engagements with property and uses this legacy to understand recent shifts in property forms and regimes. Topics include alternative currencies, indigenous interventions into cultural and intellectual property; the impact of massive social change (eg postsocialsm, digitization) on property forms and the constituion of new objects of property (cells, patents, databases etc).     Colonialism, Nationalism, and Modernity     ANTH-GA 3390.2.     Spring 2012     Abercrombie     This course asks: How can an anthropology with roots in the colonial knowledge regime hope to conspire in emancipatory projects that empower not only third world or politically-correct academics in US universities but the peoples of former European colonies and the marginalized indigenous peoples in them?     Culture and Media I     ANTH-GA 1215     Spring 2012     Ginsburg     This course offers a critical revision of the history of the genre of ethnographic film, the central debates it has engaged around cross-cultural representation, and the theoretical and cinematic responses to questions of the screen representation of culture, from the early romantic constructions of Robert Flaherty to current work in film, television, and video on the part of indigenous people throughout the world.     Cultural Citizenship     ANTH-GA 3394.     Spring 2012     Rosaldo     Cultural Citizenship concerns the right to be different and belong, in a participatory democratic sense. The term citizenship concentrates on the ordinary language definition found in the phrase full citizenship as opposed to second-class citizenship. The term cultural refers to vernacular definitions of what confers entitlement. Entitlement in this sense ranges from economic factors to notions of dignity and respect.     Politics of Latino and Latin American Representation     ANTH-GA 3391.     Spring 2012     Davila     This course offers a look at some of the politics of representation at play in different spaces where Latino/Latin American cultures are being shaped, deployed and intrumentalized across the Americas with an eye to the larger social, political and historical trends they help signal. Particular attention will be paid to the different racial and nationalist ideologies framing these politics and to the cultural hierarchies affecting the institutional spaces in which Laitno/Latin American cultures are being produced and contested.     Video Production Seminar I, II     ANTH-GA 1218, 1219. Prerequisites: ANTH-GA 1215, H72.1998, and permission of the instructor.

Intermediate-level study of literary and theoretical works pertaining to the eras of decolonization and globalization.     Topics in Postcolonial Theory     ENGL-GA 2901     Gajarawala, Sunder Rajan, Watson, Young.     Introduces M.A. and Ph.D. students to advanced study of postcolonial theory, its forms of philosophical and cultural analysis, and its theoretical advances and difficulties.     The Politics of Culture     ENGL-GA 2934 Parikh.     This course considers human rights discourses as an interpretive framework for literary and cultural production, emphasizing perspectives from postcolonial and critical American studies.          Journalism      Storytellers     JOUR-GA 1231.001     Spring 2012     Great stories are shaped by talented, reckless, funny, arrogant and often misanthropic writers and reporters working at the height of their craft. In this class, we will study how world-shaking historical events and everyday experiences alike can be crafted into original journalistic narratives. We will concentrate on the writer's angle of approach to the subject - his or her \u00d2voice\u00d3 - which is made more or less convincing through his or her control over language and the depth and range of his/her reporting. The first half of each class will consist of close readings of nonfiction narratives on Balkan wars, acid trips, nervous breakdowns, rock and roll concerts, a sarin gas attack in the Tokyo subways, a visit to the Iowa State Fair and assorted other subjects by some of my favorite journalists and novelists including Tom Wolfe, Joan Didion, David Foster Wallace, Denis Johnson, Rebecca West, Ryszard Kapucinski, Haruki Murakami, Gabriel Garcia Marquez and Joseph Mitchell. Each class will begin promptly at 12:30 PM and will be divided between an hour and thirty minute discussion of the assigned reading and an hour and fifteen minute discussion of your written work. Latecomers will be greeted with derision. We will break at 2 PM for afternoon snack. We will also enjoy visits from enlivening and informative guests from Harper's, The New Yorker and other high-class venues, who can answer any questions you might have about reporting and editing, and who will help you shape your ideas with an eye towards publishing your own work. Syllabus (PDF)     Music      Ethnomusicology: History and Theory     MUSIC-GA 2136     Spring 2012     Jason Stanyek     A broad intellectual history of the discipline, surveying landmark studies and important figures. Examines major paradigms, issues, and frameworks in ethnomusicology. The relation of ethnomusicology to other disciplines, and the relations of knowledge and power that have produced them. Serves as an introduction to the field of ethnomusicology.     Politics      Pol Econ Sem: The Moral Economy     POL-GA.3400.002     Spring 2012     Aziz     Back in the 1970s, the moral economy concept was used to describe protest movements rooted in anti-capitalist sentiment that often accompanied state making, commercialization of agriculture and colonialism. Moral economists explained such protest movements in terms of \u201ca (presumed) loss of subsistence, security and welfare by the peasantry during these changes. They interpreted such violence as a defensive reaction against capitalism and as an attempt to restore the (precapitalist) structures that provided peasant welfare\u201d (Popkin 1979: 5). But in fact this concept has evolved considerably since then and can even be applied to what\u2019s going on today with the     Occupy Wall Street movement.     Since Thompson first coined the moral economy in his 1971 study of 18th century     English crowds protesting food prices, this term has reappeared in anthropologist and political scientist Scott\u2019s 1976 study of the peasant movements against capitalism in     Vietnam. More recently, political scientists and sociologists (e.g. Svallfors 2006; May     2003; Posusney 1993) have re-conceptualised the moral economy more generally in terms of the rights and responsibilities of citizens as it relates to public policies and  institutions. It has been applied to varied case studies, including social welfare in     Europe, Nigerian food systems, economic practices in Kyrgyzstan and anti-state     labour protests in Egypt and Algeria.     Underlying this multidisciplinary body of literature is the notion that \u201cthe governing powers [have] broken the unspoken contract [of the moral economy], the idea of the rights to which all citizens were entitled, that was firmly rooted in society\u201d (Svallfors 2006: 1). This course will investigate the \u201cmoral economy\u201d and related unrest from the eighteenth century to present-day. We will take into consideration various case studies from around the world, including the most recent examples \u2013 the civil unrest during the 2007-2008 global economic crisis and the current Occupy Wall Street movement in many countries. We will also be critical of the moral economy concept by considering how useful it is as an academic construct and explanatory tool.           Cultural and Social Analysis      Seminar: Visual Studies     AFRS-GA 2303     This seminar explores how the trope of \u201cblackness\u201d is mediated over a range of ideas, images, and expressions of social difference in cinema. Screenings and readings examine how popular cinema, ranging from black independence to the commercial \u201cmainstream,\u201d deals not only with issues of race and color, but how these issues intersect, and interact, with other social categories of difference(s) mainly related to class, sexual orientation, and gender but including many others. The course explores such issues as seeing beyond the \u201cblack-white binary\u201d model of race relations; gendered perspectives on \u201cblackness\u201d and black women\u2019s filmmaking; the cultural and political dynamic between blackness and gayness on the screen; and issues of class, caste, and \u201ccolorism\u201d in cinema. The course also examines a number of ideas and theories related to the material, including passing, double consciousness, unmarked difference, and creolization.     Colloquium in Women\u2019s History: Race and Reproduction     AFRS-GA 2600     From the policies, priorities, and perversions of slave owners to the pronatalist campaigns of colonial Africa, to the family planning programs that are a hallmark of liberalism and development in the postcolonial world, and, most recently, to the promotion of assisted reproduction technologies among western elites, race and reproduction have always been among the primary axes on which large-scale political, economic, cultural, social, and intellectual processes are configured. Because reproduction connects the intimate experiences of individuals to larger historical structures and forces and because reproduction is such a fundamental (if varied) biological and social experience, this topic in particular lends itself to comparative work. This course explores issues in the history of race and reproduction, focusing primarily (though not exclusively) on American and African contexts. This cross-cultural breadth helps students to consider the relationship between biological experiences (which are often portrayed as universal) and sociocultural context. Through readings, students consider how different disciplinary orientations (social history, medical anthropology, feminist theory, art history, etc.) approach women\u2019s history both methodologically, theoretically, and in terms of narrative and analytic strategies.     Topics in Postcoloniality     AFRS-GA 2645     Explores and interrogates the notion of the \u201cpostcolonial\u201d in relation to certain key aspects of contemporary African and/or Caribbean societies, cultures, and histories. Individual areas of investigation include theories of Africa and Africans, Caribbean literary theory, modern postcolonial theory and its applicability and relevance to recent developments in the African continent and its diaspora, new identity formations, African and Caribbean cultural studies, nationalism and the nation-state, creolization, and theories of resistance.     Pensamiento Latinoamericano     AMST-GA 3212, Same as SPAN-GA 2968     Spring 2012     Mary Louise Pratt     This course will examine major projects in Latin American social and cultural theory and analysis since dependency and development theory, with a focus on the last twenty years. Latin America shares the modern state form with the rest of the global geopolitical system; it shares with the global south a history of imperial intervention, colonial occupation, and neocolonial extraction; with the rest of the Americas it was the object of Europe\u2019s first wave expansion in the 15-16th centuries; its history includes large-scale autochthonous (pre-c olumbian) societies whose forces continue to unfold in the present. What intellectual fields arise f rom the interaction of these geographies, social forms, and historical forces? What objects of study and analytical imperatives have they produced? What challenges does Latin American thought pose to the intellectual norms of metropolitan thought? Topics to be explored include: anatom\u00eda del desarrollismo (Cardoso y Faletto); cr\u00edtica del estado liberal (eg. Rodriguez, Nugent); paradojas de la modernidad (eg. Schwarz, Dussel, Franco); etnograf\u00eda del autoritarismo (eg Garret\u00f3n, Eltit); diagn\u00f3stica del occidentalismo (eg. Bonfil Batalla, Flores Galindo); g\u00e9nero y ciudadan\u00eda (Oyarz\u00fan, Olea, Monsiv\u00e1is); pensamiento ind\u00edgena(ejMamani, Paredes); crueldad, basurizaci\u00f3n y asco neoliberales (Franco, Santiesteban). Readings will be in Spanish and English; class discussion will be in Spanish and English. Students must have advanced speaking, reading, and comprehension skill in both languages to take this course. Background in cultural or social l theory is also required.     Gender, Race, and Imperialism     AMST-GA 2303     Roots of Race Thinking     AMST-GA 2326     Comparative Ethnic Studies     AMST-GA 2328     Human Rights and Cultural Politics     AMST-GA 2330     Race and Reproduction     AMST-GA 2600     Sociology      Social Stratification and Inequality     SOC-GA 2137.     Jackson, Jasso, Jennings, Torche.     Assesses the research and theoretical work on economic inequality and classes in the social sciences. Reviews important classic contributions (including Marx, Weber, and Schumpeter), compares competing approaches (including Marxist, conflict, functionalist, elite, and status attainment theories), and surveys modern directions of development (such as labor market studies, socialist inequality, the role of the state).          Social Movements     SOC-GA 2153     Goodwin, Manza     Surveys controversies and research issues and topics in social movements. Topics include classical, economic, resource mobilization, political process, and political opportunity theories of social protest movements; so-called new social movements; and issues of identity formation. Analyzes recent thinking and research concerning the consequences or impact of social protest movements, including the U.S. civil rights movement, labor movements, neopopulist movements, and revolutionary movements.          Political Sociology     SOC-GA 2441     Chibber, Ertman, Goodwin, Manza.     Surveys controversies and research topics in political sociology. At the center of these investigations are states and power. Explores concepts of power and the theories of the state. Topics are the formation of states, political institutions, and social policies and the determinants and outcomes of collective action.          Sociology of Education     SOC-GA 2407     Arum, Heyns.     Sociological perspective on American education. Topics include the social context of socialization and learning; the effects of schooling; desegregation and social inequality; teachers as unionized professionals; school politics and bureaucracy; and selected policy issues confronting American education. Emphasis is on American institutions, although comparative perspectives are discussed.          Sociology of the Family     SOC-GA 2451     Gerson, Stacey, Wu.     Systematic introduction to the literature on family and kinship. Includes classical theories and examines the major areas of contemporary research. Topics include family formation, social reciprocity, family dissolution, the history of the family, and a comparison of general theoretical paradigms.     Spanish and Portuguese      Cultural History of Latin America     SPAN-GA 9946     This courses consists of three thematically organized modules, plus introductory and concluding sessions. It is designed to allow students to explore a wide range of cultural materials, including literature, visual culture, urban space, and historical and political texts. It will emphasize issues of cultural identity, encouraging students to make connections between past debates and those of today. The approach is multidisciplinary, ranging across literature, performance studies, cultural studies, visual culture, and history. The objective of the course is to ensure that all students develop a high level of cultural literacy about the Spanish-speaking world.          Theory and Practice of Translation     SPAN-GA 9102     Students will study different schools of translation theory and their practical implications in translation, as well as the result of these applications in traductology. The course addresses the implications that translation theories can have on practice, for both literary and non-literary texts.          Museum Studies      Historic Sites, Cultural Landscapes, and the Politics of Preservation      MSMS-GA 2223     Cain.     Examines the cultural politics, social trends and economic circumstances that shape the preservation and interpretation of historic spaces. Through readings, site visits, and archival research, students investigate a wide variety of historic sites, exploring the social and political contexts that dictated sites\u2019 original use and influence subsequent reuse and interpretation.     Topics In Museum Studies: Anthropology In And Of Museums     MSMS-GA 3330, G49.3330-002     Spring 2012     Haidy Geismar     This course takes as its starting point the importance of museums and collecting in the foundational period of the discipline of anthropology and traces the role that cultural objects have had in thinking about cultural difference, and within cultural analysis. We will also examine the role of museums as sites of fieldwork and as generators of research methodologies focused on material culture. The ways in which museums consolidate emergent theories of material culture will be elicited through a series of workshops at the American Museum of Natural History. Students will investigate the history and nature of the anthropology collections, as well as thinking through the forms of knowledge engendered by artifacts, working closely with photographic and archival collections at the Museum. Working in the Science galleries, we will examine the status of anthropology as a natural science and consider the public representation and materialization of science - students will be required to undertake their own mini-ethnography in the museum. Other topics will include global trends in the emergence of new museums of culture, cultures of dealing and collection, and the place of anthropological collections in art museums. Please note that many classes will meet at the AMNH and a significant amount of assignment research will take place at the museum.          Topics In Museum Studies: Museums And Political Conflict     MSMS-GA 3330, G49.3330-004, DRAP-GA 3330.002     Spring 2012     Jeffrey D. Feldman     In contemporary Museum Studies, it is often said that museums are inherently political institutions. But how do politics actually happen in museums? What has &quot;politics&quot; meant for key exhibitions and collections and what avenues of political theory emerge from the museum in general? In this seminar, we will move beyond the general to examine how specific political concepts took shape in historic exhibitions and museum practices from the 1930s to the present. As such, our challenge will be twofold. On the one hand, we will consider how political movements have used the museums as an implement for advancing power and influence. On the other hand, we will consider how museum practices have &quot;taken up&quot; various kinds of politics: how museum objects and officials have engaged and advocated the agendas and outcomes of political parties, governments, policies, revolutions, and elections. Case studies will include: Degenerate Art (1937), Paris World Exhibition (1937), Rivera's &quot;Man at the Crossroads&quot; (1934), The Guggenheim Museum (1959), Yad Vashem (1965), Harlem on my Mind (1969), The Perfect Moment (1990), The Last Act (1994), The Jewish Museum of Bologna (1998), Sensation (1999), The Apartheid Museum (2001), Holocaust Cartoons (2006), among others. Through these case studies, students will examine the museum's role in the public sphere and the process whereby exhibitions contribute to-- or undermined--key aspects of deliberative democracy.     Topics in Museum Studies: Museums and Indigenous Peoples      G49.3330     Professor Stampe     This course examines changing relationships between indigenous peoples and museums as well as other display institutions. We will begin by positioning the representation of indigenous peoples in terms of imperialist and nationalist histories, and to move on to an examination of movements to reclaim objects, identity, and rights through efforts at self-representation. We will consider both independent and cooperative self-representation projects, focusing particularly on cases in the Americas and the Pacific, but taking on other geographic regions as student interests and available materials allow; we will attend to both the possibilities and limits of projects to reorganize practices, products, and expectations of representation. Topics will include globalization, multiculturalism, and nationalism; colonial-era display in museums and world's fairs; the critique of primitivism; decolonizing methodologies; self-determination, land claims, and economic development; repatriation and intangible cultural heritage; and contemporary art and public culture. Assignments will include weekly reading assignments, group and independent museum visits, a critical exhibition review, and a final paper or planning project.     Topics in Museum Studies: Cultural Property, Rights and Museums     G49.3330     Professor Geismar     What does it mean to own or have a culture? Are all cultures the same? Is owning your culture a basic human right? This course will investigate the growing discussions about cultural property rights that have emerged in the context of museum practices, from collection and display to conservation and archiving. A general analysis of concepts of culture, property, and rights related to these materials and social domains, will be offset by sessions that examine how different understanding of entitlements may be negotiated within museum spaces and how museum objects (broadly defined) may be understood as cultural resources. Special focus will be the impact of legislation; political events such as war; indigenous rights movements; international conceptions of intellectual and cultural property; and the commodity transaction and the marketplace, and on their impact on museum practice.     Certificate Program in Culture and Media     Culture &amp; Media I      G14.1215/ H72.1402     Ginsburg/Ganti     This course offers a critical revision of the history of the genre of ethnographic film, the central debates it has engaged around cross-cultural representation, and the theoretical and cinematic responses to questions of the screen representation of culture, from the early romantic constructions of Robert Flaherty to current work in film, television and video on the part of indigenous people throughout the world. Ethnographic film has a peculiar and highly contested status within anthropology, cinema studies, and documentary practice. In this seminar, we will situate ethnographic film within the wider project of the representation of cultural lives, and especially &quot;natives&quot;. Starting with what are regarded as the first examples of the genre, we will examine how these emerged in a particular intellectual context and political economy. We will then consider the key works that have defined the genre, and the epistemological and formal innovations associated with them, addressing questions concerning social theory, documentary, as well as the institutional structures through which they are funded, distributed, and seen by various audiences. Throughout the course we will keep in mind the properties of film as a signifying practice, its status as a form of anthropological knowledge, and the ethical and political concerns raised by cross-cultural representation.     Culture &amp; Media II:     Ethnography of Media     G14.1216/ H72.1403     Ginsburg/Ganti     Where Culture and Media I critically explored the emergence of ethnographic film largely as an academic-based documentary genre, this seminar examines the implication of film and ethnography as part of a much wider discourse of representation. Travelers, missionaries, colonialists, commercial companies, and educationalists were all involved in the production of images (both moving and still) of the &quot;Other&quot; to promote modernization abroad and education and spectacle at home. From consideration of the ethnographic visual world (photographs, world\u2019s fairs, postcards, museums, etc.) into which ethnographic film emerged in the early years of this century, to examining contemporary televisualist modes of representation, this course will weave film analysis into a broader discussion of the popular culture of ethnographic representation. It will focus on: the film archive; colonialism and visual culture; television and ethnographic film; indigenous media and postcolonial critiques of colonial visual relations.     Cultural Theory and the Documentary     H72.2002     Kahana     This course considers the actual and possible forms of relation between theories of culture and society and documentary film and video. The course is structured as a series of problematics: in each, cultural theory and documentary work are placed in conversation around issues central to both forms of social knowledge. While the course is not intended as a history of international non-fiction film production, the syllabus covers a wide historical and national range of examples. Like many of the visual works we will study, the critical premise of the syllabus is that concepts such as truth, justice, authenticity, originality, and humanity - the putative values of the documentary mode - are themselves historically and culturally relative, variable, and controversial.         Video Production Seminar 1 &amp; 2     Stout/Ganti/Furjanic     This is a year-long seminar in ethnographic documentary video production using state of the art HDV digital video equipment for students in the Program in Culture and Media. The first portion of the course is dedicated to instruction, exercises, and reading familiarizing students with fundamentals of video production and their application to a broad conception of ethnographic and documentary approaches. Assignments undertaken in the Fall raise representational, methodological, and ethical issues in approaching and working through an ethnographic and documentary project. Students develop a topic and field site for their project early in the Fall term, begin their shooting, and complete a short (5-10 minute) edited tape by the end of this semester. This work should demonstrate competence in shooting and editing using professional digital camera/audio Final Cut Pro non-linear editing systems. Students devote the spring semester to intensive work on the project, continuing to shoot and edit, presenting work to the class and completing their (approximately 20 minute-long) ethnographic documentaries. Student work is presented and critiqued during class sessions, and attendance and participation in group critiques and lab sessions is mandatory. Students should come into the class with project ideas already well-developed. Students who have not completed the work assigned in the first semester will not be allowed to register for the second semester. Culture &amp; Media I is a pre-requisite. THE SEMINAR IS OPEN ONLY TO STUDENTS IN THE PROGRAM IN CULTURE AND MEDIA. IT IS LIMITED TO TEN STUDENTS AND REQUIRES PERMISSION OF THE INSTRUCTOR. There is no lab fee, but students are expected to provide their own videotapes. In addition to class time, there will be regular technical lab sessions on the use of equipment.     *This course/certificate is recommended     Center for Latin American and Caribbean Studies      Beginner Quechua I     LATC-GA 10     Spring 2012     Odi Gonzales          Beginner Quechua II     LATC-GA 11     Spring 2012     Odi Gonzales          Intermediate Quechua I     LATC-GA 20     Odi Gonzales          Tpcs Sem: Indigenous Feminisms: Economic and Racial Justice      LATC-GA 1020     Spring 2012     Pamela Calla          Performance and Human Rights     G95.2978     Professor Jill Lane     This course focuses on the different uses of performance in human rights advocacy and activism in Latin America, from contexts of transitional justice (in Guatemala, El Salvador, Chile, Argentina), commissions for truth and reconciliation (in Peru, Chile, Argentina), and the ongoing debates and legacies of these projects. We consider the production of political truth in contexts of art, international law, and the public sphere, and focus particularly on the work of embodied performance in these settings. Our course will interact with the visiting photographic exhibit at the King Juan Carlos Center, Yuyanapaq: Para Recordar, produced as part of the Peruvian Truth and Reconciliation Commission. We will attend a planned symposium on the legacy of Latin American truth commissions at KJCC,and will attend regular film screenings on related topics. Students will write and present a final research project for the course. Taught in English, but reading knowledge of Spanish is strongly recommended.     Trauma and Violence Transdisciplinary Studies      Trauma and Representation     TRVI-GA 2005     Probes the effects of trauma on the possibility of representation and the ways in which different genres and media can represent trauma.     Wagner School of Public Serivice     Community Organizing     PADM-GP.2106     Introduction to Community Organizing is for those who could imagine running national or local advocacy organizations that make change happen or anyone who wants to understand the art of community organizing. It will provide an overview of and training in contemporary community organizing practice in the United States. This includes defining what community organizing is and identifying its value base; exploring the strategies, tactics and activities of organizing; and thinking about marketing, language and evaluation. We also will examine the transformations of civic engagement and voluntary associations in the United States and the impact of these transformations on the ways Americans organize and advocate for change.     But there is a larger lesson here: The skills of community organizing \u2013 listening, finding areas of consensus and building on that consensus, finding ways to make change happen \u2013 are skills that can be applied to all professional and life settings. Through readings, class activities, cases studies, speakers and reflection, students will examine skills and techniques for effective organizing, including building a membership base, developing ordinary people as community leaders and running member-led issue campaigns. Students will also have the opportunity to reflect on and strengthen their own skills as community organizers and advocates.     Advocacy Lab: How to Make Change Happen     PADM-GP.2407     Advocacy Lab is for those who could imagine working in national or local advocacy organizations that make change happen or anyone who wants to understand the art of issue advocacy as a method of social change. An advocacy campaign attempts to impact public policy, most often through changes in regulations and/or legislation. There are a wide range of roles campaign workers can play from research and policy analysis to education, public relations and organizing constituencies to reaching out to a wide range of influential, legislators and other government officials. At the same time, the skills of public advocacy\u2013 listening, finding areas of consensus and building on that consensus, finding ways to make change happen \u2013 are skills that can be applied to all professional and life settings.     The course will provide an overview of and training in how to affect public policy through advocacy campaigns, legislative lobbying, issue branding, coalition building and community organizing in the United States. This includes exploring the different forms of policy issue advocacy and identifying its value base; exploring the strategies, tactics and activities of organizing and running such campaigns; and thinking about marketing, language and evaluation. Advocacy lab will direct an on-going social justice advocacy campaign which students will run \u2013 this is not simulation, but the real thing.     The goal of Advocacy Lab is to gain hands-on experience in taking on a social justice issue and make change happen. In addition to classroom activities, we will take our learning out into the community. The clinical part of the program will include training in the specific advocacy issue we will be working on and going out into the field to advocate for concrete change.           Large Scale Change: Processes and Techniques for Public and Private Settings     PADM-GP.4146     Two of the most powerful set of ideas about initiating and sustaining meaningful change in all types of organizations, both public and private, have been developed recently by organizational development practitioners and theorists. High-involvement strategies are increasingly used in a variety of processes to involve people at all levels in changing their own system or organization. High-leverage strategies are used to involve people in systematic ways to sustain those changes.     Students of Organizational Development and Change who are interested in promoting and implementing dramatic and sustainable change need to explore and understand the core principles, assumptions and processes of such strategies. Often termed Large-Scale Interventions, these methods are being used more and more as diverse organizations confront changing environments, expectations and realities. It is no wonder that organizations as large as General Motors and various state government departments (social services, corrections) and as small as the local public school and community group which are interested in \u201cturning things around\u201d are investigating the use of such interventions.     This two-day course provides a comprehensive overview of the major change methods being used today. A brief review identifying core principles, assumptions and processes of over 60 such techniques will be made. In addition, participants will engage in designing and implementing three such interventions as a class: Appreciative Inquiry, Dialogue, and Future Search.     Advocacy and Movement Politics in the U.S.     UPADM-GP.271     This course will focus on four broad movements in post-war America: the movement for African-American Civil Rights; the Gay and Lesbian Civil Rights Movements; the Conservative Movement; and the Consumer Movement. The course will familiarize students with these movements that span post-war American history, putting each in its historical context from the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) to Stonewall to Unsafe at Any Speed to California's Proposition 13. Students will also learn how these movements illustrate the variety of tactics and strategies employed by advocates of social change including boycotts, litigation, regulatory action, electoral politics, marches, and voter referenda.         Minorities in America: Status, Rights, Culture and Community     UPADM-GP.0216     The position of minorities in the United States, an immigrant nation since its inception, remains a volatile topic of debate that touches the core of American identity. While we will review the history of minorities in America, we will focus on their status within the cultural and political framework and examine the ways that how we understand rights as either individually or communally derived informs policy decisions and shapes minority institutions. We will seek to define what &quot;minority&quot; status entails by studying how ethnicity, race, gender and religious identity, and cultural expression play out in the political sphere. Attention will then shift to minority community building - how public policies and leaders nurture or undermine minority identity, establish and sustain institutions, and create sustainable minority communities.     Critical Race Theory     PADM-GP.4430     Critical Race Theory refers to a broad set of historical and contemporary theories that emerged in the late 1980s to more accurately describe the lived experiences and realities of racial and ethnic minorities and marginalized groups and individuals in society. As a theoretical framework, Critical Race Theory pays close attention to the ways in which power and privilege operate in society and takes seriously the impact of the intersections of race, class, gender, ethnicity, sexuality and other markers of difference on rights and access to resources in the public sphere.     At its core, critical race theory is an applied theory with an explicit goal of social justice and transformation. As an applied theory, critical race theory relies on various tools and interventions to bring about social change including policy making and advocacy, research, community organizing and within-system advocacy.     In this course, we will explore the challenges as well as opportunities critical race theory presents for the field of public administration and service. Specifically, we will examine critical race theory as a counter framework for understanding difference and inequalities in society and how the framework can be used to deepen our understanding of historic and present-day institutional and structural barriers. We will also consider they ways Critical Race Theory can be employed as a strategy to redress social inequities over the long-term.     Race and Class in American Cities     URPL-GP.4620     American cities are comprised of residents from a great diversity of nations, cultures, religions, and political philosophies. Consequently, conflicts surrounding race, ethnicity, class, and gender are often at the center of disputes about the use of public space and the allocation of city resources. This course examines the patterns of racial\u2010ethnic, class, and gender inequality in American cities. We shall address how these inequalities emerge, how they are perpetuated, and the role of public policy in addressing these social problems.     Race, Class &amp; Gender in American Cities     UPADM-GP.0219     Spring 2012     This course examines how different racial, ethnic, and class interests interact in urban planning and development processes. It focuses on political systems and private market arrangements that affect the allocation and distribution of resources. A comparative approach identifies the ways in which different political regimes have analyzed and planned for the needs of a variety of racial, ethnic, and class interests.     Shifting Focus: Video Production and Community     K45.1445     Professor Read     From the taping of the police beating of Rodney King to the burgeoning growth of Independent Media Centers around the world, video has become an essential tool of social struggle. This course will be a hands-on class in video production in the service of progressive social change. Class time will be used to: examine the biases of corporate-controlled media; learn the theory and history of video activism; develop basic camera and editing skills; and reflect on lessons learned in the field. Outside of class students will break into groups and collaborate with local community organizations in the conception and production of a short video piece, and subsequently strategize with those organizations about how to most effectively use video in their particular struggles. Readings will include selections from Noam Chomsky, Robert McChesney and Thomas Harding.     Media, Culture and Communication     Race and Media     MCC-GE 2025     The racial and ethnic diversity of the United States from Europeans' first encounter with Native Americans, through colonialism and American slavery, Reconstruction, Jim Crow, the Civil Rights era and beyond has made the issue of race one of the United States' principal sites of conflict and conversation. For many years, scholarship on race and media has focused on a myriad of theories and issues surrounding representation, concerned with the presence or lack of people of color in media of all kinds, and the stereotypical ways they are portrayed when they are present. But this is only one part of the story. While this course highlights many of these issues, it focuses on the ways that media can and have shaped public discourse about race and racism both within and beyond the confines of the United States. The course considers a variety of media television sitcoms and drama, television and print news, film, popular music, the internet and others for the purpose of investigating how media have and continue to variably influence the publics racial agenda, and the general content, tone and tenor of racial conversation in the public sphere.     Media Activism     MCC-GE 2153     This participatory and discussion-oriented course explores the politics of media activism: its tactics, its strategies and its goals. The course will rely on both a survey of the existing theory and scholarship on media activism, as well as close analyses of actual activist practices within both old and new media and on a local, national and global scale. Special attention will be paid to questions of creativity and efficacy, addressing questions concerning the value of media activism as both an aesthetic and political activity.     Communication Processes: Gender, Race and Cultural Identity     MCC-GE 2182     Course examines past &amp; current studies on language, communication theories, speech perception, &amp; other aspects of verbal &amp; nonverbal behavior. Students relate these studies to how gender, race, culture &amp; sexual orientation are developed &amp; reflected in society in both personal &amp; professional relationships.     Decolonization and its Aftermath     MCC-GE 2211     The advent of 20th century decolonization challenged the way in which world history had been conceived for four centuries, as centered upon the tiny landmass of Western Europe, rather than say, as plural and polycentric. The former view made it difficult to understand how the majority of the world's population mattered to history at all. With the onset of decolonization after the end of World War I, the world began to be seen, first through the lens of the nation, and secondly, as an extensive set of interconnections, where seemingly remote events could have major effects across countries. This course will combine a survey of select decolonization movements with analyses of the transformations from anticolonial nationalism through postcolonial developmentalism to the contemporary new world order. The course will consider decolonization in two senses: as the historical achievement of independence in former colonies, and, as a communicational concept illuminating socio-political change.     Food Studies      Food in the Arts: Performance  E33.1204  Professor Raviv  This course will examine the affinity between food and the idea of performance, and the use of food in live performance \u2013 mostly in theater and performance art. We will analyze specific performances to understand the relationship between food and art, and the many variations in the ways artists may incorporate food into their performances or be inspired by it. We will also explore briefly extreme cases of food as performance. The class will read performance texts, watch video documentation of live performances, and go to see performances and visit appropriate sites. The majority of discussions will revolve around the analysis of actual performances and artist\u2019s work.    Food and Society     E33.1051     Professor Berg     Tisch- Performance Studies      Memory, Trauma and Performance     PERF-GT 2407 16560     Taylor     This course explores the interconnections between trauma, memory, and performance in Latin America. Starting in the 1960s, we focus on events throughout the Americas\u2014Mexico 1968, Argentina\u2019s \u2018Dirty War,\u2019 Chile under Pinochet, Guatemala, Nicaragua, and other sites in which criminal politics have disappeared citizens and traumatized populations. Does each context have its own unique structure and idiom, or can we think about individual and collective trauma through a translocal, cosmopolitan lens? Topics include: the performance of state power and state sponsored terror; the individual and collective nature of trauma; the study of embodied practices such as testimony and witnessing; the construction of archives of testimony; testimony, its use in literature, museums, and pedagogy, its dramatizations by others, its archivization; the social role of sites of memory (ESMA, Villa Grimaldi etc.); performances of protest and resistance.          Tourist Productions     PERF-GT 1041 16561     Vail     A booming multinational industry, tourism is a powerful medium of transnational encounter. There is hardly a place on earth not part of the recreational geography of tourism. This course will undertake a performance analysis of tourist productions, especially early and contemporary travelogues. The political economy and cultural impact of tourism will be explored through an ethnographic examination of actual sites, incorporating segments of the tourism industry ranging from backpackers to luxury travelers. An exemplary case of cultural invention and commodification, tourism is implicated in the histories of pilgrimage, travel, colonialism, and ethnography, retracing their itineraries and replicating their discourse. Particular emphasis will thus be placed on travel stories, from word-of-mouth tales to those circulating in print and media, and their role in shaping experience and destination perspectives.     Intercultural Performance: Ways Of Seeing     H42.2860     Professor Karen Shimakawa     This course will examine the concept of &quot;interculturalism&quot; in terms of audience and performer: how do we see or perform across cultures? And what is the efficacy of the term (or genre) in the current, transnational economy? Using Japanese contemporary performance and dance as our jumping-off point (some of which might conventionally be seen as &quot;intercultural,&quot; some of which might not) we will consider theories of (culturally-embedded) watching, alongside theories of interculturalism and transnationalism. What does it mean to conceive of the &quot;intercultural&quot; (either as a performance genre or mode of seeing)?     Verbal Art as Performance: The Performed Story in Culture And Society     H42.0340     Professor Kay Turner     In his The Law of Genre, Derrida says, &quot; as soon as genre announces itself, one must respect a norm, one must not cross a line of demarcation, one must not risk impurity, anomaly, or monstrosity.&quot; But just as quickly, he announces the impossibility of the law of genre because every genre contains the seeds of its own contamination. Both of Derrida's claims are useful for studying the performed story. For once we've learned something of generic distinctions, we'll proceed happily to generic impurities. Contagion spreads from storyteller to storyteller in acts of performing narrative.     Anthropology and folklore- based collections of myths, folktales, fairy tales, and legends provide resources for our discussion of the ways in which different types of stories and the context of their telling shape peoples\u2019 identities and world views. We discover ways in which important social concerns--among them gender construction, sexuality, marriage, family, status, ethnicity, and religious belief--are raised and appraised through the occasion of traditional storytelling performances. We review &quot;old-school&quot; resources for interpreting elements of performance in stories, including structuralism and oral-formulaic theory. But we soon move on to the &quot;new school&quot; impurities of post-structuralist and performance studies understandings of the storyteller's art as it has been reformulated in personal experience narrative, testimony, journalism and in other media: film, theater, performance art, and so on. Story is the jewel of performance; performance is largely about the necessity of telling stories and the motivation to perform is often story-based.     A portion of this course is field-based: students will be assigned a collecting project and short transcription, and we also attend at least one story performance. Reading, two short papers and class participation round out requirements. Readings include all or selections from, Derrida, &quot;The Law of Genre,&quot; Benjamin, &quot;The Storyteller;&quot; Levi-Strauss, &quot;Elementary Structures of Kinship;&quot; Roman Jakobson, &quot;Closing Statement: Linguistics and Poetics;&quot; Brothers Grimm, &quot;Household Tales;&quot; Julie Cruikshank, &quot;Do Glaciers Listen? Local Knowledge, Colonial Encounters and Social Imagination;&quot; Richard Bauman, &quot;Verbal Art as Performance;&quot; Patricia Sawin, &quot;Performance at the Nexus of Gender, Power, and Desire.     Art and Art Professions      Contemporary Art and Critical Pedagogy: Identity, Representation and Multiculturalism     ARTED-GE 2015     This course addresses philosophical. historical, socio-politcal contexts of multiculturalism in the United States, with an emphasis on relationship to critical pedagogy &amp; contemporary art practices. Current ideas about representation &amp; identity will be considered specifically in relation to a critique of mainstream notions of multiculturalism &amp; art. Topics may include the history of race in the United States, the role of ethnicity &amp; class in shaping identity, &amp; feminism &amp; multiculturalism. The course of addresses pedagogy &amp; curriculum in a variety of educational settings, including schools, museums, &amp; alternative spaces.     Silver School of Social Work     Culture &amp; Social Issues of Central America     MSWEL-GS 2114     Spring 2012     This course will introduce students to the European-heritage and Indigenous cultures of and contemporary socio-political issues facing developing countries with a focus on Latin America emphasizing issues affecting children and families in of Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Guatemala, and Costa Rica.

This course is an opportunity to learn about and from the developing world? in Costa Rica! From a global perspective (with an emphasis on Latin America), we will explore social policy issues as they affect vulnerable populations, particularly children and families. We will be introduced to domestic and international aid responses through guest lectures and site visits. For the field portion of the program, we will be spending three to six afternoons at a public child care center for very poor, pre-school children, half of whom are Costa Rican and half of whom are from Nicaragua. Students should be prepared to engage the children in activities (arts and crafts, music, dance, games), providing their own supplies          School of Continuing and Professional Studies      Cultural Diversity in Business     Y10.0501     Professor Tansey     Examines the dynamics of a multicultural society and its impact on the world of business. The nature of intercultural relations and commonly shared perceptions of various cultures are studied. Students learn the advantages and challenges of interacting in multicultural contexts through historical research, role-playing, and simulation.           Spirituality in the Workplace     Y26.2251     Professor Merson     This course will look at the trends that have led to an interest in spirituality in the workplace, and will explore its definition separate from religion. We will analyze the application of spirituality in organizations on four levels: individual, group, organizational and societal. Topics covered will be work and individual meaning, leadership and spirituality, spirituality and innovation, and systemic approaches to creating enlightened organizations.     School of Continuing and Professional Studies           World Cultures: Latin America &amp; The Caribbean     ANTH1-DC 5014     Spring 2012     This course offers a historic and comparative study of the cultures and societies of Central and South America and the Caribbean region.

Cuba: History and  Revolution   HIST-UA 755 Ferrer. 4  points.   Cuba was one of the  first territories colonized by Spain and among the last to secure its  independence. It was among the last territories in the hemisphere to  abolish slavery, yet home to the first black political party in the  Americas. Its struggle for independence from Spain helped usher in an  age of U.S. imperialism. It is the hemisphere\u2019s first and last  socialist state. This brief description hints not only at the  complexities of Cuban history but also at its significance for  international histories of nationalism and imperialism, race and  slavery, the Cold War and socialist revolution. This course serves as  an in-depth examination of that complex and fascinating history,  focusing in depth on the major themes that have shaped modern Cuban  history in the 19th and 20th centuries: race and slavery, nationalism  and imperialism, reform and revolution.

Colloquium: 20th Century European Capitalism HIST-UA 272 Offered every other year. 4 points. Nineteenth   century Europe was the birthplace of economic liberalism. The gold   standard, the night watchman state, and the writings of the classical   economists laid the foundation for a golden age of laissez-faire   capitalism. More than a century later we see Europe as the birthplace of   the modern welfare state, a pioneer of organized capitalism, and the   center for a supra-national experiment in economic cooperation: the   European Union. This course traces the evolution of European capitalism   during the twentieth century, from a laissez-faire to a social market   economy. Throughout the semester we will study key themes and turning   points that shaped Europe's economic development: the Great Depression;   the World Wars; alternative ways of organizing an economic life under   fascism and communism; the stagnation of the 1970s; and European   economic integration.

Colloquium: Pirates and Buccaneers: Seaborne Terrorism in the Early Modern World HIST-UA 369 Offered every year. 4 points. This course will sort out the myths and realities of the \u201cGolden Age of Piracy.\u201d The emergence of Spain as a political and economic superpower in the early sixteenth century bred waves of French, English, and Dutch interlopers, contraband slave traders, seaborne raiders, freebooters, and privateers eager to thwart her attempt at hegemony and expropriate her wealth. Their success gave rise to a multinational and cross-cultural underworld of violence and crime on the high seas that flourished nearly unchecked from the mid-seventeenth century until its suppression in the early decades of the eighteenth century. The response of the early modern world to piracy and buccaneering is embedded in the \u201cLaw of Nations\u201d and the \u201cLaw of the Sea,\u201d progenitors of modern international law. Participants in this course will engage a rich body of primary and secondary historical sources to reconstruct and interpret the multiple contexts within which piracy and buccaneering operated.

Ortolano.  4 points.   Assists students in  writing archivally-based research papers about a single topic in  recent British history. Since the end of the Second World War,  Britain has faced many of the challenges typical of Western  societies, as well as more particular obstacles resulting from its  status as a recent imperial power. British history since 1945 has  thus been characterized by the creation of the welfare state, the end  of the British Empire, immigration and racial conflict, \u201cSwinging  London\u201d and 1960s second-wave feminism, labor unrest and the  decline of heavy industry, neo-liberal economics, and Tony Blair\u2019s  New Labour. We spend the first part of the seminar becoming  acquainted with these developments, while also identifying specific  topics for students to explore through primary-source-based papers of  about 20 pages.      United States History Seminar: Topics in U.S.  History      HIST-UA 413 4 points.   Topics vary from  semester to semester.

Seminar: Capital and Labor and the Making of Modern America   HIST-UA 416 Offered  every other year. Montoya. 4 points.   This course has two  purposes. The first is to learn the fundamentals of historical  research. By completing assignments that teach them how to conduct  archival research and engage in historical analysis, students come to  understand how historians engage in their craft, how they construct  historical narratives, and how they ensure their accuracy. The course  culminates in a 15- to 20-page research paper. The second purpose of  this course is to learn about U.S. labor history, which includes not  only the study of the workplace but also how families interacted and  reacted to labor conditions as they lived their domestic lives.

This seminar investigates the historical development of the key ideologies of postwar American politics and their differing engagements with the central historical developments of that time period: the Cold War, civil rights movement, metropolitan development, feminism, environmentalism, and fiscal and monetary policy. It will investigate how liberalism and conservatism reshaped American society and politics at the various scales of American governance: grass-roots, state, regional, and national. As a research seminar, students will be expected to complete a piece of original research, on a topic of their choosing, over the course of the semester.    Seminar: Unbordered and Bordered Lands: North American Borderlands History HIST-UA 663 Offered every other year. 4 points. In this reading seminar, students will explore the major themes and historiographical approaches to the study of North American borderlands history. A rapidly expanding and vibrant field, borderlands history focuses on the interactions of peoples, nations, and empires across the boundaries of Mexico, the United States, and Canada. Beginning with the earliest European claims to the continent, this course will explore recent writings on the interactions of Europeans and Native peoples as Spain, Britain, and France attempted to conquer North America. In the second half of the class, we will turn to the transition from empires to nation-states in North America and explore how Mexico, the United States, and Canada worked to assert state power and create national space and citizens in the borderlands between nations.      Seminar: Reading and  Writing Experimental History   HIST-UA 672 Hodes. 4  points.   Investigates and  evaluates the ways in which scholars attempt to expand the boundaries  of writing history. Focuses on the relationship between historical  evidence and the writing of history in new ways; relation between  scholar and subject; connections between history and speculation; use  of unconventional voices; re-creation of past worlds and lives; and  connections between history and storytelling.

Students choose  a research project, which they report on both orally and in a seminar  paper. Colloquium: Twentieth Century U.S. History in Film HIST-UA 694 Offered every other spring. 4 points. The purpose of this course is two-fold: to engage in critical examination of film and to analyze how film either captures or portrays specific moments in twentieth-century U.S. history. Throughout the semester, we will discuss major historical eras and events\u2014including the Great Depression, the Second World War, McCarthyism, the Cold War, the Civil Rights movement, Vietnam, and Watergate\u2014as we explore major film genres such as the social problem film, screwball comedy, the \u201cwoman\u2019s film,\u201d film noir, and Gen-X cinema. In terms of documentaries, we will view newsreels, government-produced films, historical documentaries, cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9, and \u201cdocu-ganda.\u201d We will not necessarily focus upon whether filmic representations are historically accurate in fine detail. Rather, we shall carefully consider the ways in which filmic representations do\u2014and do not\u2014comment upon complex political, social, cultural, and historical dynamics. Lastly, we shall also consider key developments in cinema over the course of the twentieth century. Women, the Entertainment Industry, and the Blacklist Era HIST-UA 695 Offered every fall. 4 points. One of the darker epochs of American history were the years most commonly known as the McCarthy era, although the senator from Wisconsin played only a small part in the investigations of the entertainment industry. History also chooses to remember only the men whenever discussions of this period are presented. Long forgotten, more accurately ignored, many women were named, appeared before the Committees, and were victims of the blacklist. This course reviews the history of this period, and the women of the entertainment industry who appeared before the various Un-American Activities Committees from 1938-1958. Here is an opportunity to examine an important piece of the American story through a new lens, giving a fascinating group of women their place in the history of this period.    Seminar: Sport and Film  in American History   HIST-UA 698 Sammons. 4  points.   Investigates how a  visual medium (film), subject to the conventions of drama and  fiction, and a popular activity/institution (sport), often associated  with frivolity, violence, and puerility, might be used as serious  vehicles for conceptualizing and analyzing the past. Seminar: Histories of the U.S.-Mexico Border HIST-UA 756 4 points. The border between the United States and Mexico is both a meeting ground and a dividing line between two nations, cultures, and people. It has been a site of conflict and coexistence from the time it was created until the present. In the media the border most often appears as a site of controversy, violence, and national control that is defined by U.S. and Mexican policies concerning trade, immigration, and national security. But the border is more than this; it is a place where individuals, families, and communities have made their lives. The history of the border then is found not only in the pages of government reports and statistics, but in the memories, songs, and stories of border people. In this class we will explore some of the many histories of the border. A wide array of course materials\u2014including historical monographs, journalistic reports, oral histories, folk songs, and documentary and feature films\u2014will introduce students to the many ways that people use and make sense of the past. In the process we will seek not just to better understand the contemporary political issues focused on the border today, but the longer and richer history of the U.S.-Mexico border and the people who have lived along and across it.     History of Asia, Africa, and Latin America      Seminar: Capitalism in  South Asia   HIST-UA 327 Offered  every year. Sartori. 4 points.   Is capitalism a set of  global arrangements superimposed on a set of local cultures, a  long-term tendency of South Asian societies, or something that has  entered into the very structure of modern South Asian society? This  course explores a series of topics including the Indian Ocean trading  world; \u201cproto-industrialization\u201d in pre-colonial India; the East  India Company; deindustrialization, peasantization, and  traditionalization; continuity and transformation in peasant society;  developmentalist theories and pro-industrialization policies;  nationalism, decolonization, and political economy; and  neo-liberalism.

Rather, it takes up crucial issues in the history of each polity and  society, focusing primarily on Taiwan, thus allowing students to gain  an understanding of the complexities of Taiwanese history and society  and of this contested region of the world. The reading and writing  load are heavy, and students are expected to participate in class.  Some background in China\u2019s or Taiwan\u2019s history is desirable and  presumed.      Seminar: Topics in  Eurasian History   HIST-UA 533 Offered  every year. 4 points.   Focuses on major  historical issues and problems in the history of Eurasia, which is  the largest landmass in the world but is rarely treated as a region  or unit of historical analysis. Responds to recent shifts in the  field of history that emphasize frameworks larger than the  \u201cnation-state\u201d for historical research and analysis. Possible  topics: The Mongol Empire and Its Legacy; Early Modern Empires:  China, Russia, and the Ottomans; Scientific and Technological  Exchanges, 1225\u20132000; Eurasian Militaries; and Nomads and Nomadism  in Eurasia.

The war is dealt with in two senses: its meaning  for Japan\u2019s international history and its impact on the domestic  landscape. Readings are drawn from both primary and secondary sources  so that interpretative controversies as well as texts may be  discussed. Thematically, the course divides into sections: (1) the  great debates over Japanese fascism and ultranationalism; (2) the  China War; (3) the Pacific War; (4) the Coprosperity Sphere; (5) the  atom bomb, surrender, and occupation; and (6) issues of public memory  and war responsibility.

Many assume that bodies are ahistorical, unchanging, but this is not true. This seminar examines historical changes in physical bodies, perception of bodies, and treatment of the body over time; how social class, race, sex and region have contributed to these changes and to bodily diversity; and how national and international inequalities have affected the human body. Colloquium: Biography and History HIST-UA 669 Offered every other fall. 4 points. In this course, we will explore the ways in which the art and craft of biography can serve the study of history. Reading critically and thoughtfully, we will explore both conventional and unconventional biographies, by both academics and non-academics, treating subjects ranging from the well-known to the unknown, and beyond. Around the seminar table, we will ask how each work illuminates the study of history, with attention to such topics as research methods, sources, evidence, argument, style, voice, and the relationship between writer and subject. Throughout the semester, students will make their own forays into biography, sharing their work and reflecting on one another\u2019s efforts. Colloquium: Consumption and Consumer Culture in Comparative Perspective HIST-UA 671 Offered every other year. 4 points. This upper level class will explore the study of consumption and consumer culture.

Undergraduate Courses     Anthropology      Topical Seminar: Formations of Indigeneity     ANTH-UA320.001     Spring 2012     Myers     Through a case study of materials concerning indigenous people in Australia and North America, this course will investigate the consequences (cultural, sociological, policy) of a development that has taken place throughout the world. Many of the peoples in whom anthropologists have long been interested\u2013those organized into small-scale societies, kinship based\u2013have been encapsulated as indigenous minorities within nation states dominated by other cultural traditions. In this context, the capacity and practices of these peoples, who some have characterized as \u201cFourth World peoples,\u201d to reproduce themselves and their traditions in their own terms has been limited, undermined, co-opted and, on occasion, ironically reinforced .     Topical Seminar: Memory, Heritage, History and Narrative     ANTH-UA320.002     Spring 2012     Abercrombie      Topical Seminar: Latino Expressive Culture and Literature      ANTH-UA320.003     Spring 2012     Rosaldo      Human Society and Culture     ANTH-UA 1     Abercrombie, Beidelman, D\u00e1vila, Ganti, Grant, Khan, Myers, Rapp, Rogers, Siu.     Surveys the general aims, methods, and findings of modern cultural anthropology and its ties with the humanities and social sciences. Economic, political, and family organizations and systems of thought, including religion, are covered with equal attention to \u201cprimitive,\u201d traditional, and modern complex societies, particularly non-Western societies.      Anthropology of Language     ANTH-UA 17     Prerequisite: ANTH-UA 1 or permission of the instructor. Schieffelin.     Taking an anthropological perspective on the role of language in contemporary social life, introduces students to theories and methods for studying communicative practices across a range of societies and settings. Ethnographic studies focus on the role of language in regulating social relations, identity formation, power and politics, verbal art and performance, literacy and education in multilingual and multicultural settings, and the development of new media.      Salvation and Revolution     ANTH-UA 34     Prerequisite: ANTH-UA 1 or permission of the instructor. Beidelman, Myers.     Examines revolutionary movements in both traditional and industrial societies in terms of how violence, coercion, prophecy, and radical thought impel social change. Analyzes utopian communities, prophetic movements, cargo cults, religious sects, and terrorism from various social scientific perspectives.     Family and Kinship     ANTH-UA 41     Prerequisite: ANTH-UA 1. Abercrombie, Beidelman, Ginsburg, Khan, Martin, Myers, Rapp, Rogers.     Explores cross-cultural diversity in the organization of family life and kin relationships. Discusses how anthropology\u2019s cross-cultural perspective helps illuminate new or controversial family arrangements in Western societies.     Cultural Symbols     ANTH-UA 48     Prerequisite: ANTH-UA 1 or permission of the instructor. Abercrombie, Beidelman, Ginsburg, Myers.     Surveys the various symbolic systems employed by the world\u2019s people, considering their use in myth, ritual, literature, and art and the kinds of anthropological theories applied to explain their power and forms. Approaches theory through case studies, providing a diverse view of world cultures. Uses materials from all continents; emphasizes non-Western, nonliterate societies though some material from the West is also used.     Peoples of Latin America     ANTH-UA 103     Prerequisite: ANTH-UA 1 or permission of the instructor. Abercrombie, D\u00e1vila, Rosaldo, Stout.     Surveys Latin American societies and cultures, placing special emphasis on class, ethnicity, and nationhood. Examines some of the fundamental characteristics of Ibero-American civilization both in its historical development and in its transformations across a variety of regional and class contexts. Discusses the complex interrelationships between country and city and between \u201cpopular\u201d and \u201celite\u201d culture by examining ethnographic case material and a few general interpretative works.     Visual Anthropology     ANTH-UA 122 Formerly Transcultural Cinema.     Prerequisite: ANTH-UA 1 or permission of the instructor. Ganti, Ginsburg, Stout.     Explores the history and development of anthropology\u2019s relationship to visual practices, focusing on, but not limited to, photography and film, both as a mode for representing culture and as a site of cultural practice. Examines the emergence of, as well as the contestations around, the genre known as ethnographic film and its relationship to wider debates about documentary and nonfictional film practice. One of the central themes of the course is the relationship between representation, power, and knowledge as manifest in cross-cultural representation.     Anthropology of Media     ANTH-UA 123     Prerequisite: ANTH-UA 1 or permission of the instructor. Ganti, Ginsburg, Stout.     Examines the social and political life of media and how it makes a difference in the daily lives of people as a practice\u2014in production, reception, or circulation. Introduces some key concepts in social theory such as ideology, hegemony, the public sphere, and the nation, which have been critical to the study of the media across disciplines. Provides an overview of the increasing theoretical attention paid to the mass media by anthropologists and focuses on concrete ethnographic examples. Examines cross-culturally how the mass media have become the primary means for the circulation of symbolic forms across time and space and crucial to the constitution of subjectivities, collectivities, and histories in the contemporary world. Topics include the role of media in constituting and contesting national identities, in forging alternative political visions, in transforming religious practice, and in creating subcultures.      Anthropology of Art     ANTH-UA 125     Prerequisite: ANTH-UA 1 or permission of the instructor. Geismar, Myers.     Introduces students to the \u201cclassic\u201d literature within the anthropology of art, charts the development and interests of this subdiscipline of anthropology, and uses this material to develop an \u201canthropological\u201d perspective on art that can be used as a key form of critical inquiry into diverse art forms\u2014even those not conventionally explored in the history of anthropology. The starting point for the anthropology of art is to ask, what is art? in comparative cultural perspective. Analyzes, among other things, the idea of aesthetics in cross-cultural context; the notion of style; the relation between art, technology, and skill; the entanglement of primitivism and modernity; the role of class and taste in appreciating art; art and value in the marketplace; art and museum practice; tourist art and the value of authenticity; and colonial and postcolonial art.     Race, \u201cDifference,\u201d and Social Inequality     ANTH-UA 323 Identical to SCA-UA 323.     Prerequisite: ANTH-UA 1 or permission of the instructor. Khan, Siu.     Human beings have always grappled with some notion of identity, asking questions about who they are, about who others distinguished from themselves are, and about the ways that perceived similarities and differences are meaningful and important (or not) in social relationships. Examines how historical, social, and cultural contexts shape the forms that identities take, looking in particular at ideas about race and racial identity. We work with two     premises: (1) race must be understood in relation to other identity categories: gender, class, sexuality, ethnicity, and so on and (2) race is expressed in both obvious and subtle ways; thus, racial identity is implicit as well as explicitly expressed. We also consider whether race must necessarily be understood as stigma; discuss nonfiction, fiction, and films; and may visit public exhibitions.     Reimagining Community: Race, Nation, and the Politics of Belonging     ANTH-UA 325 Identical to SCA-UA 200.     Prerequisite: ANTH-UA 1 or permission of the instructor. D\u00e1vila, Siu.     Critically examines and evaluates the various approaches to studying and interpreting different community formations. Examines different notions of \u201ccommunity\u201d through a variety of disciplinary lenses. Readings are drawn from anthropology, history, feminist studies, cultural studies, ethnic studies, and philosophy. Students are encouraged to examine these texts both as theoretical representations of \u201ccommunity\u201d as well as historically embedded artifacts that are part of the larger machinery in the production of knowledge.     Language and Law     ANTH-UA 329     Prerequisite: ANTH-UA 1 or permission of the instructor. Schieffelin.     Arguments and conflicts are part of everyday life, and language is central to both their instigation and resolution. Explores how speakers ranging from small children to litigants in courts attempt to settle their differences. Comparative materials illustrate theories of disputes and dispute resolution, examining the power of language and the language of power in a variety of settings (e.g., mediation, arbitration, trials). Class includes fieldwork trips to small claims court. Students audio record cases and transcribe and analyze them according to different analytic perspectives. Bilingual students are encouraged to focus on cases that use interpreters.     Human Rights and Culture      ANTH-UA 331     Prerequisite: ANTH-UA 1 or permission of the instructor.     Offers an overview of the human rights system, looking at its basic elements and studying how it works. Focuses on the relationships between human rights and culture. Human rights campaigns frequently encounter resistance in the name of protecting cultural differences. This is particularly common with issues concerning women, children, and the family. Explores several issues that raise questions of human rights and culture, such as female genital cutting, honor killing, trafficking of persons, and indigenous people\u2019s rights to culture. Using these examples, considers how the human rights system deals with tensions between global standards and local ways of life. Examines the meanings of rights and of culture in these debates and shows the implications of adopting an anthropological analysis of these situations. The goal of the course is developing an understanding of human rights in practice.     Culture Through Food     ANTH-UA 410     Prerequisite: ANTH-UA 1 or permission of the instructor. Abercrombie, Rogers.     Explores some of the ways that people use food, cuisines, and eating to organize and engage with social worlds. This focus provides a concrete means for deepening our understanding of alternative models of social explanation. Drawing on ethnographic material from a wide range of cultures, as well as feature films and our own observations and interviews, we consider topics such as the material dimensions of food production, distribution, and consumption (e.g., how food scarcity or abundance shapes collective possibilities, expectations, and values; the causes, consequences, forms, and myths of globalization) and the cultural meanings and social distinctions encoded in food practices (e.g., how food is used cross-culturally as a marker of social identity\u2014class, gender, and ethnicity\u2014and source of meaning\u2014nostalgia, anxiety, and so on).     Medical Anthropology     ANTH-UA 35     Sprig 2012     Analyzes medical beliefs and practices in African, Asian, and Latin American societies. Studies the coexistence of different kinds of medical specialists (e.g., shamans, herbalists, bonesetters, midwives, physicians trained in indigenous and cosmopolitan medicine), with particular reference to the structures of health resources available to laymen and problems of improving health care.     Art History      Topics in Latin American Art: Colonial to Modern     ARTH-UA 316     Prerequisites: ARTH-UA 2, ARTH-UA 5, and ARTH-UA 6, or a score of 5 on the AP Art History exam. Offered periodically.     Focuses on trends, movements, and individuals in the art of Latin America from the 16th to the 20th century. This course is not a survey; it attempts to situate works of art within their social, historical, and theoretical contexts. Chronological focus of this course may vary from term to term.     North American Indian Arts      ARTH-UA 570     Offered periodically.     This course is an introductory survey of North American Indian and Eskimo art. It covers the following art-producing areas and cultures: Northwest Coast (Ozette, Salish, Nootka, Haida, Kwakiutl, Tlingit); Alaska (Old Bering Sea, Ipiutak, and Yupik Eskimo); Southwest (Hohokam, Mogollon, Anasazi, Hopi, Navajo); Plains (Arapaho, Kiowa, Mandan, Sioux); Woodlands (Adena, Hopewell, Mississippian, Ojibwa, Iroquois); and contemporary art (tradition and innovation in contemporary Native American and Eskimo art).     Reading the City     ARTH-UA 677 Prerequisites: ARTH-UA 601, ARTH-UA 661, and permission of the program director. Offered every year.     The course focuses on observation and documentation of a historical section of New York City from its foundation to the present. Students participate in field walks and attend in-class lectures and discussions. A principal objective of the course is to have students learn to read the historical stratigraphy of the city by using primary and secondary sources such as maps, prints, and panoramas, as well as City Council minutes and other printed documents. The goal is to have them deepen their understanding of phenomena that they have observed firsthand.     Classics     Special Topics: Archaeologies of Daily Life     CLASS-UA 293.001     Spring 2012     Joan Connelly     This seminar examines the daily life of Greeks and Romans through consideration of objects in the NYU Classics Department Collections. The role of art in ancient society, the functions that it served, as well as the values and assumptions that it reflects, will be explored through individual objects in the Collections. Students will prepare oral and power point presentations of objects in materials that include ceramics, terracotta, marble, bronze, and glass. From altar pieces to inscribed plaques, from Attic black-figured vases to Roman course ware pots, from bronze coins to candelabra, from glass bottles to terracotta votive figurines, objects in the Classics Dept. Collections provide case studies through which larger social issues can be examined. The capstone project of the course will be student generated design and installation of objects for display as well as the creation of information panels and brochures to accompany their \u201cmini-exhibitions.\u201d     Comparative Literature      Topics in Film and Literature: South by South: Ideological Maps And Fictions of Uneven Development     COLIT-UA 300.001, SPAN-UA 551.002     Spring 2012     Dopico     This course considers the \u201cidea of the South\u201d as geopolitical territory, imaginary landscape and ideological map: a fictive and creative topos where regional mythology, racial divisions, national contests, and cultural imperialism together produce extraordinary narratives and alternative histories. Reading comparatively, south by south, we discover a dynamic cultural genealogy from the global South\u2019s western hemisphere that precedes the urgency of current debates about uneven development and the problems of North and South. We will encounter artists who manipulate and contest the political imaginary and the fictive qualities assigned to the South and its subjects. Engaging works that exalt or decry that ideological geography, we will examine how these artists remake \u201cthe South,\u201d and how they engage the North and its fictions.     Lectures and section discussions will consider works that reflect on different Souths and consider how they portray seductive, dangerous, infantile, charming, backward, or even criminal cultures. In texts, visual art, and films from Europe and the Americas, we will consider how realities and fantasies of the South are represented, how a global South becomes a true fiction, and how writers from \u201cSouthern\u201d places respond to the realities of uneven development and to their own barbarous, childlike, or exotic status on political maps and cultural markets. We will question why writers explore lost worlds, or belatedly return to a region\u2019s buried history to fictively rework and revive the past. We will consider why outsiders, children, and outlaws are central tropes. We will think about the exceptional \u201crepresentational burden\u201d of Southern artists and consider how they negotiate their double bind -- how they engage the biases and appetites of the North and at the same time respond to the weight of history, self-hatred and loyalty in the South.     English     American Literature I      ENGL-UA 230     Prerequisite: ENGL-UA 200 or equivalent approved by the course instructor. .     A survey of American literature and literary history, from the early colonial period to the eve of the Civil War. The goal is to acquire a grasp of the expanding canon of American literature by reading both established, canonical masterpieces and texts traditionally considered marginal. Topics include the relation between history and cultural mythology, the rise of \u201cliterature\u201d as a discipline unto itself, the meaning of American individualism, the mythology of American exceptionalism, the dialectic of freedom and slavery in American rhetoric, the American obsession with race, the ideology of domesticity and its link to the sentimental, and the nature of the \u201cAmerican Renaissance.\u201d     Colonialism and the Rise of Modern African Literature     ENGL-UA 707 Identical to COLIT-UA 850.         Topics: Cross Cultural Encounters on the Renaissance Stage      x-ENGL-UA 252.004     Spring 2012     Instructor: Forman     The Renaissance witnessed both an explosion in theatrical innovation and an increasingly global world--the beginnings of global trade, the \u2015discovery of the New World, and bouts of both conflict and cooperation among the world\u2018s powers. By reading plays that stage encounters between Europeans from different countries and of different religions, between Europeans and the Ottoman Empire, among natives of \u2015India, and among Europeans, Native Americans, and African slaves, we will explore how and why the stage became such a significant site for the representation of cross-cultural encounters. Some questions we will explore include: how do these plays represent conflict\u2014between self and other and over goods and territory\u2014and what possibilities for reconciliation do they imagine? How do these plays understand the differences encountered as a result of travel, trade, and exploration? Why did the theatre develop a fascination with the exotic (for example, with cannibals and pirates)? In what ways did what it means to be European, Christian, or even a good wife or husband get defined and altered by these encounters? In keeping with the theme of encounters, this course will stage a number of creative encounters from the period: between works from different European nations; between plays and the prose works with which they were in dialogue; and between written and visual materials, for example, engravings of the New World and its inhabitants. In the cases where translations exist, we will also read accounts of how non-Europeans viewed Europe. Likely authors include, Shakespeare, Marlowe, Cervantes, Montaigne, Behn, Fletcher, DeBry, and Massinger.     Topics: 19th C American Lit: American Wilderness     ENGL-UA 961.001     Spring 2012     Baker     This course will examine the literary construction of the American wilderness from the colonial era to the present day. We will begin with a study of several modes of colonial writing: the early promotional tract, which linked wilderness with economic opportunity; the Puritan spiritual narrative, which viewed wilderness as a place of savagery and temptation; and the Enlightenment travel narrative, which sought to bring order to nature by means of classification and analysis. Taking up writings of the nineteenth century, we will then examine how Romantic and Transcendentalist writers revised these earlier views of nature, depicting nature as a retreat from commerce as well as a place where humans could restore themselves (or, in the words of John Muir, wash their sprits clean). Our study of nineteenth-century writing will also consider the figure of the Native American as an embodiment of wildness in both positive and negative senses; the growing awareness of America\u2018s limited natural resources; and the impact of evolutionary biology on the American understanding of animality and human nature. We will conclude the course by examining the construction of wilderness in the literature of twentieth-century counter-cultural movements and contemporary environmentalism.     History      American Natives in Early American History   HIST-UA 602   Kupperman. Offered every year.   Focuses on the relationship between Indians and Europeans roughly within the future United States from first contact through the period of Indian removal. Examines colonialism\u2019s impact on Indian societies and the broad variety of techniques native leaders used in attempting to control the relationship. Looks at changing Euramerican attitudes through the colonial period and the role of imperial conflict and American independence on policy development. Assesses the pressure created by Euramerican westward migration before and after the War of 1812, Indian resistance, and the campaign for removal of Indians beyond the Mississippi.     American Indian Policy: Indian-White Relations, 1750 to the Present      HIST-UA 628     Offered every other year.     Historical development of Indian-white relations and the formation of major federal policies toward the Native American from the experiences in late colonial America to the present. Includes the nature of relations between the Indian and the white man in America, the formation and implementation of policies to deal with that relationship, the Indian dilemma in an expansive American society, the impact of historical change on major Indian tribes, and the significant influences of Indian and white leaders.     U.S. Borderlands: Culture, Conflict, and Conquest      HIST-UA 645     Montoya. Offered every other year.     Examines the history of the U.S. Southwest\u2014the borderlands\u2014in the 18th and 19th centuries. Covers the history of the indigenous peoples in this region, Spanish and Mexican control of the area, and the struggles between Mexico and the United States to lay claim to the land. Readings and lectures focus closely on the ways in which communities and cultures developed and interacted in a region where territorial borders between nations were often unclear and shifting.     American Colonial History to 1763      HIST-UA 601     Eustace, Kupperman. Offered every other year.     Examines European expansion in the early modern period and the creation of an interconnected Atlantic world with particular emphasis on North America and the Caribbean.

Seminar: Reading and Writing Experimental History     HIST-UA 672     Hodes.Investigates and evaluates the ways in which scholars attempt to expand the boundaries of writing history. Focuses on the relationship between historical evidence and the writing of history in new ways; relation between scholar and subject; connections between history and speculation; use of unconventional voices; re-creation of past worlds and lives; and connections between history and storytelling.     The United States to 1865      HIST-UA 9     Eustace, Hodes. Offered every fall and every other summer.     Main currents of American historical development from the precolonial epoch to the Civil War. Analysis of the country\u2019s economic and political growth, intellectual traditions, and patterns of social development.

Major Themes in World History: Colonialism and Imperialism     HIST-UA 31     Karl, Young. Offered periodically.     Introduces students to key texts in and critical methodologies for the study of modern world history from the perspective of two of its dominant themes: imperialism and colonialism. Helps students theorize and historicize these seemingly well-known and self-explanatory concepts by introducing them as historically specific theories for understanding the very notion of \u201cmodern world history.\u201d The broad theoretical consideration is accompanied by a consideration of specific texts from Asia and the United States, although not confined to such a bilateral view of the \u201cworld.\u201d     Modern Imperialism      HIST-UA 198 Fulfills non-Western course requirement for the major.     Offered every other year     Conquest, domination, and exploitation in the 19th and 20th centuries in Africa, Asia, and North America. Compares the imperialism of Western Europeans and Americans as well as non-Western peoples. Examines general, technological, environmental, cultural, political, and economic causes.

Explores the ways in which migration from abroad has impacted on American history. Organized chronologically, this course examines immigrations to the United States from the 17th century to present times and the ways in which immigrants and their descendants constructed ethnic communities and practices. Furthermore, the course looks at changing American attitudes toward immigration as reflected in popular culture and public policy and seeks to understand the influence of American reactions on the process of ethnic cultural formation.     History of Colonial Latin America      HIST-UA 743     Thomson. Offered every other year.     Introduces students to the colonial origins of the Latin American region and the ways they have shaped the present.

Specific topics include Inca and Aztec worlds; Indian-European confrontations; the Catholic Church and popular religiosity; patriarchy and honor codes; racial dynamics and slavery; the development of capitalism; anticolonial struggles; imperial rivalry; reform; decline; and colonial legacies.     History of Modern Latin America     HIST-UA 745     Ferrer, Grandin, Weinstein. Offered every year.     A comparative survey of Latin American social, economic, cultural, and political history from 1800 to the present.     History of Mexico and Central America     HIST-UA 752     Grandin. Offered every other year.     A survey of Mexican social and cultural history, including a brief sketch of indigenous societies and civilizations on the eve of the Spanish Conquest, an examination of the conquest as a protracted process and of the establishment of regionally distinct colonial societies, and an exploration of the formation and subsequent development of specific patterns of social life (urban society and rural hinterlands, characteristic agrarian institutions, and interracial and interethnic relations). Special attention paid to moments of real or apparent rupture in the social and political system, when these characteristic patterns and institutions were challenged or threatened: the Wars of Independence, the Revolution, and the recent conflict and crisis in Chiapas.     Power and Poverty     HIST-UA 743     Ludden. Offered every year.     This lecture/discussion course explores entanglements of power and poverty by focusing on dynamics of inequality during economic development under globalization. The course has four parts; each presents a particular angle of analysis. We begin with Amartya Sen\u2019s entitlement approach to famine. We then consider contemporary global issues. Our third project is to bring health into understandings of poverty and power. Last, we consider political struggles as potentially productive forces inside inequality environments.     Seminar: Constructions of Race in U.S. History     HIST-UA 680 Hodes.     Explores the ideas of race and how racial classifications have changed over time and across regions and cultures in the United States. Themes include language, color, law, science, slavery, mixed ancestries, and white identity.     Empires and Political Imagination     MAP-UA 552     Spring 2012     Burbank/Cooper     Throughout history, few people lived for very long under a polity that consisted entirely or even mainly of people with whom they shared a language and culture. Any examination of the variety of human cultures must take account of the political structures within which people tried to make their way, sometimes seeking higher degrees of autonomy, sometimes accommodating to rulers' authority, sometimes trying to extend their own power over others. Empires\u2013polities which maintained and enhanced social and cultural distinction even as they incorporated different people\u2013have been one of the most common and durable forms of political association. This course will focus on the comparative study of empires from the Romans and the Chinese to the present, and upon the variety of ways in which empires have inspired and constrained their subjects' ideas of rights, belonging, and power. The study of empire expands our ideas of citizenship and challenges the notion that the nation-state is &quot;natural&quot; and necessary.     Students in this course will explore historians' approaches to studying empires. We will investigate how empires were held together\u2013and where they were weak\u2013from perspectives that focus on political and economic connections over long distances and long time periods.     Readings will include historical scholarship on the Roman, Chinese, Mongol, Ottoman, Spanish, Russian, French, British, and American empires, as well as primary sources produced by people living in these and other imperial polities.     Colonial North America      HIST-UA 601     Spring 2012     Eustace     No further information.     Writing Stories / Making History     HIST-UA-569     Spring 2012     Eustace     Who killed the old widow in colonial Rhode Island? Her resentful adult son or her angry Indian servant? What can her death tell us about the tensions of early American patriarchy or the extent of interracial antagonisms in the colonies? Practitioners of microhistory use detailed retellings of the stories of ordinary people and events to try to reveal with sharpened clarity the issues that characterize whole cultures and societies. In this class, we will read a number of model microhistories, primarily based in early America. Doing so will familiarize students with key themes in early American history, while also helping them to think seriously about the strategic choices involved in producing stories and arguments around those themes.     History of Colonial Latin America      HIST-UA 743. 001     Spring 2012     Eineigel     The purpose of this course is to introduce students to the colonial origins of the Latin American region from the sixteenth-century conquest through the early nineteenth-century wars of independence. The course will focus on the ramifications of colonial social conflict and dynamics of gender, race, and class. Course materials will include primary and secondary historical texts and visual sources including film and documentaries. All these sources are intended to stimulate critical thinking and historical imagination about colonial Latin America.     Travel and Discovery in World History     13644 HIST-UA 830     Spring 2012     Ben-Dor     This seminar explores the development of travel and travel narratives in the early modern period, and their relationship to religion, trade, empires, myth, and naval history. Among the topics we will be thinking about are: pilgrimage, geography, cartography, cosmography, ethnography, scholars, missionaries (mostly Jesuits), and more. We will pay special attention to the history of the connection between travel writing and geography in the early modern and modern period before 20th century.     Italian Studies      Italian Colonialism     ITAL UA 167     Spring 2012     Ben-Ghiat     Studies Italian colonialism from the late 19th century through decolonization. Through readings of colonial travel literature, films, novels, diaries, memoirs, and histories, we address the meaning of colonialism within Italian history and culture, the specificities of Italian colonialism, and the legacies of colonialism in contemporary Italy. Syllabus     Journalism      Journalism &amp; Society: Minorities in the Media     JOUR-UA 503.002     Spring 2012     Pamela Newkirk     It has been 40 years since President Johnson\u2019s National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders released its findings on the civil unrest that erupted in urban areas across the nation. The panel, commonly referred to as the Kerner Commission, concluded that we are living in two nations, \u201cblack, white, separate and unequal,\u201d and devoted an entire chapter to the impact the media had on the nation\u2019s race relations. \u201cWe believe that the media have thus far failed to report adequately on the causes and consequences of civil disorders and the underlying problems of race relations,\u201d the report said. It added: \u201cThe media report and write from the standpoint of a white man\u2019s world. The ills of the ghetto, the difficulties of life there, the Negro\u2019s burning sense of grievance, are seldom conveyed.\u201d     The report criticized as \u201cshockingly backward\u201d the industry\u2019s failure to hire, train and promote African Americans. At the time, fewer than five percent of the newsroom jobs in the United States were held by African Americans. Today, despite the progress that\u2019s been made in the hiring and coverage of African Americans and other so-called minorities, many critics say that the Kerner Report findings continue to resonate today. With the report as a backdrop, we will examine the portrayals of racial and ethnic minorities in the media, paying particular attention to African Americans \u2013 the subject of the Kerner Report \u2013 but also others, including Latinos, Asians, women, and gays and lesbians. Syllabus (PDF)     Perspectives on Race and Class     JOUR-GA 1281.002     Spring 2012     Susie Linfield     This seminar examines the ways in which some of the major writers of the 20th and early 21st-centuries have reported on the key and ever-controversial issues of race and class. We will look at how these issues have, historically, been written about, and at how some of today's best reporters and essayists are approaching them; and we will explore how concepts of class and race have changed over the last century. Among the writers whose works we'll study are W.E.B. Du Bois, James Agee, George Orwell, James Baldwin, Jamaica Kincaid, Henry Louis Gates, Jr., William Finnegan, Anthony Lewis., and Orlando Patterson. We'll explore controversial issues such as affirmative action, the increasing polarization of wealth, and the legacy of slavery. This is an intensive reading course with a major final project. Syllabus (PDF)     Linguistics      Language in Latin America      LING-UA 30.001 (8615), SCA-UA 850-001     Spring 2012     Guy     Latin America is so-called because it was colonized by speakers of languages descended from Latin: Spanish, Portuguese and French. These languages have flourished and diversified in the Americas: Spanish is the national language of 19 New World countries, and Portuguese is the language of 200 million Brazilians. They have also changed: Brazilian Portuguese is markedly different from its European source, and Spanish in the Americas shows collective differences from European Spanish, as well as marked contrasts between regions and countries. These changes are partly a result of contact with the other languages currently or formerly spoken in Latin America, especially African languages like Yoruba and Kimbundu, and indigenous (Native American) languages like Quechua, Guarani, and Nahuatl. This course examines the linguistic variety of Latin America. We look at national and dialectal differences in Latin American Spanish and Portuguese; we also consider social diversity in language use: the ways of speaking of people of different class and ethnic backgrounds. Indigenous languages, and contact languages and creoles such as Media Lengua, Papiamentu, and Haitian Creole are also considered. Finally, we study the linguistic history of Latin America: how did the languages spoken there spread, develop, and interact, and what caused the changes that they experienced.     Music     The Art of Listening     MUSIC-UA 3     Spring 2012     Anoosua Mukherjee     This course is intended for students who are interested in the parallels between modern music and visual art. In this class, we will focus our attention on the ways in which listening and seeing are comparable, the relationship that exists between sound culture and visual art in the 20th-Century, and the complex interplay between the disciplines of musicology and art history. We will explore the challenges that modern composers and visual artists face and we will analyze the conceptual, stylistic, and geographical shifts that have taken place. As viewers and critics, we will also address questions about the modalities of making and appreciating music and visual art. How do we attribute meaning to the works that we experience? And how is this process affected by the space in which we encounter these works, namely the gallery and the concert hall?     We will begin our journey at the critical moment of transition from Romanticism to Modernism with an investigation of primitivism in painting and music at the turn of the 20th century. From there, we will proceed chronologically and thematically, taking care to address those pivotal moments such as the rise of feminism, the maturation of popular aesthetics and the evolution of cultural politics. We will examine the work of notable composers, artists and thinkers such as Paul Gaugain, Erik Satie, Aaron Copland, Takashi Murakami, Clement Greenberg and the members of the New York School. The course will conclude with a study of postmodernism and a discussion as to the future of modernism.     Topics in 20th-Century Music: In Search of the Authentic     MUSIC-UA 111     Spring 2012     David Samuels     This course will explore the near-simultaneous emergence of ethnomusicology, the folk music revival, and the historical performance movement as overlapping and interwoven 20th-century responses to Romanticism. All three rejected aspects of earlier aesthetic precepts in a search for new formulations of what might constitute &quot;authentic expression.&quot; We will explore the historical, cultural, and aesthetic importance of these interwoven musical and aesthetic practices.     Politics      Civil Liberties     POL-UA 332     Spring 2012     Khan     Interpretation of the Bill of Rights, the Civil War amendments, and other rights in the U.S. Constitution through the reading of Supreme Court opinions. Topics include freedom of speech and press; free exercise of religion and separation of church and state; the right of privacy; rights of the criminally accused; equal protection of the law against race, gender, and other discrimination; and the rights of franchise and citizenship.     Minority Representation in American Politics     V53.0380     Offered every year.     Explores whether and how racial and ethnic minorities are able to organize effectively and press their demands through the American political system. Specifically, focuses on the political behavior of minority citizens, the relative strength and effect of these groups at the polls and in political office, the theory and practice of group formation as it applies to minority groups, the responsiveness of elected officials, and the legal and constitutional obstacles and instruments that provide context and shape these phenomena.          Wealth, Power, and Status: Inequity in Society     V93.0137     Offered every year.     Sociological overview of the causes and consequences of social inequality. Topics include the concepts, theories, and measures of inequality; race, gender, and other caste systems; social mobility and social change; institutional supports for stratification, including family, schooling, and work; political power and the role of elites; and comparative patterns of inequality, including capitalist, socialist, and postsocialist societies.          Inequality: Social Stratification in a Changing World     V93.9137     Professor Rulikova          Seminar: Authoritarian Regimes &amp; Reversal     G53.3501     Professor Kancha Chandra          Social and Cultural Analysis      Intersections: Gender, Race, and Sexuality in U.S. History and Politics       SCA-UA 230 Can be substituted for SCA-UA 201.     Offered every year.     Draws on the histories of African, Asian, European, Latino, and Native Americans of both genders and many sexualities to explore the complex and important intersection of gender, race, and sexuality in the United States from the 17th century through the 20th, in historically related case studies. Starting in the period of European imperialism in the Americas, examines the ways that gender, race, and sexuality shaped cultural and political policies and debates surrounding the Salem witch trials; slavery, abolition, and lynching; U.S. imperialism in Puerto Rico and Hawaii; the politics of welfare and reproduction; cultural constructions of manliness, masculinity, and citizenship; and responses to the AIDS pandemic in a global context.     Postmodern Travel Fictions      SCA-UA 572     Offered in the spring.     This is a study of travel narratives by post\u2013World War II authors/filmmakers of the Americas. Designed to investigate relationships existing between travel narratives and legacy of colonialism in the Americas; between the concept of \u201cfreedom\u201d embodied in travel writing and the ideology of conquest engraved in historical memory; and between lost idealism of youth and melancholic romps across continents; and between literary representation and the perpetuation of racialized myths about North and South America. Emphasis on gendered dynamic of travel writing. How are notions of freedom and mobility tied to sexuality? Why do the protagonists of novels and films\u2014white, black, Latino, Asian American, or indigenous\u2014\u201cgo West,\u201d South, East, or North? Why do they ping-pong among these geographic and symbolic poles? What are the evaluative meanings assigned to the cartographically given spaces these protagonists choose to visit and these authors/directors choose to revise in their novels and films?     Concepts in Social and Cultural Analysis     SCA-UA 1     Offered every semester.     A gateway to all majors offered by SCA. Focuses on the core concepts that intersect the constituent programs of SCA: Africana Studies, American Studies, Asian/Pacific/ American Studies, Gender and Sexuality Studies, Latino Studies, and Metropolitan Studies. Surveys basic approaches to a range of significant analytical concepts (for example, property, work, technology, nature, popular culture, consumption, knowledge), each one considered within a two-week unit.     Empire for Liberty: The United States in the 19th Century     SCA-UA 231 Identical to HIST-UA 618.     Johnson. Offered every other year.     Tells the story of how the welter of social and cultural tendencies and tensions that characterized the first half of the 19th century in the United States was channeled into a war between two regions, the North and the South. The course is expansive in its framing of the Civil War era and broad in its treatment of the international dimensions of U.S. history. By seeking to place the central event of the century in a history of diplomacy and warfare that also included the War of 1812, the Mexican-American War, illegal invasions of Cuba and Nicaragua in the 1850s, and the Spanish-American War, it attempts to illuminate the imperial causes and consequences of this domestic conflict. And by embedding the conflict over slavery in the United States into the histories of the Haitian Revolution, the Louisiana Purchase, Indian removal, the Atlantic cotton economy, and the hemispheric history of antislavery, it seeks to call into question the nationalist and regionalist framing of the event that has dominated most mainstream accounts.     Ethnicity and the Media     SCA-UA 232     Offered every other year.     Examines media images in relation to the making of ethnic and racial identities in the United States. Surveys some of the theoretical approaches to the study of images, paying particular attention to the intersection of history and ideologies or representation. Looks into the nature and politics of stereotypes; inquires into their reproduction through discourses, representations, and practices; and then moves to a comparative examination of media images in relation to the making of African American, Asian, Latino, and Native American images in the media, looking specifically at changes and continuities in the representation of these four minority groups in the media.     Multiethnic New York     SCA-UA 363     Offered every two years.     As a global city, New York is one of the most ethnically and culturally diverse places in the world. In particular, the growth of migrant populations from Asia, Latin America, and the Caribbean is driving the transformation of New York\u2019s economic, social, and political landscape. This course both explores the global socioeconomic conditions that facilitate and sustain these migrations and examines the cultural practices, imaginaries, and strategies of migrants as they become part of the city.     Race and Rumors of Race     SCA-UA 154     Offered every year.     A multidisciplinary reading, writing, and discussion course on the concept of race. Though the focus is on \u201cblackness\u201d and \u201cwhiteness\u201d in the United States, there is some comparison to Brazil. We also pay some attention to those who have traditionally rejected the racial identities imposed on them and have suffered the consequences. The name of the course is borrowed from the title of a book written by Howard Washington Odum and published by the University of North Carolina Press in 1943.     The Postcolonial City     SCA-UA 166     Offered once every year.     Cities have played an important role throughout African history and in various Afrodiasporic contexts: from the metropolises of ancient Egypt and the urban centers of well-known West African civilizations (such as Ghana, Mali, and Songhai) to cities such as Port-au-Prince, Havana, and Georgetown in the Caribbean and the urban enclaves in the United States. In attending to the way actors constitute wealth and power\u2014in accounting for the way proximity structures interpersonal experiences\u2014this course uses ethnographic, sociological, historical, and literary texts to theorize the Afrodiasporic city. We explore the contours of these urban matrices through special attention to historical categories that prepare us to theorize the way Afrodiasporic populations have experienced and lived history (e.g., the precolonial, the colonial, and the postcolonial). As part of our mission, we consider the historical emergence of the Third World as not simply a broad rubric for African and Asian postcolonies, but instead, a project to reverse the course of European exploitation. Instead of proceeding strictly chronologically, students consider the Afrodiasporic urban experience thematically, through a diverse array of readings.     Approaches to American Studies     SCA-UA 201     Offered every year.     Offers a survey of American studies as a dynamic field of scholarship. Using a schedule of keywords, the course engages key themes and concerns, including war\u2019s role in social and political development, the meaning of borders, the politics of entertainment, public interest in private affairs, and the interplay of goods and labor in shaping national (and transnational) conditions of fulfillment and dignity. It is intended to serve as a gateway to lines of inquiry and analysis currently animating interdisciplinary study of \u201cAmerica\u201d; as an opportunity to relate current debates to respective historical contexts; and as an occasion to interrogate presumptions of the United States\u2019 exceptionality, at a time when its interrelation with broader worlds becomes ever more clear.          W. E. B. Du Bois and the Roots of Critical Race Thinking     SCA-UA 223     Offered every other year.     Addresses the work of the black thinker and leader W. E. B. Du Bois, who has long been acclaimed as the preeminent thinker in the African American tradition. Increasingly, though, he is seen as an indispensable modern intellectual, one whose ideas shape current lives and concerns. In examining Du Bois, we pursue changing ideas of intellectual responsibility in the modern world; clarify the unique way Du Bois merged self-, racial, and historical awareness into critical method; and relate his tendency to see race as a social construction, an approach that is transforming intellectual, social, and cultural life in the United States.          Comparative U.S. Ethnic Studies     SCA-UA 224     Offered every fifth semester.     Serves as an introduction to the interdisciplinary study of race and ethnicity in the United States and to the range of identities and issues inherent in American culture. No previous knowledge of ethnic studies is presumed, but the goal of the class is to create a framework for thoughtful discussion and analysis of race and ethnicity for students to use long after the completion of the class.          The Constitution and People of Color     SCA-UA 366 Identical to POL-UA 801, LWSOC-UA 327.     Offered every year.     Examines how the American legal system decided constitutional challenges affecting the empowerment of African, Latino, and Asian American communities from the 19th century to the present. Topics include the denial of citizenship and naturalization to slaves and immigrants, government-sanctioned segregation, the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II, the prison industry, police brutality, post-9/11 detention issues, and voting rights. Course requirements include attendance at a community function involving constitutional issues, a midterm, and an interactive oral and written final project comparing a present-day issue affecting racial minorities in New York City and proposing measures to collectively address the issue.     Reading Race and Representation     SCA-UA 368     Parikh. Offered every year.     Much contemporary public discourse characterizes race as a problem that some individuals \u201chave,\u201d or, even, a \u201ccard\u201d that some people \u201cplay.\u201d It is rarely recognized as a structural or material dimension that comprises everyday experience and knowledge. In this course, we ask what it means to \u201cread\u201d race in objects, spaces, and events that for the most part do not seem to be \u201cabout\u201d race per se. The course is organized around a series of such topics, which we consider from an interdisciplinary perspective, engaging historical and legal texts, literature, and film, as well as scholarship from anthropology, sociology, and history. Over the course of the semester, we address concepts and themes related to U.S. ethnic studies and critical race theory, including citizenship, rights, segregation, whiteness, colonialism, labor, migration, and alienness. The course provides an introduction to critical American studies as a field of scholarship that challenges our sense of the nation as socially and politically exceptional by asking what is forgotten or excluded in such a self-image.     Gender, Nation, and the Colonial Condition     SCA-UA 480 Prerequisite: SCA-UA 401 or permission of the instructor.     Advanced-level course. An interdisciplinary and comparative inquiry into the historical and contemporary linkages between gender dynamics, the culture of nationalism, and the politics of colonialism on an international scale. Studies different perspectives on the national question\u2014as a liberation movement, as a political ideology, and as a mechanism for inclusion/exclusion.     Latino/a Art and Performance in New York City     SCA-UA 532     Looks at the history of Latino/a art and performance in the context of New York City. In particular, students study Latino/a aesthetic practices within and against the social-political environment of their enactment. Latinos\u2019 role in the continually redefined realm of hip-hop, the extensive history of Latino contributions to the artistic vitality of the Lower East Side, and the theatrical production of Latino-specific community theatres represent a few of the areas that are explored. Students consider contemporary Latino art, and the institutions that support it, from the perspective of the changing Latino demographic of New York City. Furthermore, students examine and analyze the specific ways that artists utilize the city as a site for artistic possibility. This course brings together both an investigation of the aesthetics of Latino performance and an investigation of democratic possibilities of urban space. In addition to the weekly seminar meeting, students are required to attend several perfor-mances, visit art galleries, and execute a research project profiling a particular artist or institution.     Community Empowerment     SCA-UA 613     Offered in the spring.     Empowerment is defined as those processes, mechanisms, strategies, and tactics through which people, as well as organizations and communities, gain mastery over their lives. It is personal as well as institutional and organizational. This course addresses these issues in a wide variety of community settings. The course is designed to be challenging and rewarding to those students interested in helping people work together to improve their lives.          Culture of the City     SCA-UA 620     Offered in the spring.     Urban culture is a complex, fantastic part of daily life, encompassing everything from vaudeville, the public library, opera, and dance to the local bar, social club, and graffiti. By considering cities to be sources of cultural invention, this course explores, through literature, history, social science, and student experience, the evolution of high and popular culture, both modernist and postmodernist. Emphasis is on how cultures create bonds between specific interest groups and on how culture becomes the arena for acting out or resolving group conflict.     Urban Environmentalism     SCA-UA 631     Offered every other year.     Examines some of the many environmental issues facing people living in cities and towns around the world. It focuses on the practical, everyday realities of these issues, why they exist, and what can and should be done to change them. It uses these particularities to consider larger questions about the relationship between human society and the natural world in the urban context. Employing the analytic tools of sociology, the course grapples with ideas from economics, political science, philosophy, geography, and natural science to develop a theoretical framework for understanding environmental issues facing cities today.     American Dilemmas: Race, Inequality, and the Unfulfilled Promise of Education     SCA-UA 755 Identical to TCHL-UE 41.     No other information available.     Hip Hop and Politics     SCA-UA 280.001     A dominant thrust of contemporary political theory in the U.S. targets the \u201chip hop generation.\u201d From political commentary of Adolph Reed to the comedy of Bill Cosby one finds a critique of the \u201chip hop generation\u201d so dismissive it might be a useful point of departure for further historical and theoretical inquiry. This course mixes a diverse set of readings with music and film to interrogate the specific generational tensions that structure popular and intellectual discourses concerning the \u201chip hop generation\u201d and the perceived demise of progressive politics. (AF, AM, MET)     Sociology      The Family      S     OC-UA 451 Identical to SCA-UA 0724.     Gerson. Offered every year.     Introduction to the sociology of family life. Addresses a range of questions: What is the relationship between family life and social arrangements outside the family (for example, in the workplace, the economy, the government)? How is the division of labor in the family related to gender, age, class, and ethnic inequality? Why and how have families changed historically? What are the contours of contemporary American families, and why are they changing?     Race and Ethnicity     SOC-UA 135 Identical to SCA-UA 0803.     Conley, Duster, Morning. Offered every year     What is 'race' exactly? Defining the concept presents a real challenge. This class explores what race and ethnicity mean, beginning with historical ideas about human difference. Comparing American beliefs and practices to those found in other societies, we will pay special attention to the particular notions and hierarchies of race that emerge in different times and places. The course also investigates the roles that institutions like the media, the arts, the state, and the sciences play in shaping our understandings of race and ethnicity. We will conclude by considering the predictions that scholars have made about the future of racial stratification in the United States.

The American Ghetto     SOC-UA 139     Offered every spring.     This course examines the concept of the \u201cghetto,\u201d with particular focus on urban communities in the post World War II era. We will use empirical research, literature and other forms of text and media to consider the following questions: What is a ghetto, and what forms has the ghetto taken in the United States? Is there something unique about urban, African-American ghettos? How and why did urban ghettos emerge, and how have they changed over time? What, if any, are the consequences of the American ghetto for racial and economic inequality in America? What role has the state played in the production, maintenance or dismantling of the ghetto, and what role can/should it play?

Morse Academic Plan (MAP)      Texts and Ideas: Topics\u2014On Liberation      MAP-UA 400     Fall 2011     Prof. Watson (English)     What is liberation? What is the political form that allows for maximum freedom, and how is it to be achieved? How have the concepts of freedom, slavery and oppression been articulated by thinkers from Plato to Gandhi? We examine these enduring questions through a wide historical and cultural lens, aiming to understand and map out competing ideas around the conditions for freedom (and unfreedom). To this end, we read seminal works theorizing the relationship between the individual and the collective, ideas of sovereignty, the ideal state and the revolutionary nation, and arguments for violence and non-violence. While grounded in Western thought on the topic, we also pay attention to how the struggles and theorizations of the non-West (the Haitian Revolution, the Algerian and Indian independence struggles, postcolonialism and the Tricontinental) have shaped our inquiry into the nature and promise of liberation. Reading: Epictetus\u2019 Handbook, Plato\u2019s Republic, Equiano\u2019s Life, Shakespeare\u2019s Tempest, Rousseau\u2019s Discourse on Inequality, Mill\u2019s On Liberty, selections from Marx, James\u2019 Black Jacobins, Cesaire\u2019s Discourse on Colonialism, Gandhi\u2019s Hind Swaraj, Freire\u2019s Pedagogy of the Oppressed. syllabus          Texts and Ideas: Topics\u2014The Deliberating Citizens     MAP-UA 400     FALL 2011     Prof. Connolly (Classics)     What capacities help us function as citizens\u2014members of a community larger than ourselves, our friends, and our families? Some argue we must develop our capacities of reason and argument; others advocate a transformed conception of the individual. Some focus on the management of emotions, especially affection and sympathy; still others insist on the importance of belief in God, cultivating the imagination, or remembering the past. We read philosophers (Plato, Locke, Kant, Adam Smith, John Dewey, Hannah Arendt), a historian (Thucydides), and scripture (Genesis and Exodus), and also examine works that address the role of art and music in creating and critiquing civic values: Euripides\u2019 Bacchae, Vergil\u2019s Aeneid, Melville\u2019s \u201cBartleby the Scrivener,\u201d and John Ford\u2019s Westerns. syllabus          Texts and Ideas: Topics\u2014Freedom and Oppression     MAP-UA 400     SPRING 2012     Prof. Kunhardt (History)     Examines the human quest for freedom\u2014freedom from slavery, from sexual oppression, and from the shackling of the mind\u2014as these three came to a crisis in nineteenth century America. We begin with a critical reading of formative biblical texts and ideas; touch down on the passionate thought-world of the American founders; and culminate in a close look at mid-nineteenth century reform efforts, and the ideas of freedom that animated them. Exploring the dawn of biblical humanism, the embrace of the secular, and efforts to widen the circles of inclusion, we pay particular attention to the writings of Abraham Lincoln and his generation, as he and others, both allies and critics, worked to eradicate slavery from American society. Why did the Bible condone slavery, helping Americans justify continuing the practice? In what ways are competing ideas of freedom to be judged? How is the idea of freedom related to that of human equality? Readings: Genesis, Exodus, Psalms, Isaiah, Matthew, Luke; and works by Paine, Jefferson, Madison, Garrison, Douglass, Sumner, Stanton, Anthony, Rose, Emerson, Thoreau, Whitman, Parker, Mill, Ingersoll, Lincoln. syllabus     Cultures and Contexts: Indigenous Australia      MAP-UA 536     Fall 2011     Prof. Myers (Anthropology)     The indigenous people of Australia have long been the subject of interest and imagination by outsiders for their cultural formulations of kinship, ritual, art, gender, and politics, and they have entered into representations as distinctively &quot;Other&quot;\u2014whether in negative or positive formulations of the &quot;Primitive.&quot; These representations\u2014in feature films about them such as Walkabout and Rabbit Proof Fence, in New Age Literature, or museum exhibitions\u2014are now also in dialogue with their own forms of cultural production. At the same time, Aboriginal people have struggled to reproduce themselves and their traditions in their own terms, asserting their right to forms of cultural autonomy and self-determination. We explore the historical and geographical range of Aboriginal Australian forms of social being through ethnographic texts, art, novels, autobiographies, film and other media, and consider the ways in which identity is being challenged and constructed. syllabus     Cultures and Contexts: New World Encounters      MAP-UA 541     Fall 2011     Prof. Ben-Dor Benite (History/Middle Eastern and Islamic Studies)     We discover the ways in which people \u201cdiscovered\u201d the world during the 15th and 16th centuries and ask what gave that period the title: \u201cThe Age of Discovery.\u201d We ask why do people \u201cexplore.\u201d We investigate the ways in which people have created, traveled to, encountered, and reported on \u201cnew-worlds.\u201d We read the accounts of sailors, pirates, merchants, explorers, missionaries and pilgrims. We discuss the themes of history, religion, geography, and imagination and see how they shaped the ways in which people encountered new worlds. We ask how \u201cfrontiers\u201d are created and we focus on issues such as: distances and altitudes, culture, modes of travel, food, sex, music, and many others. syllabus          Cultures and Contexts: New World Encounters      MAP-UA 541     Fall2011     Prof. Lane (Spanish &amp; Portuguese)     What was America before it was called America? How did indigenous cultures understand and document their first encounters with Europeans? We focus on peoples, events, and cultural expressions associated with the conquest and colonization of the Americas, concentrating on three key areas: central Mexico, home to a several pre-Columbian societies, most notably the Aztec Empire, and later the seat of Spanish power in northern Latin America (the Viceroyalty of New Spain); the central Andes, home of the Incas and later the site of Spanish power in southern Latin America (the Viceroyalty of Peru); and finally, early plantation societies of the Caribbean, where the violent history of enslaved Africans in the new world unfolded. On one hand, we explore how those subjugated by conquest and colonialism interpreted, resisted, and recorded their experience. On the other, we ask what new cultural forms emerged from these violent encounters, and consider their role in the foundation of &quot;Latin American&quot; cultures. Readings balance a range of primary documents and art created during the &quot;age of encounter,&quot; including maps, letters, paintings, and testimonials, along with historical and theoretical texts. syllabus          Cultures and Contexts: Globalizing the Americas     MAP-UA 550     Fall 2011     Prof. Khan (Anthropology)     The idea of \u201cAmerica\u201d has long been dissected and reconstituted by a number of ideologues, theorists, policymakers, artists, activists, and ordinary people. Each has sought to craft a new existence that distinguished itself from \u201cOld World\u201d tyranny and tensions, significantly through the creation of imagined communities of identity and belonging, based on various cultural, political-economic, and social criteria. We focus on studies of selected communities (e.g., the concept and experience of race in Brazil, homophobia in the West Indies) and historical events (e.g., 19th-20th century migrations of Asians to Central America) and explore how global visions and international movements as, for example, Negritude, Pan-Americanism, Pan-Africanism, cosmopolitanism, and mestizaje/creolite emerge from local currents and practices. syllabus          Religious studies      Topics in Religious Studies: Religion, Health &amp; Medicine     RELST-UA 650     Spring 2012     Petro Does prayer help the sick heal faster? Does positive thinking ward off illness? Should faith play a role in modern medicine? These questions permeate contemporary discussions of health and medicine. In this course, we examine questions about the proper relationship between religion and medicine by assaying the historical and cultural contexts out of which they have arisen in the first place. That is: Why do we think about religion, health, and medicine today in the ways that we do? To answer this, we trace the religious roots of modern medicine in the nineteenth century alongside the development of new forms of faith healing and alternatuve medicine over the past century. This course will investigate how religious and moral narratives have informed our very understandings of disease, our conceptions of health and the body, and our approaches to contemporary medicine. Readings will focus especially on Christian, Jewish, and New Age currents in the United States and will draw from religious studies, medical anthropology, and the history of medicine.     Undergraduate- Gallatin School of Individualized Study     Indigenous Culture and Cultural Authenticity      IDSEM-UG1684     Spring 2012     Luke Fleming     Even as indigenous groups have found themselves subjugated by centuries of colonialism, they are increasingly finding that they must prove their \u201cindigeneity\u201d to legal, national, or colonial authorities so as to gain territorial, cultural and political rights. Here, national and colonial authorities are concerned to distinguish inauthentic from authentic cultural practice and tradition. But what does it mean for a culture to be \u201cauthentic\u201d? What are the criteria by which cultures are evaluated as legitimate or spurious, and who judges? This course interrogates the relationship between discourses of cultural authenticity and performances of indigenous identity as a lens through which to understand the particularly post-colonial (and post-modern) predicaments of indigenous peoples today. The course will look at how the concept of indigeneity as a globalized identity-category has emerged historically out of conditions of settler colonialism. We examine common strains in colonial, anthropological, missionary and tourist encounters with local linguistic and cultural communities in order to better understand how indigenous peoples have been represented and constructed as social \u201cOthers\u201d, and how indigenous \u201cculture\u201d\u2014as a set of objectified practices\u2014has been discovered, documented, and often prohibited through these encounters. An aim of this course is to understand the double-bind that indigenous groups face: they must publically display signs of \u201ctraditional\u201d indigenous culture in order to gain recognition, but in performing \u201cindigeneity\u201d they are then accused of being fakes. Readings may include: James Clifford, The Predicament of Culture; Jean &amp; John Comaroff, Ethnicity, Inc. ; Kirk Dombrowski, Against Culture: Development, Politics, and Religion in Indian Alaska; Jean Jackson &amp; Warren Kay (eds.), Indigenous Movements, Self-Representation, and the State in Latin America ; and Elizabeth Povinelli, The Cunning of Recognition: Indigenous Alterities and the Making of Australian Multiculturalism .     World Dance     ARTS-UG1212     Spring 2012     Ze'eva Cohen     Dance reflects cultural heritage and is a key to understanding diverse societies. In this arts workshop, students will explore dance as it appears on several continents. Dance can be seen as encoded forms of a society's religious, artistic, political, economic, and familial values. Readings cover issues of globalization, fusion and authenticity. Migration, missionaries, trade routes and the diaspora have led to the creation of new dance forms like &quot;Bollywood&quot; and &quot;Tribal&quot; that are a synthesis of earlier forms. Students will be introduced to different dance forms through selected readings, rich collection of video footage and studio practice often lead by various guest artists. After a brief warm-up, the class will learn simple steps, floor plans and rhythms from the music and dance cultures being studied. Students will chose a dance form as their project and themselves become researchers, performers and creators of new forms.     First-Year Research Seminar: Storytelling and Collective Identity     FIRST-UG733     Spring 2012     Sharon Fulton     Sharing stories may draw together two friends, inspire a political party to action, sway a jury, delight an audience, instruct a congregation, or unite a tribe, race, or nation. In this research and writing course, students will define \u201cthe story\u201d using narrative theory, study the relationship between storytelling and identity formation by analyzing recent psychological findings, and finally learn how stories foster a sense of community by evaluating anthropological and sociological articles. With this critical background, we will examine the formative storytelling in selections from Boccaccio\u2019s Decameron and Geoffrey Chaucer\u2019s Canterbury Tales for a historical perspective before looking at contemporary Native American communities that preserve collective identity through oral histories and stories. We conclude by exploring popular movements such as The Moth live storytelling performances and poetry slams. Students will debate how groups organized to create and appreciate stories offer a sense of identity in the modern world. For their research projects, students may pursue a variety of topics related to storytelling, such as political speech and propaganda; advertising strategies; ancient epic traditions; preaching and religious parable; folklore; mythology; survivors\u2019 tales; and oral history projects. Students may also wish to conduct more research about the literary, psychological, or anthropological approaches to storytelling that we reviewed earlier in the semester.      First-Year Research Seminar: Memory and the City     FIRST-UG737     Joanna Scutts     How does a city \u2018remember\u2019 the past lives of its inhabitants? How do the peculiar characteristics of a city like New York\u2014its population density, cultural diversity, and constant evolution\u2014affect the memories of the individuals and groups who live there? This seminar will explore the interplay between memory and the city through the study and analysis of literary texts, photographs, monuments, maps and movies. A wide range of theoretical readings will provide us with a working critical vocabulary for investigating questions of cultural memory and memorialization. The research paper will explore some aspect of the creation, ideology and reception of a commemorative site in New York City. Sites could include major memorials such as the National September 11 Memorial and Museum, Ellis Island, or the Irish Hunger Memorial; a smaller museum or commemorative site such as the Lower East Side Tenement Museum, the African Burial Grounds, the Stonewall Inn, or the statues in a city park; or an unofficial, virtual, or erased memorial. Writers and artists may include Sigmund Freud, Walter Benjamin, James Young, Art Spiegelman, Jane Jacobs, E.B. White, Susan Sontag, Tony Kushner, and Woody Allen.     Of Fire and Blood: Art-making, Culture and Mythology in Mexico      ARTS-UG1431     Spring 2012     Jaime Arredondo     A rich landscape of art and culture flourished in Mexico for thousands of years beginning with the Olmec civilization at around the second millennium before Christ. With the arrival of the Spaniards in 1519, a new hybrid culture resulted from the fusion of two different worlds, the Iberian and the Native American: a fusion which continues to exist and grow to the present day. This interdisciplinary workshop will closely examine the art, culture and mythology of Mexico, both before and after the conquest, and combine our study of it with hands on art making. The course will begin with a brief overview of the major Mexican muralists, Rivera, Orozco, and Siquieros, and American artists who were influenced by them such as Guston, O'keefe, and Pollock. It will then move chronologically from the Olmec culture occurring 4,000 years ago; Teotihuacan, or the City of the Gods; the Toltecs of Tula, from which emerged Quetzalcoatl the &quot;Feathered Serpent&quot;, a figure that inspired art for centuries; the hyper-religious Aztecs; the large and complex Mayan culture; and lastly, the new hybrid art formed by the synthesis of Spanish and Native American cultures. Topics to be covered will include: astrology/astronomy; religion and shamanism; mythology; and human sacrifice. Museum trips, slide shows, videos, and the reading of rare texts such as the Popul Vuh will also be scheduled.     Cultural Mapping for Social Change     CLI-UG1422     Spring 2012     Jaime Martinez     Where do forces of gentrification intersect with grassroots efforts to preserve the cultural identity of a marginalized community? How are demographics used as a tool by political activists to organize campaigns? How is mapping being used in campaigns to affect social change? This course explores how to use Geographic Information Systems (GIS), a powerful application in mapping technology, as a tool for cultural documentation, community engagement, and public policy analysis. We will explore the effectiveness of GIS as a mapping tool to help understand historical patterns of demographics, and empower community members to become informed citizens in the decision-making process. Specific skills we&amp;apos;ll learn include how to geocode addresses, do a spatial analysis, and use census data to map the racial and income composition of New York neighborhoods. You will also work with local community based organizations to understand how community non-profits are using GIS mapping as a tool for research and strategic planning.     Policy, Community, and Self     CLI-UG1466     Sprig 2012     Eric Brettschneider     Intended to introduce policy, this course will include an internship at a policy and /or advocacy organization. Community building, service integration and child welfare will be featured in readings, discussion, and internships. Through examples such as ethnic matching placements in foster care, zero tolerance approaches to drug abuse, or public financing of political campaigns, students will come to understand how government, schools, gangs, religious institutions and families can, with varying degrees of explicitness and formality, all make policy. Students will at the course conclusion be able to: identify policies within their lives; argue all sides of a policy question; appreciate the importance of evidence; and distinguish implementation from formulation. Readings will include Bowling Alone, by Robert Putnam, and The Lost Children of Wilder, by Nina Bernstein. Students will be helped to connect meetings they attend and the policy concepts taught and discussed in class. The goal is to leave no student unaware of the importance of policy in their own and their community's life. The course will focus on policies that are empowering. Assignments will include an internship journal.     First-Year Research Seminar: Identity and the Cultural Construction of Race and Ethnicity     FIRST-UG738     Spring 2012     Laurie Woodard     Identity: the ways in which we see our selves; the ways in which others see us; the dynamic relationship between these two seemingly distinct and often irreconcilable poles is the underlying theme of this first-year research seminar. We will focus specifically on the ways in which we create, build, rebuild, and live our racial identities in constant dialogue with contemporary American societal constructions of race and ethnicity. Questions we will explore include: what is race? Is it immutable? How do we know it when we see it? How is it distinct from ethnicity? What is gained and/or lost by considering or not considering race today? In what ways do other facets of identity, for example gender, sexuality, and class inform, challenge, reconstruct, or deconstruct our racial identities? We will employ historical, sociological, and cultural lenses. Several short written assignments will help students formulate, research, and respond to questions about racial identity in a longer final research paper. Text will include fiction, plays, theory and criticism including Lorraine Hansberry\u2019s A Raisin in the Sun , The Elephant Vanishes by Haruki Murakami, Julia Alvarez\u2019s How the Garcia Girls Lost Their Accents , \u201cSlavery, Race, and Ideology in the United States by Barbara Fields, Stuart Hall\u2019s \u201cWhat is This Black in Black Popular Culture,\u201d Kip Fulbeck\u2019s What Are You? , Heid E. Erdrich and Laura Tohe collection Sister Nations: Native American Women Writers On Community , Edward Said\u2019s Orientalism , Matthew Jacobson\u2019s Whiteness of a Different Color , and Off with  Her Head!: The Denial of Women's Identity in Myth, Religion, and Culture edited by Howard Eilberg-Schwartz and Wendy Doniger.          First-Year Research Seminar: Adventure Narratives     FIRST-UG730     Spring 2012     Tara Gellene     Adventure narratives have been a popular sub-genre of both fiction and non-fiction for over a century. In such narratives, men and women typically seek out, or are thrust into, unfamiliar spaces where they confront elemental forces. Some adventurers traverse dramatic natural environments--The Arctic and Antarctic Poles, Mt. Everest\u2014while others explore spaces of dramatic cultural difference. We will explore how and why these spaces are represented as staging grounds for conflicts with principles of gender, power, and moral life. Students will write three analytic essays and a longer research essay as they explore some of the following questions: Why are these conflicts desirable to adventurers and to those who admire them? How do these often masculine narratives represent women and domesticity, especially when dealing with women adventurers? How do they represent the people who populate the adventurous landscape? Are adventurers ultimately imperial or anti-social? Theoretical sources may include Immanuel Kant, Sigmund Freud, Mariana Torgovnick, William Cronon, and Frederick Jackson Turner. Other readings may include works by H. Rider Haggard, Rudyard Kipling, Amelia Earhart, Richard Burton, Ernest Shackleton, Jon Krakauer, Joseph Conrad, Cormac McCarthy, Jamyang Norbu, and Charles Johnson.     Narrating Memory, History and Place     IDSEM-UG1568     Spring 2012     Marie Cruz Soto     This course examines how people imagine a place of their own through narrations of the past. The past, after all, is a contested terrain open to divergent interpretations that shape common understandings of places. The meanings bestowed on places dictate who can use them, and how. Thus, the ways through which people narrate the past can transform places. This course, therefore, explores the broad interplay between narrations of memory, history and place. It focuses, however, on the politics of historical narrations in struggles of disempowered communities to claim a place of their own. Course readings include literary and other scholarly texts like Jamaica Kincaid\u2019s A Small Place, Michel-Rolph Trouillot\u2019s Silencing the Past and Michel De Certeau\u2019s The Practice of Everyday Life as well as writings by Edward Said, William Cronon, Diana Taylor, Steven Hoelscher and Doreen Massey.     Barbarians: Ancient Conceptions of the Outsider     IDSEM-UG1593     Spring 2012     Hallie Franks     The conceptions of people outside of one's own culture are complex and multi-layered, and this was as true in the ancient world as it is today. From the conquered Elamites that were depicted on the palace walls of the Neo-Assyrian Assurbanipal, to the mythical Ethiopians of Homer's epics, or to the Gauls with whom Julius Caesar did battle, representations of other kinds of people serve as a backdrop against which a distinctive sense of cultural identity is clarified or reinforced. This seminar explores the representation of &quot;foreign&quot; peoples in the visual arts and literature of the ancient Near Eastern, Greek, and Roman worlds. Using visual (reliefs, vase-painting, sculpture, mosaics, and wall-painting) and written (inscriptions, epic poetry, drama, histories, novels) sources, we pursue the following questions: What role do local ideals play in the construction and definition of another culture? What are the political or social motivations for the representations of foreigners in ancient art and literature? To what extent does the definition of an &quot;other&quot; reflect an already defined identity, and to what extent is identity constituted by imagining difference? Readings may include Simone de Beauvoir, Clifford Geertz, Euripides Medea, Aeschylus The Persians, Herodotus, Caesar The Gallic Wars, Heliodorus Aethiopika (The Ethiopian Romance).     Between Rights and Justice in Latin America     IDSEM-UG1580     Spring 2012     Alejandro Velasco     What is the relationship between human rights and social justice? Do both always operate in conjunction? Are they ever mutually exclusive\u2014one sacrificed at the expense of the other? This course explores key questions around the theory and practice of human rights promotion, surveying specialized literature and founding documents to consider the promise and challenge of existing human rights frameworks as they work for, but sometimes clash with, the promotion of social justice. We ask, are there universal rights? If so, how are these defined, and by whom? What is the relationship between &quot;political&quot; and &quot;human&quot; rights, between individual and collective rights? Can human rights be in conflict, and if so, how are such conflicts to be resolved? In regions rife with inequality\u2014political, social, and economic\u2014is promoting a global human rights agenda unrealistic, or more necessary than ever? After exploring these general questions, we will focus on Latin America, in particular on Argentina, Guatemala, Chile, Bolivia, Colombia, and Mexico. How do human rights struggles in these countries change our view of the prevailing human rights regime? How do legacies of colonialism in these countries affect both the protection and violation of human rights in the present? Do these countries reveal a political tension social justice and human rights? Readings will draw from Bartolom\u00e9 de las Casas, Ariel Dorfman, Elena Poniatowska, Alison Brysk, and Greg Grandin, among others.     American Narratives I: American Literature, Race and Politics     IDSEM-UG1592     Spring 2012     George Shulman     The premise of this course is that there is no great political philosophy in the American tradition\u2014the Federalist Papers do not rival Plato or Marx\u2014but that profound thinking about politics does occur\u2014in the literary art of Melville, Faulkner, Ellison, Mailer, and Morrison among others. Moreover, formally &quot;political\u201d writers, like Madison and Hamilton, present a world that seems antithetical to the world presented by, say, Melville and Morrison: one depicts rational bargaining and self-interested contracts among men in markets and legislatures, whereas the other depicts racial and sexual violence, rape and slavery, in claustrophobic domestic spaces or in nature on frontiers. One depicts rationality and progress, the other madness and tragedy. The literature thus makes visible what is made invisible by prevailing forms of political science and American political thought, not only the constitutive power of race, gender, and sex, but also the deep narrative forms structuring the culture. We therefore ask several basic questions. First, what accounts for this difference and how shall we understand it? Second, what can we learn about (American) political life if we read literature as a form of political theory? But third, do we lose what is precious about literary art if we reduce it to an argument about politics? Or is the literary/aesthetic character of a work\u2014the ways it uses language and narrative to create both ambiguity and meaning\u2014an important part of what it can teach us about politics and political theorizing? To pursue these questions we focus on Alexis de Tocqueville\u2019s Democracy in America , Herman Melville\u2019s Moby Dick , and Toni Morrison\u2019s Playing in the Dark and Beloved .     Health and Human Rights in the World Community     IDSEM-UG1641     Spring 2012     Allen Keller     This course focuses on the relationship between health and human rights. First, it provides an overview of human rights violations in the world and it offers an analysis of the health consequences of human rights abuses. Second, it explores how individual and community health can be improved by protecting and promoting human rights. Third, it evaluates the ethical obligations of health professionals in the face of human rights violations, and it explores their role in caring for the victims. Intended for non-science as well as science majors, we use presentations and discussion to explore the link between health and human rights. Readings include Claude and Weston, Human Rights in the World Community: Issues and Actions, and Martin and Rangaswamy, eds., Twenty Five Human Rights Documents.     Dangerous and Intermingled II: Subaltern New York     IDSEM-UG1667     Spring 2012     Jack Tchen     In the world of political moralists, intermingled New York has and still represents the epitome of danger and evil about the American experiment\u2014the public intermixture of classes, genders, races, sexualities, spiritualisms, and the-devil-knows-what-else!#? As elite Protestants created a refined European-affected \u201chigh brow\u201d culture, they also created myriad \u201cothers\u201d\u2014a transgressive, lowly polyglot city of shadows, miscegenation, and impurity. The docks, the Bowery, The Five Points, Greenwich Village, LES/Loisaida, Chinatown, and Harlem were all forged against the repressed imaginings of the powerful and the distinguished. This peoples\u2019 Gotham, this disdained intertwined underworld of music, slang, jokes, songs, stories, foodways, and marvels of people will be the focus of this advanced research seminar. Course materials will include: Wallace &amp; Burrow\u2019s Gotham, Burn\u2019s documentary New York, Smith\u2019s Decolonizing Methodologies, and a course reader. Research walks and visits off campus will be held during lab hours on Fridays. Students will learn how to conduct a case study using primary sources.     * This professor is reccomended     The Politics of Food     IDSEM-UG1674     Spring 2012     Myisha Priest     In this class we will explore food as an explicitly political space, one that demarcates racial and cultural boundaries and shapes identities. We will address these core concerns, in part, by engaging works of literature that examine the relationship between food and the expression of culture, history and trauma. Course texts may include novels like Nervous Conditions, Breath Eyes Memory, Beloved , and Black Boy . Nowhere is food more politically and culturally charged than in NYC, so the city will also be our classroom. We negotiate the porous yet enduring boundaries of race and culture as often as we eat, walk or shop in Little Italy or Little India, Koreatown or Chinatown, Le Petite Senegal or Harlem. None of these places or cuisines is in any way associated with contemporary American food culture, which has historically harkened to preserving what is &quot;authentically&quot; American. These difference can be understood as forms of exclusion as well as cultural preservation\u2014 but either way they are lines of demarcation that make legible forms of power. We will use a variety of texts to investigate dynamics of power represented in and by food. Who is food for? How does the representation of food reify and negotiate the boundaries of race and culture?     Cross-Cultural Encounters on the Renaissance Stage      IDSEM-UG1687     Spring 2012     Valerie Forman     The Renaissance witnessed both an explosion in theatrical innovation and an increasingly global world--the beginnings of global trade, the \u201cdiscovery\u201d of the New World, and bouts of both conflict and cooperation among the world\u2019s powers. By reading plays that stage encounters between Europeans from different countries and of different religions, between Europeans and the Ottoman Empire, among natives of \u201cIndia,\u201d and among Europeans, Native Americans, and African slaves, we will explore how and why the stage became such a significant site for the representation of cross-cultural encounters. Some questions we will explore include: how do these plays represent conflict\u2014between self and other and over goods and territory\u2014and what possibilities for reconciliation do they imagine? How do these plays understand the differences encountered as a result of travel, trade, and exploration? Why did the theatre develop a fascination with the exotic (for example, with cannibals and pirates)? In what ways did what it means to be European, Christian, or even a good wife or husband get defined and altered by these encounters? In keeping with the theme of encounters, this course will stage a number of creative encounters from the period: between works from different European nations; between plays and the prose works with which they were in dialogue; and between written and visual materials, for example, engravings of the New World and its inhabitants. In the cases where translations exist, we will also read accounts of how non-Europeans viewed Europe. Likely authors include, Shakespeare, Marlowe, Cervantes, Montaigne, Behn, Fletcher, DeBry, and Massinger.     Writing your Ancestry     K30.1336     Nancy Agabian     This workshop will give students the opportunity to practice elements of creative nonfiction through a multi-faceted approach to writing on ancestry and cultural heritage. The main goal will be a written exploration of the self to consider wider issues of history, community, identity, place, and family. The major assignments will be structured around various tasks: a personal essay will help to define themes and set scenes in the present; memoir writing will involve mining your memories of family to identify possible leads into the past; a reported piece will entail interviews of family members, archival research, and/or a visit to an ancestral site. These essays will be developed gradually with the help of shorter at-home assignments and in-class exercises on style, structure, and strategy. Revision will be built into the process, and we will read each other's work and give supportive feedback throughout the semester. Likely authors to be read and discussed for inspiration will include Ian Frazier, Honor Moore, Lawrence Weschler, Sarah Vowell, Bliss Broyard, Brenda Lin, Tara Bray Smith, and D.J. Waldie     Native American Film and Video: Performing Self-Representation through Media      ARTS-UG 1604     This course will study the ways that Indigenous peoples and independent Native artists in the Americas have turned to film, video, and digital arts to dispute ethnographic and Hollywood imagery, and create their own audiovisual media \u201cfrom within.\u201d We will explore notions of Third and Fourth cinema, indigenous self-representation, collective authorship, Indigenous people\u2019s representation, in mainstream films, photography, and exhibition sites such as museums. We will research specific authors and media projects, and discuss the roles of the institutions that present this work through exhibitions, events, festivals, and publications. The course features guest lecturers and requires class viewing of films and videos that are otherwise unavailable on the market. Central readings may include Through Navajo Eyes: An Exploration in Film and Communication and Anthropology (1997), by Sol Worth and John Adair, Unthinking Eurocentrism: Multiculturalism and the Media (1994), by Ella Shohat and Robert Stam, Wiping the War Paint Off the Lens: Native American Film and Video (2001), by Beverly Singer, and Global Indigenous Media: Cultures, Poetics and Politics, by Pamela Wilson and Michelle Stewart (2008). Films will include works by Victor Masayesva, Jr. (Hopi), Dante Cerano (Purepecha), Zacharias Kunuk (Inuit), and works from the Video in the Villages project in Brazil.     Oral History, Cultural Identity, and the Arts     K40.1045     Professor Sloan     Oral History is a complex process in the creation of artistic projects across the disciplines: documentary film, theatre, book arts, exhibitions, web art, public radio, etc. This course offers training in interviewing and editing techniques, and looks at the impact of &quot;truth-telling&quot; on the people we interview, their families and friends, ourselves and the culture at large. Research explores the balance in accurately reflecting the realities and integrity of the people represented while staying true to the vision of the artist/creator and addresses some of the following questions: Who has a right to a story? How do we represent people with different experiences than our own? What are the nuances in understanding needed for representing people in our own culture and identity or those from a different cultural or class background? Readings include (but are not limited to): Greg Halpern's Harvard Works Because We Do; Art Spiegelman's Maus I &amp; II; Ira Berlin, et.al (eds) Remembering Slavery; Warren Lehrer and Judith Sloan's Crossing the BLVD; Jim Fricke and Charlie Ahearn's Oral History of Hip-Hop's First Decade Yes Yes Y'all; as well as works by Studs Terkel, Anna Deveare-Smith, and articles and theory on oral history as a field of study. Guest lectures by filmmakers, book artists, theatre artists as well as viewing of films and listening to public radio projects will be included in the weekly class sessions. For final projects students create collaborative or solo work in the discipline of their own training; theatre, artist books, photography, poetry, music, radio, audio art, film or video.     First-Year Interdisciplinary Seminar: What is &quot;Development?&quot;     FIRST-UG 76     From Bono to indigenous community activists in the Amazon, everyone is talking about 'development.' The term, however, means different things to different people and has a long and contentious history. This class provides an introduction to the study of international development and poverty from an interdisciplinary perspective. To begin, it examines the different measures of the state of development, from conventional economic metrics like Gross Domestic Product to notions of &quot;Development as Freedom.&quot; Building on this, it then explores some of the most influential contemporary voices in the process of development. Of central importance here will be a consideration of the central development actors, including multilateral institutions like the UN and World Bank, as well as states, NGOs, and community groups. Finally, it will explore some of the key themes in contemporary development policy, including gender, the environment, and human rights. The goal is to provide a clear sense of the chief objects, processes, actors, and policies of international development in order to grapple with the important stakes held by these different approaches to combating global poverty. Readings may include: Amartya Sen, Joseph Stiglitz, Jeff Sachs, Bill Easterly, and Dambisa Moyo          Media, Culture, and Communication      Space and Place in Human Communication     MCC-UE 1002     This course will build on a core concept of Lewis Mumford who understood media ecology as a component of spatial and urban ecology. Emphasis will be given on how space socially organizes human meaning and on the inscription of space. How do people, through their practices and their being in the world, form relationships with the locales they occupy (both the natural world and the build environment)? How do they attach meaning to spaces to create places? And how do the experiences of inhabiting, viewing, and hearing those places shape their meanings, communicative practices, cultural performances, memories, and habits? Course themes include: mapping and the imagination; vision and space, soundscape, architecture and landscape, new media and space/time compression; space and identity; spatial violence; spatialization of memory.     Youth Media: Communication, Community, &amp; Social Change     MCC-UE 1017     This course explores the theory, practice, and impact of the non-profit youth media organizations and school-based programs working in this field locally and around the world. Students will also use media production to conduct fieldwork in the New York City area that further builds the subfields of youth media/youth development, teaching and learning, and community building. Research projects will document and investigate how youth media is supporting the development of young people's capacities for 21st century skills of digital communication, critical literacy, and civic engagement.     Media and Identity     MCC-UE 1019     Study and exploration of the relationship between the media and the construction of both individual and social identities. Examines the ways in which human identity is increasingly influenced by media representations and the social and personal consequences of this trend.     Race and Media     MCC-UE 1025     America's founding principles of equality and equal opportunity have long been the subject of interpretation, debate, national angst and widespread (often violent) conflict. No more is this the case than when we talk about the issue of race. While biological notions of race have lost their scientific validity, race remains a salient issue in American life as a social and political reality sustained through a wide variety of media forms. The broad purpose of this course is to better understand how notions of race have been defined and shaped in and through these mediated forms. Specific attention may be given to the ways that race is articulated in forms of mass media and popular culture.      Screening History: The Construction of American History in Hollywood Films     MCC-UE 1140     This course explores the ways in which popular Hollywood films construct the historical past, the ensuing battles among historians and the public over Hollywood\u2019s version of American history, and the ways that such films can be utilized as historical documents themselves. We will consider films as products of the culture industry; as visions of popularly understood history and national mythology; as evidence for how social conflicts have been depicted; and as evidence of how popular understanding and interpretations of the past have been revised from earlier eras to the present.     * This course is recommended     Postcolonial Visual Culture     MCC-UE 1403     This courses addresses how colonialism and postcolonialism are shaped and mediated through images and the gaze. The dynamics of colonial history motivate and shape colonial and postcolonial perceptions and influence their patterns of global circulation when the boundary between the world out there and the nation at home is increasingly blurred. We will survey a range of image texts through various media (photography, television, cinema) and sites (war, the harem, refugee camps, prisons, disasters): nationalist mobilization, counter-insurgency, urban conflict, disaster management, the prison system, and the war on terror.     Tisch- Dance      History of Dance     DANC-UT.106     A study of the function of dance as art and ritual, social activity, spectacle, and entertainment through a survey of ethnic dance forms and the history of European tradition.     Tisch- Cinema Studies Cinema Studies often has relevant courses, but posts new courses late in the semester. See their site for more information.     Tisch- Art and Public Policy      Creative Response: Public Interventions     ASPP - UT/GT.1028/ 2028     Alfredo Jaar     This intensive workshop considers visual practices as an integral part of a network of social and cultural relationships. It considers the city of New York as laboratory: a social, political and cultural landscape where participants will be encouraged to create their own interventions in a series of intensive exercises.     We will consider context, site, audience and presentation (communication) as an essential, structural aspect of the artistic production process. The objective of the workshop is to offer a first approach and basic understanding of the complexities of interventions in public spaces. Different contemporary strategies will be presented and analyzed in class, with a particular focus on critical and alternative productions in the fields of visual arts and architecture.     The sessions will be structured integrating both practical and theoretical considerations and will encourage students to explore ways in which conceptual ideas can be developed creatively. This course is intended for students interested in working outside of the white cube and in strategies of communication in public space.     Language as Action     ASPP - UT/ GT.1070/ 2070     Kathy Engel     This is a close reading and craft writing class that will look at the poetry, essays, and narratives of writers who traverse forms, their work inextricably related to community and social engagement. We will look at the question of what constitutes \u201caction\u201d or \u201cactivism\u201d and how writing and language can be those transformative engagements, deconstructing clich\u00e9\u2019s that suggest the contrary. At the same time we will discuss the relationship of writing to other forms of action and the complex ways conditions mandate form. We will explore the work from the perspectives of craft, impact, identity, \u201cscripting,\u201d community, the relationship of personal to political, memory, and boundary breaking, to begin with. We will examine the texts to understand the connection to community and activism, looking at the complexities and conflicts that arise in the context of making art and working to make an impact on public life. We will interrogate questions of quality and aesthetics, popular culture, compromise, truth, authenticity, voice, beauty, responsibility, fact, and translation as a world view in the 21st Century.     While studying the work of June Jordan, Martin Espada, Mahmoud Darwish, Alexis De Veaux, Eduardo Galeano, D.A. Powell, Gloria Anzaldua, Joy Harjo, Patricia Smith, Muriel Rukeyser, Adrienne Rich, Cornelius Eady, Valzhyna Mort, Suheir Hammad, and Tina Chang, the students will concurrently delve deeply into their own writing processes.     We will explore questions related to the work of the scribe, the teller or artist, to a given community, event, and history itself, the ethical issues involved in \u201ctruth\u201d and \u201cstory,\u201d how writers and social narrators deal with plural and counter narratives and some of the problems inherent, and the many traditions within telling. We will examine questions of voice, power, silence, the question of \u201cpersona\u201d writing, inhabiting another\u2019s experience.     The Media of Displacement: Postcolonial Culture     H48.1055     We are here because you were there\u201d has become a common slogan for postcolonial diasporas in the metropolitan \u201ccenters\u201d of the West. With the growing numbers of immigrants and refugees from the Middle East/North Africa in cities such as London, Paris, Berlin, New York, Los Angeles, Montreal, and Sao Paulo, the construction of \u201cus\u201d versus \u201cthem\u201d can no longer correspond to one geography, simplistically imagined as \u201cover there.\u201d This seminar will study questions of displacement as represented, mediated and narrated in diverse cultural realms, especially cinema, media, visual culture and writing. How such texts have confronted exclusionary and essentialist discourses with a rich cultural production that foregrounds a complex understanding of such issues as \u201chome,\u201d \u201chomeland,\u201d \u201cexile,\u201d \u201chybridity\u201d and \u201cminorities.\u201d We will look at the past few decades of artistic work within the larger context of post-independence and globalization politics. We will mainly look examine the ways films/videos, novels, memoirs, and visual work have represented dislocations that have come in the wake of colonial partitions, and of regional, ethnic and religious conflicts; as well as into the ways they challenge traditional genres about immigration, transcending the neat divisions among the social documentary, the ethnographic media, the experimental autobiography, and the fictional narrative. We will also examine these texts in relation to contemporary cyber diasporic practices, problematizing especially such issues as \u201cnostalgia\u201d and \u201creturn\u201d in the context of new communication technologies.     Art and Art Professions      Interdisciplinary Undergraduate Projects in Studio Art: Building an Activist Knowledge Base     ART-UE 1985     This course is for students who wish to learn about &amp; study the effectiveness of a wide range of activist practices &amp; techniques. They should be largely self-directed &amp; self-motivated, as there are no sophisticated research or action tools thus far available for much of the course material. Creativity will play a large role, especially when examining creative resistance actions that took place with minimal or no documentation, which is the case for most of them. Course goals are to build useful databases &amp; acquaint students with the depth &amp; breadth of activist practice.     Interdisciplinary Undergraduate Projects in Studio Art: Visionaries and Saboteur     ART-UE 1982     This interdisciplinary course focuses on how artists engage with ?institutions? in contemporary culture. These many ?institutions?: fashion, the museum, the store, the government, the home, &amp; music among them, are all structures, which make up the world in which we live. We will look at how artists utilize these structure as a means to change the way we experience life &amp; living. Each week will be geared towards a specific institution through slide lectures, screenings of films, field trips, &amp; guest artists. There will also be presentations &amp; critiques of student work as well as special topics of interest.     Postcolonial Practices in Studio Art     ART-UE 0801     Exploration of post-colonial theories of identity, representation, &amp; culture as they are expressed in contemporary art. Students will meet regularly with visiting African painters, sculptors, &amp; designers in intimate workshop settings for lectures, critiques, &amp; demonstrations. The class will include field trips to galleries as well as artists\u2019 residences &amp; studios in urban &amp; rural settings.      Graduate Level Courses     Anthropology      New Formations of Property     ANTH-GA 3393     Spring 2012     Geismar.     This class traces the history of anthropological engagements with property and uses this legacy to understand recent shifts in property forms and regimes. Topics include alternative currencies, indigenous interventions into cultural and intellectual property; the impact of massive social change (eg postsocialsm, digitization) on property forms and the constituion of new objects of property (cells, patents, databases etc).     Colonialism, Nationalism, and Modernity     ANTH-GA 3390.2.     Spring 2012     Abercrombie     This course asks: How can an anthropology with roots in the colonial knowledge regime hope to conspire in emancipatory projects that empower not only third world or politically-correct academics in US universities but the peoples of former European colonies and the marginalized indigenous peoples in them?     Culture and Media I     ANTH-GA 1215     Spring 2012     Ginsburg     This course offers a critical revision of the history of the genre of ethnographic film, the central debates it has engaged around cross-cultural representation, and the theoretical and cinematic responses to questions of the screen representation of culture, from the early romantic constructions of Robert Flaherty to current work in film, television, and video on the part of indigenous people throughout the world.     Cultural Citizenship     ANTH-GA 3394.     Spring 2012     Rosaldo     Cultural Citizenship concerns the right to be different and belong, in a participatory democratic sense. The term citizenship concentrates on the ordinary language definition found in the phrase full citizenship as opposed to second-class citizenship. The term cultural refers to vernacular definitions of what confers entitlement. Entitlement in this sense ranges from economic factors to notions of dignity and respect.     Politics of Latino and Latin American Representation     ANTH-GA 3391.     Spring 2012     Davila     This course offers a look at some of the politics of representation at play in different spaces where Latino/Latin American cultures are being shaped, deployed and intrumentalized across the Americas with an eye to the larger social, political and historical trends they help signal. Particular attention will be paid to the different racial and nationalist ideologies framing these politics and to the cultural hierarchies affecting the institutional spaces in which Laitno/Latin American cultures are being produced and contested.     Video Production Seminar I, II     ANTH-GA 1218, 1219. Prerequisites: ANTH-GA 1215, H72.1998, and permission of the instructor.     Stout     Yearlong seminar in ethnographic documentary video production using state-of-the-art digital video equipment for students in the Program in Culture and Media. This course is dedicated to instruction, exercises, and reading familiarizing students with fundamentals of video production and their application to a broad conception of ethnographic and documentary approaches.     *This professor is recommended          The Anthropology of Human Rights     ANTH-GA 2600     Examines the contemporary elaboration and dissemination of human rights law and discourse in the post-World War II period. Explores the opposition between culture and rights and examines current anthropological work on human rights in political struggles in various parts of the world. Specific areas of focus include indigenous rights and women\u2019s rights. The course also examines transnational, deterritorialized, and multisited ethnographic research methods for studying human rights.          English      Early American Literature     ENGL-GA 2802     Baker, Crain, Waterman.     American literature, 1607-1800, in its cultural setting. Topics include the literature of exploration and promotion; American Puritan poetry and prose; writing in the early South and the middle colonies; rise of the epic, the novel, and the theatre during the American Revolution, with related study of music and painting of the period; the beginning of American romanticism.     Topics in Postcolonial Literature     ENGL-GA 2900     Gajarawala, Sunder Rajan, Watson, Young.     Intermediate-level study of literary and theoretical works pertaining to the eras of decolonization and globalization.     Topics in Postcolonial Theory     ENGL-GA 2901     Gajarawala, Sunder Rajan, Watson, Young.     Introduces M.A. and Ph.D. students to advanced study of postcolonial theory, its forms of philosophical and cultural analysis, and its theoretical advances and difficulties.     The Politics of Culture     ENGL-GA 2934 Parikh.     This course considers human rights discourses as an interpretive framework for literary and cultural production, emphasizing perspectives from postcolonial and critical American studies.          Journalism      Storytellers     JOUR-GA 1231.001     Spring 2012     Great stories are shaped by talented, reckless, funny, arrogant and often misanthropic writers and reporters working at the height of their craft. In this class, we will study how world-shaking historical events and everyday experiences alike can be crafted into original journalistic narratives. We will concentrate on the writer's angle of approach to the subject - his or her \u00d2voice\u00d3 - which is made more or less convincing through his or her control over language and the depth and range of his/her reporting. The first half of each class will consist of close readings of nonfiction narratives on Balkan wars, acid trips, nervous breakdowns, rock and roll concerts, a sarin gas attack in the Tokyo subways, a visit to the Iowa State Fair and assorted other subjects by some of my favorite journalists and novelists including Tom Wolfe, Joan Didion, David Foster Wallace, Denis Johnson, Rebecca West, Ryszard Kapucinski, Haruki Murakami, Gabriel Garcia Marquez and Joseph Mitchell. Each class will begin promptly at 12:30 PM and will be divided between an hour and thirty minute discussion of the assigned reading and an hour and fifteen minute discussion of your written work. Latecomers will be greeted with derision. We will break at 2 PM for afternoon snack. We will also enjoy visits from enlivening and informative guests from Harper's, The New Yorker and other high-class venues, who can answer any questions you might have about reporting and editing, and who will help you shape your ideas with an eye towards publishing your own work. Syllabus (PDF)     Music      Ethnomusicology: History and Theory     MUSIC-GA 2136     Spring 2012     Jason Stanyek     A broad intellectual history of the discipline, surveying landmark studies and important figures. Examines major paradigms, issues, and frameworks in ethnomusicology. The relation of ethnomusicology to other disciplines, and the relations of knowledge and power that have produced them. Serves as an introduction to the field of ethnomusicology.     Politics      Pol Econ Sem: The Moral Economy     POL-GA.3400.002     Spring 2012     Aziz     Back in the 1970s, the moral economy concept was used to describe protest movements rooted in anti-capitalist sentiment that often accompanied state making, commercialization of agriculture and colonialism. Moral economists explained such protest movements in terms of \u201ca (presumed) loss of subsistence, security and welfare by the peasantry during these changes. They interpreted such violence as a defensive reaction against capitalism and as an attempt to restore the (precapitalist) structures that provided peasant welfare\u201d (Popkin 1979: 5). But in fact this concept has evolved considerably since then and can even be applied to what\u2019s going on today with the     Occupy Wall Street movement.     Since Thompson first coined the moral economy in his 1971 study of 18th century     English crowds protesting food prices, this term has reappeared in anthropologist and political scientist Scott\u2019s 1976 study of the peasant movements against capitalism in     Vietnam. More recently, political scientists and sociologists (e.g. Svallfors 2006; May     2003; Posusney 1993) have re-conceptualised the moral economy more generally in terms of the rights and responsibilities of citizens as it relates to public policies and  institutions. It has been applied to varied case studies, including social welfare in     Europe, Nigerian food systems, economic practices in Kyrgyzstan and anti-state     labour protests in Egypt and Algeria.     Underlying this multidisciplinary body of literature is the notion that \u201cthe governing powers [have] broken the unspoken contract [of the moral economy], the idea of the rights to which all citizens were entitled, that was firmly rooted in society\u201d (Svallfors 2006: 1). This course will investigate the \u201cmoral economy\u201d and related unrest from the eighteenth century to present-day. We will take into consideration various case studies from around the world, including the most recent examples \u2013 the civil unrest during the 2007-2008 global economic crisis and the current Occupy Wall Street movement in many countries. We will also be critical of the moral economy concept by considering how useful it is as an academic construct and explanatory tool.           Cultural and Social Analysis      Seminar: Visual Studies     AFRS-GA 2303     This seminar explores how the trope of \u201cblackness\u201d is mediated over a range of ideas, images, and expressions of social difference in cinema. Screenings and readings examine how popular cinema, ranging from black independence to the commercial \u201cmainstream,\u201d deals not only with issues of race and color, but how these issues intersect, and interact, with other social categories of difference(s) mainly related to class, sexual orientation, and gender but including many others. The course explores such issues as seeing beyond the \u201cblack-white binary\u201d model of race relations; gendered perspectives on \u201cblackness\u201d and black women\u2019s filmmaking; the cultural and political dynamic between blackness and gayness on the screen; and issues of class, caste, and \u201ccolorism\u201d in cinema. The course also examines a number of ideas and theories related to the material, including passing, double consciousness, unmarked difference, and creolization.     Colloquium in Women\u2019s History: Race and Reproduction     AFRS-GA 2600     From the policies, priorities, and perversions of slave owners to the pronatalist campaigns of colonial Africa, to the family planning programs that are a hallmark of liberalism and development in the postcolonial world, and, most recently, to the promotion of assisted reproduction technologies among western elites, race and reproduction have always been among the primary axes on which large-scale political, economic, cultural, social, and intellectual processes are configured. Because reproduction connects the intimate experiences of individuals to larger historical structures and forces and because reproduction is such a fundamental (if varied) biological and social experience, this topic in particular lends itself to comparative work. This course explores issues in the history of race and reproduction, focusing primarily (though not exclusively) on American and African contexts. This cross-cultural breadth helps students to consider the relationship between biological experiences (which are often portrayed as universal) and sociocultural context. Through readings, students consider how different disciplinary orientations (social history, medical anthropology, feminist theory, art history, etc.) approach women\u2019s history both methodologically, theoretically, and in terms of narrative and analytic strategies.     Topics in Postcoloniality     AFRS-GA 2645     Explores and interrogates the notion of the \u201cpostcolonial\u201d in relation to certain key aspects of contemporary African and/or Caribbean societies, cultures, and histories. Individual areas of investigation include theories of Africa and Africans, Caribbean literary theory, modern postcolonial theory and its applicability and relevance to recent developments in the African continent and its diaspora, new identity formations, African and Caribbean cultural studies, nationalism and the nation-state, creolization, and theories of resistance.     Pensamiento Latinoamericano     AMST-GA 3212, Same as SPAN-GA 2968     Spring 2012     Mary Louise Pratt     This course will examine major projects in Latin American social and cultural theory and analysis since dependency and development theory, with a focus on the last twenty years. Latin America shares the modern state form with the rest of the global geopolitical system; it shares with the global south a history of imperial intervention, colonial occupation, and neocolonial extraction; with the rest of the Americas it was the object of Europe\u2019s first wave expansion in the 15-16th centuries; its history includes large-scale autochthonous (pre-c olumbian) societies whose forces continue to unfold in the present. What intellectual fields arise f rom the interaction of these geographies, social forms, and historical forces? What objects of study and analytical imperatives have they produced? What challenges does Latin American thought pose to the intellectual norms of metropolitan thought? Topics to be explored include: anatom\u00eda del desarrollismo (Cardoso y Faletto); cr\u00edtica del estado liberal (eg. Rodriguez, Nugent); paradojas de la modernidad (eg. Schwarz, Dussel, Franco); etnograf\u00eda del autoritarismo (eg Garret\u00f3n, Eltit); diagn\u00f3stica del occidentalismo (eg. Bonfil Batalla, Flores Galindo); g\u00e9nero y ciudadan\u00eda (Oyarz\u00fan, Olea, Monsiv\u00e1is); pensamiento ind\u00edgena(ejMamani, Paredes); crueldad, basurizaci\u00f3n y asco neoliberales (Franco, Santiesteban). Readings will be in Spanish and English; class discussion will be in Spanish and English. Students must have advanced speaking, reading, and comprehension skill in both languages to take this course. Background in cultural or social l theory is also required.     Gender, Race, and Imperialism     AMST-GA 2303     Roots of Race Thinking     AMST-GA 2326     Comparative Ethnic Studies     AMST-GA 2328     Human Rights and Cultural Politics     AMST-GA 2330     Race and Reproduction     AMST-GA 2600     Sociology      Social Stratification and Inequality     SOC-GA 2137.     Jackson, Jasso, Jennings, Torche.     Assesses the research and theoretical work on economic inequality and classes in the social sciences. Reviews important classic contributions (including Marx, Weber, and Schumpeter), compares competing approaches (including Marxist, conflict, functionalist, elite, and status attainment theories), and surveys modern directions of development (such as labor market studies, socialist inequality, the role of the state).          Social Movements     SOC-GA 2153     Goodwin, Manza     Surveys controversies and research issues and topics in social movements. Topics include classical, economic, resource mobilization, political process, and political opportunity theories of social protest movements; so-called new social movements; and issues of identity formation. Analyzes recent thinking and research concerning the consequences or impact of social protest movements, including the U.S. civil rights movement, labor movements, neopopulist movements, and revolutionary movements.          Political Sociology     SOC-GA 2441     Chibber, Ertman, Goodwin, Manza.     Surveys controversies and research topics in political sociology. At the center of these investigations are states and power. Explores concepts of power and the theories of the state. Topics are the formation of states, political institutions, and social policies and the determinants and outcomes of collective action.          Sociology of Education     SOC-GA 2407     Arum, Heyns.     Sociological perspective on American education. Topics include the social context of socialization and learning; the effects of schooling; desegregation and social inequality; teachers as unionized professionals; school politics and bureaucracy; and selected policy issues confronting American education. Emphasis is on American institutions, although comparative perspectives are discussed.          Sociology of the Family     SOC-GA 2451     Gerson, Stacey, Wu.     Systematic introduction to the literature on family and kinship. Includes classical theories and examines the major areas of contemporary research. Topics include family formation, social reciprocity, family dissolution, the history of the family, and a comparison of general theoretical paradigms.     Spanish and Portuguese      Cultural History of Latin America     SPAN-GA 9946     This courses consists of three thematically organized modules, plus introductory and concluding sessions. It is designed to allow students to explore a wide range of cultural materials, including literature, visual culture, urban space, and historical and political texts. It will emphasize issues of cultural identity, encouraging students to make connections between past debates and those of today. The approach is multidisciplinary, ranging across literature, performance studies, cultural studies, visual culture, and history. The objective of the course is to ensure that all students develop a high level of cultural literacy about the Spanish-speaking world.          Theory and Practice of Translation     SPAN-GA 9102     Students will study different schools of translation theory and their practical implications in translation, as well as the result of these applications in traductology. The course addresses the implications that translation theories can have on practice, for both literary and non-literary texts.          Museum Studies      Historic Sites, Cultural Landscapes, and the Politics of Preservation      MSMS-GA 2223     Cain.     Examines the cultural politics, social trends and economic circumstances that shape the preservation and interpretation of historic spaces. Through readings, site visits, and archival research, students investigate a wide variety of historic sites, exploring the social and political contexts that dictated sites\u2019 original use and influence subsequent reuse and interpretation.     Topics In Museum Studies: Anthropology In And Of Museums     MSMS-GA 3330, G49.3330-002     Spring 2012     Haidy Geismar     This course takes as its starting point the importance of museums and collecting in the foundational period of the discipline of anthropology and traces the role that cultural objects have had in thinking about cultural difference, and within cultural analysis. We will also examine the role of museums as sites of fieldwork and as generators of research methodologies focused on material culture. The ways in which museums consolidate emergent theories of material culture will be elicited through a series of workshops at the American Museum of Natural History. Students will investigate the history and nature of the anthropology collections, as well as thinking through the forms of knowledge engendered by artifacts, working closely with photographic and archival collections at the Museum. Working in the Science galleries, we will examine the status of anthropology as a natural science and consider the public representation and materialization of science - students will be required to undertake their own mini-ethnography in the museum. Other topics will include global trends in the emergence of new museums of culture, cultures of dealing and collection, and the place of anthropological collections in art museums. Please note that many classes will meet at the AMNH and a significant amount of assignment research will take place at the museum.          Topics In Museum Studies: Museums And Political Conflict     MSMS-GA 3330, G49.3330-004, DRAP-GA 3330.002     Spring 2012     Jeffrey D. Feldman     In contemporary Museum Studies, it is often said that museums are inherently political institutions. But how do politics actually happen in museums? What has &quot;politics&quot; meant for key exhibitions and collections and what avenues of political theory emerge from the museum in general? In this seminar, we will move beyond the general to examine how specific political concepts took shape in historic exhibitions and museum practices from the 1930s to the present. As such, our challenge will be twofold. On the one hand, we will consider how political movements have used the museums as an implement for advancing power and influence. On the other hand, we will consider how museum practices have &quot;taken up&quot; various kinds of politics: how museum objects and officials have engaged and advocated the agendas and outcomes of political parties, governments, policies, revolutions, and elections. Case studies will include: Degenerate Art (1937), Paris World Exhibition (1937), Rivera's &quot;Man at the Crossroads&quot; (1934), The Guggenheim Museum (1959), Yad Vashem (1965), Harlem on my Mind (1969), The Perfect Moment (1990), The Last Act (1994), The Jewish Museum of Bologna (1998), Sensation (1999), The Apartheid Museum (2001), Holocaust Cartoons (2006), among others. Through these case studies, students will examine the museum's role in the public sphere and the process whereby exhibitions contribute to-- or undermined--key aspects of deliberative democracy.     Topics in Museum Studies: Museums and Indigenous Peoples      G49.3330     Professor Stampe     This course examines changing relationships between indigenous peoples and museums as well as other display institutions. We will begin by positioning the representation of indigenous peoples in terms of imperialist and nationalist histories, and to move on to an examination of movements to reclaim objects, identity, and rights through efforts at self-representation. We will consider both independent and cooperative self-representation projects, focusing particularly on cases in the Americas and the Pacific, but taking on other geographic regions as student interests and available materials allow; we will attend to both the possibilities and limits of projects to reorganize practices, products, and expectations of representation. Topics will include globalization, multiculturalism, and nationalism; colonial-era display in museums and world's fairs; the critique of primitivism; decolonizing methodologies; self-determination, land claims, and economic development; repatriation and intangible cultural heritage; and contemporary art and public culture. Assignments will include weekly reading assignments, group and independent museum visits, a critical exhibition review, and a final paper or planning project.     Topics in Museum Studies: Cultural Property, Rights and Museums     G49.3330     Professor Geismar     What does it mean to own or have a culture? Are all cultures the same? Is owning your culture a basic human right? This course will investigate the growing discussions about cultural property rights that have emerged in the context of museum practices, from collection and display to conservation and archiving. A general analysis of concepts of culture, property, and rights related to these materials and social domains, will be offset by sessions that examine how different understanding of entitlements may be negotiated within museum spaces and how museum objects (broadly defined) may be understood as cultural resources. Special focus will be the impact of legislation; political events such as war; indigenous rights movements; international conceptions of intellectual and cultural property; and the commodity transaction and the marketplace, and on their impact on museum practice.     Certificate Program in Culture and Media     Culture &amp; Media I      G14.1215/ H72.1402     Ginsburg/Ganti     This course offers a critical revision of the history of the genre of ethnographic film, the central debates it has engaged around cross-cultural representation, and the theoretical and cinematic responses to questions of the screen representation of culture, from the early romantic constructions of Robert Flaherty to current work in film, television and video on the part of indigenous people throughout the world. Ethnographic film has a peculiar and highly contested status within anthropology, cinema studies, and documentary practice. In this seminar, we will situate ethnographic film within the wider project of the representation of cultural lives, and especially &quot;natives&quot;. Starting with what are regarded as the first examples of the genre, we will examine how these emerged in a particular intellectual context and political economy. We will then consider the key works that have defined the genre, and the epistemological and formal innovations associated with them, addressing questions concerning social theory, documentary, as well as the institutional structures through which they are funded, distributed, and seen by various audiences. Throughout the course we will keep in mind the properties of film as a signifying practice, its status as a form of anthropological knowledge, and the ethical and political concerns raised by cross-cultural representation.     Culture &amp; Media II:     Ethnography of Media     G14.1216/ H72.1403     Ginsburg/Ganti     Where Culture and Media I critically explored the emergence of ethnographic film largely as an academic-based documentary genre, this seminar examines the implication of film and ethnography as part of a much wider discourse of representation. Travelers, missionaries, colonialists, commercial companies, and educationalists were all involved in the production of images (both moving and still) of the &quot;Other&quot; to promote modernization abroad and education and spectacle at home. From consideration of the ethnographic visual world (photographs, world\u2019s fairs, postcards, museums, etc.) into which ethnographic film emerged in the early years of this century, to examining contemporary televisualist modes of representation, this course will weave film analysis into a broader discussion of the popular culture of ethnographic representation. It will focus on: the film archive; colonialism and visual culture; television and ethnographic film; indigenous media and postcolonial critiques of colonial visual relations.     Cultural Theory and the Documentary     H72.2002     Kahana     This course considers the actual and possible forms of relation between theories of culture and society and documentary film and video. The course is structured as a series of problematics: in each, cultural theory and documentary work are placed in conversation around issues central to both forms of social knowledge. While the course is not intended as a history of international non-fiction film production, the syllabus covers a wide historical and national range of examples. Like many of the visual works we will study, the critical premise of the syllabus is that concepts such as truth, justice, authenticity, originality, and humanity - the putative values of the documentary mode - are themselves historically and culturally relative, variable, and controversial.         Video Production Seminar 1 &amp; 2     Stout/Ganti/Furjanic     This is a year-long seminar in ethnographic documentary video production using state of the art HDV digital video equipment for students in the Program in Culture and Media. The first portion of the course is dedicated to instruction, exercises, and reading familiarizing students with fundamentals of video production and their application to a broad conception of ethnographic and documentary approaches. Assignments undertaken in the Fall raise representational, methodological, and ethical issues in approaching and working through an ethnographic and documentary project. Students develop a topic and field site for their project early in the Fall term, begin their shooting, and complete a short (5-10 minute) edited tape by the end of this semester. This work should demonstrate competence in shooting and editing using professional digital camera/audio Final Cut Pro non-linear editing systems. Students devote the spring semester to intensive work on the project, continuing to shoot and edit, presenting work to the class and completing their (approximately 20 minute-long) ethnographic documentaries. Student work is presented and critiqued during class sessions, and attendance and participation in group critiques and lab sessions is mandatory. Students should come into the class with project ideas already well-developed. Students who have not completed the work assigned in the first semester will not be allowed to register for the second semester. Culture &amp; Media I is a pre-requisite. THE SEMINAR IS OPEN ONLY TO STUDENTS IN THE PROGRAM IN CULTURE AND MEDIA. IT IS LIMITED TO TEN STUDENTS AND REQUIRES PERMISSION OF THE INSTRUCTOR. There is no lab fee, but students are expected to provide their own videotapes. In addition to class time, there will be regular technical lab sessions on the use of equipment.     *This course/certificate is recommended     Center for Latin American and Caribbean Studies      Beginner Quechua I     LATC-GA 10     Spring 2012     Odi Gonzales          Beginner Quechua II     LATC-GA 11     Spring 2012     Odi Gonzales          Intermediate Quechua I     LATC-GA 20     Odi Gonzales          Tpcs Sem: Indigenous Feminisms: Economic and Racial Justice      LATC-GA 1020     Spring 2012     Pamela Calla          Performance and Human Rights     G95.2978     Professor Jill Lane     This course focuses on the different uses of performance in human rights advocacy and activism in Latin America, from contexts of transitional justice (in Guatemala, El Salvador, Chile, Argentina), commissions for truth and reconciliation (in Peru, Chile, Argentina), and the ongoing debates and legacies of these projects. We consider the production of political truth in contexts of art, international law, and the public sphere, and focus particularly on the work of embodied performance in these settings. Our course will interact with the visiting photographic exhibit at the King Juan Carlos Center, Yuyanapaq: Para Recordar, produced as part of the Peruvian Truth and Reconciliation Commission. We will attend a planned symposium on the legacy of Latin American truth commissions at KJCC,and will attend regular film screenings on related topics. Students will write and present a final research project for the course. Taught in English, but reading knowledge of Spanish is strongly recommended.     Trauma and Violence Transdisciplinary Studies      Trauma and Representation     TRVI-GA 2005     Probes the effects of trauma on the possibility of representation and the ways in which different genres and media can represent trauma.     Wagner School of Public Serivice     Community Organizing     PADM-GP.2106     Introduction to Community Organizing is for those who could imagine running national or local advocacy organizations that make change happen or anyone who wants to understand the art of community organizing. It will provide an overview of and training in contemporary community organizing practice in the United States. This includes defining what community organizing is and identifying its value base; exploring the strategies, tactics and activities of organizing; and thinking about marketing, language and evaluation. We also will examine the transformations of civic engagement and voluntary associations in the United States and the impact of these transformations on the ways Americans organize and advocate for change.     But there is a larger lesson here: The skills of community organizing \u2013 listening, finding areas of consensus and building on that consensus, finding ways to make change happen \u2013 are skills that can be applied to all professional and life settings. Through readings, class activities, cases studies, speakers and reflection, students will examine skills and techniques for effective organizing, including building a membership base, developing ordinary people as community leaders and running member-led issue campaigns. Students will also have the opportunity to reflect on and strengthen their own skills as community organizers and advocates.     Advocacy Lab: How to Make Change Happen     PADM-GP.2407     Advocacy Lab is for those who could imagine working in national or local advocacy organizations that make change happen or anyone who wants to understand the art of issue advocacy as a method of social change. An advocacy campaign attempts to impact public policy, most often through changes in regulations and/or legislation. There are a wide range of roles campaign workers can play from research and policy analysis to education, public relations and organizing constituencies to reaching out to a wide range of influential, legislators and other government officials. At the same time, the skills of public advocacy\u2013 listening, finding areas of consensus and building on that consensus, finding ways to make change happen \u2013 are skills that can be applied to all professional and life settings.     The course will provide an overview of and training in how to affect public policy through advocacy campaigns, legislative lobbying, issue branding, coalition building and community organizing in the United States. This includes exploring the different forms of policy issue advocacy and identifying its value base; exploring the strategies, tactics and activities of organizing and running such campaigns; and thinking about marketing, language and evaluation. Advocacy lab will direct an on-going social justice advocacy campaign which students will run \u2013 this is not simulation, but the real thing.     The goal of Advocacy Lab is to gain hands-on experience in taking on a social justice issue and make change happen. In addition to classroom activities, we will take our learning out into the community. The clinical part of the program will include training in the specific advocacy issue we will be working on and going out into the field to advocate for concrete change.           Large Scale Change: Processes and Techniques for Public and Private Settings     PADM-GP.4146     Two of the most powerful set of ideas about initiating and sustaining meaningful change in all types of organizations, both public and private, have been developed recently by organizational development practitioners and theorists. High-involvement strategies are increasingly used in a variety of processes to involve people at all levels in changing their own system or organization. High-leverage strategies are used to involve people in systematic ways to sustain those changes.     Students of Organizational Development and Change who are interested in promoting and implementing dramatic and sustainable change need to explore and understand the core principles, assumptions and processes of such strategies. Often termed Large-Scale Interventions, these methods are being used more and more as diverse organizations confront changing environments, expectations and realities. It is no wonder that organizations as large as General Motors and various state government departments (social services, corrections) and as small as the local public school and community group which are interested in \u201cturning things around\u201d are investigating the use of such interventions.     This two-day course provides a comprehensive overview of the major change methods being used today. A brief review identifying core principles, assumptions and processes of over 60 such techniques will be made. In addition, participants will engage in designing and implementing three such interventions as a class: Appreciative Inquiry, Dialogue, and Future Search.     Advocacy and Movement Politics in the U.S.     UPADM-GP.271     This course will focus on four broad movements in post-war America: the movement for African-American Civil Rights; the Gay and Lesbian Civil Rights Movements; the Conservative Movement; and the Consumer Movement. The course will familiarize students with these movements that span post-war American history, putting each in its historical context from the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) to Stonewall to Unsafe at Any Speed to California's Proposition 13. Students will also learn how these movements illustrate the variety of tactics and strategies employed by advocates of social change including boycotts, litigation, regulatory action, electoral politics, marches, and voter referenda.         Minorities in America: Status, Rights, Culture and Community     UPADM-GP.0216     The position of minorities in the United States, an immigrant nation since its inception, remains a volatile topic of debate that touches the core of American identity. While we will review the history of minorities in America, we will focus on their status within the cultural and political framework and examine the ways that how we understand rights as either individually or communally derived informs policy decisions and shapes minority institutions. We will seek to define what &quot;minority&quot; status entails by studying how ethnicity, race, gender and religious identity, and cultural expression play out in the political sphere. Attention will then shift to minority community building - how public policies and leaders nurture or undermine minority identity, establish and sustain institutions, and create sustainable minority communities.     Critical Race Theory     PADM-GP.4430     Critical Race Theory refers to a broad set of historical and contemporary theories that emerged in the late 1980s to more accurately describe the lived experiences and realities of racial and ethnic minorities and marginalized groups and individuals in society. As a theoretical framework, Critical Race Theory pays close attention to the ways in which power and privilege operate in society and takes seriously the impact of the intersections of race, class, gender, ethnicity, sexuality and other markers of difference on rights and access to resources in the public sphere.     At its core, critical race theory is an applied theory with an explicit goal of social justice and transformation. As an applied theory, critical race theory relies on various tools and interventions to bring about social change including policy making and advocacy, research, community organizing and within-system advocacy.     In this course, we will explore the challenges as well as opportunities critical race theory presents for the field of public administration and service. Specifically, we will examine critical race theory as a counter framework for understanding difference and inequalities in society and how the framework can be used to deepen our understanding of historic and present-day institutional and structural barriers. We will also consider they ways Critical Race Theory can be employed as a strategy to redress social inequities over the long-term.     Race and Class in American Cities     URPL-GP.4620     American cities are comprised of residents from a great diversity of nations, cultures, religions, and political philosophies. Consequently, conflicts surrounding race, ethnicity, class, and gender are often at the center of disputes about the use of public space and the allocation of city resources. This course examines the patterns of racial\u2010ethnic, class, and gender inequality in American cities. We shall address how these inequalities emerge, how they are perpetuated, and the role of public policy in addressing these social problems.     Race, Class &amp; Gender in American Cities     UPADM-GP.0219     Spring 2012     This course examines how different racial, ethnic, and class interests interact in urban planning and development processes. It focuses on political systems and private market arrangements that affect the allocation and distribution of resources. A comparative approach identifies the ways in which different political regimes have analyzed and planned for the needs of a variety of racial, ethnic, and class interests.     Shifting Focus: Video Production and Community     K45.1445     Professor Read     From the taping of the police beating of Rodney King to the burgeoning growth of Independent Media Centers around the world, video has become an essential tool of social struggle. This course will be a hands-on class in video production in the service of progressive social change. Class time will be used to: examine the biases of corporate-controlled media; learn the theory and history of video activism; develop basic camera and editing skills; and reflect on lessons learned in the field. Outside of class students will break into groups and collaborate with local community organizations in the conception and production of a short video piece, and subsequently strategize with those organizations about how to most effectively use video in their particular struggles. Readings will include selections from Noam Chomsky, Robert McChesney and Thomas Harding.     Media, Culture and Communication     Race and Media     MCC-GE 2025     The racial and ethnic diversity of the United States from Europeans' first encounter with Native Americans, through colonialism and American slavery, Reconstruction, Jim Crow, the Civil Rights era and beyond has made the issue of race one of the United States' principal sites of conflict and conversation. For many years, scholarship on race and media has focused on a myriad of theories and issues surrounding representation, concerned with the presence or lack of people of color in media of all kinds, and the stereotypical ways they are portrayed when they are present. But this is only one part of the story. While this course highlights many of these issues, it focuses on the ways that media can and have shaped public discourse about race and racism both within and beyond the confines of the United States. The course considers a variety of media television sitcoms and drama, television and print news, film, popular music, the internet and others for the purpose of investigating how media have and continue to variably influence the publics racial agenda, and the general content, tone and tenor of racial conversation in the public sphere.     Media Activism     MCC-GE 2153     This participatory and discussion-oriented course explores the politics of media activism: its tactics, its strategies and its goals. The course will rely on both a survey of the existing theory and scholarship on media activism, as well as close analyses of actual activist practices within both old and new media and on a local, national and global scale. Special attention will be paid to questions of creativity and efficacy, addressing questions concerning the value of media activism as both an aesthetic and political activity.     Communication Processes: Gender, Race and Cultural Identity     MCC-GE 2182     Course examines past &amp; current studies on language, communication theories, speech perception, &amp; other aspects of verbal &amp; nonverbal behavior. Students relate these studies to how gender, race, culture &amp; sexual orientation are developed &amp; reflected in society in both personal &amp; professional relationships.     Decolonization and its Aftermath     MCC-GE 2211     The advent of 20th century decolonization challenged the way in which world history had been conceived for four centuries, as centered upon the tiny landmass of Western Europe, rather than say, as plural and polycentric. The former view made it difficult to understand how the majority of the world's population mattered to history at all. With the onset of decolonization after the end of World War I, the world began to be seen, first through the lens of the nation, and secondly, as an extensive set of interconnections, where seemingly remote events could have major effects across countries. This course will combine a survey of select decolonization movements with analyses of the transformations from anticolonial nationalism through postcolonial developmentalism to the contemporary new world order. The course will consider decolonization in two senses: as the historical achievement of independence in former colonies, and, as a communicational concept illuminating socio-political change.     Food Studies      Food in the Arts: Performance  E33.1204  Professor Raviv  This course will examine the affinity between food and the idea of performance, and the use of food in live performance \u2013 mostly in theater and performance art. We will analyze specific performances to understand the relationship between food and art, and the many variations in the ways artists may incorporate food into their performances or be inspired by it. We will also explore briefly extreme cases of food as performance. The class will read performance texts, watch video documentation of live performances, and go to see performances and visit appropriate sites. The majority of discussions will revolve around the analysis of actual performances and artist\u2019s work.    Food and Society     E33.1051     Professor Berg     Tisch- Performance Studies      Memory, Trauma and Performance     PERF-GT 2407 16560     Taylor     This course explores the interconnections between trauma, memory, and performance in Latin America. Starting in the 1960s, we focus on events throughout the Americas\u2014Mexico 1968, Argentina\u2019s \u2018Dirty War,\u2019 Chile under Pinochet, Guatemala, Nicaragua, and other sites in which criminal politics have disappeared citizens and traumatized populations. Does each context have its own unique structure and idiom, or can we think about individual and collective trauma through a translocal, cosmopolitan lens? Topics include: the performance of state power and state sponsored terror; the individual and collective nature of trauma; the study of embodied practices such as testimony and witnessing; the construction of archives of testimony; testimony, its use in literature, museums, and pedagogy, its dramatizations by others, its archivization; the social role of sites of memory (ESMA, Villa Grimaldi etc.); performances of protest and resistance.          Tourist Productions     PERF-GT 1041 16561     Vail     A booming multinational industry, tourism is a powerful medium of transnational encounter. There is hardly a place on earth not part of the recreational geography of tourism. This course will undertake a performance analysis of tourist productions, especially early and contemporary travelogues. The political economy and cultural impact of tourism will be explored through an ethnographic examination of actual sites, incorporating segments of the tourism industry ranging from backpackers to luxury travelers. An exemplary case of cultural invention and commodification, tourism is implicated in the histories of pilgrimage, travel, colonialism, and ethnography, retracing their itineraries and replicating their discourse. Particular emphasis will thus be placed on travel stories, from word-of-mouth tales to those circulating in print and media, and their role in shaping experience and destination perspectives.     Intercultural Performance: Ways Of Seeing     H42.2860     Professor Karen Shimakawa     This course will examine the concept of &quot;interculturalism&quot; in terms of audience and performer: how do we see or perform across cultures? And what is the efficacy of the term (or genre) in the current, transnational economy? Using Japanese contemporary performance and dance as our jumping-off point (some of which might conventionally be seen as &quot;intercultural,&quot; some of which might not) we will consider theories of (culturally-embedded) watching, alongside theories of interculturalism and transnationalism. What does it mean to conceive of the &quot;intercultural&quot; (either as a performance genre or mode of seeing)?     Verbal Art as Performance: The Performed Story in Culture And Society     H42.0340     Professor Kay Turner     In his The Law of Genre, Derrida says, &quot; as soon as genre announces itself, one must respect a norm, one must not cross a line of demarcation, one must not risk impurity, anomaly, or monstrosity.&quot; But just as quickly, he announces the impossibility of the law of genre because every genre contains the seeds of its own contamination. Both of Derrida's claims are useful for studying the performed story. For once we've learned something of generic distinctions, we'll proceed happily to generic impurities. Contagion spreads from storyteller to storyteller in acts of performing narrative.     Anthropology and folklore- based collections of myths, folktales, fairy tales, and legends provide resources for our discussion of the ways in which different types of stories and the context of their telling shape peoples\u2019 identities and world views. We discover ways in which important social concerns--among them gender construction, sexuality, marriage, family, status, ethnicity, and religious belief--are raised and appraised through the occasion of traditional storytelling performances. We review &quot;old-school&quot; resources for interpreting elements of performance in stories, including structuralism and oral-formulaic theory. But we soon move on to the &quot;new school&quot; impurities of post-structuralist and performance studies understandings of the storyteller's art as it has been reformulated in personal experience narrative, testimony, journalism and in other media: film, theater, performance art, and so on. Story is the jewel of performance; performance is largely about the necessity of telling stories and the motivation to perform is often story-based.     A portion of this course is field-based: students will be assigned a collecting project and short transcription, and we also attend at least one story performance. Reading, two short papers and class participation round out requirements. Readings include all or selections from, Derrida, &quot;The Law of Genre,&quot; Benjamin, &quot;The Storyteller;&quot; Levi-Strauss, &quot;Elementary Structures of Kinship;&quot; Roman Jakobson, &quot;Closing Statement: Linguistics and Poetics;&quot; Brothers Grimm, &quot;Household Tales;&quot; Julie Cruikshank, &quot;Do Glaciers Listen? Local Knowledge, Colonial Encounters and Social Imagination;&quot; Richard Bauman, &quot;Verbal Art as Performance;&quot; Patricia Sawin, &quot;Performance at the Nexus of Gender, Power, and Desire.     Art and Art Professions      Contemporary Art and Critical Pedagogy: Identity, Representation and Multiculturalism     ARTED-GE 2015     This course addresses philosophical. historical, socio-politcal contexts of multiculturalism in the United States, with an emphasis on relationship to critical pedagogy &amp; contemporary art practices. Current ideas about representation &amp; identity will be considered specifically in relation to a critique of mainstream notions of multiculturalism &amp; art. Topics may include the history of race in the United States, the role of ethnicity &amp; class in shaping identity, &amp; feminism &amp; multiculturalism. The course of addresses pedagogy &amp; curriculum in a variety of educational settings, including schools, museums, &amp; alternative spaces.     Silver School of Social Work     Culture &amp; Social Issues of Central America     MSWEL-GS 2114     Spring 2012     This course will introduce students to the European-heritage and Indigenous cultures of and contemporary socio-political issues facing developing countries with a focus on Latin America emphasizing issues affecting children and families in of Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Guatemala, and Costa Rica. Using Costa Rica as the focus of study, domestic and international aid responses to poverty and vulnerable populations, public and private, will be explored. This course is an opportunity to learn about and from the developing world? in Costa Rica! From a global perspective (with an emphasis on Latin America), we will explore social policy issues as they affect vulnerable populations, particularly children and families. We will be introduced to domestic and international aid responses through guest lectures and site visits. For the field portion of the program, we will be spending three to six afternoons at a public child care center for very poor, pre-school children, half of whom are Costa Rican and half of whom are from Nicaragua. Students should be prepared to engage the children in activities (arts and crafts, music, dance, games), providing their own supplies          School of Continuing and Professional Studies      Cultural Diversity in Business     Y10.0501     Professor Tansey     Examines the dynamics of a multicultural society and its impact on the world of business. The nature of intercultural relations and commonly shared perceptions of various cultures are studied. Students learn the advantages and challenges of interacting in multicultural contexts through historical research, role-playing, and simulation.           Spirituality in the Workplace     Y26.2251     Professor Merson     This course will look at the trends that have led to an interest in spirituality in the workplace, and will explore its definition separate from religion. We will analyze the application of spirituality in organizations on four levels: individual, group, organizational and societal. Topics covered will be work and individual meaning, leadership and spirituality, spirituality and innovation, and systemic approaches to creating enlightened organizations.     School of Continuing and Professional Studies           World Cultures: Latin America &amp; The Caribbean     ANTH1-DC 5014     Spring 2012     This course offers a historic and comparative study of the cultures and societies of Central and South America and the Caribbean region. Hispanic, native, and Afro-Creole cultures are analyzed with special emphasis on ethnicity, class, and nationhood. This course also reviews the historical factors that shaped and defined contemporary Latin and Caribbean cultures, including the Iberian conquest and the marginalization of indigenous peoples, the slave trade and the plantation economy, and the problems of post-colonial development.
