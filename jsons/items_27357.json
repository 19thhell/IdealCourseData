Game Center MFA   The Game Center MFA is a 2-year Masters of Fine Arts degree in Game Design that explores the design, analysis, and development of games as a creative practice. In our program, students create and study games to become industry leaders, experimental game artists, and trailblazing writers, theorists and curators. Over the two years, students find their voices as creative practitioners working on individual and group game projects, as well as through rigorous scholarly study of the theoretical and cultural aspects of games, all within the thriving community that is the NYU Game Center .     The program begins with a carefully crafted curriculum that covers game design, digital game programming and development, game studies and scholarship, and a historical survey of games on and off the computer. In the remaining semesters, students direct and shape their own study by choosing a variety of Game Center electives, along with courses from the Tisch School of the Arts and across New York University. \u00a0The MFA culminates in a 1-year thesis, which can take the form of a collaborative or solo game, an event or exhibition, paper or website, or any other kind of game-related research project.   Our students come from all over the world and from every background imaginable. Some hail from traditional game development areas like programming or animation &#8211; but many of our students come from film, philosophy, literature, economics, and just about any field you can imagine. What unites them all is creative talent, critical thinking, and a passion for making and studying games. On a practical level, every student that asks for financial aid gets assistance in some form. And we work hard to connect our students with internships and jobs, both during their stay at NYU and in their careers afterwards.   Find out more about the program here .
