Students who secure an internship through or with the assistance of NYU Washington, DC must confirm their spot in the program and enroll in the internship class in order to accept the internship. Many NYU departments (including SCA &amp; Environmental Studies) allow the Washington, DC internship course to satisfy major requirements. Always consult with your academic adviser to confirm how the internship course and other courses you will take while away fit in with your academic progress towards degree fulfillment. Students are required to pursue a minimum of 10 hours/week in their internships to earn course credit. NYU Washington, DC advises that students pursue no more than 20 hrs/week in internship commitments. If students elect to participate in an internship that exceeds the recommended number of hours, they may be advised to reduce their academic course load. Students are highly encouraged to consult NYU Washington DC staff for assistance with these decisions.   PLEASE NOTE: Internships that take place in Maryland, regardless of whether credit is awarded for the experience, require that your school or department have a certificate of approval to operate in the state.

Students who secure an internship through or with the assistance of NYU Washington, DC must confirm their spot in the program and enroll in the internship class in order to accept the internship. Many NYU departments (including SCA &amp; Environmental Studies) allow the Washington, DC internship course to satisfy major requirements. Always consult with your academic adviser to confirm how the internship course and other courses you will take while away fit in with your academic progress towards degree fulfillment. Students are required to pursue a minimum of 10 hours/week in their internships to earn course credit. NYU Washington, DC advises that students pursue no more than 20 hrs/week in internship commitments. If students elect to participate in an internship that exceeds the recommended number of hours, they may be advised to reduce their academic course load. Students are highly encouraged to consult NYU Washington DC staff for assistance with these decisions.   PLEASE NOTE: Internships that take place in Maryland, regardless of whether credit is awarded for the experience, require that your school or department have a certificate of approval to operate in the state. If you are interested in a placement in Maryland, please contact global.internships@nyu.edu before applying to the internship for more information.
