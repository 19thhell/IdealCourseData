Global Perspectives on Society II is a prerequisite for this course. Perspectives on Humanities classes are offered as writing intensive topical seminars. Each seminar will explore interdisciplinary questions related to a topic in the humanities and extend expository writing skills introduced in GPS Writing Workshop. In addition, students will attend up to six evening events, including spotlight lectures, panel discussions, and film screenings. The expectation is that Perspectives on Humanities will be taken in fall or spring of the second year.   Interactive Media Arts Major (pg 96)   IMA Majors may take up to three approved electives outside the Interactive Media Arts (IMA) Program course listings, but no more than two per semester. In addition, we anticipate one online class will be offered by IMA and available to IMA Majors throughout the global network each semester, pending demand for the course. IMA Majors may petition to take one additional non-IMA course to apply towards their Major requirements through the following programs: Interactive Media (IM) at NYU Abu Dhabi, Integrated Digital Media (IDM) at NYU Polytechnic School of Engineering, Interactive Telecommunications Program (ITP) at NYU Tisch, and Open Arts at NYU Tisch. Special permission by the IMA Director is required for approval of a fourth course towards the IMA Major.

Global Perspectives on Society II is a prerequisite for this course. Perspectives on Humanities classes are offered as writing intensive topical seminars. Each seminar will explore interdisciplinary questions related to a topic in the humanities and extend expository writing skills introduced in GPS Writing Workshop. In addition, students will attend up to six evening events, including spotlight lectures, panel discussions, and film screenings. The expectation is that Perspectives on Humanities will be taken in fall or spring of the second year.   Interactive Media Arts Major (pg 96)   IMA Majors may take up to three approved electives outside the Interactive Media Arts (IMA) Program course listings, but no more than two per semester. In addition, we anticipate one online class will be offered by IMA and available to IMA Majors throughout the global network each semester, pending demand for the course. IMA Majors may petition to take one additional non-IMA course to apply towards their Major requirements through the following programs: Interactive Media (IM) at NYU Abu Dhabi, Integrated Digital Media (IDM) at NYU Polytechnic School of Engineering, Interactive Telecommunications Program (ITP) at NYU Tisch, and Open Arts at NYU Tisch. Special permission by the IMA Director is required for approval of a fourth course towards the IMA Major.

These two courses have been replaced with general electives. Students who major in computer science are required to take 10 general elective courses. Please see the computer science majors\u2019 sample schedule here .   Global China Studies Major (pg 80)   The global China studies major has changed from a major to a track. Students who are interested in global China studies should complete the global China studies track. The course requirements for the track are the same as those listed for the major.\u00a0 Students who complete the track will graduate with a humanities major and global China studies track.
