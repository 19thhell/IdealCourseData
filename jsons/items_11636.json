This course looks at the various elements that make up and structure the contemporary urban subject in Asia. This includes architecture, art, technology and new media, and economic (and political economic) conditions. Attention is paid to the ways in which each of these factors create and organize life\u2014but the aim is also to examine how these elements are being recombined in ways that point to new orders of social life in general. The boundaries of crime, and of subculture, play an integral role in this view. While sociological analysis is part of the approach, the course also draws heavily on the ways in which conditions are formulated and expressed in fiction, film, animation, and fine art. The course entails some historical overview and comparison with earlier moments (especially the early 20th century), but the emphasis is on the situation now. It is also meant to provide a comparative view between major Asian cities, but will focus on particular cities (depending on the instructor, and when the course is offered). The conditions being discussed are also global, and so inevitably the topics expand beyond Asia as well, even while they have specificity in different regions. At stake overall is the changing conditions of life, of mass culture, and of the social community in Asia and the world. Historical Epics of China and Japan EAST-GA 1726 Roberts. 4 points. 2013-14, 2014-15. An in-depth study of the major epics of China, Japan, and Vietnam, from the historical-military and the social-romantic. The Chinese historical epic Three Kingdoms is read against the Japanese epic Tale of the Heike. Emphasis is placed on the political nature of the dynastic state form, the types of legitimacy and the forms of rebellion, the process of breakdown and reintegration of an imperial house, the empire as dynasty and as territory, and the range of characterology. In the second half of the course, the Chinese classic Dream of the Red Chamber is read against the Japanese The Tale of Genji. In addition to the above-mentioned topics, attention is given to the role of women and marriage in a governing elite, the modalities of social criticism in a novel of manners. The Vietnamese national classic Tale of Kieu is used as an introduction to the course because it combines all of the key topics. Particular attention is given to the ways in which Buddhist, Daoist, and Confucian doctrines function in each work. First-Year Seminar: Introduction to Critical Asian Studies EAST-GA 1001 4 points. 2013-14, 2014-15. This course is an introductory seminar offered to first-year graduate students in East Asian studies. The seminar provides a critical overview of the social, political, intellectual, and institutional history of the field of East Asian studies. Chinese Philosophy in Chinese EAST-GA 1223 Roberts. 4 points. 2014-15. Translation, Modernity, and History EAST-GA 1761 Karl. 4 points. 2013-14. Problems in the History of Early Modern China EAST-GA 1919 4 points. 2013-14, 2014-15. The Asiatic Mode of Production: Theory and History EAST-GA 2530 Karl. 4 points. 2014-15. Investigates aspects of the historical interpretation of China in the 19th and 20th centuries, focusing on the genesis and development of one of the most debated and enduring tropes of the historiography of China: the Asiatic mode of production. Structures of Modernity EAST-GA 2700 Looser. 4 points. 2014-15. This course starts with\u2014and aims to rethink\u2014the basic theoretical terms and practical conditions of mass culture and everyday life as definitive of modernity. In part, the course is framed by claims made in new media theory (especially with regard to the advent of digital electronic technologies) and the ways in which new media supposedly are placing us within new world horizons. Modernity, however, is made up of multiple moments of \"new media\"; this course provides historical perspective on these moments. Nor does the course assume a technological determinism; in addition to changing relations between \"new\" media (including theatre, film, and animation), it examines the changing structuring of experience in terms of narrative form; architecture; art; and urbanism. One of the unifying concerns, however, is history itself and the ways in which differing material conditions create new visions of, and positions within, history. History, therefore, is one of the means through which new media conditions claim to allow the rethinking of, and critique of, the grounds of modern experience. Emphasis is placed on Japan, but comparative material is drawn from elsewhere in Asia and the West; the context is for the most part global.

The program will   provide students with background in journalism and East Asian   Studies. Students   will gain a wide-ranging understanding of the country/area of   their   concentration (past and present) while also sharpening their   ability to   research, report and write for a sophisticated general public.   The curriculum   will be comprised of required classes from both the Arthur L.   Carter Journalism   Institute and the Department of East Asian Studies, as well as   elective courses   from other disciplines (such as History, Politics, and others).   The final   requirement will be a Master\u2019s Project.       40 credits over three terms   and completing a thesis in the fourth term for 2 credits for a   total of 42   credits. In East Asian Studies, the curriculum will consist of   the   core course First Year Seminar (Intro to Critical Asian Studies)   plus four other 4-credit electives. The East   Asian Studies electives may   be chosen from those offered in the East Asian Studies   Department or from other   NYU departments offering East Asian-related classes; courses   taken in other   departments would be subject to approval from the Director of   Graduate Studies   in East Asian Studies.   For the   Journalism component, the curriculum will consist   of three required core courses, two other 4-credit electives,   and the 2-credit   master\u2019s project. The required core courses are: Writing,   Research and   Reporting I; Writing, Research and Reporting II; and Journalism   Ethics or First Amendment Law. The two elective   courses will be selected from the department\u2019s specialized   reporting courses   offered in any given semester. The master\u2019s project requirement   is satisfied in   a 2-point Directed Reading course.       Master\u2019s Project . Students will be required to   complete a Master\u2019s Project: a heavily researched and reported   journalistic   work of 6,000 to 10,000 words in explanatory, investigative, or   narrative   style. Students enroll in a special two-credit course, Directed   Reading, to   support their efforts. It is expected that satisfying the MA   project   requirement will require continued work beyond the third   semester of   enrollment; therefore, the program will allow full-time status   for a fourth   semester of graduate work. Students working on the Master\u2019s   Project will   receive support in the form of workshops specifically for the   students in the   Global and Joint Program Studies program. The Master\u2019s Project   will be   evaluated by the East Asian Studies Director of Graduate Studies   and by his or   her faculty counterpart in the Journalism institute.      Language Requirements : Students   will be expected to already have very high level proficiency in   at least one East Asian language, prior to beginning the   program.
