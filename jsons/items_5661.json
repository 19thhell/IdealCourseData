For any student applying for transfer admission in the first semester of the freshman year of college/university, the focus of our evaluation will be primarily based on one's high/secondary school performance.          Because our applicants come from a broad range of secondary schools around the world, we understand that the options available to students will vary widely based on the schools they attend. Freshmen who are best prepared to succeed at NYU will have explored the following topics in their high schools:   4 years of English with a heavy emphasis on writing;  3-4 years of history/social studies;  3-4 years of mathematics;  3-4 years of laboratory sciences; and  3-4 years of a foreign language.   Students who are highly competitive for admission will choose the most demanding coursework available in their schools, with four years in each of the subjects above.     Proof of Graduation  Admitted students must provide the Office of Undergraduate Admissions with proof of graduation by July 1 of the year they plan to enroll. Extensions will only be granted for international students who attend schools that operate on a different academic calendar. In all cases, proof of graduation must be provided prior to beginning the first semester of classes at NYU.   The following documents serve as proof of secondary school graduation:       A final high school transcript submitted directly from the student\u2019s school. We will not accept a high school transcript submitted by the student. The final high school transcript must show the date of graduation.   Results from the General Education Development (GED) Test. Click here for more information about obtaining a GED.     Original or officially certified copies of nationally recognized high school graduation examination results, such as the Advanced Level General Certificate of Education or the International Baccalaureate Diploma.     A homeschool diploma, a certificate of completion of a homeschool program that is considered the equivalent of a high school diploma in the applicant's home state, or GED test results as listed above.       Final transcripts may be submitted by a school official through the Common Application website. All hardcopy materials should bear an official stamp, be signed and mailed from a student's school in a sealed envelope to:   New York University  Office of Undergraduate Admissions  665 Broadway, 11th Floor  New York, New York 10012  USA.   Documents may also be emailed to admissions.ops@nyu.edu but must still bear an official stamp, come from a school official, and be sent from an official school email address.

For any student applying for transfer admission in the first semester of the freshman year of college/university, the focus of our evaluation will be primarily based on one's high/secondary school performance.          Because our applicants come from a broad range of secondary schools around the world, we understand that the options available to students will vary widely based on the schools they attend. Freshmen who are best prepared to succeed at NYU will have explored the following topics in their high schools:   4 years of English with a heavy emphasis on writing;  3-4 years of history/social studies;  3-4 years of mathematics;  3-4 years of laboratory sciences; and  3-4 years of a foreign language.   Students who are highly competitive for admission will choose the most demanding coursework available in their schools, with four years in each of the subjects above.     Proof of Graduation  Admitted students must provide the Office of Undergraduate Admissions with proof of graduation by July 1 of the year they plan to enroll. Extensions will only be granted for international students who attend schools that operate on a different academic calendar. In all cases, proof of graduation must be provided prior to beginning the first semester of classes at NYU.   The following documents serve as proof of secondary school graduation:       A final high school transcript submitted directly from the student\u2019s school. We will not accept a high school transcript submitted by the student. The final high school transcript must show the date of graduation.   Results from the General Education Development (GED) Test. Click here for more information about obtaining a GED.     Original or officially certified copies of nationally recognized high school graduation examination results, such as the Advanced Level General Certificate of Education or the International Baccalaureate Diploma.     A homeschool diploma, a certificate of completion of a homeschool program that is considered the equivalent of a high school diploma in the applicant's home state, or GED test results as listed above.       Final transcripts may be submitted by a school official through the Common Application website. All hardcopy materials should bear an official stamp, be signed and mailed from a student's school in a sealed envelope to:   New York University  Office of Undergraduate Admissions  665 Broadway, 11th Floor  New York, New York 10012  USA.   Documents may also be emailed to admissions.ops@nyu.edu but must still bear an official stamp, come from a school official, and be sent from an official school email address.

Students, however, who are currently engaged in their first full-time semester of college/university work are welcome to apply. Since we will not have college/university grades to evaluate, mid-term grades will be expected and our evaluation will focus heavily on high/secondary school performance.   Transfer admission is competitive. Our admit rate fluctuates between 10% and 30% depending on space availability each semester. Our most competitive applicants have taken liberal arts and science/math courses at their current institution and have earned A and B grades. There is no minimum or cut-off GPA required for admission. Applicants who recently graduated from high school are most competitive if they earned an A to A- (90-95) average in high school liberal arts courses: English, math, science, history and foreign language. Please also note:     All transfer applicants must declare a major and will not be considered for admission as \u201cundecided\u201d candidates.     We are unable to consider transfer applicants for our Dual Degree Program in Engineering (offered between the College of Arts and Science and the Polytechnic School of Engineering), or for the Dual BA/DDS dental program (offered with NYU's College of Dentistry).     Applicants may apply for our International Relations major but should know that admission to NYU does not guarantee admission to the department. Students must apply separately to this program once they have arrived at NYU. If not offered admission to the International Relations program, entering transfer students will be able to declare another major within the College of Arts and Science upon arrival.     Some programs will require that admitted students re-take courses taken at a student's previous college/university upon arrival at NYU. This ensures that students have thoroughly mastered material of foundational and prerequisite courses as they are taught at NYU.     Certain sequential majors require a minimum number of semesters in order to complete all requirements (e.g. Economics requires five full semesters, Neural Science, Physics and other science majors generally require at least four). As a result, students entering NYU with junior standing should very carefully review major requirements to confirm that the degree can be completed in 4 years.     Students should not assume that all previous applicable coursework or pre-requisites will count towards their major at NYU. When a student is required to re-take a course at NYU, credit towards the major and BA/BS degree will only be given for the re-taken course. NYU does not count credits for a similar course twice.                                                                  College of Nursing                               Applicants seeking a second bachelor's degree in nursing should not use the Common Application and should instead follow the instructions given here .   Transfer applicants to the College of Nursing who are seeking their first bachelor's degree should follow the standard instructions outlined here .                                                              Gallatin School of Individualized Study                                 Your specific interest in an individualized program should be addressed in the Writing Supplement to the Common Application.     Artistic portfolio submissions will not be reviewed. If you plan to include creative or performing arts courses in your academic concentration, please indicate your depth of involvement in these areas in the Activity section of the Common Application. If you wish to further expand on how your particular artistic interest relates to your intended program of study at Gallatin, please elaborate under the Additional Information section (within the Writing section) of the Common Application.     We believe that 64 credits in residence at Gallatin (taken over the course of two years and under the guidance and mentoring of a Gallatin adviser), is the minimum amount of course work and time required for students to develop a proper concentration and establish an individualized program of study. Therefore, transfer students to the Gallatin School will be eligible to transfer a maximum of 64 credits upon their matriculation at Gallatin. Ultimately, 128 credits are needed to graduate from NYU. Ideally, transfer students will enter Gallatin in their sophomore year but no later than the beginning of their junior year. Only very rarely will freshmen be permitted to transfer in the middle of their freshman year.     If you entered Gallatin as a transfer student, you can study away for a full semester starting your second semester at Gallatin\u2014you must spend your first full semester as a Gallatin student in New York.   No more than 31 credits in business courses can count towards the Gallatin B.A. degree. This includes courses in NYU's Stern School of Business, the School of Professional Studies, and those transferred from other colleges and universities.   For a complete list of degree requirements, please visit the Gallatin website .                                                                Global Liberal Studies                               NYU offers both a Bachelor of Arts degree program in Global Liberal Studies (GLS) and a two-year Liberal Studies Core Program (which is only open to freshmen). Current NYU students and external transfer applicants from outside the University are welcome to apply for our unique, interdisciplinary program in GLS, featuring small classes, independent research, a senior thesis, immersive experiential learning abroad, and significant student-faculty contact. Applicants should be aware of the following:       Given the structured nature of the GLS curriculum and the featured junior year abroad, competitive applicants must be able to demonstrate suitable preparation for the junior year at one of NYU\u2019s global centers, as well as appropriate progress toward additional degree requirements in the lab sciences and math.   Competitive applications will include the following credentials:     Strong language skills in one of the following languages: French, German, Arabic, Hebrew, Spanish, Italian, Mandarin Chinese;   Expressed interest in the liberal arts with foundational coursework in the following fields of study: History, Philosophy, Politics, Art History, Religion, Rhetoric, Comparative Literature, Anthropology or English; and   Demonstrated experience in writing and research through prior coursework           Most competitive applicants will have completed a minimum of one-semester to one-year of college level coursework.   Those submitting their application into the sophomore year should expect to spend a minimum of one year prior to entry before the Junior Year abroad.   While the Office of Undergraduate Admissions will make every effort to count completed coursework toward elective credits, transfer students should expect to spend a minimum of 3 years at NYU to complete the GLS degree in its entirety, regardless of when they transfer to NYU.                                                                  Liberal Studies Core Program                               At this time, the Core Program does not consider either internal or external transfer applicants. Any students interested in the program would need to apply as incoming freshmen.                                                                Polytechnic School of Engineering                               The most competitive applicants to the Polytechnic School of Engineering are those who have already completed a minimum of one full-time semester of college/university coursework at another accredited institution when they apply for admission. Students who are currently engaged in their first full-time semester of college/university work are welcome to apply, but admission may be more competitive since we will not have college/university grades to evaluate. Instead, mid-term grades will be expected and our evaluation will focus heavily on high/secondary school performance.   Please note that if you have not already completed one full year of full-time college or university enrollment in liberal arts and science courses by the time you submit your application, you must meet the same standardized testing requirements that are outlined on our Standardized Tests page for Freshman Applicants.   The most competitive applicants have taken liberal arts and science/engineering courses at their current institution and have demonstrated strengths in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and higher level mathematics.   Some programs within the Polytechnic School of Engineering will require that admitted students re-take courses taken at a student's previous college/university upon arrival at NYU. This requirement ensures that students have thoroughly mastered material of foundational and prerequisite courses as they are taught at New York University. Students should not assume that all previous applicable coursework or pre-requisites will count towards their major at NYU. Note that when a student is required to re-take a course at NYU, credit towards the major degree will only be given for the re-taken course. NYU does not count credits for a similar course twice.   Applicants should note that the Polytechnic School of Engineering does not offer summer transfer admission.   Second Bachelor\u2019s in Engineering\u2028  Applicants seeking a second bachelor\u2019s in engineering should not use the Common Application and should instead follow the instructions given here .                                                              Silver School of Social Work                               An interview with a faculty member is usually required for transfer students with more than 48 credits.                                                                Steinhardt School for Culture, Education, and Human Development                               Applicants should note the program requirements below and understand that our Music Composition does not offer spring transfer admission to external candidates. In addition, neither our Music Business program or our Media, Culture and Communication program offer spring transfer admission to either internal or external transfer candidates.     Educational Theatre     Students applying to the Educational Theatre program are required to audition. For information about this requirement, please visit the department's website .   Media, Culture, and Communication   Any student applying to transfer or transition to the Media, Culture and Communication (MCC) major from within Steinhardt or elsewhere at NYU must have completed at least one MCC core course before applying, receiving a grade of B- or better. The Department also recommends that such students have at least a B- (2.7) cumulative grade point average. See the MCC website for more information.     Music     Auditions are required for all music programs. Audition procedures and requirements are available here . To expedite the scheduling of your audition, we recommend that transfer music applicants apply by March 15.   Studio Art     A portfolio with artist statement is required for all applicants to the Studio Art Program. Detailed portfolio submission requirements are available at the department's website .   Portfolios should be submitted directly to the department, not to the Office of Undergraduate Admissions. Note also that portfolios will not be reviewed until you have submitted all of the necessary credentials and your application for admission is complete.                                                                Stern School of Business                               Our transfer admission process is highly selective. For the Fall 2014 term, we were able to admit fewer than 25 applicants of the more than 1,000 students who applied from outside the University. The most competitive students typically present extraordinary records of achievement on both the undergraduate and secondary school levels and have fulfilled the required coursework.   Eligibility:   To be considered for transfer into Stern, you must:     Apply for Fall semester entry only (Stern does not accept Spring transfers).     Have completed (or be in the process of completing) one year or 30\u201332 semester hours/credits/points at your current college or university. This does not include credit awarded by examination (e.g., AP or IB) or college course credit earned while in secondary/high school.   Be in your Freshmen or Sophomore year. Students are only eligible for transfer admission to Stern to go into their sophomore or junior year. Stern will not consider transfer applications from current juniors or seniors. Please note that external transfers to Stern cannot transfer more than 64 credits of coursework.   Have completed (or be in the process of completing) the required coursework. Internal transfer applicants to the Stern School of Business can review a more detailed list of course equivalencies here .       Final transfer credit decisions will be made by Stern Advising once a student has been formally admitted.   Required Course Work:   Students wishing to transfer into the second/sophomore year should have completed the following courses (at minimum)\u2020 at their current institution:     1 semester of Calculus I or higher*   1 semester of Writing/Composition (2 semesters preferred)     Students wishing to transfer into the third/junior year should have completed the following courses (at minimum)\u2020 at their current institution:     1 semester of Calculus I or higher*     1 semester of Writing/Composition (2 semesters preferred)   1 semester of introductory-level Microeconomics**   1 semester of Statistics and regression***   1 semester of Financial Accounting     Notes on required course work:   Completing the above prerequisites at your current institution does not guarantee transfer of credit. Official approval of transfer credit takes place after your admission and after Stern evaluates your previous course work. Stern will not transfer any AP credit your current school may have awarded you in AB Calculus, Macroeconomics, Microeconomics, Statistics***, or English Language.   Admitted students should not plan on taking additional course work the summer before they enter Stern.   \u2020We understand that some students may not be able to complete all required courses by the time they apply. In this case, please provide an explanation in the \u201cadditional information\u201d section of your application for the admissions committee to review.   *The calculus course must be the equivalent of Calculus I or higher as offered by your school\u2019s mathematics department for math majors (compare to NYU\u2019s MATH-UA 121 course); Calculus courses \u201ctargeted\u201d to non-math majors (e.g., business calculus, elementary calculus, or calculus for social sciences) typically do not satisfy the calculus requirement for transfers. You may also use a score of 4 or 5 on AP BC Calculus, a 6 or 7 on a higher-level IB Math, or an A or B in GCE A-level Math to satisfy the math requirement.   **Students transferring into the junior year should have completed at least an introductory Microeconomics course (blended, one-semester Microeconomics-Macroeconomics courses are not sufficient). If you take an introductory Microeconomics course but are unable to take/complete an intermediate-level Microeconomics course at your current institution, you would be required to take a Stern-specified upper-level Economics course at NYU after you transfer.   ***Acceptance of your Statistics credit depends on passing a Stern proficiency exam after admission.   Again, internal transfer applicants to the Stern School of Business can review a more detailed list of course equivalencies here .   Additional Suggested Course Work:   In addition to the required coursework above, sophomore- and junior-year transfer students at Stern will have greater flexibility with course selection after admission if they have taken the courses below:   Rising Sophomores     1 natural science course (or an AP score of 4 or 5 in a biological, chemical, or physical science)     1 additional semester of Writing/Composition     1 Statistics course (STAT-UB 3 or a multiple regression course highly recommended)   1 Financial Accounting course       Rising Juniors     1 intermediate-level Microeconomics course   1 Natural Science course (or an AP score of 4 or 5 in a science)   1 additional Writing/Composition course, or an Introductory Philosophy or &quot;great books&quot; course   1 History/Arts course focusing on a specific culture or region   Introductory Business courses (e.g., Management, Operations, Marketing)\u2020\u2020       \u2020\u2020Certain business courses will require passing a Stern proficiency exam after admission. View course syllabi for more information.   Transfer Applicants to Stern\u2019s BS-MS in Accounting Program:   After admission, there is a separate application required for official admission to the BS-MS program.   Students interested in the BS-MS program (especially if they are applying as a rising junior) must have completed Financial Accounting before they transfer.   To complete the BS-MS program requirements, students must take a sufficient amount of coursework to obtain an undergraduate degree, followed by a summer intensive to obtain an MS in Accounting. Students transferring as rising sophomores should expect to complete 3 years of coursework followed by an intensive summer, while students transferring as rising juniors should expect to complete 2 years of coursework followed by an intensive summer.
