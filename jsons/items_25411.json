They will have the chance to test those ideas out with real learners at the New York Hall of Science, & subsequently improve on these designs. While the course will begin with a focus on constructivism & inquiry, students will experience the limitations of these learning theories as related to people's emotional & affective responses to instruction so designed. They will subsequently explore two much more \"playful\" learning modalities to help someone learn science: guided play & design-based science. Students will work in small teams to design & test instruction consistent with both approaches, aiming to teach the same middle school science content in both, so that they can compare & contrast their experiences. Three of the fourteen classes will be held on Saturdays to give students the opportunity to test their instructional designs-in-progress at the New York Hall of Science.

The selected environment can be a microworld, a game, distance education board, a content management system, a social network, or a computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL) tool such as a media-based data archive & analysis tool. Throughout the course, we evaluate a range of existing learning environments that use technologies for game creation, toolkits, community builders, & emerging communications media. Final project includes a theoretical paper & an accompanying ?architecture? map/model, & workflow plan based on the theories presented in the course.
