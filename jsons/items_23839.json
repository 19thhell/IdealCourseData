Marc N. Gourevitch, MD, MPH , Professor of Population Health and Medicine at NYU School of Medicine, was appointed the department\u2019s inaugural Chair.   A field of rapidly escalating importance, population health complements the individualized practice of clinical medicine by placing its focus on the health \u2013 both determinants and outcomes \u2013 of entire populations of persons, promoting proactive approaches to disease prevention and management at the community, health system and policy levels. By bridging diverse yet related disciplines and methodologies, the department advances discovery, translation and dissemination of health-related interventions with the goal of improving the health of populations in New York City and around the world.   The department serves as the academic home to several broad groups of scientists: Investigators from diverse disciplines focused on strategies and interventions to improve population health; investigators in epidemiology, biostatistics, and related fields of methodologic research; and medical ethicists. As researchers, faculty are engaged in dual roles: Building cutting-edge science in their areas of inquiry, and providing collaborative consultation to other investigators throughout our academic community at NYU Langone School of Medicine as well as across the University.   Educating the next generation of scientists in the discipline of population health is a central mission of the department. Our faculty teach at the undergraduate, medical student, and graduate levels in the School of Medicine and in other NYU programs.   The department takes pride in advancing real-world applications of its research, and collaboration with colleagues in other disciplines, as well as community partners and public sector stakeholders, is central to our mission.

By bridging diverse yet related disciplines and methodologies, the department advances discovery, translation and dissemination of health-related interventions with the goal of improving the health of populations in New York City and around the world.   The department serves as the academic home to several broad groups of scientists: Investigators from diverse disciplines focused on strategies and interventions to improve population health; investigators in epidemiology, biostatistics, and related fields of methodologic research; and medical ethicists. As researchers, faculty are engaged in dual roles: Building cutting-edge science in their areas of inquiry, and providing collaborative consultation to other investigators throughout our academic community at NYU Langone School of Medicine as well as across the University.   Educating the next generation of scientists in the discipline of population health is a central mission of the department.

Marc N. Gourevitch, MD, MPH , Professor of Population Health and Medicine at NYU School of Medicine, was appointed the department\u2019s inaugural Chair.   A field of rapidly escalating importance, population health complements the individualized practice of clinical medicine by placing its focus on the health \u2013 both determinants and outcomes \u2013 of entire populations of persons, promoting proactive approaches to disease prevention and management at the community, health system and policy levels. By bridging diverse yet related disciplines and methodologies, the department advances discovery, translation and dissemination of health-related interventions with the goal of improving the health of populations in New York City and around the world.   The department serves as the academic home to several broad groups of scientists: Investigators from diverse disciplines focused on strategies and interventions to improve population health; investigators in epidemiology, biostatistics, and related fields of methodologic research; and medical ethicists. As researchers, faculty are engaged in dual roles: Building cutting-edge science in their areas of inquiry, and providing collaborative consultation to other investigators throughout our academic community at NYU Langone School of Medicine as well as across the University.   Educating the next generation of scientists in the discipline of population health is a central mission of the department. Our faculty teach at the undergraduate, medical student, and graduate levels in the School of Medicine and in other NYU programs.   The department takes pride in advancing real-world applications of its research, and collaboration with colleagues in other disciplines, as well as community partners and public sector stakeholders, is central to our mission.
