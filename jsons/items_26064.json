While enrollment in the HTH plan is free to students studying abroad at NYU-London for the semester, they must maintain domestic coverage. Some important points to note:     Students will receive an e-mail from enrollment@hthworldwide.com welcoming them to HTH and notifying them to finalize the registration and print the HTH insurance ID card. The HTH insurance card must be printed!

Specialized programs are available in Africana studies, art and architecture, business, mathematics, British literature and writing, pre-health, and psychology. Courses in math, biology, chemistry, and physics accommodate students whose schedules might not otherwise allow for a semester of global study. Additionally, NYU is the only institution in London to offer science courses approved by the American Medical College Application Service (AMCAS) for medical school admittance. NYU London encourages students to enroll in for-credit internships with key institutions in fields including marketing, finance, media, law, politics, health, and theatre.     Students who spend a semester at NYU London live and learn in the heart of Bloomsbury, a neighborhood that is home to the British Museum, the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, and the West End (London\u2019s famous theatre district).

Click here for a link to her bio.   While studying abroad is an incredible experience, it often takes time to adjust to a new culture, living arrangements, food, language and submersion into the unfamiliar. Some students feel overwhelmed, others homesick. Some afraid, others depressed. Students may periodically feel out of sorts.   The attitudes toward counseling, or therapy, vary from one country to another. Similarly, the availability of resources and quality of services may be different from what a student is accustomed to in their home country.   Students must plan ahead before departure! Call the Wellness Exchange at 212.443.9999 or write to wellness.exchange@nyu.edu if help is needed in making connections to mental health professionals abroad.   If a student is currently attending counseling or seeing a therapist regularly, they should consider the following:     If treatment is essential to functioning, a student must identify a therapist PRIOR TO their departure!   If a student is considering taking a hiatus from treatment, they should have a plan in the event they need to see someone while abroad.     If a student is presently taking prescribed psychotropic medication:     The student must meet with their prescribing physician to discuss   Receive enough medication to last until the student returns. (Note: for some conditions and some medications, this is not possible)   Prescriptions from American doctors cannot be filled abroad. Obtain a referral to a psychiatrist or medical doctor abroad who can follow the student and write prescription refills.          Insurance Services in London     As part of the NYU London program, students are enrolled in a global health insurance plan called HTH Worldwide at no additional cost. This program provides students with improved access to medical and mental health services in the event they become ill or injured or require ongoing health or mental health care while abroad with New York University. While enrollment in the HTH plan is free to students studying abroad at NYU-London for the semester, they must maintain domestic coverage. Some important points to note:     Students will receive an e-mail from enrollment@hthworldwide.com welcoming them to HTH and notifying them to finalize the registration and print the HTH insurance ID card. The HTH insurance card must be printed!   If you have questions about medications or pre-existing conditions, please contact HTH to consult on pre-departure steps. 1.888.243.2358 or +1.610.254.8769 or globalhealth@hthworldwide.com   Students are enrolled in HTH for ONLY the dates of the program, so if they travel after the semester ends they are not covered by HTH.   HTH covers both mental and physical health care needs and can be utilized throughout the world, not just where students are studying.   Students must remain enrolled in their domestic health insurance plan while they are abroad (this is a condition of enrollment in NYU study abroad). Do NOT cancel the current health insurance.          Health Requirements in London       Health Requirements for All Students     Meningococcal vaccine is required for all undergraduate students.

NYU London encourages students to enroll in for-credit internships with key institutions in fields including marketing, finance, media, law, politics, health, and theatre.     Students who spend a semester at NYU London live and learn in the heart of Bloomsbury, a neighborhood that is home to the British Museum, the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, and the West End (London\u2019s famous theatre district).

Rodwin           There is a widely shared belief among American policy-makers that a   national program providing for universal entitlement to health care,   in the United States, would result in runaway costs.(1) In response to   this presumptive wisdom, nations that entitle all of their residents   to a high level of medical care and simultaneously spend less than the   United States, are often held up as exemplars. Canada's system of national   health insurance (NHI) is the most celebrated example.(2) French NHI, a   prototype of western European continental health systems, is another   case in point. Britain's National Health Service (NHS), although   typically considered a \"painful prescription\" for the United States   (Aaron and Schwartz 1984), assures first dollar coverage for basic   health services to its entire population and spends the smallest   share of its gross domestic product (GDP) on health care expenditures   (Table 9.1).        All of these countries have produced sonic of the leading physicians   and hospitals in the world. judging by various measures of health   status, they are in the same league or better than the United States.   In Britain, life expectancy at 60 - when medical care may have an   important impact - is lower than in the United States. But in the   United States over 15 per cent of the population remains uninsured   for health care services while spending, as a per cent of GDP,   surpasses that of all industrially advanced nations (OECD 1985).(3)           Table 9.1 Health care expenditures arid health stains        Health expenditures(1984)as % of GDP      Life expectancy (1980)     at birth   at age 60     males  females males  females      Infant mortality 2(1981)         France     9.1   70.1    78.3    17.2   22.3   .89    Canada     8.4   71.0     79.0   18.0   23.0  .85    Britain'     5.9   711.2     75.9   115.9   20.5  1.02    United States      10.7   69.6     76.7   17.2   22.4   1.09      Sources: Data on health expenditures arc from Schieber and Poullier 1986; data   on life expectancy and infant mortality arc from OECD 1985, Tables F.1 and F.2: 131.

Virtually no one in Canada or ill western Europe - not even the fiercest   critic - would want to import or even emulate the American system of   financing and organizing health care. But ill spite of this prevailing   view, a number of fashionable American ideas, most importantly the   concept of a health maintenance organization (HMO), have drifted   north to Canada and across the Atlantic to Europe. These ideas are   hardly popular. They are simmering and they represent a potentially   creative response to a number of present concerns in France, Canada   and Britain. Although all three of these countries, especially Canada   and Britain, have eliminated financial barriers to care, policymakers   still face three festering problems.        Economists, for example, emphasize that cost containment should not be   confused with allocative efficiency in the use of health care resources.   They point to the possibilities of obtaining more value for the money   spent oil health care in France, Canada, and Britain, as well as in the   United States.(4) This applies not only with regard to improving health   status (Cochrane 1972) but also with respect to altering input mixes   in the provision of health services - taking advantage of costclIfiective   treatment settings, e.g. ambulatory surgery, and personnel, e.g. nurse   practitioners.        Public health and medical care analysts criticize the lack of continuity   of care between primary, secondary, and tertiary levels. Although health   planners in France, Canada, and Britain have called for redistributing   resources away from hospitals to community-based ambulatory care services   and public health programs, the allocation of resources within health   regions has been notoriously biased in favor of the more costly technology based   medical care at the apex of the regional hierarchy (Rodwin 1984).(5) The consequence   of this allocational pattern has been to weaken institutional capability for   delivering primary care services. This has exacerbated the separation between   primary, secondary, and tertiary levels of care thus making it difficult for   providers to assure that the right patient receives the right kind of care,   in the right place and for the right reason.        Consumers have noted the inflexibility of bureaucratic decision-making   procedures and the absence of opportunities for exercising for what Hirschman   calls \"voice,\" in most health care organizations. Indeed, the problem of   control and how it should be shared between consumers, providers, managers,   and payers is at the center of all criticisms levelled against the current   structure of health care delivery in France, Canada, and Britain (Rodwin 1987).   In all of these systems, decisions about what medical services to provide, how   and where they should be provided, by whom and how often, are separated from the   responsibility for financing medical care.        In the context of these problems - inefficiency in the allocation of health   care resources, lack of continuity between levels of care, and the absence of   voice in most health care organizations - the concept of an HMO, in combination   with elements of market competition, has a certain intellectual appeal. Since an   HMO is, by definition, both an insurer and a provider of health services, it   establishes a link between the financing and provision of health services.   Since it is financed on the basis of prepaid capitation payments, its managers   have an explicit budget as well as a clearly defined clientele (population at   risk). Moreover, since an HMO is responsible - on a contractual basis - for   providing a broad range of primary, secondary, and tertiary level services    to its enrolled population, it has powerful incentives to provide these services   in a cost-effective manner while simultaneously maintaining quality SO as to    minimize the risk of disenrollment.        There are currently so many models of HMOs in the United  States that it is unwise to generalize about them. Nevertheless, the   evidence based on a large number of stable HMOs in the 1960s and 1970s   is persuasive in demonstrating that this form of health care financing   and organization can reduce hospital admissions by as much as 40 per cent   when compared with conventional fee-for-service practice (Luft 1981).          The idea of introducing HMOs - or similar kinds of health care organizations -   into national systems that provide universal entitlement to health care resembles,    in many ways, the American experience of encouraging medicare beneficiaries to    enroll in federally qualified HMOs or competing medical plans (CMPs). The idea    usually involves two reforms. It spurs policymakers to combine regulatory controls    with competition on the supply side; and it encourages them to design market    incentives for both providers and consumers of health care. In this chapter I    examine some new ideas along these lines for France, Canada, and Britain and    conclude with an assessment of their viability.      France: les reseaux de soins coordonnes (RSC)        France is noted for combining NHI with fee-for-service private practice   in the ambulatory care sector and a mixed hospital sector of which two-thirds   of all acute beds are in the public sector, and one-third in the private sector   (Rodwin 1981). Physicians in the ambulatory sector and in private hospitals   (known as cliniques) are reimbursed on the basis of a negotiated fee schedule.   Roughly 15 per cent of all physicians are allowed to set their own fees. And   physicians based in public hospitals ? the principal teaching and research   institutions - are reimbursed on a part-time or full-time salaried basis.   private cliniques are reimbursed on the basis of a negotiated per diem fee.   Public hospitals used to be reimbursed on a retrospective cost-based per   them fee but they have received prospectively set \"global\" budgets since 1984.        There are several problems in this system. From a public health point of view,   there is inadequate communication between full-time salaried physicians in   public hospitals and solo practice physicians working in the community.   Although general practitioners in the fee-for-service sector have informal   referral networks to specialists and public hospitals, there are no formal   institutional relationships which assure continuity of  medical care, disease prevention and health promotion services,   post-hospital follow-up care, and more generally systematic linkages   and referral patterns between primary, secondary, and tertiary level   services.        From tile point of view of economic efficiency criteria, there are additional   problems in the French health care system. Oil the demand side, two factors   encourage consumers to increase their use of medical care services: the   uncertainty about the results of treatment and tile presence of insurance   coverage. To reduce the risk of misdiagnosis or improper therapy physicians   are always tempted to order more diagnostic tests. Since NHI covers most of   the cost, there is no incentive - neither for the physician nor for the patient -   to balance marginal changes in risk with marginal increases in costs. This results   in excessive medical care utilization.        Oil the supply side, fee-for-service reimbursement of physicians has provided   incentives for them to increase their volume of services so as to raise their   income. Likewise, per diem reimbursement of cliniques and hospitals created   incentives to increase patient lengths of stay. The recent imposition of global   budgets, in France, has eliminated this problem but they represent a blunt   policy tool - one which tends to support the existing allocation of resources   within the hospital sector and, possibly, to jeopardize the quality of hospital   care. It is relatively easy for a hospital to receive all annual budget to   maintain its ongoing activities but extremely difficult to receive additional   compensation for higher service levels, institutional innovation or   improvements in the quality of care. Even with prospective budgets,   hospitals naturally seek to ma ' ximize the level of their annual   allocations and to resist budget cutbacks.        In summary, providers under French NHI have no financial incentives to   achieve savings while holding quality constant or even improving it.   Consumers have few incentives, other than minimal co-payments, to be   economical in their use of medical care. And, there are no incentives to   move the French system away from hospital-centered services toward new organizational  modalities.        Traditional solutions to these problems go in the direction of   making patients pay higher co-payments. For example, a 3 dollar daily co-payment    charge was recently imposed oil all hospital in-patient stays. Reimbursement for    drugs has become more restrictive, particularly for those with more questionable  therapeutic effects. Also, the government is allowing more physicians   to refuse assignment of their fees and engage in extrabilling. The problem   with these proposals is that they focus only on the demand side. They do   nothing to promote supply-side efficiency. It is in response to this challenge   that a proposal was recently developed to introduce a system of HMOs under   French NHI.        In French, the concept of an HMO was translated as a reseau de soins   coordonnes (RSC) - a network of coordinated medical services. The proposal,   published in the French Review of Social Affairs by two French economists, a   French physician and the present author (Launois et al. 1985), is based on   six principles:      Preservation of entitlements under NHI        All compulsory pay-roll taxes for NHI remain unchanged. All those covered   under French NHI, i.e. 99 per cent of the population, remain covered. The   current level of benefits becomes a minimum benefit package under the new plan.      Supply-side modernization through the creation of RSCs        Qualified RSCs - with minimum benefit packages - are retitiired to   allow open enrollment. RSCs could be organized by a variety of sponsors.   They would promote vertical integration in the health sector and place    hospitals, day surgery facilities, physicians, and other health-care    professionals at risk for providing cost-effective medical services.      Promotion of integrated medical care         The RSC assumes a contractual responsibility for providing its enrolled   population with all health services covered under French NHI. The patient   chooses a primary care physician who is in charge of making proper referrals   and managing patient      Prepayment on a capitation basis        The RSC receives a pre0-paid capitated monthly fee directly   front the beneficiary's NHI fund. This payment is equal to the   actuarial cost based on the enrollee's age, sex, and health status.   The RSC's annual budget is equal to its annual capitation payment multiplied   by the number of its enrollees. Within that constraint, managers have an   incentive to minimize costs and maximize patient satisfaction so as to avoid   disenrollment.      Marginal shifts in health care financing        Most of the capitated fee is financed directly by the beneficiary's NHI   fund. But since, in the aggregate, consumers pay roughly 15 per cent of all   health expenditures through co-payments, to make the proposal financially    viable there is an additional prepaid contribution by the beneficiary at the    time of enrollment. This would be equal to the difference between the capitation    fee charged by the RSC and the actuarial cost calculated by the beneficiary's NHI    fund. There is no payment at the time of service use, and all enrollees    who cannot afford the additional contribution are eligible for a state subsidy.      Competition between RSCs        Enrollment in RSCs is voluntary. This results in three levels of competition.   First, between RSCs and traditional NHI. Second, between RSCs themselves.   Third, between health care providers to whom RSCs will send their enrollees   presumably on the basis of their ability to keep quality high and costs low.        The six principles of this proposal were inspired by Alain Enthoven's (1980)   Consumer Choice Health Plan for the United States. But whereas Enthoven's   plan is designed to create a new form of NHI for the United States, tile RSC   proposal is largely a strategy to promote supply side efficiency within an   already existing NHI system. As in the case of competing medical plaits (CMPs) -   HMOs for Medicare beneficiaries in the United States - if French beneficiaries   choose to enroll in an RSC, they would lose their coverage under traditional NHI.   just as CMPs have to accept all Medicare beneficiaries who choose to   enroll, all RSCs would have to accept all French NHI beneficiaries who   choose to enroll, which could be 99 per cent of the population. Thus the   problem of adverse selection is somewhat reduced, although by no means absent.      Canada: publicly financed competition        Under Canadian NHI, although coverage for drugs is far less than in France,   there are no co-payments; there is first-dollar coverage for hospital and   medical services. Physicians in ambulatory care are paid predominantly on   a fee-for-service basis, according to fee schedules negotiated between   physicians' associations and provincial governments. In contrast to France,   physicians in hospitals are most often paid on a fee-for-service basis, as    in the United States.        There are few private for-profit hospitals in Canada such as French cliniques   and American proprietary or investor-owned institutions. Most acute care   hospitals in Canada are private nonprofit institutions. But their operating   expenditures are financed through the NHI system. And most of their capital   expenditures ?ire financed by the provincial governments.        In the United States, Canada's health system is typically depicted as a   model for NHI (Andreopoulos 1975). Its financing, through a complex shared   federal and provincial tax revenue formula, is more progressive than the   European NHI systems financed on the basis of payroll taxes. Canada's levels   of health Status are high by international standards. And it has achieved   notable success in controlling the growth of health-care costs. What, then,    are the problems in this system?        From the point of view of health-care providers, there is, above all, a   crisis of underfinancing. physicians complain about low fee levels.   Hospital administrators complain about draconian control of their budgets.   And other health care professionals note that the combination of a physician   \"surplus\" and excessive reliance on physicians prevents an expansion of their   roles. Although Robert Evans (1987) contends that Canadian costcontrol    policies cannot be shown to have jeopardized the quality of care, providers    and administrators, alike, claim that there has been deterioration since the    imposition of restrictive prospective budgets.        Leaving aside the issue of quality, the same issues discussed in  the context of France are present in Canada, with respect to economic efficiency.   Neither the hospital physician nor the patient have an incentive to be economical   in their use of health care resources. On the demand side, since patients benefit   from what is perceived as \"free\" tax-financed first-dollar coverage, they have   no incentive to choose cost-effective forms of care. For example, in the case of   a demand for urgent care, there is no incentive for a patient to use community   health centers rather than rush directly to the emergency room.        On the supply side, physicians lack incentives to make efficient use of hospitals   which are essentially a free good at their disposal. There are no incentives for   altering input mixes to affect practice style (technical efficiency). Nor are   there incentives for providers to evaluate service levels and the kinds of   therapy performed in relation to improving health status (allocative efficiency).   It could be argued that these problems are common to all health systems. But   they are especially acute in a system characterized by a bilateral monopoly   that tends to support the status quo. On the one hand, providers have strong   monopoly power which they use to defend their legitimate interests; on the   other, the monopsony power of sole source financing (under Canadian NHI) keeps   provider interests in check at the cost of not intervening in the organizational   practice of medicine.        Stoddard (1985) has characterized the problems of the Canadian health system as   \"financing without organization.\" In his view, Canadian provinces \"adopted a   'pay the bills' philosophy, in which decisions about service provision ? which   services, in what amounts, produced how, by whom, and where ? were viewed as   the legitimate domain of physicians and hospital administrators\"   (Stoddard 1985: 3). The result of this policy is that provincial governments   were concerned about maintaining a good relationship with providers. This   concert) has not avoided tough negotiations and occasional confrontations.   But there has been no effort to devise new forms of medical-care practice,   e.g. HMOs or new institutions to handle the growing burden of long-term care   for the elderly. The side effect of Canadian NHI has been to support the   separation of hospital and ambulatory care and to reinforce traditional   organizational structures.        As in France, or the United States, there are, in essence, two strategies   for managing the Canadian health system and making  adjustments. The first involves greater regulation oil the   supply side - even stronger controls oil hospital spending,   more rationing of medical technology, more hospital closures and    mergers and eventual prohibition of extra billing. The second involves    increased reliance upon market forces oil tile demand side various forms    of user charges such as co-payments and deductibles now advocated as forms   of privatization. Neither strategy is likely to succeed on its own. The    former will control health?care expenditures in the short run but it    fails to affect practice styles. Its effectiveness runs the risk of    exacerbating confrontation between providers and the state and    jeopardizing health care needs. The latter deals with only part    of the problem - the demand side - and neglects the issue of supply    side efficiency. It provides no mechanism by which consumer decisions    can generate signals to providers to adopt efficient practice styles.    Moreover, it is likely to raise the level of total (public and private)    expenditures.        Due to the deficiencies which may occur if each strategy is followed   independently, Stoddard (1983) has devised an innovative proposal for   the province of Ontario, one that relies oil the use of market forces   while maintaining the full benefits of a compulsory and universal NHI   program. His proposal, which lie calls \"publicly financed competition,\"   rests oil four principles:      Creation of three payment modalities on the supply side        Physicians would have the choice of practicing in solo or group practice   in the fee-for-service modality, or accepting a capitation fee per   person enrolled in their practices, or accepting salary payment in   return for working in community health centers organized by the public   sector. Fees in the fee-for-service modality mould correspond to the   current fee schedule and extra-billing would be allowed to continue.   The capitation rate would be based on the average cost of insured    services per patient across all three payment modalities. Salaries    as well as staffing, programs, and service mix in the community health    centers Would be set by Ministry of Health planners.      Financing of NHI is unchanged        All citizens would pay for health care through the tax system as   they currently do.      Choice of primary care provider        All citizens would continue to choose a primary care provider but   they would have to commit themselves to one modality of selected    primary care for a specified period of time. The NHI program would no    longer cover services not sought from or approved by the primary care    provider. All services used by each patient over the course of the year    would be charged to the appropriate payment modality.      Calculation of premium for each payment modality         At the end of each enrollment period, the premium for each modality   would be adjusted. based on its total costs. The least costly modality    would then become the baseline which would be fully covered under the   Ontario Health Insurance Plan. Patients enrolled in the two more costly    modalities would have to pay the difference between the baseline and the    higher premium.        Although these principles are not as elaborately developed as the French RSC   model, they are equally provocative and present a serious challenge to the   status quo. Since the relative premiums of the three modalities are calculated    on the basis of the average per capita cost including utilization, there would    be powerful incentives to reduce such utilization. Assuming government measures    are taken to assure a minimum level of medical care quality across payment    modalities, these four principles create a system in which the patient   benefits from seeking an efficient provider and the provider benefits    by choosing cost-effective styles of practice. The level of health    benefits remains the same across the three modalities; access to care    would not be restrained by user charges; and adverse selection between    payment modalities would be carefully monitored by requiring open    enrollment and eventually introducing premium adjustments which    would take into account age, sex as well as health status.      Britain: internal markets and HMOs        Britain is the exemplar of a National Health Service. It is financed   almost entirely through general revenue taxation and accountable   directly to the Department of Health and Social Security (DHSS) and   Parliament. Access to health services is free of charge to all British   subjects and to all legal residents. But despite the universal entitlement,   Britons spend only 5.9 per cent of their GDP on health care - one half of what   Americans spend as a percentage of their GDP.        Although the NHS is cherished by most Britons, there are, nevertheless,   some serious problems concerning both the equity and efficiency of resource   allocation in the health sector. With regard to equity, in 1976 the Resource   Allocation Working Party (RAWP) developed a formula for the allocation of   NHS funds between regions (DHSS 1976). The formula represents one of the most    far-reaching attempts to allocate health care funds because it    incorporates regional differences in measures of health status.    Slow progress is now being made in redistributing the aggregate    NHS budget along the lines of RAWP, but substantial inequities still    remain both from the point of view of spatial distribution as well as    from the point Of View Of social class (Townsend and Davidson 1982).        With regard to efficiency, the problems are even more severe because NHS   resources are extremely scarce by international standards. Since there is   less slack, the marginal costs of inefficiency are higher than in western   Europe or the United States. And since the NHS faces the same demands as   other systems to make available new technology and to care for an   increasingly aged population, British policy-makers recognize that   they must pursue innovations that improve efficiency. But there are   numerous institutional obstacles in the way.        The tri-partite structure of the NHS is, itself, a major source of   inefficiency. Regional health authorities (RHAs) are responsible for   allocating budgets to hospitals in their regions. Hospitalbased   \"consultants\" are paid on a salaried basis with distinguished   clinicians receiving \"merit awards\" and all consultants have the   right to see a limited number of private fee-paying patients in \"pay   beds.\" Outside the RHA budget are family practitioner committees (FPCs)   responsible for remunerating general practitioners (GPs), ophthalmologists,   dentists, and pharmacists. The GPs are reimbursed on a capitation basis   with additional remuneration coming from special \"practice allowances\"    and fee-for-service payment for specific services, e.g. night visits    and immunizations. Separate from both the RHAs and the FPCs are the   local authorities (LAs) that are responsible for the provision of    social services, public health services, and certain community nursing services.        Such an institutional framework creates perverse incentives to shift   borderline patients from GPs to hospital consultants, to the community,    and back to the hospital. GPs, for example, have no incentive to minimize    costs and can impose costs on RHAs by referring patients to hospital    consultants or for diagnostic services. NHS managers can shift costs    from the NHS to social security by sending elderly hospitalized patients    to private nursing homes. And, consultants can shift costs back on to the    patient by keeping long waiting lists thereby increasing demand for their    private services. As in France and Canada, neither the patient nor the    physician in Britain bear the costs of the decisions they make; it is    the taxpayer who pays the bill.        Three recent strategies, all of them inadequate, have attempted to deal   with this problem (Maynard 1986b). The first came promptly with the   arrival of the Thatcher government. After cautious attempts to    denationalize the NHS by promoting a shift toward NHI and privatization,    the Conservative government backed off when they realized that such an    approach would not merely provoke strong political opposition but also    increase public expenditure and, therefore, conflict with their budgetary    objectives (McLachlan and Maynard 1982). Instead, the strategy was narrowed    in favor of encouraging competition and market incentives in limited areas.    To begin with, the government allowed a slight increase of private beds in    NHS hospitals. In addition, it introduced tax incentives to encourage the    purchase of private health insurance and the growth of charitable    contributions. Also the government encouraged local authorities to    raise money through the sale of surplus property and to contract out    to the private sector such services as laundry, cleaning, and catering .       The second response was the Griffiths Report, which resulted in yet another   reorganization in the long history of administrative reform within the NHS.   Mr Griffiths, the former director of a large British department store chain,   introduced the concept of a general manager at the department (DHSS), regional,   district, and unit levels. This individual is now presumably responsible for the   efficient use of the budget of each level of the NHS. The problem, however, is   that the tri-partite structure of the system remains unchanged; and the general   managers have very little information about least-cost strategies (across  the tripartite structure) for generating improvements in health status.        The third and most recent response to the problem of improving efficiency   has been to reduce the drug bill. Since April 1985 the government has   limited the list of reimbursable drugs and reduced the pharmaceutical   industry's rate of return. These measures will help contain the costs   of the only openended budget within the NITS. But there is no evidence   that they will have any impact on the efficiency of health care expenditures.        The more innovative efficiency-improving ideas have been developed   by Enthoven and Maynard. They concern the promotion of \"internal   markets\" and HMOs within the existing system of entitlements provided   under the NHS. The essence of these ideas is to create financial   incentives for each district to provide its residents with the best   medical care possible, even if it has to purchase services outside   of its boundaries. The aim is to maximize the benefits of health   service expenditures, as measured by some measure of health status,   e.g. qualityadjusted life years (QALYs); or to minimize the costs of   sustaining a given level of QALYs. It sounds entirely theoretical but   cost-effectiveness studies can produce empirical results. Recent   findings indicate that the cost of a QALY of hemodialysis in a hospital   is fourteen times that of a corollary artery by-pass graft and more than   fifteen times that of a hip replacement (Torrance 1984; Williams 1985).        Short of allocating the entire NHS budget so as to maximize QALYs,   there are a number of efficiency-improving measures that could be   taken in the short run. For example, to avoid long queues for elective   surgery in some regions and excess capacity in others, incentives could   be devised to reward those regions receiving what the British call   \"cross-boundary flows.\" Or to persuade GPs to prescribe economically,   a system could be devised to allow GPs to share in the savings. Beyond   these examples of internal markets, Enthoven and Maynard have proposed   variations of all HMO Plan for the NHS.        In Enthoven's plan, which he considers a form of \"market socialism,\"   a district continues to receive a RAWP-based per capita revenue and   capital allocation and remain responsible for providing health services   to its resident population (Enthoven 1985). In contrast to the present   system, however, it receives additional compensation for services   provided to residents from other districts and it controls referrals to   providers outside its district. fit short, the district controls all   budgets within the tripartite structure and purchases health services   from the most cost-effective sources outside its borders. In effect,   it operates as an HMO. Consultants and GPs enter into a variety of   contractual arrangements with district authorities and district   authorities are free to enroll consumers near the borders of a   neighboring district.        fit Maynard's plan the GP functions as a client budget holder   (Maynard 1985). All Britons receive a voucher front the NHS which   entities them to sign up with a GP of their choice. The voucher   generates a per capita payment to the GP in return for the provision   of comprehensive health care for a year, after which the patient can   choose another GP. The GP is responsible not merely for providing primary   care but also for purchasing hospital services front public or private hospitals.        Both plans would provoke rapid reorganization of the health sector in   Britain. The Enthoven plan would shift power to district managers -   far more than they now exercise following the Griffiths reforms. The   Maynard plait would shift power to GPs who would need to hire managers   to assist with HMO formation. Needless to say, the details of these plans   require a great deal more study. But even at such a level of generality,   what is most interesting is the extent to which they resemble new ideas    in France and Canada.      HMOs and universal entitlement: the promise and potential pitfalls        Ideas about introducing HMOs and elements of market competition into   national health systems with universal entitlement hold promise because   they point to the possibilities of combining some of the best features   in the United States, Canada, and western Europe. The French plait for   RSCs, the Canadian proposal for publicly financed competition, and the   ideas about internal markets and HMOs in Britain focus on combining the   supply-side efficiency embodied in a well-managed HMO with the financial   security of a universal NHI system. To the extent that such ideas can be   made to work in practice, they would probably provide more realistic   models for the United States than the present structure of health care   financing and organization in either France, Canada, or Britain.        But are these new ideas for health policy feasible in either the   United States or France, in Canada or Britain? It would be naive to,   conclude without adding some cautionary observations.        The proposals we have examined rest on two important assumptions: first,   that competition between health care organizations will increase efficiency    in the allocation of resources; and second, that health care providers can be    motivated to change their behavior in response to financial incentives.    The first assumption fails to circumvent a fundamental characteristic of    health care markets - \"informational assynimetry.\" The prevailing    uncertainty about the effectiveness of various forms of medical    care and the inability of consumers to assess quality makes them    likely to turn to physicians for advice. Economists have shown that    in markets characterized by agent-principal relationships in which    buyers and sellers are unequally informed, competition does not    necessarily lead to efficiency (Arrow 1963). In traditional, fee-for-service    medicine, financed by third-party payers, physicians are likely to err on the    side of overutilization. In HMO-type settings, due to prepayment, financial    incentives are reversed and there is a risk of under-utilization. HMOs may    increase competition between providers more than traditional indemnity    coverage, but given the special characteristics of the health sector,   it is impossible to draw inferences oil the basis of economic theory    about the impact of increased competition on welfare (Weisbrod 1983).        The second assumption fails to acknowledge that health care providers do   not behave like profit-maximizing firms. Only a small fraction of   hospitals in France, Canada, Britain as well as the United States,   are proprietary institutions. In the main, they are public and non-profit   organizations with powerful missions and community allegiances. As for   physicians, although much of their behavior, particularly in France,    Canada, and the United States, has an entrepreneurial character, they    are, nevertheless, members of a highly reputed profession and have    consequently internalized a powerful set of values and norms. The    extent to which financial incentives will influence the behavior of    health care providers is bounded by the psychological, cultural.    and institutional context within which they work (Brown 1981).        If, in deference to realism, we relax these two assumptions, it is   important to note that the combination of HMOs and universal   entitlement betrays a number of potential pitfalls.        First, efforts to promote competition between RSCs in  France, the three payment modalities in Canada, and   districts or GI) client budget holders in Britain, may   result in competition over attributes other than price   and quality. The theory of monopolistic competition suggests   that a system of competing health care organizations would lead to   product differentiation. Competition may well be focused on features   other than delivering medical care, for example, amenities, marketing,   and advertising. Also, there is a risk of collusion between competing health    care organizations, which may result in providers demanding government    regulation to maintain their market share.        Second, efforts to promote competition create incentives for providers to   engage in risk selection. This would result in health risks or expected   medical care costs being distributed unevenly among RSCs, payment modalities,   or client budget holders. Of course, in elaborating the operational details of   all these proposals, attempts would be made to identify the health risks of all   beneficiaries based on criteria such as age, sex, residence, and perhaps    even health status and certain socio-demographic characteristics. Nevertheless,    even if health care organizations are compensated for beneficiaries with higher    health risks, whatever system of risk rating is used, studies based on the    experience of Medicare's competing medical plans (CMPs) suggest that the    possibilities for risk selection are abundant (Eggers 1980).        Third, efforts to change physician behavior by confronting them with   new financial incentives are likely to place physicians in the   uncomfortable position of choosing between their ethical obligation    to do the most for their patients, their natural inclination to pursue    their own interests and organizational constraints, which encourage them    to contain costs. Such a position is bound to erode doctor-patient    relationships with no assurance of efficiency improvements in the allocation    of health resources.        Fourth, all of the above potential pitfalls suggest that the new ideas   for health policy, which we have examined, would create extraordinary   possibilities for \"gaining the system.\" For example, to skim healthy   young patients and keep away frail elderly patients, a French RSC or   the Canadian payment modality based in community health centers might   decide to invest in exceptional amenities for a new birthing center   and I. under-service\" geriatric cases. Or in Britain, GP client budget  holders might make referrals with few limitations for young healthy   patients but drastically restrict them far elderly people. Suppose    the Gil makes too few referrals and lowers the drug bill too much in    order to appropriate a larger share of the savings. Would there be    sanctions? Who would monitor the system?        That there are possibilities for gaming tile system has led   Alain Enthoven (1986) to recognize that consumers could not   negotiate effectively oil their own. They would need \"sponsors\"   to \"manage the demand side (and) to make the market achieve   desirable results.\" But this fact should not detract front tile   promise held by the idea of combining HMOs and universal entitlement.   It merely exposes the illusion that competing HMOs could somehow operate   as all alternative to strong government regulation. Clearly in a system   of competing HMOs under NHI or within all NHS, sponsors would demand   vigilant government regulation.      The kinds of government titles and regulations under which any of   the above proposals would most likely have to operate include the following:      Periodic open enrollment;      Standard benefit packages with minimum specified benefits;      Standardized information disclosure by all competing health care   organizations of data oil utilization trends, per capita costs   (including premiums and out-of-pocket expenses), hospital mortality   and patient characteristics (including health status);       Spot checks oil the veracity of the disclosed information;       Monitoring of quality.         How would such a system of \"regulated\" or \"managed\" competition   compare with existing forms of more centralized regulation and budget   control in France, Canada, and Britain? Would it succeed in producing    efficiency improvements, greater continuity of medical care, and more    flexibility in decision Making procedures? The evidence, at this point,    is too fragmentary to serve as any reliable guide for policy. Nor is it    ever likely to persuade analysts who are predisposed to accept the    competition/regulation dichotomy in health policy.(6) But the curious    melange of competition and regulation implied by these ideas for health    policy in France, Canada, and Britain, do suggest one conclusive    proposition. Whatever reforms are pursued in the health sector,    there will always be a number of underlying tensions - between    the patient's desire to take extra precautions and mobilize a    maximum amount of attention. irrespective of costs, and a    collective desire to contain costs; between a clinician's   inclination to err on the side of overprovision, at the    margin, and an HMO's or a government's rationale for making    decisions on the basis of statistical averages; and between    an HMO's or a government's persistent attempts to measure    medical care activities and performance and the formidable    difficulties of perceiving and measuring results.

Schwartz, \"Policy options and the impact Of    national health insurance,\" New England Journal of Medicine (1974) 290, 24: 1345-58.      See e.g. Andreopoulos (1975) and the more recent work of Robert Evans (1985).      Estimates of the uninsured range from 15 per cent to 20 per cent of the   population. In 1984 the Current Population Survey estimated that 35.1   million people, 17.1 per cent of the population under 65, were without    insurance. The percentage increases if one broadens the definition to    include the underinsured and otherwise medically disadvantaged. See M.B.    Sulvetta and K. Swartz (1986) The Uninsured and Uncompensated Care:    A Chartbook , Washington, DC: National Health Policy Forum George    Washington University, June.      The literature in health economics is abundant with examples of   efificiency-improving changes in patterns of health care organization.   For classic statements on this theme, see Fuchs (1975) and Enthoven (1978).   For examples in France, Giraud and Launois (1985); in Canada, Evans and   Robinson (1980); in Britain, Abel-Smith (1976) and Maynard (I 986b).      Daniel Fox (1986) traces the evolution of this pattern - what   lie calls \"hierarchical regionalism\" - in an historical study of   health policy developments in Britain and the United States.      The misleading nature of this dichotomy has been well analyzed by  Luft (1985) and Schramm (1986), among others.       References      Aaron, H. and Schwartz, W.
