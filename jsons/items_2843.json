Srivatsan; vsrivats@stern.nyu.edu ; Office: KMC 7-49    The course has three goals:    (1) Introduce the student to the academic discipline of human and economic development    (2) Focus on the role of the private sector in promoting development through social enterprise    (3) Utilize the context of India - one of the oldest, and the longest living, of human civilizations      One of the lessons that we will learn is that we cannot fully understand development without a deep understanding of a particular society's culture, values, traditions, institutions and practices. However the academic understanding of these issues is far less rigorous than those on market and government-related ones and thereby leads to many puzzles, enigmas and mysteries. In order to gain a greater insight into how these societal particularities inter-relate and interact with economic development, we shall familiarize ourselves with the culture, history and institutions of India, as well as go on excursions in and around Mumbai and Chennai. The hope is that through lectures, documentaries, discussions and excursions, students will gain a deeper understanding of human development in general, as well as economic development in the specific Indian context. Building on this conceptual understanding we will use cases to discuss how various private sector actors - for-profit and not-for-profit, small and large, start-ups and ongoing initiatives - are helping to solve some of these deep problems and are overcoming some daunting challenges. The focus of this course and especially the students' final group project is to look at how developmental issues, which were previously believed to be in the domain of the public sector alone, can be fruitfully addressed by the private sector and/or by public-private partnerships.

Program Overview                                              Course Overview                                     ECON-UB 223 Social Enterprise and Economic Development: The Indian Context, 3 credits  Professor V. Srivatsan; vsrivats@stern.nyu.edu ; Office: KMC 7-49    The course has three goals:    (1) Introduce the student to the academic discipline of human and economic development    (2) Focus on the role of the private sector in promoting development through social enterprise    (3) Utilize the context of India - one of the oldest, and the longest living, of human civilizations      One of the lessons that we will learn is that we cannot fully understand development without a deep understanding of a particular society's culture, values, traditions, institutions and practices. However the academic understanding of these issues is far less rigorous than those on market and government-related ones and thereby leads to many puzzles, enigmas and mysteries. In order to gain a greater insight into how these societal particularities inter-relate and interact with economic development, we shall familiarize ourselves with the culture, history and institutions of India, as well as go on excursions in and around Mumbai and Chennai. The hope is that through lectures, documentaries, discussions and excursions, students will gain a deeper understanding of human development in general, as well as economic development in the specific Indian context. Building on this conceptual understanding we will use cases to discuss how various private sector actors - for-profit and not-for-profit, small and large, start-ups and ongoing initiatives - are helping to solve some of these deep problems and are overcoming some daunting challenges. The focus of this course and especially the students' final group project is to look at how developmental issues, which were previously believed to be in the domain of the public sector alone, can be fruitfully addressed by the private sector and/or by public-private partnerships.                                   Eligibility                                    This course is open to matriculated NYU Stern Juniors and Seniors who are in good standing with Stern and the University and meet the following prerequisites:   \u2022 Minimum 3.0 GPA (study abroad requirement)  \u2022 Must be enrolled at Stern in New York City for the Fall 2015 semester  \u2022 Plan to graduate no earlier than May 2016 (January grads are not eligible)  \u2022 ECON-UB1 Microeconomics (or equivalent)  \u2022 ECON-UB11 Economics of Global Business (or CAS equivalent ECON-UA238 International Economics)      This course can count as an Advanced Global Business Elective, a Social Entrepreneurship minor Elective, a Stern Advanced Economics Elective or a General Stern Elective.
