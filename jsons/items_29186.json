I especially favor strong songwriters who can tell a story and strong singers who can make the music come alive. I love the music business because it&rsquo;s currently in a state of transition and I am in the position to teach those who want to be involved both behind the scenes or on the stage.&rdquo;                 Department of Music and Performing Arts Professions - 35 W. 4th Street, Suite 1077 -  New York, NY 10012 -  212 998 5424    This site, and all its contents, are Copyright &copy;    by New York University.
