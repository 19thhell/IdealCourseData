As a prospective student, try to think of your audition as a unique opportunity for you to introduce yourself to people who are your advocates and who very much want you to be good at what you do. This \"mind set\" will serve you well in any audition situation.    Always remember to take your time and to breathe.    Your task is to share your talents - not to impress the auditors!        Professor Brian Gill with audition advice.    Undergraduate Procedures and Requirements           How do I audition for the program?           What do I prepare for my Undergraduate Audition?           What do I prepare for my Undergraduate Transfer Audition?           What do I bring to my audition?           What do I wear to my audition?           What should I expect at my audition?             How do I audition for the program?    Part I: Submit application to NYU Steinhardt. All prospective students &ndash; except those attending the November 15 Undergraduate Open House auditions &ndash; must first submit an application for admission to the Steinhardt School at New York University. You can find information on the application process through the appropriate admissions office.    Office of Undergraduate Admissions \u2028 212-998-4500    Office of Graduate Admissions \u2028 212-998-5030    Part II: Upload Pre-screening Materials: All prospective students &ndash; except those attending the November 15 Undergraduate Open House auditions &ndash; are required to submit a video pre-screening submission prior to being invited to a live audition. In this process, you will make short videos and upload them to GetAcceptd, a company created for this purpose. You may begin this process at:        All pre-screening submissions must be uploaded by the dates below. Materials submitted after these dates may not be accepted.    Early Decision I: November 1 Early Decision II: December 1 Regular Decision: December 15 Transfer Applicants: March 1    Rather than a single long video, we would like three separate clips: the introduction, the first song, and the second song. It&rsquo;s easier for us to review and easier for you to shoot. We will not be influenced by the professional quality of the video. Please do not worry about any elaborate lighting or studio conditions. Below are the requirements and suggestions for your material.       Introduction: Please say your name clearly, the city you are from, and the pieces that you are going to do. Include the Specialization for which you are auditioning (classical voice) and the degree level you would be entering (freshman, transfer).       Two songs: Your two selections should be complete and contrasting songs. Each selection should be no longer than four minutes. One of your songs must be in English and the other in a foreign language &ndash; Italian, German, or French. Piano must accompany you (no a capella singing). Please make sure your voice can be heard above the accompaniment &ndash; try different distances from the sound source until you find the right &ldquo;balance&rdquo; between piano and voice.       Upload a resum&eacute;.       Upload a headshot or photograph.    After uploading the pre-screening submission, you will immediately be notified that we have received your materials. After those materials have been reviewed, you will be sent an email inviting you to an audition in person, or an email notice that no additional audition is required. This review process can take anywhere from 2-4 weeks. If you are invited to an audition, you must prepare materials according to the guidelines below. If you cannot travel to New York you will have the option of submitting a video audition.    Invited Audition Dates for Undergraduates and Transfers Only: \u2028 Saturday, November 22, 2014 ( last day for Early Decision I candidates to audition )\u2028 Saturday, January 31, 2015\u2028 ( last day for Early Decision II candidates to audition )\u2028 Sunday, February 8, 2015 Sunday, February 22, 2015 Saturday, February 28, 2015 (last day for freshman auditions) \u2028 Saturday, April 4, 2015 ( transfer applicants only )    *The last audition date for undergraduate freshman applicants is February 28. This is also the last date for all talent awards for undergraduate applicants.        What do I prepare for my Undergraduate Audition?    Three (3) Songs : At least one of your songs must be in English and one must be in a foreign language &ndash; Italian, German, or French. Your songs must be sung from memory , and each selection should be no longer than four minutes.    Sight-Reading: Testing your ability to sight-sing music helps us determine your basic musicianship skills. You will be provided with a piece of music and will be expected to sing the melodic line. Sight-singing is a skill that singers develop through a process of ear-training. You can, and should, practice this before your audition. Music theory, music history, and keyboard performance are essential elements in any music curriculum. Study and preparation in these areas will also be a great advantage to you.        What do I prepare for my Undergraduate Transfer Audition?    Four (4) Songs : One of your four songs must be in English and each of the others in a differing foreign language &ndash; Italian, German, or French. Your songs must be sung from memory , and each selection should be no longer than four minutes.    Sight-Reading: Testing your ability to sight-sing music helps us determine your basic musicianship skills. You will be provided with a piece of music and will be expected to sing the melodic line. Sight-singing is a skill that singers develop through a process of ear-training. You can, and should, practice this before your audition. Music theory, music history, and keyboard performance are essential elements in any music curriculum. Study and preparation in these areas will also be a great advantage to you.    Note for Prospective Transfer Students: Though NYU's deadline for Spring transfer admission is November 1 and our deadline for Summer/Fall transfer admission is April 1, we suggest that you submit your Common Application one month in advance. Submitting your Common Application early will leave you more time to schedule an audition by our deadlines above.    Note: If you are accepted as a transfer student there are two factors that determine how long it will take you to complete your degree at NYU. These factors are 1) the number of completed credits that NYU will accept and apply to your curriculum requirements and 2) the number of semesters of private voice the faculty adjudicators decide you must take in order to complete your NYU degree. Completed semesters of private voice at another institution will not necessarily count toward your degree requirements at NYU. Be aware that while the voice study requirement can be provided to you immediately upon your acceptance, it often takes longer for the University and the Program to process and apply your transfer credits.        What do I bring to my audition?    Picture and Resum&eacute; &ndash; a recent photograph along with a resum&eacute; of your educational and performing experience.    Audition Music for the Accompanist &ndash; legible copies in the key in which you will sing with all cuts clearly marked. No &ldquo;charts&rdquo; or lead sheets.    Recital Program (Graduate Applicants Only) &ndash; a copy of the program from your undergraduate voice recital (or equivalent solo recital).        What do I wear to my audition?    Professional performers are often expected to dress with a sense of &ldquo;the occasion&rdquo; and an audition is a crucial part of both your education and the professional career you are beginning to pursue. Wear clothing that makes you comfortable, but make certain that you look your best and are dressed in a manner that shows you take both yourself and the audition seriously.        What should I expect at my audition?    An accompanist : We will provide a pianist who will play the music you bring. Copies of your songs must be provided in a legible form and in the key in which you will sing them with all cuts clearly marked. We will not accept charts or lead sheets.    Note: You must audition with the accompanist, or you may bring your own accompanist if you choose. Singing a cappella or performing to pre-recorded music is not allowed!!    Questions : The auditors may decide to ask you questions about your training, your experience, and your goals. This is done in an attempt to get to know you a bit better.    Coaching &amp; Direction : Once you have performed your selections various members of the panel may ask you to make some adjustments or to repeat part of your song. This is done in order to determine how readily and receptively you work with instruction and direction.

Note for Prospective Transfer Students: Though NYU's deadline for Spring transfer admission is November 1 and our deadline for Summer/Fall transfer admission is April 1, we suggest that you submit your Common Application one month in advance. Submitting your Common Application early will leave you more time to schedule an audition by our deadlines above.    Note: If you are accepted as a transfer student there are two factors that determine how long it will take you to complete your degree at NYU. These factors are 1) the number of completed credits that NYU will accept and apply to your curriculum requirements and 2) the number of semesters of private voice the faculty adjudicators decide you must take in order to complete your NYU degree. Completed semesters of private voice at another institution will not necessarily count toward your degree requirements at NYU. Be aware that while the voice study requirement can be provided to you immediately upon your acceptance, it often takes longer for the University and the Program to process and apply your transfer credits.

Professional performers are often expected to dress with a sense of &ldquo;the occasion&rdquo; and an audition is a crucial part of both your education and the professional career you are beginning to pursue. Wear clothing that makes you comfortable, but make certain that you look your best and are dressed in a manner that shows you take both yourself and the audition seriously.        What should I expect at my audition?    An accompanist : We will provide a pianist who will play the music you bring. Copies of your songs must be provided in a legible form and in the key in which you will sing them with all cuts clearly marked. We will not accept charts or lead sheets.    Note: You must audition with the accompanist, or you may bring your own accompanist if you choose. Singing a cappella or performing to pre-recorded music is not allowed!!    Questions : The auditors may decide to ask you questions about your training, your experience, and your goals. This is done in an attempt to get to know you a bit better.    Coaching &amp; Direction : Once you have performed your selections various members of the panel may ask you to make some adjustments or to repeat part of your song.

The classes follow a seasonal theme and a curriculum that is based on sensory input. Your child will be immersed in fun activities, while learning to identify new and familiar sounds and objects. Interactions and activities include greetings, songs, nursery rhymes, movement, stories, and crafts.  In the Toddler Class (age 3-4) children interact with the language by playing games, making crafts, singing songs, and storytelling. These activities supplement our standard German kindergarten activities especially learning the concepts of same and different, size, opposites, left and right, numbers, colors and more. Seasonal topics are also incorporated into the lesson plan. The Primary Class is for children 5-6. We learn and practice German through playful activities that encourage the kids to communicate in German. The curriculum is filled with activities that encourage language and literacy development in young children, e.g. rhythmic games, playing with syllables and letters. Reading and writing is introduced through games and other supplemental learning materials. The Lower Elementary Class is for children 7-8. We focus on conversation to expand vocabulary and work on Grammar, as well as reading and writing in German. Reading and writing is introduced within the learning topic. Other supplemental learning materials are supporting the reading and writing development as well. The Elementary Class is for children ages 9-10. The focus of this course in conversation, but a strong literacy component ensures that the students not only listen, speak and play in German, but read and write, as well as work on grammar. The topics are chosen according to children's interests to provide a fun yet educational environment similar to schools in Germany. The Upper Elementary Class is for children ages 11-12. The course is for students who are already communicating well, but need to work on grammar and orthography.

The classes follow a seasonal theme and a curriculum that is based on sensory input. Your child will be immersed in fun activities, while learning to identify new and familiar sounds and objects. Interactions and activities include greetings, songs, nursery rhymes, movement, stories, and crafts.  In the Toddler Class (age 3-4) children interact with the language by playing games, making crafts, singing songs, and storytelling. These activities supplement our standard German kindergarten activities especially learning the concepts of same and different, size, opposites, left and right, numbers, colors and more. Seasonal topics are also incorporated into the lesson plan. The Primary Class is for children 5-6. We learn and practice German through playful activities that encourage the kids to communicate in German. The curriculum is filled with activities that encourage language and literacy development in young children, e.g. rhythmic games, playing with syllables and letters. Reading and writing is introduced through games and other supplemental learning materials. The Lower Elementary Class is for children 7-8. We focus on conversation to expand vocabulary and work on Grammar, as well as reading and writing in German. Reading and writing is introduced within the learning topic. Other supplemental learning materials are supporting the reading and writing development as well. The Elementary Class is for children ages 9-10. The focus of this course in conversation, but a strong literacy component ensures that the students not only listen, speak and play in German, but read and write, as well as work on grammar. The topics are chosen according to children's interests to provide a fun yet educational environment similar to schools in Germany. The Upper Elementary Class is for children ages 11-12. The course is for students who are already communicating well, but need to work on grammar and orthography.

As a prospective student, try to think of your audition as a unique opportunity for you to introduce yourself to people who are your advocates and who very much want you to be good at what you do. This \"mind set\" will serve you well in any audition situation.    Always remember to take your time and to breathe.    Your task is to share your talents - not to impress the auditors!        Professor Brian Gill with audition advice.    Undergraduate Procedures and Requirements           How do I audition for the program?           What do I prepare for my Undergraduate Audition?           What do I prepare for my Undergraduate Transfer Audition?           What do I bring to my audition?           What do I wear to my audition?           What should I expect at my audition?             How do I audition for the program?    Part I: Submit application to NYU Steinhardt. All prospective students &ndash; except those attending the November 15 Undergraduate Open House auditions &ndash; must first submit an application for admission to the Steinhardt School at New York University. You can find information on the application process through the appropriate admissions office.    Office of Undergraduate Admissions \u2028 212-998-4500    Office of Graduate Admissions \u2028 212-998-5030    Part II: Upload Pre-screening Materials: All prospective students &ndash; except those attending the November 15 Undergraduate Open House auditions &ndash; are required to submit a video pre-screening submission prior to being invited to a live audition. In this process, you will make short videos and upload them to GetAcceptd, a company created for this purpose. You may begin this process at:        All pre-screening submissions must be uploaded by the dates below. Materials submitted after these dates may not be accepted.    Early Decision I: November 1 Early Decision II: December 1 Regular Decision: December 15 Transfer Applicants: March 1    Rather than a single long video, we would like three separate clips: the introduction, the first song, and the second song. It&rsquo;s easier for us to review and easier for you to shoot. We will not be influenced by the professional quality of the video. Please do not worry about any elaborate lighting or studio conditions. Below are the requirements and suggestions for your material.       Introduction: Please say your name clearly, the city you are from, and the pieces that you are going to do. Include the Specialization for which you are auditioning (classical voice) and the degree level you would be entering (freshman, transfer).       Two songs: Your two selections should be complete and contrasting songs. Each selection should be no longer than four minutes. One of your songs must be in English and the other in a foreign language &ndash; Italian, German, or French. Piano must accompany you (no a capella singing). Please make sure your voice can be heard above the accompaniment &ndash; try different distances from the sound source until you find the right &ldquo;balance&rdquo; between piano and voice.       Upload a resum&eacute;.       Upload a headshot or photograph.    After uploading the pre-screening submission, you will immediately be notified that we have received your materials. After those materials have been reviewed, you will be sent an email inviting you to an audition in person, or an email notice that no additional audition is required. This review process can take anywhere from 2-4 weeks. If you are invited to an audition, you must prepare materials according to the guidelines below. If you cannot travel to New York you will have the option of submitting a video audition.    Invited Audition Dates for Undergraduates and Transfers Only: \u2028 Saturday, November 22, 2014 ( last day for Early Decision I candidates to audition )\u2028 Saturday, January 31, 2015\u2028 ( last day for Early Decision II candidates to audition )\u2028 Sunday, February 8, 2015 Sunday, February 22, 2015 Saturday, February 28, 2015 (last day for freshman auditions) \u2028 Saturday, April 4, 2015 ( transfer applicants only )    *The last audition date for undergraduate freshman applicants is February 28. This is also the last date for all talent awards for undergraduate applicants.        What do I prepare for my Undergraduate Audition?    Three (3) Songs : At least one of your songs must be in English and one must be in a foreign language &ndash; Italian, German, or French. Your songs must be sung from memory , and each selection should be no longer than four minutes.    Sight-Reading: Testing your ability to sight-sing music helps us determine your basic musicianship skills. You will be provided with a piece of music and will be expected to sing the melodic line. Sight-singing is a skill that singers develop through a process of ear-training. You can, and should, practice this before your audition. Music theory, music history, and keyboard performance are essential elements in any music curriculum. Study and preparation in these areas will also be a great advantage to you.        What do I prepare for my Undergraduate Transfer Audition?    Four (4) Songs : One of your four songs must be in English and each of the others in a differing foreign language &ndash; Italian, German, or French. Your songs must be sung from memory , and each selection should be no longer than four minutes.    Sight-Reading: Testing your ability to sight-sing music helps us determine your basic musicianship skills. You will be provided with a piece of music and will be expected to sing the melodic line. Sight-singing is a skill that singers develop through a process of ear-training. You can, and should, practice this before your audition. Music theory, music history, and keyboard performance are essential elements in any music curriculum. Study and preparation in these areas will also be a great advantage to you.    Note for Prospective Transfer Students: Though NYU's deadline for Spring transfer admission is November 1 and our deadline for Summer/Fall transfer admission is April 1, we suggest that you submit your Common Application one month in advance. Submitting your Common Application early will leave you more time to schedule an audition by our deadlines above.    Note: If you are accepted as a transfer student there are two factors that determine how long it will take you to complete your degree at NYU. These factors are 1) the number of completed credits that NYU will accept and apply to your curriculum requirements and 2) the number of semesters of private voice the faculty adjudicators decide you must take in order to complete your NYU degree. Completed semesters of private voice at another institution will not necessarily count toward your degree requirements at NYU. Be aware that while the voice study requirement can be provided to you immediately upon your acceptance, it often takes longer for the University and the Program to process and apply your transfer credits.        What do I bring to my audition?    Picture and Resum&eacute; &ndash; a recent photograph along with a resum&eacute; of your educational and performing experience.    Audition Music for the Accompanist &ndash; legible copies in the key in which you will sing with all cuts clearly marked. No &ldquo;charts&rdquo; or lead sheets.    Recital Program (Graduate Applicants Only) &ndash; a copy of the program from your undergraduate voice recital (or equivalent solo recital).        What do I wear to my audition?    Professional performers are often expected to dress with a sense of &ldquo;the occasion&rdquo; and an audition is a crucial part of both your education and the professional career you are beginning to pursue. Wear clothing that makes you comfortable, but make certain that you look your best and are dressed in a manner that shows you take both yourself and the audition seriously.        What should I expect at my audition?    An accompanist : We will provide a pianist who will play the music you bring. Copies of your songs must be provided in a legible form and in the key in which you will sing them with all cuts clearly marked. We will not accept charts or lead sheets.    Note: You must audition with the accompanist, or you may bring your own accompanist if you choose. Singing a cappella or performing to pre-recorded music is not allowed!!    Questions : The auditors may decide to ask you questions about your training, your experience, and your goals. This is done in an attempt to get to know you a bit better.    Coaching &amp; Direction : Once you have performed your selections various members of the panel may ask you to make some adjustments or to repeat part of your song. This is done in order to determine how readily and receptively you work with instruction and direction.

Note for Prospective Transfer Students: Though NYU's deadline for Spring transfer admission is November 1 and our deadline for Summer/Fall transfer admission is April 1, we suggest that you submit your Common Application one month in advance. Submitting your Common Application early will leave you more time to schedule an audition by our deadlines above.    Note: If you are accepted as a transfer student there are two factors that determine how long it will take you to complete your degree at NYU. These factors are 1) the number of completed credits that NYU will accept and apply to your curriculum requirements and 2) the number of semesters of private voice the faculty adjudicators decide you must take in order to complete your NYU degree. Completed semesters of private voice at another institution will not necessarily count toward your degree requirements at NYU. Be aware that while the voice study requirement can be provided to you immediately upon your acceptance, it often takes longer for the University and the Program to process and apply your transfer credits.        What do I bring to my audition?    Picture and Resum&eacute; &ndash; a recent photograph along with a resum&eacute; of your educational and performing experience.    Audition Music for the Accompanist &ndash; legible copies in the key in which you will sing with all cuts clearly marked. No &ldquo;charts&rdquo; or lead sheets.    Recital Program (Graduate Applicants Only) &ndash; a copy of the program from your undergraduate voice recital (or equivalent solo recital).        What do I wear to my audition?    Professional performers are often expected to dress with a sense of &ldquo;the occasion&rdquo; and an audition is a crucial part of both your education and the professional career you are beginning to pursue. Wear clothing that makes you comfortable, but make certain that you look your best and are dressed in a manner that shows you take both yourself and the audition seriously.        What should I expect at my audition?    An accompanist : We will provide a pianist who will play the music you bring. Copies of your songs must be provided in a legible form and in the key in which you will sing them with all cuts clearly marked. We will not accept charts or lead sheets.    Note: You must audition with the accompanist, or you may bring your own accompanist if you choose. Singing a cappella or performing to pre-recorded music is not allowed!!    Questions : The auditors may decide to ask you questions about your training, your experience, and your goals. This is done in an attempt to get to know you a bit better.    Coaching &amp; Direction : Once you have performed your selections various members of the panel may ask you to make some adjustments or to repeat part of your song. This is done in order to determine how readily and receptively you work with instruction and direction.
