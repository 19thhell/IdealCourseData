It is important to maintain an appropriate residence hall environment. To facilitate this process, every member of the residence hall community is expected to uphold certain responsibilities to ensure the growth and development of the Office of Residential Life and Housing Services\u2019 mission. These responsibilities include:     Recognizing one\u2019s membership in a residential community   Respecting all community members, including students, faculty, and staff   Participation in the maintenance of the residential facility   Informing the Office of Residential Life and Housing Services staff and/or Public Safety Officers about behavior that is disrespectful to community as well as situations that infringe on the safety of the community   Avoiding any behavior that indicates or could be perceived as retaliation for the reporting of potential violations of community standards   Supporting and honoring the diverse lifestyles and pursuits of individual members in the community   Playing an active role in the social and intellectual life of the community     A detailed description of University policies governing student conduct policies and process is available on the Residence Hall Policies page . Behavioral guidelines specifically applicable to University housing are described below and in your housing license agreement. To achieve these goals, the University reserves the right to review all alleged violations of Office of Residential Life and Housing Services Policies, and to initiate disciplinary action and impose sanctions when appropriate. If you have questions about this information, contact your Residence Hall Director (RHD) or the Office of Residential Life and Housing Services (ORLHS) at 212-998-4600.   Residents are expected to familiarize themselves with the ORLHS policies, the University Policies and Procedures in the New York University Students Guide, and to also comply with applicable city, state, and federal law.   Please be advised that information concerning student conduct is made available to the NYU Office of Global Programs, which may affect a student's eligibility to participate in a Study Away program. Please consult the Study Away Admissions Policies online for more specific information.   Campus Safety   Campus safety tips can be found on the NYU Public Safety page . Campus Safety statistics are available on the U.S. Department of Education's site , on Public Safety's Crime Reports &amp; Statistics page , or by contacting the NYU Department of Public Safety.   Alcohol Policy   Residents are required to abide by all New York State and New York University regulations regarding the use of alcohol. These rules specify that persons under 21 years of age are prohibited from possessing or consuming any alcoholic beverage. In residence halls, persons under the age of 21 are in violation of policy if found to be in the presence of alcohol.   Students who are of legal drinking age (21 years of age or older) may possess and consume alcoholic beverages (referred herein \u201calcohol\u201d) within NYU residence halls in accordance with the following:   Alcohol may be consumed only within assigned rooms or suites. Open containers of alcohol are prohibited in common spaces such as hallways and lounges, in public areas such as lobbies, or in outdoor areas adjacent to residence halls.   Alcohol or alcoholic beverage containers may not be kept in any room whose residents are under the age of 21.   Students of legal drinking age who bring alcohol into a residence hall or possess alcohol in a residence hall are responsible for its legal use. This includes taking reasonable precautions to prevent the possession of alcohol by underage students and guests.   Kegs or devices that permit storage and distribution of alcohol in bulk quantities, or that allow unregulated access to alcohol by any means, are prohibited. Devices or mechanisms that facilitate rapid consumption (funnel bongs, etc.) are also prohibited.   Participation in activities that facilitate or promote the rapid, dangerous, and/or forced consumption of alcohol (i.e. drinking games) is prohibited.   Alcohol may not be sold or distributed in the residence halls. This prohibition includes, but is not limited to: cash bars; events to which admission tickets are sold or fees are charged (e.g. entertainment charge or annual dues); fees for access to an open bar; and parties at which alcoholic beverages are served and for which contribution or donations to offset the costs of the party are sought.   University funds allocated for hall government or programming activities may not be used for the purchase of alcohol.   Residents are responsible for the behavior of their guests, including any violation of policy by their guest(s).   Students found to be excessively intoxicated in a residence hall may be subject to mandatory medical or psychological evaluation as well as appropriate student conduct action.   Illegal or Controlled Substance Policy   Marijuana   Marijuana is an illegal substance in New York State and is prohibited in the residence halls. Any student who is found to be in possession of, in the presence of or using marijuana will face disciplinary action and possible criminal charges. Water pipes, bongs, hookahs, and other paraphernalia commonly associated with drug use also are prohibited in the residence halls.   Other Controlled Substances Policy   The possession or use of narcotics and/or other controlled substances without a valid prescription, or misuse of prescribed medication, in the residence halls is prohibited. Students are expected to obey Federal and New York State Laws regarding the use, possession, sale and distribution of controlled substances.   For further information, the University\u2019s policy on Substance Abuse and Alcoholic Beverages can be accessed on the Office of Community Standards website.   Fire Safety Policy   Residents will receive residence hall specific information about fire safety and evacuation procedures at the beginning of each term from their Resident Assistant (RA) or RHD. It is extremely important that residents familiarize themselves and their guests with all applicable fire safety procedures in their assigned building. Residents who fail to comply fully with applicable fire safety procedures, such as those who fail to abide by building emergency evacuation procedures or who otherwise violate rules and regulations related to fire safety, will be subject to student conduct action. All NYU owned or leased buildings are equipped with fire alarms that are tested regularly.   In general, residents are expected to maintain adequate standards of cleanliness to avoid fire hazards, and must not obstruct sidewalks, entrances, passages, heating/air conditioning vents, fire escapes, elevators, lobbies, stairways, corridors or halls with personal property. The following items are prohibited in the residence halls and will be confiscated:     Flammable decorations   Natural or artificial evergreens   Electric heaters, air conditioners, hot plate burners   Halogen lighting equipment   Candles, incense, outdoor grills, or any other type of open flame or open coil device   Explosives, fireworks, firearms, or ammunition   Any other object found to block easy egress from a resident\u2019s room as deemed by ORLHS staff     Students found in possession of prohibited items will be subject to student conduct action and sanctioned accordingly. If you have any questions or concerns regarding fire safety, please contact your Residence Hall Director.   Outside Furniture Policy   NYU Residential Life &amp; Housing Services maintains a strict outside furniture policy to ensure fire safety and protect the cleanliness of the rooms. Additionally, outside furniture can contribute to pest problems. All rooms are furnished appropriately for its occupants with a desk, dresser, and bed.   Outside furniture is prohibited in the residence halls except for the following items:     Desk chairs that do not have any fabric or upholstery   Lamps (only non\u2010halogen bulbs)   Media stand, book case, or night stand in which the total dimensions of each piece do not exceed 80 inches. Total inches can be calculated by adding the longest width, the longest height, and the longest depth together when fully extended (such as legs or sides)     Please keep in mind the following:     Do not bring in items noted above, which are dirty or has been discarded (such as furniture left on the street). Such dirty or dilapidated items may have pests such as bedbugs and will not be allowed in the residence hall even if it meets guidelines.   No upholstered furniture or furniture that requires cushions are allowed for any reason. This includes, but is not limited to dish/butterfly chairs, couches, futons, etc. Please consult with your roommate in making any decisions to bring in outside furniture. Also, it is recommended that you wait until you have stayed in your room for several nights before deciding to bring items.   Residents are responsible to remove outside furniture from their room when they move out of the building or they will be charged for its removal. Residents will be charged for any outside furniture that causes pest problems. The Office of Residential Life and Housing Services may amend these guidelines at any time and reserves the right to require the immediate removal of any outside furniture for any reason.     Policy on Filming/Recording Devices in Residence Halls   An individual\u2019s right to privacy is important in a residence hall community setting.&amp;nbsp; The University expects students and their guests to respect the reasonable expectations of privacy of other individuals within the community.   Students and their guests are not permitted to make or attempt to make an audio or video recording of private, nonpublic conversations, informal gatherings, and/or meetings without the knowledge and consent of all participants subject to such recordings. This includes, but is not limited to, making, attempting to make, transmitting, or attempting to transmit audio or video of any person(s) in bathrooms, showers, bedrooms, common areas within suites, or other premises where there is an explicit expectation of privacy.   Furthermore, filming/recording in or into any area of a residence hall without prior permission from the Office of Residential Life and Housing Services is prohibited. The uses of undisclosed or hidden recording devices is also prohibited, as is the transmission and/or distribution of any such recordings.   Permission to film/record in or into a residence hall may be granted in certain circumstances and in certain locations. Please see a professional staff member in your residence hall for more information and/or to apply for permission.     Smoking Policy   Any form of smoking, including the use of cigarettes, cigars, pipes, hookahs, or devices such as an electronic cigarette or a vaporizer to do so, is prohibited in all areas of all University residence halls. Furthermore, smoking may not occur within close proximity to or cause the obstruction of any building entrance, covered walkway or ventilation system. Pipes, bongs, hook\u00adahs, and other such smoking devices are not permitted in the residence halls.     Sound Policy   Residents are expected to keep sound to reasonable levels and to comply with requests to reduce sound levels that are intrusive. Use of amplifiers or P.A. systems in the residence halls is prohibited. Pianos are not permitted in residence hall rooms. Musical instruments may be played only in designated practice areas. Such space may not be available in all residence halls. Contact the residence hall staff if you have any questions about these guidelines. Residents are responsible for complying with New York City ordinances that include additional restrictions on noise after 11 PM on weeknights and 1 AM on weekends. Residents must observe 24-hour quiet hours during University designated examination periods. The residence hall government with the approval of the Residence Hall Director may specify other quiet hour periods.   Turnstile Access for Current Residents of NYU Housing   Most residence halls have turnstiles located at the entry of the building near the Public Safety station. These turnstiles allow students that currently reside in NYU Housing to visit another residence hall by swiping their University ID upon entry and exit. While the turnstile provides a convenient means for allowing access, visitors are still expected to respect the time and frequency limitations as established below for all guests. Failure to respect the policy may result in restriction of a resident's turnstile access privilege.   For guests that do not reside in University Housing, and for those buildings awaiting turnstile installation, the following procedures are in place.   Residential Guest Policy   The privilege to have guests in a residence hall, room, or suite is based upon the precept of mutual respect and balance; one resident\u2019s right to have guests does not supersede another\u2019s right to reasonable privacy. In particular, it is expected that students who share a living unit will be courteous to one another, communicate, show willingness to make compromises, and act in good faith in the matter of guests. The presence of a guest in a residence hall, a room, or a suite must not compromise the personal or academic well-being of room/suitemates or other building residents.   A) TYPES OF GUESTS AND ACCESS:   Same Hall Student Guest: Guests who are New York University students and reside in the same residence hall as the person they are visiting may proceed directly to the room/suite of the resident host provided their visit to that rooms/suite is in accordance with the conditions set forth in this policy statement.   Other Hall Student Guest: Guests who are New York University students who reside in another University residence hall may be eligible to enter the residence hall of the person they are visiting by swiping/tapping in with their NYU ID card and proceeding directly to the room of that student provided their visit to that rooms/suite is in accordance with the conditions set forth in this policy statement.   Non-Hall Student Guest: Guests who are New York University students but who do not reside in a University residence hall (e.g. commuters) must present their University ID card in order to be signed in to a residence hall. The resident host must come to the lobby to sign-in their guest. At the end of a visit, the visitor may sign out themselves.   Non-NYU Guest: Guests who are not affiliated with New York University must present a valid acceptable form of photo ID in order to be signed in to a residence hall. Acceptable forms of photo ID are: a U.S. State-issued driver license, a U.S. State-issued non-driver identification, a student ID from a high school or another college or university, a passport, or another government ID; including foreign governments\u2019 IDs. If a foreign government\u2019s ID in another language is presented, a corresponding passport must be displayed for verification. Forms of identification that are not acceptable include: bank cards, telephone and credit cards. The photo ID will be held at the Public Safety Desk for the duration of the visit. (Students are expected to inform their guests in advanced that a valid photo ID will be required to enter the building.) The resident host must come to the lobby, sign-in their guest, and is urged to escort their guest at all times. Access to the hall or room/suite must be in accordance with the conditions set forth in this policy statement. At the end of a visit, that same host must accompany their guests to the lobby to sign them out in the guest register. Proof of identification will be returned at this time.   Guests Under the age of 12: Guests who are under the age of 12 may not be in a residence hall during \u201cLate Hours\u201d [i.e. between the hours of 11:00 pm and 9:00 am on weeknights (Sunday-Thursday) and 1:00 am to 9:00 am on weekends (Friday and Saturday)] and are subject to the same sign-in requirements as Non-NYU Guests.   Guest Passes: In order to make it easier for visitors to enter and leave the residence halls, especially during longer-term stays, resident hosts should obtain guest passes which are available from the hall\u2019s Resource Center. A guest pass combined with an appropriate form of ID allows a visitor to enter and exit the hall without being accompanied by their resident host. Guest Passes must be dropped off to the hall\u2019s Resource Center two business days in advance of anticipated use to allow for hall staff to process the request. The Resident Host must meet their guest in the lobby upon their initial arrival to the residence hall. Upon entering the building, guests with passes must present both the pass and appropriate ID, but need not sign-in or leave any identification with the building Public Safety Officer. No more than three guest passes will be issued at one time to a resident. A guest pass will be issued for no more than four (4) consecutive days. The issuance of Guest Passes may be suspended at certain times, such as final examination periods, winter break, spring break, or other periods as deemed necessary. Please check with your building\u2019s professional staff for specific details.   B) HOURS OF VISITATION:   Regular Hours Guests:     A Regular Hours Guest is anyone who is present in a residence hall or in a room/suite in which they have not been assigned to live between the hours of 9:00 am and 11:00 pm on weeknights (Sunday-Thursday) and 9:00 am to 1:00am on weekends (Friday and Saturday).   A resident is permitted to have up to four guests in their room/suite at any time during Regular Hours without the prior permission of their room/suitemates provided there is no interference with the rights of a roommate/suitemate.   If a resident host wishes to have more than 4 Regular Hours guests, they must have the permission of their roommate, if the guests are to remain within the bedroom , or their suitemates, if the guests are to be in a common area.   All Regular Hours Guests must have followed the appropriate access procedures as set forth above in this document.     Late Hours / Overnight Guests:     A Late Hours/Overnight guest is anyone who is present in a residence hall or in a room/suite in which they has not been assigned to live between the hours of 11:00 pm and 9 am on weeknights (Sunday-Thursday) and 1:00 am to 9:00am on weekends (Friday and Saturday).   A Resident Host must have the permission of their roommate(s) to have a Late Hours/Overnight guest.   Although permission from suitemates is not required, if there are complaints about the actions or presence of a Late Hours/Overnight Guest by a suitemate and if, in the opinion of the Residence Hall Director, the presence of Late Hours/Overnight Guest is interfering with the academic or personal well-being of the suitemates, the same conditions for permission from suitemates may be imposed upon the Resident Host by the Residence Hall Director for a designated period of time.   A Resident Host may have no more than three (3) Late Hours/Overnight guests at one time.   A Resident Host may not have a Late Hours/Overnight guest \u2013 whether the same or a different person - for more than four (4) consecutive nights or for more than six (6) nights per calendar month.   The same individual may not be a Late Hours/Overnight guest in the residence hall system for more than six (6) nights per calendar month, whether with the same or different resident hosts.   All Late Hours/Overnight guests must have followed the appropriate access procedures as set forth above in this document.     C) ENFORCEMENT   Policy Violations:   All guests in a University residence hall are expected to abide by all University and Office of Residential Life and Housing Services policies, procedures and regulations.     A Resident Host is responsible for the actions of their guest(s) in the residence hall building, room, or suite in which that host resides and will be held accountable for any violations of University/Residence Life policy and/or for any theft, injury to person or property resulting from the behavior of their guests, regardless of whether that guest is a fellow University student or not.   University students who engage in disruptive or volatile behavior while a guest in a residence hall or a room/suite will also personally be held accountable for their actions.   Matters involving the problematic behavior of a guest may be managed through administrative actions (eg. Classification of guest as Persona Non Grata), through the University student conduct process, or may be referred to local law enforcement when deemed appropriate.   Should a guest who engages in volatile behavior be a student at another college or university, New York University reserves the right to report that individual\u2019s behavior to their home institution.   Late / Overnight guests are not to sleep in hall lounges or other public spaces.     Room/Suitemate Interference:     Whenever a resident has a concern about the presence of a guest in the room, they should approach the room/suitemate whom the guest is visiting to express their concerns and to seek to resolve the issues.   Should Residential Life staff receive (1) a complaint that the presence of a guest (Regular or Late Hours) is unreasonably interfering with the academic or personal well-being of the residents of the residence hall or a particular suite/room or (2) a complaint that the students sharing a living space are unable to agree on the time, date, frequency, and duration of each other\u2019s visitors, the Residential Life staff may restrict the presence of guests in that suite/room until such time that the room/suitemates are able to come to a mutually satisfactory agreement about visitation.   As deemed appropriate, such matters will be addressed through informal discussions among room/suitemates or through formal mediation. Should such efforts fail, the Residential Life staff shall have the authority to establish reasonable parameters for visitation and all residents of that room/suite will be expected to adhere to those terms. Failure to abide by those conditions may likely result in the reassignment of the student who violates the terms set forth and may also subject that student to disciplinary action should their guests be involved in a violation of a University or Residential Life policy.   A resident may request an exception to this policy by submitting a written request to the Residence Hall Director who shall have the sole discretion to grant or deny the request based up the circumstances (e.g. situation, frequency of exceptions sought, impact on room/suitemates, etc).     There may be certain times of the year, such as semester breaks or exam periods, when these guest policies may be restricted or modified. Students will be notified in advance when any such changes occur. Any modifications or exceptions to these guest policies must be approved by the Residence Hall Director and/or the Office of Residential Life and Housing Services.     Residence Hall Violations   Important Notes     Residents will be held responsible for any policy violations by their guests.   Students found to be present while a violation is occurring may be considered participants and may also be subject to student conduct action.   Prohibited items described in this policy will be confiscated and may be discarded.     The following behavior is prohibited in all NYU residence halls:   A. Health and Safety Violations   1.

Student Behavior Off-Campus   The University should not use its powers to interfere with the rights of a student outside the university campus. At university sponsored events that may be held off campus, students are expected to adhere to all university policies. In general, a student's off-campus activities should be subject only to sanctions of the public authorities. If a student is charged with a violation of law off-campus, s/he should not be subject to university discipline for the same offense unless the conduct seriously affects her/his position as a member of the academic community. Where a student's conduct on campus constitutes violations of both university rules and public law, s/he may be subject to both university conduct process and public sanctions.   Student Behavior Online   Residential Life and Housing Services staff members who choose to participate in non-University online communities do not use the forum as a formal mechanism for monitoring inappropriate student behavior, illegal activity, or issues of student safety.   Notwithstanding the above, it is possible that a staff member may unintentionally encounter inappropriate student conduct, or such conduct may be brought to the staff member\u2019s attention by another. In general, a student\u2019s conduct in non-University affiliated online communities should not be subject to disciplinary action unless the information relates to documented incidents which occurred within University property or the conduct seriously affects the student\u2019s position as a member of the academic community.   Residential Student Conduct Process   Students who violate Residence Hall or University policies will be subject to student conduct action. The residential student conduct process typically occurs as follows:   Report or Formal Complaint   Residence hall student and professional staff document things that they observe, hear, smell or are otherwise brought to their attention through an incident reporting process. Any person may file a report or discuss a complaint with hall staff. Reports may also be made in writing and may be submitted either to the Office of Residential Life and Housing Services on the 7th floor of 726 Broadway or to any Residence Hall Director.   Investigation   Professional staff of the ORLHS and/or the Office of Community Standards review the report. After the review, staff will either close the case with no conduct action deemed necessary or conclude that a potential violation may have occurred and if a student conduct meeting is necessary.   Student Conduct Meeting   If a student conduct meeting is necessary, any one of the following may occur:     The Residence Hall Director or Residence Hall Assistant Director may adjudicate the matter or designate the case to one of his/her staff members.   Cases involving allegations of serious violations or repeat offenses may be referred to the Office of Community Standards or ORLHS Central Staff.   Cases may also be heard by a senior member of the NYU Division of Student Affairs. The appropriate hearing forum is determined by the Residence Hall Director, in consultation with an ORLHS Central staff and/or the Office of Community Standards.     The student will receive notice via email through their NYU account. Notice includes information about who will hear the case, the alleged violations, and the date, time, and location for the student conduct meeting. In addition, it is explained in the notice to meet that if a student chooses not to attend the meeting, all available information will be reviewed in the student's absence and a response will be determined. Should the student be found in violation, the possible consequences may affect the status of the student's housing license. Therefore, student attendance is important. If the student has an academic conflict that interferes with their meeting attendance, the student may reschedule the appointment. This meeting will serve as an opportunity for the student to share their perspective of the incident and engage in a conversation about community living at New York University.   During the student conduct meeting an explanation of the student conduct process will be provided. Prior to a student conduct meeting, a resident who has been charged may choose to meet with a staff member to discuss the student conduct process and/or any related issues. Appointments can be arranged by calling the Office of Residential Life and Housing Services at (212) 998-4600. Further information about the student conduct process and preparing for a hearing is also available on the Residence Hall Policies page.   During the student conduct meeting, the accused resident may present supporting evidence and/or witnesses and may be accompanied by an advisor of his/her choice. The advisor must be a currently enrolled NYU student. The advisor's role is only to provide support and advice for the accused student. The advisor may not speak on behalf of the accused student. During final exam periods, students will be offered the opportunity to respond to allegations in writing as an alternative to attending a student conduct meeting. After the student conduct meeting is complete, the accused student will be notified in writing of the outcome, including any sanctions imposed.   Sanctions   Sanctions that may be issued at the residence hall level by a Residence Hall Director or her/his designee include, but are not limited to:     Written Warning   Campus Service   Probation   Restitution to the University   Educational Project or Research   Participation in an Education Seminar   Counseling and/or Mandatory Evaluation   Room Reassignment   Restriction of Privileges   Hall Persona Non Grata   Alcohol/Drug Education   Mandatory Health Referral     IMPORTANT: Students failing to abide by the terms of a Mandatory Health Referral sanction may be subject to suspension from University Housing.   Sanctions that may be issued by the Assistant Director of Community Standards and ORLHS Central Staff or his/her designee include, but are not limited to, all of the above sanctions as well as the following:     Hall Reassignment   Campus Persona Non Grata   Emergency Temporary Suspension from Housing   Suspension from Housing*   Dismissal from Housing*   Referral to the Office of the Vice-President for Student Affairs     *The suspension or dismissal from University Housing applies to all NYU locations, including study abroad and global sites and includes a Persona Non Grata at all such locations.   Parental Notification   In an effort to provide support or assistance to students, the University (in accordance with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act - FERPA) may notify the parents or legal guardians of students who have violated university policies or federal, state, or local laws pertaining to alcohol or other drugs or in situations in which there is a health and safety emergency. The decision to notify parents or legal guardians will be made according to the professional judgment of the appropriate staff. Whenever possible, students will be consulted in the notification process. The primary goal of notifying parents or legal guardians is to promote the health and wellness of the student and others in the community.   Requesting a Review of a Student Conduct Decision   A student may appeal the outcome of a student conduct decision. A review will be considered only if there is evidence of, or reason to believe, that one or more of the following conditions exist:     A significant procedural error has occurred that affected the decision   New information, unavailable at the time of the hearing, has become available and such information could have substantially affected the decision   Sanctions issued were too severe in relation to the student's record or nature of the violation     Students wishing to appeal the outcome of a student conduct decision are encouraged to speak first with the staff member that issued the decision. If the resident wishes to have the matter reviewed by another administrator in the student conduct process, she/he must utilize the web link provided in the conduct summary letter to submit a request to the Office of Community Standards within 3 calendar days of the date of the letter in which the student was notified of the results of the student conduct process.   The Assistant Director of Community Standards, or his/her designee, may review any student conduct actions taken by any ORLHS staff. A senior staff member of the NYU Division of Student Affairs, or his/her designee, will review actions taken by the Assistant Director of Community Standards. Any sanction which involves a suspension from Housing, may be reviewed by the senior staff of ORLHS, the Associate Vice President of Student Affairs, or his/her designee.   The review may result in one of the following:     All findings and sanctions of the initial hearing will be upheld.   Findings and/or sanctions will be modified as deemed appropriate.   Additional sanctions may be enacted in light of new information discovered during the review process.     Only one review of a student conduct decision or sanction may occur. Students are not afforded multiple reviews.

Whether in one of the residence halls near Washington Square Park in Greenwich Village, in Brooklyn Heights or in a building in another vibrant New York neighborhood, students living in NYU residence halls are consumers of the city's rich culture, savvy metropolitan travelers and valued members of their New York City communities. Becoming such adept navigators of the city and NYU requires that students get to know their homes.        Moving to a new home can be a big transition, especially when you'll be sharing your space with a roommate. The information on this page will serve as a guide to navigating your move, from managing roommate relations to familiarizing yourself with on-campus housing policies to the rights and responsibilities afforded to you as residents in one of the University's residence halls. Moving to New York City and into an NYU residence hall is an exciting time, but can also be stressful. Navigate this page to learn more about your new home, what to expect and the rules, regulations, rights and responsibilities for living at NYU.

Conduct that is violative of such laws and ordinances occurring off  University premises will ordinarily not be subject to University discipline,  unless such conduct   a. seriously affects the interests of the University or the position of the member within the University community, or  b. occurs in close proximity to University premises and is connected to violative conduct on University premises.   B. All members of the University community are prohibited from engaging in  conduct leading to or resulting in any of the following:   1. Interference with or disruption of the regular operations and activities of the University.   2.

It is important to maintain an appropriate residence hall environment. To facilitate this process, every member of the residence hall community is expected to uphold certain responsibilities to ensure the growth and development of the Office of Residential Life and Housing Services\u2019 mission. These responsibilities include:     Recognizing one\u2019s membership in a residential community   Respecting all community members, including students, faculty, and staff   Participation in the maintenance of the residential facility   Informing the Office of Residential Life and Housing Services staff and/or Public Safety Officers about behavior that is disrespectful to community as well as situations that infringe on the safety of the community   Avoiding any behavior that indicates or could be perceived as retaliation for the reporting of potential violations of community standards   Supporting and honoring the diverse lifestyles and pursuits of individual members in the community   Playing an active role in the social and intellectual life of the community     A detailed description of University policies governing student conduct policies and process is available on the Residence Hall Policies page . Behavioral guidelines specifically applicable to University housing are described below and in your housing license agreement. To achieve these goals, the University reserves the right to review all alleged violations of Office of Residential Life and Housing Services Policies, and to initiate disciplinary action and impose sanctions when appropriate. If you have questions about this information, contact your Residence Hall Director (RHD) or the Office of Residential Life and Housing Services (ORLHS) at 212-998-4600.   Residents are expected to familiarize themselves with the ORLHS policies, the University Policies and Procedures in the New York University Students Guide, and to also comply with applicable city, state, and federal law.   Please be advised that information concerning student conduct is made available to the NYU Office of Global Programs, which may affect a student's eligibility to participate in a Study Away program. Please consult the Study Away Admissions Policies online for more specific information.   Campus Safety   Campus safety tips can be found on the NYU Public Safety page . Campus Safety statistics are available on the U.S. Department of Education's site , on Public Safety's Crime Reports &amp; Statistics page , or by contacting the NYU Department of Public Safety.   Alcohol Policy   Residents are required to abide by all New York State and New York University regulations regarding the use of alcohol. These rules specify that persons under 21 years of age are prohibited from possessing or consuming any alcoholic beverage. In residence halls, persons under the age of 21 are in violation of policy if found to be in the presence of alcohol.   Students who are of legal drinking age (21 years of age or older) may possess and consume alcoholic beverages (referred herein \u201calcohol\u201d) within NYU residence halls in accordance with the following:   Alcohol may be consumed only within assigned rooms or suites. Open containers of alcohol are prohibited in common spaces such as hallways and lounges, in public areas such as lobbies, or in outdoor areas adjacent to residence halls.   Alcohol or alcoholic beverage containers may not be kept in any room whose residents are under the age of 21.   Students of legal drinking age who bring alcohol into a residence hall or possess alcohol in a residence hall are responsible for its legal use. This includes taking reasonable precautions to prevent the possession of alcohol by underage students and guests.   Kegs or devices that permit storage and distribution of alcohol in bulk quantities, or that allow unregulated access to alcohol by any means, are prohibited. Devices or mechanisms that facilitate rapid consumption (funnel bongs, etc.) are also prohibited.   Participation in activities that facilitate or promote the rapid, dangerous, and/or forced consumption of alcohol (i.e. drinking games) is prohibited.   Alcohol may not be sold or distributed in the residence halls. This prohibition includes, but is not limited to: cash bars; events to which admission tickets are sold or fees are charged (e.g. entertainment charge or annual dues); fees for access to an open bar; and parties at which alcoholic beverages are served and for which contribution or donations to offset the costs of the party are sought.   University funds allocated for hall government or programming activities may not be used for the purchase of alcohol.   Residents are responsible for the behavior of their guests, including any violation of policy by their guest(s).   Students found to be excessively intoxicated in a residence hall may be subject to mandatory medical or psychological evaluation as well as appropriate student conduct action.   Illegal or Controlled Substance Policy   Marijuana   Marijuana is an illegal substance in New York State and is prohibited in the residence halls. Any student who is found to be in possession of, in the presence of or using marijuana will face disciplinary action and possible criminal charges. Water pipes, bongs, hookahs, and other paraphernalia commonly associated with drug use also are prohibited in the residence halls.   Other Controlled Substances Policy   The possession or use of narcotics and/or other controlled substances without a valid prescription, or misuse of prescribed medication, in the residence halls is prohibited. Students are expected to obey Federal and New York State Laws regarding the use, possession, sale and distribution of controlled substances.   For further information, the University\u2019s policy on Substance Abuse and Alcoholic Beverages can be accessed on the Office of Community Standards website.   Fire Safety Policy   Residents will receive residence hall specific information about fire safety and evacuation procedures at the beginning of each term from their Resident Assistant (RA) or RHD. It is extremely important that residents familiarize themselves and their guests with all applicable fire safety procedures in their assigned building. Residents who fail to comply fully with applicable fire safety procedures, such as those who fail to abide by building emergency evacuation procedures or who otherwise violate rules and regulations related to fire safety, will be subject to student conduct action. All NYU owned or leased buildings are equipped with fire alarms that are tested regularly.   In general, residents are expected to maintain adequate standards of cleanliness to avoid fire hazards, and must not obstruct sidewalks, entrances, passages, heating/air conditioning vents, fire escapes, elevators, lobbies, stairways, corridors or halls with personal property. The following items are prohibited in the residence halls and will be confiscated:     Flammable decorations   Natural or artificial evergreens   Electric heaters, air conditioners, hot plate burners   Halogen lighting equipment   Candles, incense, outdoor grills, or any other type of open flame or open coil device   Explosives, fireworks, firearms, or ammunition   Any other object found to block easy egress from a resident\u2019s room as deemed by ORLHS staff     Students found in possession of prohibited items will be subject to student conduct action and sanctioned accordingly. If you have any questions or concerns regarding fire safety, please contact your Residence Hall Director.   Outside Furniture Policy   NYU Residential Life &amp; Housing Services maintains a strict outside furniture policy to ensure fire safety and protect the cleanliness of the rooms. Additionally, outside furniture can contribute to pest problems. All rooms are furnished appropriately for its occupants with a desk, dresser, and bed.   Outside furniture is prohibited in the residence halls except for the following items:     Desk chairs that do not have any fabric or upholstery   Lamps (only non\u2010halogen bulbs)   Media stand, book case, or night stand in which the total dimensions of each piece do not exceed 80 inches. Total inches can be calculated by adding the longest width, the longest height, and the longest depth together when fully extended (such as legs or sides)     Please keep in mind the following:     Do not bring in items noted above, which are dirty or has been discarded (such as furniture left on the street). Such dirty or dilapidated items may have pests such as bedbugs and will not be allowed in the residence hall even if it meets guidelines.   No upholstered furniture or furniture that requires cushions are allowed for any reason. This includes, but is not limited to dish/butterfly chairs, couches, futons, etc. Please consult with your roommate in making any decisions to bring in outside furniture. Also, it is recommended that you wait until you have stayed in your room for several nights before deciding to bring items.   Residents are responsible to remove outside furniture from their room when they move out of the building or they will be charged for its removal. Residents will be charged for any outside furniture that causes pest problems. The Office of Residential Life and Housing Services may amend these guidelines at any time and reserves the right to require the immediate removal of any outside furniture for any reason.     Policy on Filming/Recording Devices in Residence Halls   An individual\u2019s right to privacy is important in a residence hall community setting.&amp;nbsp; The University expects students and their guests to respect the reasonable expectations of privacy of other individuals within the community.   Students and their guests are not permitted to make or attempt to make an audio or video recording of private, nonpublic conversations, informal gatherings, and/or meetings without the knowledge and consent of all participants subject to such recordings. This includes, but is not limited to, making, attempting to make, transmitting, or attempting to transmit audio or video of any person(s) in bathrooms, showers, bedrooms, common areas within suites, or other premises where there is an explicit expectation of privacy.   Furthermore, filming/recording in or into any area of a residence hall without prior permission from the Office of Residential Life and Housing Services is prohibited. The uses of undisclosed or hidden recording devices is also prohibited, as is the transmission and/or distribution of any such recordings.   Permission to film/record in or into a residence hall may be granted in certain circumstances and in certain locations. Please see a professional staff member in your residence hall for more information and/or to apply for permission.     Smoking Policy   Any form of smoking, including the use of cigarettes, cigars, pipes, hookahs, or devices such as an electronic cigarette or a vaporizer to do so, is prohibited in all areas of all University residence halls. Furthermore, smoking may not occur within close proximity to or cause the obstruction of any building entrance, covered walkway or ventilation system. Pipes, bongs, hook\u00adahs, and other such smoking devices are not permitted in the residence halls.     Sound Policy   Residents are expected to keep sound to reasonable levels and to comply with requests to reduce sound levels that are intrusive. Use of amplifiers or P.A. systems in the residence halls is prohibited. Pianos are not permitted in residence hall rooms. Musical instruments may be played only in designated practice areas. Such space may not be available in all residence halls. Contact the residence hall staff if you have any questions about these guidelines. Residents are responsible for complying with New York City ordinances that include additional restrictions on noise after 11 PM on weeknights and 1 AM on weekends. Residents must observe 24-hour quiet hours during University designated examination periods. The residence hall government with the approval of the Residence Hall Director may specify other quiet hour periods.   Turnstile Access for Current Residents of NYU Housing   Most residence halls have turnstiles located at the entry of the building near the Public Safety station. These turnstiles allow students that currently reside in NYU Housing to visit another residence hall by swiping their University ID upon entry and exit. While the turnstile provides a convenient means for allowing access, visitors are still expected to respect the time and frequency limitations as established below for all guests. Failure to respect the policy may result in restriction of a resident's turnstile access privilege.   For guests that do not reside in University Housing, and for those buildings awaiting turnstile installation, the following procedures are in place.   Residential Guest Policy   The privilege to have guests in a residence hall, room, or suite is based upon the precept of mutual respect and balance; one resident\u2019s right to have guests does not supersede another\u2019s right to reasonable privacy. In particular, it is expected that students who share a living unit will be courteous to one another, communicate, show willingness to make compromises, and act in good faith in the matter of guests. The presence of a guest in a residence hall, a room, or a suite must not compromise the personal or academic well-being of room/suitemates or other building residents.   A) TYPES OF GUESTS AND ACCESS:   Same Hall Student Guest: Guests who are New York University students and reside in the same residence hall as the person they are visiting may proceed directly to the room/suite of the resident host provided their visit to that rooms/suite is in accordance with the conditions set forth in this policy statement.   Other Hall Student Guest: Guests who are New York University students who reside in another University residence hall may be eligible to enter the residence hall of the person they are visiting by swiping/tapping in with their NYU ID card and proceeding directly to the room of that student provided their visit to that rooms/suite is in accordance with the conditions set forth in this policy statement.   Non-Hall Student Guest: Guests who are New York University students but who do not reside in a University residence hall (e.g. commuters) must present their University ID card in order to be signed in to a residence hall. The resident host must come to the lobby to sign-in their guest. At the end of a visit, the visitor may sign out themselves.   Non-NYU Guest: Guests who are not affiliated with New York University must present a valid acceptable form of photo ID in order to be signed in to a residence hall. Acceptable forms of photo ID are: a U.S. State-issued driver license, a U.S. State-issued non-driver identification, a student ID from a high school or another college or university, a passport, or another government ID; including foreign governments\u2019 IDs. If a foreign government\u2019s ID in another language is presented, a corresponding passport must be displayed for verification. Forms of identification that are not acceptable include: bank cards, telephone and credit cards. The photo ID will be held at the Public Safety Desk for the duration of the visit. (Students are expected to inform their guests in advanced that a valid photo ID will be required to enter the building.) The resident host must come to the lobby, sign-in their guest, and is urged to escort their guest at all times. Access to the hall or room/suite must be in accordance with the conditions set forth in this policy statement. At the end of a visit, that same host must accompany their guests to the lobby to sign them out in the guest register. Proof of identification will be returned at this time.   Guests Under the age of 12: Guests who are under the age of 12 may not be in a residence hall during \u201cLate Hours\u201d [i.e. between the hours of 11:00 pm and 9:00 am on weeknights (Sunday-Thursday) and 1:00 am to 9:00 am on weekends (Friday and Saturday)] and are subject to the same sign-in requirements as Non-NYU Guests.   Guest Passes: In order to make it easier for visitors to enter and leave the residence halls, especially during longer-term stays, resident hosts should obtain guest passes which are available from the hall\u2019s Resource Center. A guest pass combined with an appropriate form of ID allows a visitor to enter and exit the hall without being accompanied by their resident host. Guest Passes must be dropped off to the hall\u2019s Resource Center two business days in advance of anticipated use to allow for hall staff to process the request. The Resident Host must meet their guest in the lobby upon their initial arrival to the residence hall. Upon entering the building, guests with passes must present both the pass and appropriate ID, but need not sign-in or leave any identification with the building Public Safety Officer. No more than three guest passes will be issued at one time to a resident. A guest pass will be issued for no more than four (4) consecutive days. The issuance of Guest Passes may be suspended at certain times, such as final examination periods, winter break, spring break, or other periods as deemed necessary. Please check with your building\u2019s professional staff for specific details.   B) HOURS OF VISITATION:   Regular Hours Guests:     A Regular Hours Guest is anyone who is present in a residence hall or in a room/suite in which they have not been assigned to live between the hours of 9:00 am and 11:00 pm on weeknights (Sunday-Thursday) and 9:00 am to 1:00am on weekends (Friday and Saturday).   A resident is permitted to have up to four guests in their room/suite at any time during Regular Hours without the prior permission of their room/suitemates provided there is no interference with the rights of a roommate/suitemate.   If a resident host wishes to have more than 4 Regular Hours guests, they must have the permission of their roommate, if the guests are to remain within the bedroom , or their suitemates, if the guests are to be in a common area.   All Regular Hours Guests must have followed the appropriate access procedures as set forth above in this document.     Late Hours / Overnight Guests:     A Late Hours/Overnight guest is anyone who is present in a residence hall or in a room/suite in which they has not been assigned to live between the hours of 11:00 pm and 9 am on weeknights (Sunday-Thursday) and 1:00 am to 9:00am on weekends (Friday and Saturday).   A Resident Host must have the permission of their roommate(s) to have a Late Hours/Overnight guest.   Although permission from suitemates is not required, if there are complaints about the actions or presence of a Late Hours/Overnight Guest by a suitemate and if, in the opinion of the Residence Hall Director, the presence of Late Hours/Overnight Guest is interfering with the academic or personal well-being of the suitemates, the same conditions for permission from suitemates may be imposed upon the Resident Host by the Residence Hall Director for a designated period of time.   A Resident Host may have no more than three (3) Late Hours/Overnight guests at one time.   A Resident Host may not have a Late Hours/Overnight guest \u2013 whether the same or a different person - for more than four (4) consecutive nights or for more than six (6) nights per calendar month.   The same individual may not be a Late Hours/Overnight guest in the residence hall system for more than six (6) nights per calendar month, whether with the same or different resident hosts.   All Late Hours/Overnight guests must have followed the appropriate access procedures as set forth above in this document.     C) ENFORCEMENT   Policy Violations:   All guests in a University residence hall are expected to abide by all University and Office of Residential Life and Housing Services policies, procedures and regulations.     A Resident Host is responsible for the actions of their guest(s) in the residence hall building, room, or suite in which that host resides and will be held accountable for any violations of University/Residence Life policy and/or for any theft, injury to person or property resulting from the behavior of their guests, regardless of whether that guest is a fellow University student or not.   University students who engage in disruptive or volatile behavior while a guest in a residence hall or a room/suite will also personally be held accountable for their actions.   Matters involving the problematic behavior of a guest may be managed through administrative actions (eg. Classification of guest as Persona Non Grata), through the University student conduct process, or may be referred to local law enforcement when deemed appropriate.   Should a guest who engages in volatile behavior be a student at another college or university, New York University reserves the right to report that individual\u2019s behavior to their home institution.   Late / Overnight guests are not to sleep in hall lounges or other public spaces.     Room/Suitemate Interference:     Whenever a resident has a concern about the presence of a guest in the room, they should approach the room/suitemate whom the guest is visiting to express their concerns and to seek to resolve the issues.   Should Residential Life staff receive (1) a complaint that the presence of a guest (Regular or Late Hours) is unreasonably interfering with the academic or personal well-being of the residents of the residence hall or a particular suite/room or (2) a complaint that the students sharing a living space are unable to agree on the time, date, frequency, and duration of each other\u2019s visitors, the Residential Life staff may restrict the presence of guests in that suite/room until such time that the room/suitemates are able to come to a mutually satisfactory agreement about visitation.   As deemed appropriate, such matters will be addressed through informal discussions among room/suitemates or through formal mediation. Should such efforts fail, the Residential Life staff shall have the authority to establish reasonable parameters for visitation and all residents of that room/suite will be expected to adhere to those terms. Failure to abide by those conditions may likely result in the reassignment of the student who violates the terms set forth and may also subject that student to disciplinary action should their guests be involved in a violation of a University or Residential Life policy.   A resident may request an exception to this policy by submitting a written request to the Residence Hall Director who shall have the sole discretion to grant or deny the request based up the circumstances (e.g. situation, frequency of exceptions sought, impact on room/suitemates, etc).     There may be certain times of the year, such as semester breaks or exam periods, when these guest policies may be restricted or modified. Students will be notified in advance when any such changes occur. Any modifications or exceptions to these guest policies must be approved by the Residence Hall Director and/or the Office of Residential Life and Housing Services.     Residence Hall Violations   Important Notes     Residents will be held responsible for any policy violations by their guests.   Students found to be present while a violation is occurring may be considered participants and may also be subject to student conduct action.   Prohibited items described in this policy will be confiscated and may be discarded.     The following behavior is prohibited in all NYU residence halls:   A. Health and Safety Violations   1. Tampering with fire safety or other safety equipment, this includes, but is not limited to, tampering with or covering smoke detectors and/or carbon monoxide detectors.   2.

For further information please refer to the Policy on Theatrical Use of Simulated Firearms and other Weapons.   7. Throwing and/or causing objects, laser pointers, or any substance to be directed from, into, or onto residence hall windows, doors, terraces, ledges, roofs or other areas.

Student Behavior Off-Campus   The University should not use its powers to interfere with the rights of a student outside the university campus. At university sponsored events that may be held off campus, students are expected to adhere to all university policies. In general, a student's off-campus activities should be subject only to sanctions of the public authorities. If a student is charged with a violation of law off-campus, s/he should not be subject to university discipline for the same offense unless the conduct seriously affects her/his position as a member of the academic community. Where a student's conduct on campus constitutes violations of both university rules and public law, s/he may be subject to both university conduct process and public sanctions.   Student Behavior Online   Residential Life and Housing Services staff members who choose to participate in non-University online communities do not use the forum as a formal mechanism for monitoring inappropriate student behavior, illegal activity, or issues of student safety.   Notwithstanding the above, it is possible that a staff member may unintentionally encounter inappropriate student conduct, or such conduct may be brought to the staff member\u2019s attention by another. In general, a student\u2019s conduct in non-University affiliated online communities should not be subject to disciplinary action unless the information relates to documented incidents which occurred within University property or the conduct seriously affects the student\u2019s position as a member of the academic community.   Residential Student Conduct Process   Students who violate Residence Hall or University policies will be subject to student conduct action. The residential student conduct process typically occurs as follows:   Report or Formal Complaint   Residence hall student and professional staff document things that they observe, hear, smell or are otherwise brought to their attention through an incident reporting process. Any person may file a report or discuss a complaint with hall staff. Reports may also be made in writing and may be submitted either to the Office of Residential Life and Housing Services on the 7th floor of 726 Broadway or to any Residence Hall Director.   Investigation   Professional staff of the ORLHS and/or the Office of Community Standards review the report. After the review, staff will either close the case with no conduct action deemed necessary or conclude that a potential violation may have occurred and if a student conduct meeting is necessary.   Student Conduct Meeting   If a student conduct meeting is necessary, any one of the following may occur:     The Residence Hall Director or Residence Hall Assistant Director may adjudicate the matter or designate the case to one of his/her staff members.   Cases involving allegations of serious violations or repeat offenses may be referred to the Office of Community Standards or ORLHS Central Staff.   Cases may also be heard by a senior member of the NYU Division of Student Affairs. The appropriate hearing forum is determined by the Residence Hall Director, in consultation with an ORLHS Central staff and/or the Office of Community Standards.     The student will receive notice via email through their NYU account. Notice includes information about who will hear the case, the alleged violations, and the date, time, and location for the student conduct meeting. In addition, it is explained in the notice to meet that if a student chooses not to attend the meeting, all available information will be reviewed in the student's absence and a response will be determined. Should the student be found in violation, the possible consequences may affect the status of the student's housing license. Therefore, student attendance is important. If the student has an academic conflict that interferes with their meeting attendance, the student may reschedule the appointment. This meeting will serve as an opportunity for the student to share their perspective of the incident and engage in a conversation about community living at New York University.   During the student conduct meeting an explanation of the student conduct process will be provided. Prior to a student conduct meeting, a resident who has been charged may choose to meet with a staff member to discuss the student conduct process and/or any related issues. Appointments can be arranged by calling the Office of Residential Life and Housing Services at (212) 998-4600. Further information about the student conduct process and preparing for a hearing is also available on the Residence Hall Policies page.   During the student conduct meeting, the accused resident may present supporting evidence and/or witnesses and may be accompanied by an advisor of his/her choice. The advisor must be a currently enrolled NYU student. The advisor's role is only to provide support and advice for the accused student. The advisor may not speak on behalf of the accused student. During final exam periods, students will be offered the opportunity to respond to allegations in writing as an alternative to attending a student conduct meeting. After the student conduct meeting is complete, the accused student will be notified in writing of the outcome, including any sanctions imposed.   Sanctions   Sanctions that may be issued at the residence hall level by a Residence Hall Director or her/his designee include, but are not limited to:     Written Warning   Campus Service   Probation   Restitution to the University   Educational Project or Research   Participation in an Education Seminar   Counseling and/or Mandatory Evaluation   Room Reassignment   Restriction of Privileges   Hall Persona Non Grata   Alcohol/Drug Education   Mandatory Health Referral     IMPORTANT: Students failing to abide by the terms of a Mandatory Health Referral sanction may be subject to suspension from University Housing.   Sanctions that may be issued by the Assistant Director of Community Standards and ORLHS Central Staff or his/her designee include, but are not limited to, all of the above sanctions as well as the following:     Hall Reassignment   Campus Persona Non Grata   Emergency Temporary Suspension from Housing   Suspension from Housing*   Dismissal from Housing*   Referral to the Office of the Vice-President for Student Affairs     *The suspension or dismissal from University Housing applies to all NYU locations, including study abroad and global sites and includes a Persona Non Grata at all such locations.   Parental Notification   In an effort to provide support or assistance to students, the University (in accordance with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act - FERPA) may notify the parents or legal guardians of students who have violated university policies or federal, state, or local laws pertaining to alcohol or other drugs or in situations in which there is a health and safety emergency. The decision to notify parents or legal guardians will be made according to the professional judgment of the appropriate staff. Whenever possible, students will be consulted in the notification process. The primary goal of notifying parents or legal guardians is to promote the health and wellness of the student and others in the community.   Requesting a Review of a Student Conduct Decision   A student may appeal the outcome of a student conduct decision. A review will be considered only if there is evidence of, or reason to believe, that one or more of the following conditions exist:     A significant procedural error has occurred that affected the decision   New information, unavailable at the time of the hearing, has become available and such information could have substantially affected the decision   Sanctions issued were too severe in relation to the student's record or nature of the violation     Students wishing to appeal the outcome of a student conduct decision are encouraged to speak first with the staff member that issued the decision. If the resident wishes to have the matter reviewed by another administrator in the student conduct process, she/he must utilize the web link provided in the conduct summary letter to submit a request to the Office of Community Standards within 3 calendar days of the date of the letter in which the student was notified of the results of the student conduct process.   The Assistant Director of Community Standards, or his/her designee, may review any student conduct actions taken by any ORLHS staff. A senior staff member of the NYU Division of Student Affairs, or his/her designee, will review actions taken by the Assistant Director of Community Standards. Any sanction which involves a suspension from Housing, may be reviewed by the senior staff of ORLHS, the Associate Vice President of Student Affairs, or his/her designee.   The review may result in one of the following:     All findings and sanctions of the initial hearing will be upheld.   Findings and/or sanctions will be modified as deemed appropriate.   Additional sanctions may be enacted in light of new information discovered during the review process.     Only one review of a student conduct decision or sanction may occur. Students are not afforded multiple reviews.

Whether in one of the residence halls near Washington Square Park in Greenwich Village, in Brooklyn Heights or in a building in another vibrant New York neighborhood, students living in NYU residence halls are consumers of the city's rich culture, savvy metropolitan travelers and valued members of their New York City communities. Becoming such adept navigators of the city and NYU requires that students get to know their homes.        Moving to a new home can be a big transition, especially when you'll be sharing your space with a roommate. The information on this page will serve as a guide to navigating your move, from managing roommate relations to familiarizing yourself with on-campus housing policies to the rights and responsibilities afforded to you as residents in one of the University's residence halls. Moving to New York City and into an NYU residence hall is an exciting time, but can also be stressful. Navigate this page to learn more about your new home, what to expect and the rules, regulations, rights and responsibilities for living at NYU.
