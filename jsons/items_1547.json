In New York University\u2019s master of arts program in Irish and Irish-American Studies, he teaches the \u201cHistory I: Elizabethan Ireland to the Act of Union,\u201d \u201cIreland in the Atlantic World\u201d seminars, and other courses dealing with early-modern Irish and Irish-American history.      \u201cThere is nothing more creative than teaching and writing history,\u201d Professor Truxes recently told an interviewer. \u201cMost people don\u2019t realize that it is historians who construct our understanding of the past, an understanding based on their interpretation of evidence. By themselves, historical facts are merely random, unsorted masses of information. Making sense of them is a creative act, much like what a detective does. In Ireland, until recently, people lost their lives over conflicting interpretations of events that took place in the sixteenth, seventeenth, and eighteenth centuries. Getting the story of early-modern Ireland right is a serious matter and a grave responsibility for the historian. It\u2019s also very exciting.\u201d      Professor Truxes earned a doctorate in modern history at Trinity College, Dublin. He is the author of Irish American Trade, 1660-1783 (Cambridge University Press, 1988) and Letterbook of Greg &amp; Cunningham, 1756-57: Merchants of New York and Belfast (Oxford University Press, 2001), the correspondence of the most successful Irish-American trading firm of the colonial period. His most recent book, Defying Empire: Trading with the Enemy in Colonial New York (Yale University Press, 2008) was a finalist for the 2009 Francis Parkman Prize presented by the Society of American Historians and was named \u201cBest Book of 2008\u201d by the American Revolution Round Table of New York.
