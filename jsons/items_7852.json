When you select a brain mechanism to study, what do you expect to 'understand' and how would you know that you have understood it? 'Understanding' as a cognitive accomplishment is intuitively understood but its meaning in science is debated. With the impressive advances in the armamentarium of neuroscience, the increasing pace of discovery at multiple levels of description, and the integration of such findings into models, discussion of what 'understanding' means in brain research becomes even more timely. This course will address 'understanding' from the point of view of practicing neuroscientists but also drawing on concepts and observations from a multitude of disciplines, including philosophy, history of science, and cognition. The course will combine frontal lectures and discussions, including guest presentations by members of the NYU faculty on what they consider as 'understanding' in their own research program.

When you select a brain mechanism to study, what do you expect to 'understand' and how would you know that you have understood it? 'Understanding' as a cognitive accomplishment is intuitively understood but its meaning in science is debated. With the impressive advances in the armamentarium of neuroscience, the increasing pace of discovery at multiple levels of description, and the integration of such findings into models, discussion of what 'understanding' means in brain research becomes even more timely. This course will address 'understanding' from the point of view of practicing neuroscientists but also drawing on concepts and observations from a multitude of disciplines, including philosophy, history of science, and cognition. The course will combine frontal lectures and discussions, including guest presentations by members of the NYU faculty on what they consider as 'understanding' in their own research program.

The Meaning of 'Understanding' in Brain Research  NEURL-GA 3042.007   Prerequisites: Open to doctoral candidates in fields relevant to neural science.  Dudai  Spring  3 points.    When you select a brain mechanism to study, what do you expect to 'understand' and how would you know that you have understood it? 'Understanding' as a cognitive accomplishment is intuitively understood but its meaning in science is debated. With the impressive advances in the armamentarium of neuroscience, the increasing pace of discovery at multiple levels of description, and the integration of such findings into models, discussion of what 'understanding' means in brain research becomes even more timely. This course will address 'understanding' from the point of view of practicing neuroscientists but also drawing on concepts and observations from a multitude of disciplines, including philosophy, history of science, and cognition. The course will combine frontal lectures and discussions, including guest presentations by members of the NYU faculty on what they consider as 'understanding' in their own research program.
