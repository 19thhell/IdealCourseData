Learning to identify and attend to these ubiquitous weaknesses in concept, narrative and prose can lift a manuscript from the \u201cno\u201d pile to enthusiastic acceptance and, later, from lackluster publication to strong word of mouth and review attention. This class will focus on two kinds of editing that can address those frequent, genre-crossing manuscript problems: the bold\u2014identifying and troubleshooting the bigger conceptual and structural problems, including the young writer\u2019s frequent habit of not being bold at all; and the basics\u2014sweating the small stuff by learning and using the tricks of an editor\u2019s trade. Readings will include works by writers such as Jennifer Egan, Jeffrey Eugenides, Mary Karr, Laura Hillenbrand and others (models of successful basics and boldness), and student writings. Students will be expected to: 1) bring in one story, chapter of a novel, piece of memoir or narrative nonfiction that they have written, 2) edit (including a line edit and an editorial letter) and 3) revise their own piece of writing in response to editorial feedback from the class.

But they also privilege thorough research, live reporting and a writer\u2019s quizzical, intelligent stance. In this course, students will not only learn the components of a good story, but what makes an idea compelling to a diverse audience to begin with. Students will choose their own topics, but we\u2019ll all write and revise one profile and one long investigative-style piece of researched and reported literary nonfiction. We will workshop these longer stories in sections, and students will learn effective editing strategies for their own writing by working closely with their peers. We\u2019ll read masters of the genre like Joseph Mitchell, Katherine Boo, and Alex Kotlowitz as well as some newer or more experimental voices like Pumla Gobodo\u2013Madikizela and Lauren Slater. We\u2019ll also look at broader ethical questions like going undercover, cloaking source identities, and writing outside of one\u2019s own experience.

Learning to identify and attend to these ubiquitous weaknesses in concept, narrative and prose can lift a manuscript from the \u201cno\u201d pile to enthusiastic acceptance and, later, from lackluster publication to strong word of mouth and review attention. This class will focus on two kinds of editing that can address those frequent, genre-crossing manuscript problems: the bold\u2014identifying and troubleshooting the bigger conceptual and structural problems, including the young writer\u2019s frequent habit of not being bold at all; and the basics\u2014sweating the small stuff by learning and using the tricks of an editor\u2019s trade. Readings will include works by writers such as Jennifer Egan, Jeffrey Eugenides, Mary Karr, Laura Hillenbrand and others (models of successful basics and boldness), and student writings. Students will be expected to: 1) bring in one story, chapter of a novel, piece of memoir or narrative nonfiction that they have written, 2) edit (including a line edit and an editorial letter) and 3) revise their own piece of writing in response to editorial feedback from the class.
