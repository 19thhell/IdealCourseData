They are designed to support high academic standards in awarding tenure and promotion, and to insure a comprehensive, rigorous, and fair review of the candidates. The successful implementation of the guidelines to achieve and maintain high academic standards depends on the leadership of the deans, the provost and the president working in conjunction with the tenured faculty.   UNIVERSITY APPROVAL, SCHOOL GUIDELINES   Each school at New York University must establish its own detailed guidelines for   promotion and tenure, consistent with its own culture. These school guidelines must   conform to each of the University-wide general guidelines described in this document.   These school guidelines must contain a detailed, comprehensive, and fair set of   procedures which will enable the school to perform rigorous and effective reviews of   candidates for tenure and/or promotion. These school guidelines must appear in a   document that is readily available in print, in electronic media and on the web, to all   members of the school.   These school guidelines, and any subsequent changes to them, must be presented to   the Provost of New York University for approval, and the Provost should consult with the FSC prior to making the final decision about such changes. A sample template of guidelines will be made available to each school \u2013 guidelines which will be sufficient and, should the school elect to use them, be automatically approved.   STANDARDS   A high standard of excellence and effectiveness in teaching in the context of a research university is a prerequisite for tenure at NYU, as is the promise of effective contributions toward the work of the individual's department or school and the intellectual life of the University. Once these prerequisites are met, outstanding scholarship or creative work in the arts is the requirement for tenure. Thus, in order to have a reasonable prospect of gaining tenure at NYU, a candidate must have a record of outstanding achievement and recognition in scholarly research or creative work in the arts together with a record of effective teaching integrally influenced by scholarship or creative work. In the absence of such a record, tenure will not be granted.   The process of evaluating a candidate for tenure is an inquiry: Is the candidate for tenure among the strongest in his or her field, in comparison with other individuals in the same field at similar points in their careers, taking into consideration the goals of the department?   Standards and Process for Promotion to Full Professor   The inquiry for promotion to full professor is essentially the same as for a tenure candidate: is the candidate for promotion among the strongest in her/his field, in comparison with individuals at similar points in their careers? In addition, the candidate must have achieved a significant milestone or marker beyond the work considered at the point of awarding tenure. The normal expectation will be that the new work mark significant new scholarly research or artistic achievement since the conferring of tenure. The docket must clearly indicate which work distinguishes the candidate\u2019s achievements since the last review for promotion.   It is neither desirable nor possible to define an abstract and universal standard of measurement for tenure and promotion. Each case must be examined in detail by making explicit comparisons, by delineating special strengths, and by acknowledging limits or weaknesses. Context may be a criterion in judging the strength of a particular candidate. All these factors must be carefully discussed and weighed in reaching a recommendation on tenure or promotion.

They are designed to support high academic standards in awarding tenure and promotion, and to insure a comprehensive, rigorous, and fair review of the candidates. The successful implementation of the guidelines to achieve and maintain high academic standards depends on the leadership of the deans, the provost and the president working in conjunction with the tenured faculty.   UNIVERSITY APPROVAL, SCHOOL GUIDELINES   Each school at New York University must establish its own detailed guidelines for   promotion and tenure, consistent with its own culture. These school guidelines must   conform to each of the University-wide general guidelines described in this document.   These school guidelines must contain a detailed, comprehensive, and fair set of   procedures which will enable the school to perform rigorous and effective reviews of   candidates for tenure and/or promotion. These school guidelines must appear in a   document that is readily available in print, in electronic media and on the web, to all   members of the school.   These school guidelines, and any subsequent changes to them, must be presented to   the Provost of New York University for approval, and the Provost should consult with the FSC prior to making the final decision about such changes. A sample template of guidelines will be made available to each school \u2013 guidelines which will be sufficient and, should the school elect to use them, be automatically approved.   STANDARDS   A high standard of excellence and effectiveness in teaching in the context of a research university is a prerequisite for tenure at NYU, as is the promise of effective contributions toward the work of the individual's department or school and the intellectual life of the University. Once these prerequisites are met, outstanding scholarship or creative work in the arts is the requirement for tenure. Thus, in order to have a reasonable prospect of gaining tenure at NYU, a candidate must have a record of outstanding achievement and recognition in scholarly research or creative work in the arts together with a record of effective teaching integrally influenced by scholarship or creative work. In the absence of such a record, tenure will not be granted.   The process of evaluating a candidate for tenure is an inquiry: Is the candidate for tenure among the strongest in his or her field, in comparison with other individuals in the same field at similar points in their careers, taking into consideration the goals of the department?   Standards and Process for Promotion to Full Professor   The inquiry for promotion to full professor is essentially the same as for a tenure candidate: is the candidate for promotion among the strongest in her/his field, in comparison with individuals at similar points in their careers? In addition, the candidate must have achieved a significant milestone or marker beyond the work considered at the point of awarding tenure. The normal expectation will be that the new work mark significant new scholarly research or artistic achievement since the conferring of tenure. The docket must clearly indicate which work distinguishes the candidate\u2019s achievements since the last review for promotion.   It is neither desirable nor possible to define an abstract and universal standard of measurement for tenure and promotion. Each case must be examined in detail by making explicit comparisons, by delineating special strengths, and by acknowledging limits or weaknesses. Context may be a criterion in judging the strength of a particular candidate. All these factors must be carefully discussed and weighed in reaching a recommendation on tenure or promotion.

Successful   candidates must provide a clear and objective demonstration that their   accomplishments merit tenure and promotion.       The Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Science makes recommendations to the   Provost of the University regarding promotions and the conferring of   tenure. The recommendation of the Dean is expected to be informed by the   faculty at large, the department, and experts in the candidate's field. In   the Faculty of Arts and Science, tradition and faculty-approved policy hold   that this occurs through a multilevel process involving detailed evaluation   within the department, review by the FAS Promotion and Tenure Committee   consisting of elected and appointed members from the three divisions of   FAS, independent external evaluations at both the department and FAS   Promotion and Tenure Committee levels, and such other information as deemed   appropriate by the Dean.       While there is often a remarkable degree of unanimity in the   recommendations made at the various levels of review, it is not unusual for   there to be divergent opinions.       Disagreement may occur because of differences in perspective,   differences in the weighing of strengths and weaknesses in the case,   additional information not evident in preceding stages of the evaluation,   and so on. In case of seriously divergent recommendations, the Dean may   choose to extend the process and seek additional information, but has no   obligation to do so.       2.2 STANDARDS       2.2.1 Conferring Tenure       The process of evaluating a candidate for tenure in the Faculty of Arts   and Science is an inquiry: Is the candidate for tenure among the strongest   in his or her field, in comparison with individuals at similar points in   their careers at NYU, nationally, and, if relevant, abroad.       It is neither desirable nor possible to define an abstract and universal   standard of measurement, and context may well become a criterion in judging   the strength of a particular candidate. The current and future shape of   programs in a department and beyond it, in FAS more generally, may be   relevant considerations. Each case must be examined in some detail by   making explicit comparisons, by delineating special strengths and   acknowledging limits or weaknesses. These factors must be carefully and   openly weighed.       2.2.2 Promotion to Full Professor       The inquiry for such cases is essentially the same as for a tenure   candidate: Is the candidate for promotion among the strongest in her/his   field, in comparison with individuals at similar points in their careers at   NYU, nationally, and internationally. In addition, we require that the   candidate provide evidence of significant academic achievement beyond the   work considered at the point of awarding tenure. The normal expectation   will be the publication of a major book or a set of articles that mark   significant new research and professional advancement since the conferring   of tenure. The docket must clearly indicate which materials distinguish the   candidate\u2019s achievements since the last review for promotion.       Department Chairs must consult with the appropriate Divisional Dean   before bringing a candidate up for promotion to full professor. When a   Department Chair is a candidate for promotion, the Divisional Dean, after   consultation with the chair, will designate a senior scholar in the   department (or outside of the department if none is available within) to   lead the review process.  2.2.3 Expectations of   Candidate       In order to have a reasonable prospect of gaining tenure at NYU,   candidates must have records of outstanding scholarly achievement and   recognition for it within their fields; they must be able to demonstrate   that they are effective teachers; and they should have contributed, beyond   their research and teaching, to the work of their departments and the life   of the University. In the absence of such a record, tenure will not be   awarded.       2.2.4 Acceleration of Schedule       Proposals for early promotion and tenure must be considered   extraordinary actions. Indeed, it is not normally in the best interest of a   candidate or of the institution to propose candidates for promotion and/or   tenure ahead of schedule unless the case is very well justified. The   Divisional Dean should be consulted prior to the preparation of an early   case. The best reason for proposing early consideration is a record of   extraordinary accomplishment that can be readily distinguished from strong   cases. It should be noted that external experts whose evaluation of the   candidate are sought in these cases should be asked to comment specifically   on the special grounds for an early decision. Chairs and departmental   committees must also specifically address this issue in the Chair's   recommendation and in the Report of the Departmental Committee   respectively. However, even with these affirmative recommendations, the   Dean will not recommend early tenure unless the case is extraordinary and   compelling, particularly in relation to the already high expectations for   candidates reviewed under the usual schedule.       2.3 GUIDELINES &amp; PROCEDURES       2.3.1 Department       Departmental Responsibilities:    1. The duty of the tenured faculty to give advice on tenure decisions is   perhaps their highest responsibility. The process begins with their review,   and it is highly dependent upon their thoroughness, fairness, and rigor. To   give weak advice to the Dean on the assumption that the difficult decisions   will be made at a later stage subverts the principle of peer review and   faculty governance, and is an abnegation of departmental responsibility.   Reports that are considered by the Dean or Promotion and Tenure Committee   to fall into this category will be returned to the department with a   request that the problem be corrected.       2. Reasonable doubt precludes a favorable recommendation. Common   indicators of reasonable doubt include a highly split vote, or a   Departmental Promotion and Tenure Committee Report that fails to achieve   consensus. If a reasonable doubt exists, the department should indicate as   much to the Dean and the FAS Advisory Committee on Promotion and   Tenure.       3. The Dean has de jure authority to recommend tenure decisions   contrary to faculty advice, although that power is usually used sparingly,   and in a properly functioning tenure process it may never be used.       Mandatory Review:       4. A recommendation and docket must be submitted in all mandatory review   cases, whether positive or negative. If, however, the candidate resigns by   November 12, 2014, effective August 31, 2016, the department need not make   a submission. In this instance, the chair must forward a letter by November   12, 2014, stating explicitly that the resignation was freely tendered   without duress.       Departmental Guidelines &amp; Procedures:       5. Each department has its own traditions and established practices for   making personnel and other decisions. Such practices may be followed in   promotion/tenure reviews providing they conform to the guidelines below. If   not, the procedures must be adapted to these guidelines. If there are   questions of interpretation, the department chair should consult in advance   with the Dean of the Faculty or the appropriate Divisional Dean.       Departmental Votes: Eligibility of Members       6. The whole tenured faculty of a department is authorized to vote and   collectively to make a recommendation for or against tenure at the rank of   associate professor. For appointments at the rank of full professor with   tenure or for promotions to full professor, the vote and authority resides   with the full professors in the department. Note: the formal vote of the   eligible faculty must be a secret vote.       7. Chairs of departments with fewer than five tenured full professors   (for a candidate being considered for promotion to full professor) or with   fewer than five tenured full and associate professors (for a candidate   being considered for tenure or promotion to associate professor) should   consult with their Divisional Dean about drawing upon tenured faculty of   appropriate rank from other departments to form an ad hoc committee   consisting of five or more members.       8. A reasonable effort must be made to enable eligible faculty on leave   to receive all relevant materials and to participate in the discussions and   vote. When faculty members are unable to attend the meeting because of a   leave or other absence, he or she shall be invited to make their views   known to the other eligible members through written or electronic   communication, but their votes must be recorded separately to distinguish   them from those made with the benefit of the open discussion of the   case.       Departmental Review: Promotion and Tenure   Committee:       9. The eligible voting members of the department, and such others   involved in departmental votes as noted in 2.3.7 above, must be presented   with a detailed, formal, written review of the candidate. The Department   Chair may serve on the Promotion and Tenure Committee, but not as the chair   of the committee.       10. This review may be conducted by all those eligible to vote, acting   as a committee-of-the-whole. Alternatively, in large departments it is   usual for the department to establish a Promotion and Tenure Committee to   carry out the review. This committee may be appointed by the department   chair, or it may be elected, following traditional practice in the   department. Departments may establish ad hoc committees for each promotion   and tenure case, or they may establish a single committee each year to   review all cases. In either case, the committee should consist of three to   five members who are eligible to vote, as described above. The committee   should not include scholars with whom the candidate has been closely   associated, such as a thesis advisor, co-author, or other close associate;   such individuals are, however, eligible to participate in the full   departmental discussion and vote on the committee report. Spouses and   partners of the candidate must recluse themselves from the entire promotion   and tenure process.       11. It is the responsibility of the Promotion and Tenure Committee to   assemble the relevant review materials (see below), to review these   materials in detail, and to prepare a written report for presentation to   the eligible faculty. The file and the written report should be made   available for inspection well in advance of the meeting of eligible faculty   at which the case will be discussed and the vote taken.       Cross Appointments:       12. In the case of a Joint Appointment, the composition of the Promotion   and Tenure Committee must include members of both units. Both units must   vote on the Report, with the Guidelines herein outlined concerning   procedures and reporting applying to both. Each Chair and/or director   should forward his or her unit's recommendation to the Dean only after   consultation with the other unit. If the departments or programs arrive at   significantly different judgments, the Dean will ordinarily invite them   together to discuss the case.       13. When the candidate has an Associated Appointment in a secondary   department or program, the departmental review must include a written   evaluation from the secondary department explaining, among other matters   thought relevant, the particular contribution of the candidate to that   program's teaching and research mission and to its administration. This   evaluation may be written by the Chair or director of the secondary unit   after formal consultation with departmental or program members.       14. In the case of Affiliated Appointments such written evaluations on   the secondary appointment are recommended but not required.       Materials for the Departmental Promotion and Tenure   Committee       15. The Departmental Promotion and Tenure Committee must prepare a   Promotion and Tenure file for examination by eligible departmental voters.   It should include the c.v. of the candidate; statement of teaching and   research interests by the candidate (mandatory for tenure cases, but   optional for promotion cases only); copies of publications and other   writings; letters from external evaluators; and the evaluation by the   Promotion and Tenure Committee. The docket should include published   academic book reviews of the candidate's work. In the case of books not yet   reviewed by the press, publisher's reader reviews should be included in the   docket. Citation analysis, if relevant, may also be included.       The candidates' statement of teaching and research interests should   narrate the trajectory of his/her career, and should include a description   of the relationship among works already published or distributed, a   description of new projects planned or under way, and should address the   role teaching (including particular courses) occupies in his/her   career.       16. The file prepared by the Promotion and Tenure Committee must include   a copy of the candidate's Third Year Review and the letter from the Dean   acknowledging the report; and separate Assessments of Teaching Performance,   Research and Scholarship, and Service.       17. The evaluation by the Promotion and Tenure Committee should not be   an advocacy document; it should strive to provide a fair assessment of the   strengths and weaknesses of the candidate. It should indicate, with   reasons, the basis for the departmental recommendation.       18. The Assessment of Teaching Performance must document and appraise   the effectiveness of the candidate's teaching. The documentation should   include Course Listing Form (a list of all courses taught and their enrollments over the past four years (graduate   courses, major courses; departmental service courses, college service   courses, etc.)), student evaluations (for the guide to undergraduate course   evaluations, see the CAS Course Evaluation   Guide ), as well as relevant additional information, course syllabi; first hand evaluations of class sessions by   a tenured colleague; and a description of the department standard for   quantity (course load) of tenure track faculty.       The appraisal of teaching effectiveness should include an analysis of   the candidate's teaching strengths and any weaknesses. In the case of   latter, some indication should be given of how the department and candidate   are addressing these weaknesses. The appraisal should address both   undergraduate and graduate teaching and should include not just an   assessment of teaching performance in specific courses but also an   evaluation of the overall significance of the candidate's contributions to   the undergraduate and graduate teaching programs of the department.   Specific mention should be made of research mentorship. The appraisal   should be provided in narrative form; raw data, such as copies of an entire   class's student evaluations, which is not accompanied with any analysis or   explanation, is not acceptable to the P &amp; T Committee.       The above instructions apply to external candidates as well as internal   candidates. External candidates are expected to submit teaching evaluations   from their current institutions and should be encouraged to address   teaching in their personal statements. If evaluations are not available,   alternative documentation of likely teaching effectiveness must be provided   by the chair of the candidate. In addition, the docket must include a   description of what the candidate's graduate and undergraduate teaching   contributions are expected to be and the significance of these   contributions for the department.       19. The Assessment of Research and Scholarship must address issues of   quality, significance, coherence, and future development. The candidate's   written work, published and unpublished, should be carefully read by at   least three senior members of the department, who must jointly sign this   portion of the Report. The quality and significance of the venues in which   the candidate's work has appeared (e.g. journals, conference papers,   websites, blogs, etc.) should be appraised. If they are not the best venues   in the field, the best should be named and the absence of publications in   them explained. The quality of the publisher of the candidate's book(s)   should be appraised as well.       In the case of joint authorship, the report should include information   about the norms of the field regarding order of authorship and an   assessment of the candidate's contributions to the co-authored work. The   report should indicate what parts of the candidate\u2019s work are based on the   dissertation, and for such work, what advances have been made upon the work   of the dissertation. The candidate's success at securing grants should be   evaluated in relation to reasonable expectations for scholars in the same   field and at the same stage of professional development. The assessment   should list and appraise the relative competitiveness of grants and   fellowships received in the past five years.       20. The Assessment of Service must indicate the quality and significance   of service to the department and the university. Specific comments,   including testimony from fellow committee members, specification of   authorship of particular reports and the like are helpful. The Assessment   of Service can include a discussion of participation in professional   organizations in the candidate's field.       21. List of all Ph.D. dissertations and Masters for which the candidate   has been the primary advisor; a list of other dissertation and theses   committees on which the candidate has served. Provide a comparison   with the average number of dissertations supervised and/or committees   served on per faculty member within the department.       22. The report must explain the importance of the candidate's field of   expertise. In what ways does the strength the candidate offers in that   field advance the department's current ambitions? How does the candidate's   field supplement other strengths in the department, and vice versa? How   does the candidate's field and performance affect the standing of the   department?       23. In the case of new appointments to tenure, it is helpful for the   report to include the justification for establishing a tenured position   within the department in the candidate's field of expertise. The report   must also include a summary of the recommendations of the Search Committee   and must identify the external referees consulted by the department in the   search process, indicating which were selected by the candidate and which   were selected by the department. A letter from a suitable evaluator   selected by the search committee, which answers all the relevant questions   of the tenure review process, may be used as one of the department\u2019s five   required outside letters for the Promotion and Tenure docket. The report   may also include letters from other search committee referees as   supplemental materials to the docket.       24. The candidate's position in the field and the discipline as a whole   should be described as precisely as possible. This appraisal should include   comparisons with other scholars both within the department and in the   discipline at large. The department may submit additional material that it   considers informative and useful for the assessment of the case, under a   section of the docket titled \"Supplementary Materials.\"       Solicitation of Letters from Outside Evaluators:       25. A complete departmental docket must include a minimum of five   letters from outside evaluators. The letter of solicitation, which should   come from the Chair of the Department, must follow the prototype attached   as Section 2.7. The letter must explicitly request comparative rankings   with the candidate's peers, and it must not in any way imply that a   positive or negative response from the evaluator is desired. Before   departments solicit letters from outside evaluators, the Chair of the   department must send a draft of the letter for review and approval to the   appropriate Divisional Dean. All outside letters of evaluation must be   current (written within one year of the FAS Promotion and Tenure   review).       26. All evaluators should be provided with the same published work, c.v.   of the candidate, and statement of teaching and research interests. If   there is unpublished work to be considered, the department should ask all   evaluators to comment on the quality of the unpublished work.       27. The confidentiality of letters from outside evaluators must be   preserved; only eligible voters in the department should be allowed access   to the letters. Neither the writers nor the content of the letters must be   communicated to the candidate or anyone else beyond eligible members of the   department, not even in summary form. In all communications with them,   writers of letters should be assured that their letters will be held in   such confidence and that they will be seen only by tenured members of the   department, the Dean of the Faculty, the Divisional Dean, the Faculty of   Arts and Science Advisory Committee on Promotion and Tenure, and the   Provost's Office.       Criteria for Selecting Outside Evaluators:       28. Evaluators will normally hold a tenured position (as a full   professor in the instance of cases of promotion to full professor) in an   institution of recognized distinction as a research university, or a   position of equivalent rank in a non-academic institution (e.g.,   laboratory, museum, or research institute).       29. Evaluators should be recognized leaders in the candidate's   discipline. Evaluators should be representative of their subject, broadly   defined, and not drawn exclusively from extremely narrow interest groups or   specializations. At least one of the five evaluators must be a scholar   identified with broader sectors of the discipline in question. The list of   evaluators need not be restricted to those at United States institutions;   if appropriate, evaluations should be solicited from abroad.       30. Evaluators cannot be suggested by the candidate, nor can the   suitability of potential evaluators be discussed with the candidate. The   evaluator must not be a scholar with whom the candidate has been closely   associated, such as a thesis advisor, co-author (*1) , or other   close associate. Individuals listed on the candidate's c.v. as personal or   professional references, are not eligible to serve as outside evaluators.   If the department should inadvertently solicit an opinion from someone it   later learns was close to the candidate or whom the candidate independently   suggested, note of that fact must be made in the departmental report.    1* Co-authors will be acceptable reviewers only in certain fields, such as   fields with very small membership or fields in which papers typically have   a large number of authors (i.e. multicenter clinical trials; large   epidemiology studies, etc.), and then only acceptable with permission of   the Dean.       31. The candidate may identify one or two scholars who he/she believes   would not \u2013 for professional or personal reasons \u2013 provide a balanced   evaluation. The candidate must state in writing the reasons for this   belief. The department and Dean are not required to accept the candidate's   request to exclude a scholar as an evaluator.       32. As a professional courtesy, evaluators should be given six weeks to   send their evaluations.       33. The Report of the Committee must include a list of all potential   evaluators who were asked to write on behalf of the candidate, including   those who declined, and those, if any, identified by the candidate as   inappropriate. All departmental communications with potential evaluators   should be documented and included in the docket. A brief rationale for the   selection of the evaluators who have written and why the particular   referee's opinion matters must be included with the docket, as well as an   explanation for each of the declinations. CV's (not just bios from the   evaluator's website) are required for all external evaluators.       Presenting the Committee Report for a Vote:       34. The chair of the Promotion and Tenure Committee should present the   case to a full special departmental meeting of those eligible to attend and   vote. After a discussion a vote must be taken. The vote must be by closed   (secret) ballot, and tallied following departmental custom or departmental   decision in advance of the presentation of the report.          Recommendation of the Chair:       35. The Report of the Departmental Committee on Promotion and Tenure and   the vote by eligible faculty are advisory to the Chair. The Chair must   forward the Report and closed vote (including the number of positive and   negative votes and abstentions, if any) to the Dean of the Faculty with his   or her own recommendation. The report must be a balanced assessment of the   candidate's performance. Documents that do not deal with evident   weaknesses, in the case of a positive recommendation, or that do not deal   with evident strengths, in the case of a negative recommendation, will not   be accepted. If the Chair's recommendation differs in significant ways from   the Report of the Departmental Committee on Promotion and Tenure upon which   the department voted, the Chair must so inform the Departmental Committee   in writing. If the Committee is not a committee-of-the-whole, voting   members of the department must also be informed.       The chair's letter must include a summary of the faculty discussion   preceding the vote, as well as a description for non-specialists of the   place the candidate's work occupies in the relevant discipline or field,   and explain why it is important to the department that this field be   represented on its faculty. It may also be helpful for this statement to   include information about the usual criteria for excellence in the   candidate's discipline (e.g., quality of venues within which the work   appears). The letter must report the number of faculty eligible to vote;   the faculty eligible to vote who are on leave, and when applicable, an   explanation as to why faculty members on leave did not vote. If the   recommendation is for early tenure, the chair's letter must address the   reasons or circumstances that designate it as \"early\" (e.g. if the   candidate had prior service in the tenure track at another institution, a   delayed tenure clock due to family obligations or medical leave, or   extraordinary accomplishments).       For external hires with tenure, the Chair must provide a summary of the   department search committee report including size and composition of the   candidate pool.       36. If the Department Chair is an Associate Professor, the Report of the   Committee for promotion only cases must be reviewed by the Divisional Dean,   who will add his or her own recommendation and forward the Report to the   Dean of the Faculty. If the department chair is the candidate for   promotion, the report of the committee should be submitted by the chair of   the Promotion and Tenure committee directly to the Divisional Dean.       Effective Departmental Reviews:       37. The Chair and all members of the Departmental Promotion and Tenure   Committee must sign the Signature Page of the Docket, attesting that they   have read the docket and that it represents the opinions of the committee   clearly and fairly. The completed docket is then forwarded to the Office of   the Associate Dean to initiate the succeeding stages of the review   process.       38. Properly prepared, detailed and well-documented dockets are the most   effective instrument for conveying the essence of the department's   evaluation of the candidate. Indeed, it is the thorough and honest   appraisal of the strengths and weaknesses of the candidate in each of the   criteria (research, teaching, and service) that is most useful to the FAS   Committee on Promotion and Tenure and to the Dean, often more so than the   final vote, for it gives substantive meaning and texture to the evaluation.   Submission of dockets in a timely fashion is strongly urged in order to   prevent delays from unforeseen complications that may arise, most   especially for dockets received near the end of the academic year.       2.3.2 Dean of the Faculty       Advisory Committee on Promotion and Tenure:       39. The FAS Advisory Committee on Promotion and Tenure consists of   twelve full professors in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, representing   the three divisions. Half of the Committee is elected by the Faculty; the   other half is appointed by the Dean of the Faculty.       40. The Dean of the Faculty, the Deans of the College and Graduate   School, and the Divisional Deans sit with the Advisory Committee on   Promotion and Tenure without vote and with voice confined to procedural   issues or responses to questions by the Committee.       41. If there are questions in any particular case, the Chair of a   Department and/or the Chair of the DepartmentalPromotion and Tenure   Committee may be asked to attend a meeting of the Advisory Committee on   Promotion and Tenure to clarify the docket or to provide additional   information.       42. The Committee makes its recommendation to the Dean of the Faculty.   After receiving the Committee's advice, that of the Deans of the College   and the Graduate School, and that of the appropriate Divisional Dean, the   Dean of the Faculty will inform the Department Chair of the advice provided   by the Advisory Committee on Promotion and Tenure as well as of his own   proposed recommendation to the Provost. In the case of a Dean's   recommendation contrary to that of the department, the Dean will provide   the Chair with the reasons. The Chair will then have ten days in which to   provide further information or counter-argument before the Dean of the   Faculty's final recommendation is made to the Provost.       43. The Dean of the Faculty will ordinarily make this recommendation by   February 15 (promotion only) and March 15 (tenure with or without   promotion). By statute this constitutes the definitive FAS   recommendation.       Dean's Outside Evaluators:       44. The Dean of the Faculty ordinarily solicits additional reviews that   are treated as confidential and are for his own use and that of the   Advisory Committee on Promotion and Tenure. To ensure that the Dean does   not solicit evaluators already contacted by the department, the Chair of   the Department is required to provide the Dean with a list of all   evaluators being solicited by the department. This list should be forwarded   by October 1, 2014.       2.3.3 Provost       The Provost shall evaluate each tenure and promotion docket and   recommendation submitted by the Dean.

After reviewing the recommendation   of the FAS Grievance Committee, the Dean will notify the candidate of his   final decision.       4. Should the decision not be satisfactory to the candidate, he or she   may appeal to the President to convene the Faculty Council Grievance   Committee, an advisory body made up of faculty from different schools   within NYU. It makes its recommendations to the President. Grievance   procedures are explained in The Faculty Handbook .       2.6 DEADLINES       2.6.1 Internal Promotion and Tenure or   Promotion only, Cases       By October 1, 2014, the Department Chair must forward the preliminary   materials in pdf format for internal promotion and tenure or new hires with   tenure; as well as for promotion to full professors only to the Office of   the Associate Dean.

For new hires with tenure who cannot be reviewed by the stated   deadlines, their appointments may need to be delayed to the following   semester or academic year (Spring 2015 or Fall 2015), or their initial   appointment can be in a non-tenured position as Visiting Professor or   Professor without tenure, with the understanding that their status will be   changed as soon as the tenure process is completed. It is important that in   communicating with candidates for tenured positions that they be made aware   of these restrictions in the timing of our tenure review process.       2.7 SAMPLE SOLICITATION LETTER, MANDATORY TENURE AND PROMOTION   REVIEW          Dear xxxx:       Josephine Smith, currently an Assistant Professor in this department, is   being considered for tenure and promotion.

Sincerely,           2.10 STOPPING TENURE CLOCK       Tenure clock stoppage may be granted, under conditions cited below, for   a maximum of two semesters during the probationary period for any one of,   or combination of, the following personal reasons:            Tenure clock stoppage may be authorized during a period of full    service, to women or men who are primary caregivers of a child; and to    primary caregivers of a parent or a spouse, or a same-sex domestic    partner in a health crisis of extended duration. A same-sex domestic    partner qualifies if he or she is registered with the University for    benefits purposes.        \"Primary care\" assumes day-to-day responsibilities for the care of    a child/parent/spouse/same sex domestic partner for a substantial    portion of the period.        Tenure clock stoppage may be authorized to a faculty member who is    granted one or more full semesters of leave, for any one, or    combination of, illness/disability leave, maternity leave, or personal    leave.     A request for tenure clock stoppage requires advance approval by the   Dean and the Office of the Provost. Requests should be made as early as   possible, and when feasible, approvals should be in place no later than the   onset of the semester preceding the period of tenure stoppage.
