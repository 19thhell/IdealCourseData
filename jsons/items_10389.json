Check back in May 2015 for updates on a 2016 offering.   2013 dates were: Tuesday, January 1 (arrival day) - Sunday, January 13 (departure day), 2013. First day of class is Thursday, January 3, last day of class is Saturday, January 12. Note: The course begins on the evening of Wednesday, January 2 with a welcome at the hotel.   The Course   PADM-GP 2201 | Syllabus   International development is a hotly contested and highly politicized field. This course carves out a narrow slice of this large pie and introduces students to the theory and practice of institutional reform in developing countries. It gives special emphasis to the case of Brazil. Throughout the 20th century, and similar to many other developing nations, Brazil has experienced deep economic transformations. Moreover, in recent decades it has enacted a range of institutional reforms to promote social inclusion, environmental protection, and business growth. Despite marked success in a number of areas, the country still struggles to promote good governance, empower its citizenry, create jobs, and raise millions out of poverty.   What can we learn from these experiences? It would be nice if we could isolate blueprints, pre-packaged tools, formulas and other ready-to-use frameworks. Unfortunately, these resources rarely work as intended. Rather, this course encourages students to analyze the theories that underpin existing initiatives, identify principles of action, and use their policy imagination to adapt findings to other contexts. A combination of lectures, class discussions, exercises, and field visits will help in this task.   This course is a joint activity of NYU Wagner and the School of Management and the Collective Health Institute (ISC) at the Federal University of Bahia (UFBA). Brazilian and US-based students and faculty will participate in all activities and all instruction will be conducted in English.   Portuguese language skills will be useful but are not required.   Visit UFBA's website for photos of the campus and facilities.

Check back in May 2015 for updates on a 2016 offering.   2013 dates were: Tuesday, January 1 (arrival day) - Sunday, January 13 (departure day), 2013. First day of class is Thursday, January 3, last day of class is Saturday, January 12. Note: The course begins on the evening of Wednesday, January 2 with a welcome at the hotel.   The Course   PADM-GP 2201 | Syllabus   International development is a hotly contested and highly politicized field. This course carves out a narrow slice of this large pie and introduces students to the theory and practice of institutional reform in developing countries. It gives special emphasis to the case of Brazil. Throughout the 20th century, and similar to many other developing nations, Brazil has experienced deep economic transformations. Moreover, in recent decades it has enacted a range of institutional reforms to promote social inclusion, environmental protection, and business growth. Despite marked success in a number of areas, the country still struggles to promote good governance, empower its citizenry, create jobs, and raise millions out of poverty.   What can we learn from these experiences? It would be nice if we could isolate blueprints, pre-packaged tools, formulas and other ready-to-use frameworks. Unfortunately, these resources rarely work as intended. Rather, this course encourages students to analyze the theories that underpin existing initiatives, identify principles of action, and use their policy imagination to adapt findings to other contexts. A combination of lectures, class discussions, exercises, and field visits will help in this task.   This course is a joint activity of NYU Wagner and the School of Management and the Collective Health Institute (ISC) at the Federal University of Bahia (UFBA). Brazilian and US-based students and faculty will participate in all activities and all instruction will be conducted in English.   Portuguese language skills will be useful but are not required.   Visit UFBA's website for photos of the campus and facilities.

Mid-December (date TBD) (4pm, time and location to be confirmed) - Pre-departure class with Salo Coslovsky and Sandro Cabral and UFBA students   Mandatory Post-Brazil Session:   End of January (time and date TBD) - Course de-brief and final project due date   Excursions   Half-day field visits (usually in the afternoons) are an integral part of the course and will allow students to interact with researchers, government officials, representatives from non-profits, and policymakers in Brazil to understand the challenges they face and how they operate on the ground.
