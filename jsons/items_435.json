Onassis Program in Hellenic Studies provides students with a comprehensive and interdisciplinary understanding of the language, literature, history, and politics of Greece. Through a wide range of courses, students are exposed to a polyphony of viewpoints that help elucidate the historical and political experiences of Byzantine, Ottoman, and modern Greece; the ways in which Greece has borne its several pasts and translated them into the modern era; Greece and its relations to Western Europe, the Balkans, the Middle East, and Mediterranean cultures; and the distinguished literary and artistic traditions of a country that many regard as the birthplace of Western civilization, even as these traditions exhibit their multicultural contexts.    NYU\u2019s summer program in Athens combines classroom study of the language, history, and culture of Greece with extracurricular activities and excursions that introduce students to all aspects of Greek life. The program offers a wide range of courses, including ancient and modern Greek language, Greek Drama, Modern Greek Politics, the City of Athens, and the Archaeology of Greece. Classes are held at the Al Andar Center, a three-story Bauhaus building located in the historical center of Athens. Activities include walking tours of Athens, visits to monuments and museums, and evening outings to dramatic and musical performances; weekend excursions include trips to several Greek islands, medieval settlements, and other important historical and archaeological sites. Relevant courses taken in the academic study program in Greece, NYU in Athens, count toward the major or minor as regular courses.
