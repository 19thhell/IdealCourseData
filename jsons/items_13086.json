Applicants to NYU's New York Campus   Domestic Students : Students who are U.S. citizens or eligible non-citizens and who wish to be considered for financial aid when applying for admission to NYU New York should complete:     The Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) (for new freshmen and continuing students, to be considered for federal financial aid).   The CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE (to be considered for institutional [non-government] financial aid). The CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE is required for new undergraduate domestic students applying for the 2015-2016 academic year who wish to be considered for institutional (non-government) financial aid funds. It is not required for transfer applicants, returning undergraduate students, graduate students, or adult students applying to The Paul McGhee Division at the NYU School of Continuing and Professional Studies.     The New York State Tuition Assistance Program (TAP) grant application, for New York State residents only.   Students seeking financial aid for summer courses must also complete a NYU Summer Aid Application (available from February through July, see the Applications and Forms menu in the column at right).     Admission to NYU New York is need-blind for domestic applicants, and financial support will be tailored for each individual family based upon the results of the FAFSA, PROFILE and TAP applications.   International Students : NYU offers limited financial support in the form of institutional grants/scholarships to international freshmen admitted to our New York campus beginning with the Fall 2013 term. Grants/scholarships will be based upon a combination of financial need and academic merit. Students who are not U.S. citizens or eligible non-citizens and who wish to be considered for institutional financial aid when applying for admission to the NYU New York campus should complete ONLY the CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE to be considered for institutional financial aid funds. International students cannot apply for financial support after they are admitted. Admission to NYU New York is need-aware for international applicants; New York University will consider a family's financial need as reported on the PROFILE when evaluating the student's application for admission.   New York Undocumented Students : Individuals applying for admission as an undocumented undergraduate student may be eligible for NYU scholarship funds. To be considered, please submit:     The CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE.   The Undocumented Student Financial Aid Application (available beginning in October, see the Applications and Forms menu at right).     Please read more information about New York Undocumented Students .   Applicants to NYU's Abu Dhabi Campus   Domestic and International students : All students, regardless of citizenship status (except Emirati nationals), who are applying for admission ONLY to NYU Abu Dhabi (that is, they do not wish to be considered for any other NYU campus) need to complete ONLY the CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE to be considered for institutional financial aid funds. (The CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE is not required for Emirati nationals, who will be automatically evaluated for Exceptional Emirati Scholarship upon acceptance.) International students cannot apply for financial support after they are admitted. Admission to NYU Abu Dhabi is need-blind for all applicants, and financial support will be tailored for each individual family based upon the results of the PROFILE. Students applying ONLY to NYU Abu Dhabi are not required to complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA).   For more information please see NYU Abu Dhabi Financial Support .   Applicants to NYU's Shanghai Campus   Domestic Students : Students who are U.S. citizens or eligible non-citizens and who wish to be considered for financial aid when applying for admission to NYU Shanghai should complete:     The Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) (to be considered for federal financial aid).

International Students and Chinese Nationals : Students who are not U.S. citizens or eligible non-citizens and who wish to be considered for financial aid when applying for admission to the NYU Shanghai campus should complete ONLY the CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE to be considered for institutional financial aid funds.

For more information please see Financial Aid at NYU Shanghai .              FAFSA, CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE and TAP     1. Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA)   Students must submit the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) to be considered for any federal financial aid funds. The FAFSA is a confidential fiinancial statement detailing information about your family\u2019s financial circumstances. When you have completed the form, you submit it directly to the U.S. Department of Education. Using a formula mandated by Congress, the U.S. Department of Education makes an evaluation of your family\u2019s financial strength and estimates the amount your family can contribute annually toward your educational expenses. The Department of Education then sends your family\u2019s financial information and its estimate of family contribution to each college you designate to receive the information. (NOTE TO DENTAL STUDENTS: College of Dentistry students seeking certain federal education loans for the health professions (e.g. the Health Professions Student Loan [HPSL] and Loans for Disadvantaged Students [LDS]) must include parents financial data on the FAFSA even if they are financially independent of their parents.)   The FAFSA is available each year beginning January 1, and should be completed as soon as possible, but not later than February 15 (midnight EST) for new freshmen , and not later than May 1 (midnight EDT) for most other students (see Financial Aid Application Priority Deadlines at column upper right for details). Students who miss the FAFSA priority deadline are still encouraged to apply and will be considered for federal student aid, if eligible, but funds become increasingly limited.   Graduate students should refer to their school or department for specific program deadlines.     Click here to begin and submit the FAFSA . Alternatively, you can complete the paper version, which may be found in your high school or college or by calling 1-800-4-FED-AID.   REQUIRED every year for U.S. citizen and eligible non-citizen undergraduate students, transfer students, and graduate students at NYU New York campus, and adult students applying to The Paul McGhee Division at the NYU School of Continuing and Professional Studies, New York campus.   REQUIRED every year for U.S. citizen and eligible non-citizen undergraduate students, transfer students, and graduate students at NYU Shanghai.     NOT REQUIRED for international students at NYU New York campus.   NOT REQUIRED for students at NYU Abu Dhabi.   NOT REQUIRED for international students and Chinese nationals at NYU Shanghai.   You must list &quot;New York University&quot; as a recipient and include our federal school code number 002785 when completing your FAFSA.     Do not wait until your taxes are done before submitting the FAFSA. Although it is better to do your taxes early, it is acceptable to use estimates of your income when you initially file the FAFSA. You can make corrections later on the FAFSA website.     YOUR FAFSA PIN:  Students and parents of dependent students may use a PIN (Personal Identification Number) to sign the FAFSA electronically and avoid the need to print and mail a signature page. The PIN can be used each year to apply for federal student aid and to review your record online at the U.S. Department of Education. Get your Federal Student Aid PIN at www.pin.ed.gov .   FAFSA priority deadlines for Freshmen applicants:         Early and Regular Decision: February 15 (midnight EST)        FAFSA priority deadlines for Transfer applicants:         Fall/Summer Admission: April 1 (midnight EDT)    Spring Admission: November 1 (midnight EDT)           2. College Scholarship Service Financial Aid PROFILE   The CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE application is administered by the College Scholarship Service (the financial aid division of The College Board) and collects information used by many private universities to award institutional (non-government) financial aid funds.   The CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE can be submitted in the fall as early as October 1 , but not later than February 15 (midnight EST).       Click here to begin and submit the CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE .   REQUIRED the first year for new undergraduate U.S. citizens and eligible non-citizens applying to NYU New York campus who wish to be considered for institutional (non-government) financial aid funds.   NOT REQUIRED for U.S. citizen and eligible non-citizen returning undergraduate students, transfer students, and graduate students at NYU New York campus, or adult students applying to The Paul McGhee Division at the NYU School of Continuing and Professional Studies, New York campus.   REQUIRED every year for international students at NYU New York campus who wish to be considered for institutional (non-government) financial aid funds.   REQUIRED every year for all students at NYU Abu Dhabi who wish to be considered for institutional (non-government) financial aid funds. (NOTE: it is not required for Emirati nationals, who will be automatically evaluated for Exceptional Emirati Scholarship upon acceptance.)   REQUIRED every year for international (not US, not Chinese nationals) students at NYU Shanghai who wish to be considered for institutional (non-government) financial aid funds. (NOTE: it is not required for Chinese nationals who complete the Gaokao college entrance examination instead of the SAT college admission test).   You must list &quot;New York University&quot; as a recipient and include our CSS school code number 2785 when completing your CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE.   Do not wait until your taxes are done before submitting the PROFILE. Although it is better to do your taxes early, it is acceptable to use estimates of your income when you initially file the PROFILE.   NYU does not participate in the CSS IDOC program.   CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE Help: telephone 305-829-9793.     CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE priority deadlines for Freshmen applicants:         Early Decision I: November 15 (midnight EST)    Early Decision II: January 15 (midnight EST)    Regular Decision: February 15 (midnight EST)        College Scholarship Service Noncustodial PROFILE     The CSS Noncustodial PROFILE is also required, if applicable;     Students who have families with separated, divorced, or single parents must also complete the Non-Custodial Parent form, which complements the CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE. NYU requires noncustodial parents to report their income, assets and other information as part of the financial aid application process to assess an applicant\u2019s eligibility for scholarship or other types of aid.   Providing such information does not necessarily mean that the student\u2019s noncustodial parent will be expected or required to contribute to educational costs.   Under certain circumstances NYU will consider waiving the requirement for the CSS Noncustodial PROFILE in the event the information cannot be obtained. Please see the CSS Noncustodial PROFILE Waiver Request form available (October to February) on the Applications and Forms menu in the column at right.   If the CSS Noncustodial PROFILE is required but not submitted, and NYU does not grant the applicant a waiver of this requirement, the student will not be considered for need-based NYU scholarship or grant funds. Please note that this is important because the amount of scholarship a student receives in their first year at NYU is typically the amount they will continue to receive each year if they remain otherwise eligible. Thus, if a student does not receive any NYU grant or scholarship in their freshman year they will likely not receive any in subsequent years. Failing to submit the CSS Noncustodial PROFILE (or the waiver request) for the first year can therefore affect eligibility in future years.     CSS Noncustodial PROFILE priority deadlines for Freshmen applicants:           Early Decision I: November 20 (midnight EST)    Early Decision II: January 20 (midnight EST)    Regular Decision: February 20 (midnight EST)        Please note that the deadlines for the CSS Noncustodial PROFILE application occur 5 days after the corresponding deadlines for the CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE application to allow additional time to provide the information required.             3. NYS Tuition Assistance Program (TAP)   In addition to the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA), New York State residents must also submit an application for the New York State Tuition Assistance Program (TAP). TAP grants are available to qualified students attending New York University.    Start the TAP application process by completing the FAFSA at http://www.fafsa.gov/ . New York State will use your FAFSA information as part of your application for TAP; you can link to the online TAP application directly from the FAFSA on the Web confirmation page.    You will be asked to establish a PIN (Personal Identification Number) for TAP. The TAP PIN will allow you complete your application online, keep track of your application information, or make changes later. Information from your FAFSA and your family's calculated NYS net taxable income will be pre-filled on your TAP on the Web application. Follow the instructions provided.       You must list &quot;New York University&quot; as a recipient and include our state school code number 0555 when completing your TAP application.     If you choose not to apply online, an Express TAP Application (ETA) will be mailed to you by the New York State Higher Education Services Corporation (HESC). Information from your FAFSA and your family's calculated NYS net taxable income will be pre-printed on your ETA. Review this information, change any incorrect items, complete any missing items, then SIGN AND MAIL THE FORM USING THE RETURN ENVELOPE.    If you provide an e-mail address on your FAFSA, HESC will use that address to contact you about your TAP application, give you processing updates, or award information. Please respond to any requests or instructions sent by HESC. If you have submitted applications, you can check the status of your TAP at any time.    If you have already received TAP, you must renew your grant each year by returning to TAP on the Web (via the online FAFSA process) to review and confirm your HESC data. You must submit the FAFSA for each academic year to continue your TAP eligibility. Based upon the data reported on your FAFSA, you will receive confirmation from HESC about your grant eligibility and award. Be sure to verify that all information is accurate, and submit any necessary corrections immediately.                                                         Priority Dates and Deadlines   All students should apply for financial aid every year. Students who miss a financial aid priority deadline are still encouraged to file the FAFSA and will be considered for federal student aid if eligible, but funds become increasingly limited. If you have not applied, do so immediately . Remember, to meet the specified deadline your application, with all necessary signatures, must be received and validated by the processor and released to NYU by the date shown below for priority consideration.   Freshman Applicants: In order to be considered for NYU scholarship, you must complete all required applications by our deadlines . Please review the Applications and Forms section of this website to find out which applications are relevant to you. Late CSS Profile applications will not be accepted for scholarship consideration.

It may surprise you to learn that most full-time undergraduate students at New York University would not be able to pay their educational costs without financial assistance. These students are able to attend NYU only because they applied for and received financial aid.    While we believe that the primary responsibility for meeting college costs rests with the student and the family, New York University as well as the state and federal governments can help. Although NYU is not able to meet the full need of every student, by combining the various types of funds available we use every method possible to coordinate adequate resources to enable you to invest in a higher education at NYU.    If you believe you will need any amount of financial assistance to attend NYU, we strongly encourage you to apply for financial aid immediately.

They may take the form of University scholarships, federal or state grants, or outside scholarships.   For most undergraduates, eligibility for a merit-based and/or need-based scholarship is determined upon entrance to the University based on prior academic strengths and, if you apply for financial aid , your demonstrated financial need. Typically you will continue to receive for subsequent academic years the amount of scholarship you received for your first year (subject to the availability of funds), as long as the following criteria are met:       You are a full-time student (at least 12 points).   You applied for financial aid on time.   You are meeting the Satisfactory Academic Progress standards.   You have approximately the same amount of financial need that you had in prior years.       New York University Scholarships   Descriptions of University-Wide and School-Based scholarships at NYU for which you may qualify are provided in the Undergraduate Admissions area of the NYU website. All admitted undergraduate students are automatically considered for these programs based on academic merit. Except where noted, no separate application form is required.   Graduate students are usually offered scholarships for each separate academic year as determined by their individual schools within NYU.   Note: If your eligibility for any federal aid you receive is jeopardized for reasons other than financial need or academic merit (e.g. if you are in default on a federal loan, or if you did not respond to the University's requests for tax information and income verification ), then your NYU scholarship may also be affected.       Federal Grant Programs                                                  FEDERAL PELL GRANT                               The Federal Pell Grant Program provides assistance to undergraduate students who demonstrate financial need according to economic criteria and program requirements established by the federal government. To be eligible, you must enroll in a degree program and be matriculated for your first bachelor's degree. (You are not eligible if you have already completed a bachelor's degree.) An estimated award will be listed in your award package if we think you will be eligible. Your Student Aid Report (SAR) contains the official evaluation of your eligibility from the U.S. Department of Education. When you review your SAR, follow the instructions to make changes if necessary\u2014including updating your record to reflect actual tax figures if you used estimated data in order to meet the NYU application deadline\u2014and then save the final SAR for your records. You may also review and make changes to your SAR in the &quot;FAFSA Follow-up&quot; area of the FAFSA Web site .                                                              TEACHER EDUCATION ASSISTANCE FOR COLLEGE AND HIGHER EDUCATION (TEACH) GRANT (Steinhardt students only)                               Through the College Cost Reduction and Access Act of 2007, Congress created the Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grant Program that provides grants of up to $3,965* per year to students who intend to teach in a public or private elementary or secondary school that serves students from low-income families.     Be a U.S. citizen or eligible non-citizen.   Be enrolled as an undergraduate, post-baccalaureate, or graduate student in a postsecondary educational institution that has chosen to participate in the TEACH Grant Program.   Be enrolled in course work that is necessary to begin a career in teaching or plan to complete such course work. Such course work may include subject area courses (e.g., math courses for a student who intends to be a math teacher).   Meet certain academic achievement requirements (generally, scoring above the 75th percentile on a college admissions test or maintaining a cumulative GPA of at least 3.25).   Complete an online TEACH Grant Entrance Counseling session each eligible year.   Sign a TEACH Grant Agreement to Serve each eligible year.     * Per federal mandate, the maximum amount for TEACH Grant awards for academic year 2013-2014 (first disbursed on or after 10/1/13 and before 10/1/14) is $3,965. The maximum amount for TEACH Grant awards for academic year 2014-2015 (first disbursed on or after 10/1/14 and before 10/1/15) is $3,708.                                                              FEDERAL SUPPLEMENTAL EDUCATION OPPORTUNITY GRANTS (FSEOG)                               The FSEOG program is funded by the U.S. Department of Education and administered by New York University to provide assistance to students with exceptional financial need. All students who qualify are automatically considered for this grant. However, our funds from this program are very limited.                                                              VETERANS BENEFITS                               The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs offers education grant assistance to qualified U.S. military service members and their families.   &gt; more                        State Scholarship and Grant Programs   New York State offers a wide variety of grants and scholarships to residents, subject to the annual availability of funds. Although application is made directly to the state and grants are awarded by the state, the amount each student is expected to receive is estimated and taken into account by NYU when assembling the student's financial aid package.                                                  NEW YORK STATE TUITION ASSISTANCE PROGRAM (TAP)                               Legal residents of the state of New York who are enrolled in a full-time or part-time degree program may be eligible for awards under this program. The award varies, depending on income and tuition cost. A separate application is necessary. &gt; more                                                              AID FOR PART-TIME STUDY (APTS)                               A financial aid program to help New York State residents pursuing part-time undergraduate degree study offers awards in amounts of up to $2,000 per academic year. To be eligible, the student must have filed a FAFSA and demonstrate financial need, must not have exhausted their TAP eligibility, must be otherwise eligible for financial aid, and must be enrolled for 3 to 11 credit points per term. A separate application is necessary, and is available here .

Some students from outside New York State may qualify for funds from their own state scholarship programs that can be used at New York University. Contact your state financial aid agency (call 1-800-433-3243 to obtain contact information) to ask about program requirements and application procedures. When you receive an eligibility notice from your state program, you should submit it immediately to the NYU Office of Financial Aid.          Scholarships and Grants from Other Organizations   In addition to the sources of gift aid described above, you may also be eligible for a private scholarship or grant from an outside organization or agency. Some sources to explore are employers, unions, professional organizations, and community and special interest groups.   Many extensive scholarship search services are available free online, and a representative sample is included on the drop menu below. The scholarships and information presented by such services are not verified or endorsed by NYU. You must notify the Office of Financial Aid if you receive funds from any outside organization.

Outside scholarships are considered a financial aid resource and must be added to a student's financial aid award. The Office of Financial Aid first applies the outside scholarship to a student's unmet need that is not already covered by financial aid. In some cases, loans not based on financial need may be reduced (private loans, Federal Unsubsidized Loans, Federal PLUS Loans, Graduate PLUS). If the student's need is already met by need-based aid, then that aid is replaced with the outside scholarship. Need-based loans are first replaced. If the outside scholarship exceeds the loan amounts, work-study and need-based grants are the next to be replaced. In most cases it is not necessary to reduce an NYU scholarship. Total aid (including outside assistance) cannot exceed the cost of attendance.

ELIGIBILITY: Preferred consideration is given to the dependents and spouses of uniformed members of the Fire Department of the City of New York (FDNY), the New York Police Department (NYPD), the Port Authority Police Department (PAPD), and other emergency response workers who died at the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001. (The dependents of other victims of 9/11 are not eligible.) There is no New York State residency requirement. Students must apply and be admitted to a four-year undergraduate degree program at New York University under normal admission standards.    Transfer students from other undergraduate programs are also eligible.    Students in graduate, professional, non-degree, or non-credit programs are not eligible for these scholarships.    Students must maintain full-time matriculation during each semester in which they receive scholarship funds and they must maintain satisfactory academic progress to continue to be eligible. Students may receive scholarship funds for up to eight semesters at NYU.     HOW TO APPLY: Once admitted, eligible students must first submit the FAFSA and also apply for the New York State World Trade Center Memorial Scholarship . NYU scholarship funds will then be used to accommodate any remaining need, up to the full cost of education at New York University.     COSTS COVERED: Scholarship awards may be used to support tuition, registration fees, and room and board (for NYU housing only), but not health services or other activity and support fees.

Applicants to NYU's New York Campus   Domestic Students : Students who are U.S. citizens or eligible non-citizens and who wish to be considered for financial aid when applying for admission to NYU New York should complete:     The Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) (for new freshmen and continuing students, to be considered for federal financial aid).   The CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE (to be considered for institutional [non-government] financial aid). The CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE is required for new undergraduate domestic students applying for the 2015-2016 academic year who wish to be considered for institutional (non-government) financial aid funds. It is not required for transfer applicants, returning undergraduate students, graduate students, or adult students applying to The Paul McGhee Division at the NYU School of Continuing and Professional Studies.     The New York State Tuition Assistance Program (TAP) grant application, for New York State residents only.   Students seeking financial aid for summer courses must also complete a NYU Summer Aid Application (available from February through July, see the Applications and Forms menu in the column at right).     Admission to NYU New York is need-blind for domestic applicants, and financial support will be tailored for each individual family based upon the results of the FAFSA, PROFILE and TAP applications.   International Students : NYU offers limited financial support in the form of institutional grants/scholarships to international freshmen admitted to our New York campus beginning with the Fall 2013 term. Grants/scholarships will be based upon a combination of financial need and academic merit. Students who are not U.S. citizens or eligible non-citizens and who wish to be considered for institutional financial aid when applying for admission to the NYU New York campus should complete ONLY the CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE to be considered for institutional financial aid funds. International students cannot apply for financial support after they are admitted. Admission to NYU New York is need-aware for international applicants; New York University will consider a family's financial need as reported on the PROFILE when evaluating the student's application for admission.   New York Undocumented Students : Individuals applying for admission as an undocumented undergraduate student may be eligible for NYU scholarship funds. To be considered, please submit:     The CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE.   The Undocumented Student Financial Aid Application (available beginning in October, see the Applications and Forms menu at right).     Please read more information about New York Undocumented Students .   Applicants to NYU's Abu Dhabi Campus   Domestic and International students : All students, regardless of citizenship status (except Emirati nationals), who are applying for admission ONLY to NYU Abu Dhabi (that is, they do not wish to be considered for any other NYU campus) need to complete ONLY the CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE to be considered for institutional financial aid funds. (The CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE is not required for Emirati nationals, who will be automatically evaluated for Exceptional Emirati Scholarship upon acceptance.) International students cannot apply for financial support after they are admitted. Admission to NYU Abu Dhabi is need-blind for all applicants, and financial support will be tailored for each individual family based upon the results of the PROFILE. Students applying ONLY to NYU Abu Dhabi are not required to complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA).   For more information please see NYU Abu Dhabi Financial Support .   Applicants to NYU's Shanghai Campus   Domestic Students : Students who are U.S. citizens or eligible non-citizens and who wish to be considered for financial aid when applying for admission to NYU Shanghai should complete:     The Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) (to be considered for federal financial aid).

International Students and Chinese Nationals : Students who are not U.S. citizens or eligible non-citizens and who wish to be considered for financial aid when applying for admission to the NYU Shanghai campus should complete ONLY the CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE to be considered for institutional financial aid funds.

For more information please see Financial Aid at NYU Shanghai .              FAFSA, CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE and TAP     1. Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA)   Students must submit the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) to be considered for any federal financial aid funds. The FAFSA is a confidential fiinancial statement detailing information about your family\u2019s financial circumstances. When you have completed the form, you submit it directly to the U.S. Department of Education. Using a formula mandated by Congress, the U.S. Department of Education makes an evaluation of your family\u2019s financial strength and estimates the amount your family can contribute annually toward your educational expenses. The Department of Education then sends your family\u2019s financial information and its estimate of family contribution to each college you designate to receive the information. (NOTE TO DENTAL STUDENTS: College of Dentistry students seeking certain federal education loans for the health professions (e.g. the Health Professions Student Loan [HPSL] and Loans for Disadvantaged Students [LDS]) must include parents financial data on the FAFSA even if they are financially independent of their parents.)   The FAFSA is available each year beginning January 1, and should be completed as soon as possible, but not later than February 15 (midnight EST) for new freshmen , and not later than May 1 (midnight EDT) for most other students (see Financial Aid Application Priority Deadlines at column upper right for details). Students who miss the FAFSA priority deadline are still encouraged to apply and will be considered for federal student aid, if eligible, but funds become increasingly limited.   Graduate students should refer to their school or department for specific program deadlines.     Click here to begin and submit the FAFSA . Alternatively, you can complete the paper version, which may be found in your high school or college or by calling 1-800-4-FED-AID.   REQUIRED every year for U.S. citizen and eligible non-citizen undergraduate students, transfer students, and graduate students at NYU New York campus, and adult students applying to The Paul McGhee Division at the NYU School of Continuing and Professional Studies, New York campus.   REQUIRED every year for U.S. citizen and eligible non-citizen undergraduate students, transfer students, and graduate students at NYU Shanghai.     NOT REQUIRED for international students at NYU New York campus.   NOT REQUIRED for students at NYU Abu Dhabi.   NOT REQUIRED for international students and Chinese nationals at NYU Shanghai.   You must list &quot;New York University&quot; as a recipient and include our federal school code number 002785 when completing your FAFSA.     Do not wait until your taxes are done before submitting the FAFSA. Although it is better to do your taxes early, it is acceptable to use estimates of your income when you initially file the FAFSA. You can make corrections later on the FAFSA website.     YOUR FAFSA PIN:  Students and parents of dependent students may use a PIN (Personal Identification Number) to sign the FAFSA electronically and avoid the need to print and mail a signature page. The PIN can be used each year to apply for federal student aid and to review your record online at the U.S. Department of Education. Get your Federal Student Aid PIN at www.pin.ed.gov .   FAFSA priority deadlines for Freshmen applicants:         Early and Regular Decision: February 15 (midnight EST)        FAFSA priority deadlines for Transfer applicants:         Fall/Summer Admission: April 1 (midnight EDT)    Spring Admission: November 1 (midnight EDT)           2. College Scholarship Service Financial Aid PROFILE   The CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE application is administered by the College Scholarship Service (the financial aid division of The College Board) and collects information used by many private universities to award institutional (non-government) financial aid funds.   The CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE can be submitted in the fall as early as October 1 , but not later than February 15 (midnight EST).       Click here to begin and submit the CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE .   REQUIRED the first year for new undergraduate U.S. citizens and eligible non-citizens applying to NYU New York campus who wish to be considered for institutional (non-government) financial aid funds.   NOT REQUIRED for U.S. citizen and eligible non-citizen returning undergraduate students, transfer students, and graduate students at NYU New York campus, or adult students applying to The Paul McGhee Division at the NYU School of Continuing and Professional Studies, New York campus.   REQUIRED every year for international students at NYU New York campus who wish to be considered for institutional (non-government) financial aid funds.   REQUIRED every year for all students at NYU Abu Dhabi who wish to be considered for institutional (non-government) financial aid funds. (NOTE: it is not required for Emirati nationals, who will be automatically evaluated for Exceptional Emirati Scholarship upon acceptance.)   REQUIRED every year for international (not US, not Chinese nationals) students at NYU Shanghai who wish to be considered for institutional (non-government) financial aid funds. (NOTE: it is not required for Chinese nationals who complete the Gaokao college entrance examination instead of the SAT college admission test).   You must list &quot;New York University&quot; as a recipient and include our CSS school code number 2785 when completing your CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE.   Do not wait until your taxes are done before submitting the PROFILE. Although it is better to do your taxes early, it is acceptable to use estimates of your income when you initially file the PROFILE.   NYU does not participate in the CSS IDOC program.   CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE Help: telephone 305-829-9793.     CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE priority deadlines for Freshmen applicants:         Early Decision I: November 15 (midnight EST)    Early Decision II: January 15 (midnight EST)    Regular Decision: February 15 (midnight EST)        College Scholarship Service Noncustodial PROFILE     The CSS Noncustodial PROFILE is also required, if applicable;     Students who have families with separated, divorced, or single parents must also complete the Non-Custodial Parent form, which complements the CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE. NYU requires noncustodial parents to report their income, assets and other information as part of the financial aid application process to assess an applicant\u2019s eligibility for scholarship or other types of aid.   Providing such information does not necessarily mean that the student\u2019s noncustodial parent will be expected or required to contribute to educational costs.   Under certain circumstances NYU will consider waiving the requirement for the CSS Noncustodial PROFILE in the event the information cannot be obtained. Please see the CSS Noncustodial PROFILE Waiver Request form available (October to February) on the Applications and Forms menu in the column at right.   If the CSS Noncustodial PROFILE is required but not submitted, and NYU does not grant the applicant a waiver of this requirement, the student will not be considered for need-based NYU scholarship or grant funds. Please note that this is important because the amount of scholarship a student receives in their first year at NYU is typically the amount they will continue to receive each year if they remain otherwise eligible. Thus, if a student does not receive any NYU grant or scholarship in their freshman year they will likely not receive any in subsequent years. Failing to submit the CSS Noncustodial PROFILE (or the waiver request) for the first year can therefore affect eligibility in future years.     CSS Noncustodial PROFILE priority deadlines for Freshmen applicants:           Early Decision I: November 20 (midnight EST)    Early Decision II: January 20 (midnight EST)    Regular Decision: February 20 (midnight EST)        Please note that the deadlines for the CSS Noncustodial PROFILE application occur 5 days after the corresponding deadlines for the CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE application to allow additional time to provide the information required.             3. NYS Tuition Assistance Program (TAP)   In addition to the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA), New York State residents must also submit an application for the New York State Tuition Assistance Program (TAP). TAP grants are available to qualified students attending New York University.    Start the TAP application process by completing the FAFSA at http://www.fafsa.gov/ . New York State will use your FAFSA information as part of your application for TAP; you can link to the online TAP application directly from the FAFSA on the Web confirmation page.    You will be asked to establish a PIN (Personal Identification Number) for TAP. The TAP PIN will allow you complete your application online, keep track of your application information, or make changes later. Information from your FAFSA and your family's calculated NYS net taxable income will be pre-filled on your TAP on the Web application. Follow the instructions provided.       You must list &quot;New York University&quot; as a recipient and include our state school code number 0555 when completing your TAP application.     If you choose not to apply online, an Express TAP Application (ETA) will be mailed to you by the New York State Higher Education Services Corporation (HESC). Information from your FAFSA and your family's calculated NYS net taxable income will be pre-printed on your ETA. Review this information, change any incorrect items, complete any missing items, then SIGN AND MAIL THE FORM USING THE RETURN ENVELOPE.    If you provide an e-mail address on your FAFSA, HESC will use that address to contact you about your TAP application, give you processing updates, or award information. Please respond to any requests or instructions sent by HESC. If you have submitted applications, you can check the status of your TAP at any time.    If you have already received TAP, you must renew your grant each year by returning to TAP on the Web (via the online FAFSA process) to review and confirm your HESC data. You must submit the FAFSA for each academic year to continue your TAP eligibility. Based upon the data reported on your FAFSA, you will receive confirmation from HESC about your grant eligibility and award. Be sure to verify that all information is accurate, and submit any necessary corrections immediately.                                                         Priority Dates and Deadlines   All students should apply for financial aid every year. Students who miss a financial aid priority deadline are still encouraged to file the FAFSA and will be considered for federal student aid if eligible, but funds become increasingly limited. If you have not applied, do so immediately . Remember, to meet the specified deadline your application, with all necessary signatures, must be received and validated by the processor and released to NYU by the date shown below for priority consideration.   Freshman Applicants: In order to be considered for NYU scholarship, you must complete all required applications by our deadlines . Please review the Applications and Forms section of this website to find out which applications are relevant to you. Late CSS Profile applications will not be accepted for scholarship consideration.

It may surprise you to learn that most full-time undergraduate students at New York University would not be able to pay their educational costs without financial assistance. These students are able to attend NYU only because they applied for and received financial aid.    While we believe that the primary responsibility for meeting college costs rests with the student and the family, New York University as well as the state and federal governments can help. Although NYU is not able to meet the full need of every student, by combining the various types of funds available we use every method possible to coordinate adequate resources to enable you to invest in a higher education at NYU.    If you believe you will need any amount of financial assistance to attend NYU, we strongly encourage you to apply for financial aid immediately.

They may take the form of University scholarships, federal or state grants, or outside scholarships.   For most undergraduates, eligibility for a merit-based and/or need-based scholarship is determined upon entrance to the University based on prior academic strengths and, if you apply for financial aid , your demonstrated financial need. Typically you will continue to receive for subsequent academic years the amount of scholarship you received for your first year (subject to the availability of funds), as long as the following criteria are met:       You are a full-time student (at least 12 points).   You applied for financial aid on time.   You are meeting the Satisfactory Academic Progress standards.   You have approximately the same amount of financial need that you had in prior years.       New York University Scholarships   Descriptions of University-Wide and School-Based scholarships at NYU for which you may qualify are provided in the Undergraduate Admissions area of the NYU website. All admitted undergraduate students are automatically considered for these programs based on academic merit. Except where noted, no separate application form is required.   Graduate students are usually offered scholarships for each separate academic year as determined by their individual schools within NYU.   Note: If your eligibility for any federal aid you receive is jeopardized for reasons other than financial need or academic merit (e.g. if you are in default on a federal loan, or if you did not respond to the University's requests for tax information and income verification ), then your NYU scholarship may also be affected.       Federal Grant Programs                                                  FEDERAL PELL GRANT                               The Federal Pell Grant Program provides assistance to undergraduate students who demonstrate financial need according to economic criteria and program requirements established by the federal government. To be eligible, you must enroll in a degree program and be matriculated for your first bachelor's degree. (You are not eligible if you have already completed a bachelor's degree.) An estimated award will be listed in your award package if we think you will be eligible. Your Student Aid Report (SAR) contains the official evaluation of your eligibility from the U.S. Department of Education. When you review your SAR, follow the instructions to make changes if necessary\u2014including updating your record to reflect actual tax figures if you used estimated data in order to meet the NYU application deadline\u2014and then save the final SAR for your records. You may also review and make changes to your SAR in the &quot;FAFSA Follow-up&quot; area of the FAFSA Web site .                                                              TEACHER EDUCATION ASSISTANCE FOR COLLEGE AND HIGHER EDUCATION (TEACH) GRANT (Steinhardt students only)                               Through the College Cost Reduction and Access Act of 2007, Congress created the Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grant Program that provides grants of up to $3,965* per year to students who intend to teach in a public or private elementary or secondary school that serves students from low-income families.     Be a U.S. citizen or eligible non-citizen.   Be enrolled as an undergraduate, post-baccalaureate, or graduate student in a postsecondary educational institution that has chosen to participate in the TEACH Grant Program.   Be enrolled in course work that is necessary to begin a career in teaching or plan to complete such course work. Such course work may include subject area courses (e.g., math courses for a student who intends to be a math teacher).   Meet certain academic achievement requirements (generally, scoring above the 75th percentile on a college admissions test or maintaining a cumulative GPA of at least 3.25).   Complete an online TEACH Grant Entrance Counseling session each eligible year.   Sign a TEACH Grant Agreement to Serve each eligible year.     * Per federal mandate, the maximum amount for TEACH Grant awards for academic year 2013-2014 (first disbursed on or after 10/1/13 and before 10/1/14) is $3,965. The maximum amount for TEACH Grant awards for academic year 2014-2015 (first disbursed on or after 10/1/14 and before 10/1/15) is $3,708.                                                              FEDERAL SUPPLEMENTAL EDUCATION OPPORTUNITY GRANTS (FSEOG)                               The FSEOG program is funded by the U.S. Department of Education and administered by New York University to provide assistance to students with exceptional financial need. All students who qualify are automatically considered for this grant. However, our funds from this program are very limited.                                                              VETERANS BENEFITS                               The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs offers education grant assistance to qualified U.S. military service members and their families.   &gt; more                        State Scholarship and Grant Programs   New York State offers a wide variety of grants and scholarships to residents, subject to the annual availability of funds. Although application is made directly to the state and grants are awarded by the state, the amount each student is expected to receive is estimated and taken into account by NYU when assembling the student's financial aid package.                                                  NEW YORK STATE TUITION ASSISTANCE PROGRAM (TAP)                               Legal residents of the state of New York who are enrolled in a full-time or part-time degree program may be eligible for awards under this program. The award varies, depending on income and tuition cost. A separate application is necessary. &gt; more                                                              AID FOR PART-TIME STUDY (APTS)                               A financial aid program to help New York State residents pursuing part-time undergraduate degree study offers awards in amounts of up to $2,000 per academic year. To be eligible, the student must have filed a FAFSA and demonstrate financial need, must not have exhausted their TAP eligibility, must be otherwise eligible for financial aid, and must be enrolled for 3 to 11 credit points per term. A separate application is necessary, and is available here .

Some students from outside New York State may qualify for funds from their own state scholarship programs that can be used at New York University. Contact your state financial aid agency (call 1-800-433-3243 to obtain contact information) to ask about program requirements and application procedures. When you receive an eligibility notice from your state program, you should submit it immediately to the NYU Office of Financial Aid.          Scholarships and Grants from Other Organizations   In addition to the sources of gift aid described above, you may also be eligible for a private scholarship or grant from an outside organization or agency. Some sources to explore are employers, unions, professional organizations, and community and special interest groups.   Many extensive scholarship search services are available free online, and a representative sample is included on the drop menu below. The scholarships and information presented by such services are not verified or endorsed by NYU. You must notify the Office of Financial Aid if you receive funds from any outside organization.

Outside scholarships are considered a financial aid resource and must be added to a student's financial aid award. The Office of Financial Aid first applies the outside scholarship to a student's unmet need that is not already covered by financial aid. In some cases, loans not based on financial need may be reduced (private loans, Federal Unsubsidized Loans, Federal PLUS Loans, Graduate PLUS). If the student's need is already met by need-based aid, then that aid is replaced with the outside scholarship. Need-based loans are first replaced. If the outside scholarship exceeds the loan amounts, work-study and need-based grants are the next to be replaced. In most cases it is not necessary to reduce an NYU scholarship. Total aid (including outside assistance) cannot exceed the cost of attendance.

ELIGIBILITY: Preferred consideration is given to the dependents and spouses of uniformed members of the Fire Department of the City of New York (FDNY), the New York Police Department (NYPD), the Port Authority Police Department (PAPD), and other emergency response workers who died at the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001. (The dependents of other victims of 9/11 are not eligible.) There is no New York State residency requirement. Students must apply and be admitted to a four-year undergraduate degree program at New York University under normal admission standards.    Transfer students from other undergraduate programs are also eligible.    Students in graduate, professional, non-degree, or non-credit programs are not eligible for these scholarships.    Students must maintain full-time matriculation during each semester in which they receive scholarship funds and they must maintain satisfactory academic progress to continue to be eligible. Students may receive scholarship funds for up to eight semesters at NYU.     HOW TO APPLY: Once admitted, eligible students must first submit the FAFSA and also apply for the New York State World Trade Center Memorial Scholarship . NYU scholarship funds will then be used to accommodate any remaining need, up to the full cost of education at New York University.     COSTS COVERED: Scholarship awards may be used to support tuition, registration fees, and room and board (for NYU housing only), but not health services or other activity and support fees.

Applicants to NYU's New York Campus   Domestic Students : Students who are U.S. citizens or eligible non-citizens and who wish to be considered for financial aid when applying for admission to NYU New York should complete:     The Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) (for new freshmen and continuing students, to be considered for federal financial aid).   The CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE (to be considered for institutional [non-government] financial aid). The CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE is required for new undergraduate domestic students applying for the 2015-2016 academic year who wish to be considered for institutional (non-government) financial aid funds. It is not required for transfer applicants, returning undergraduate students, graduate students, or adult students applying to The Paul McGhee Division at the NYU School of Continuing and Professional Studies.     The New York State Tuition Assistance Program (TAP) grant application, for New York State residents only.   Students seeking financial aid for summer courses must also complete a NYU Summer Aid Application (available from February through July, see the Applications and Forms menu in the column at right).     Admission to NYU New York is need-blind for domestic applicants, and financial support will be tailored for each individual family based upon the results of the FAFSA, PROFILE and TAP applications.   International Students : NYU offers limited financial support in the form of institutional grants/scholarships to international freshmen admitted to our New York campus beginning with the Fall 2013 term. Grants/scholarships will be based upon a combination of financial need and academic merit. Students who are not U.S. citizens or eligible non-citizens and who wish to be considered for institutional financial aid when applying for admission to the NYU New York campus should complete ONLY the CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE to be considered for institutional financial aid funds. International students cannot apply for financial support after they are admitted. Admission to NYU New York is need-aware for international applicants; New York University will consider a family's financial need as reported on the PROFILE when evaluating the student's application for admission.   New York Undocumented Students : Individuals applying for admission as an undocumented undergraduate student may be eligible for NYU scholarship funds. To be considered, please submit:     The CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE.   The Undocumented Student Financial Aid Application (available beginning in October, see the Applications and Forms menu at right).     Please read more information about New York Undocumented Students .   Applicants to NYU's Abu Dhabi Campus   Domestic and International students : All students, regardless of citizenship status (except Emirati nationals), who are applying for admission ONLY to NYU Abu Dhabi (that is, they do not wish to be considered for any other NYU campus) need to complete ONLY the CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE to be considered for institutional financial aid funds. (The CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE is not required for Emirati nationals, who will be automatically evaluated for Exceptional Emirati Scholarship upon acceptance.) International students cannot apply for financial support after they are admitted. Admission to NYU Abu Dhabi is need-blind for all applicants, and financial support will be tailored for each individual family based upon the results of the PROFILE. Students applying ONLY to NYU Abu Dhabi are not required to complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA).   For more information please see NYU Abu Dhabi Financial Support .   Applicants to NYU's Shanghai Campus   Domestic Students : Students who are U.S. citizens or eligible non-citizens and who wish to be considered for financial aid when applying for admission to NYU Shanghai should complete:     The Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) (to be considered for federal financial aid).

International Students and Chinese Nationals : Students who are not U.S. citizens or eligible non-citizens and who wish to be considered for financial aid when applying for admission to the NYU Shanghai campus should complete ONLY the CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE to be considered for institutional financial aid funds.

For more information please see Financial Aid at NYU Shanghai .              FAFSA, CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE and TAP     1. Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA)   Students must submit the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) to be considered for any federal financial aid funds. The FAFSA is a confidential fiinancial statement detailing information about your family\u2019s financial circumstances. When you have completed the form, you submit it directly to the U.S. Department of Education. Using a formula mandated by Congress, the U.S. Department of Education makes an evaluation of your family\u2019s financial strength and estimates the amount your family can contribute annually toward your educational expenses. The Department of Education then sends your family\u2019s financial information and its estimate of family contribution to each college you designate to receive the information. (NOTE TO DENTAL STUDENTS: College of Dentistry students seeking certain federal education loans for the health professions (e.g. the Health Professions Student Loan [HPSL] and Loans for Disadvantaged Students [LDS]) must include parents financial data on the FAFSA even if they are financially independent of their parents.)   The FAFSA is available each year beginning January 1, and should be completed as soon as possible, but not later than February 15 (midnight EST) for new freshmen , and not later than May 1 (midnight EDT) for most other students (see Financial Aid Application Priority Deadlines at column upper right for details). Students who miss the FAFSA priority deadline are still encouraged to apply and will be considered for federal student aid, if eligible, but funds become increasingly limited.   Graduate students should refer to their school or department for specific program deadlines.     Click here to begin and submit the FAFSA . Alternatively, you can complete the paper version, which may be found in your high school or college or by calling 1-800-4-FED-AID.   REQUIRED every year for U.S. citizen and eligible non-citizen undergraduate students, transfer students, and graduate students at NYU New York campus, and adult students applying to The Paul McGhee Division at the NYU School of Continuing and Professional Studies, New York campus.   REQUIRED every year for U.S. citizen and eligible non-citizen undergraduate students, transfer students, and graduate students at NYU Shanghai.     NOT REQUIRED for international students at NYU New York campus.   NOT REQUIRED for students at NYU Abu Dhabi.   NOT REQUIRED for international students and Chinese nationals at NYU Shanghai.   You must list &quot;New York University&quot; as a recipient and include our federal school code number 002785 when completing your FAFSA.     Do not wait until your taxes are done before submitting the FAFSA. Although it is better to do your taxes early, it is acceptable to use estimates of your income when you initially file the FAFSA. You can make corrections later on the FAFSA website.     YOUR FAFSA PIN:  Students and parents of dependent students may use a PIN (Personal Identification Number) to sign the FAFSA electronically and avoid the need to print and mail a signature page. The PIN can be used each year to apply for federal student aid and to review your record online at the U.S. Department of Education. Get your Federal Student Aid PIN at www.pin.ed.gov .   FAFSA priority deadlines for Freshmen applicants:         Early and Regular Decision: February 15 (midnight EST)        FAFSA priority deadlines for Transfer applicants:         Fall/Summer Admission: April 1 (midnight EDT)    Spring Admission: November 1 (midnight EDT)           2. College Scholarship Service Financial Aid PROFILE   The CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE application is administered by the College Scholarship Service (the financial aid division of The College Board) and collects information used by many private universities to award institutional (non-government) financial aid funds.   The CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE can be submitted in the fall as early as October 1 , but not later than February 15 (midnight EST).       Click here to begin and submit the CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE .   REQUIRED the first year for new undergraduate U.S. citizens and eligible non-citizens applying to NYU New York campus who wish to be considered for institutional (non-government) financial aid funds.   NOT REQUIRED for U.S. citizen and eligible non-citizen returning undergraduate students, transfer students, and graduate students at NYU New York campus, or adult students applying to The Paul McGhee Division at the NYU School of Continuing and Professional Studies, New York campus.   REQUIRED every year for international students at NYU New York campus who wish to be considered for institutional (non-government) financial aid funds.   REQUIRED every year for all students at NYU Abu Dhabi who wish to be considered for institutional (non-government) financial aid funds. (NOTE: it is not required for Emirati nationals, who will be automatically evaluated for Exceptional Emirati Scholarship upon acceptance.)   REQUIRED every year for international (not US, not Chinese nationals) students at NYU Shanghai who wish to be considered for institutional (non-government) financial aid funds. (NOTE: it is not required for Chinese nationals who complete the Gaokao college entrance examination instead of the SAT college admission test).   You must list &quot;New York University&quot; as a recipient and include our CSS school code number 2785 when completing your CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE.   Do not wait until your taxes are done before submitting the PROFILE. Although it is better to do your taxes early, it is acceptable to use estimates of your income when you initially file the PROFILE.   NYU does not participate in the CSS IDOC program.   CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE Help: telephone 305-829-9793.     CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE priority deadlines for Freshmen applicants:         Early Decision I: November 15 (midnight EST)    Early Decision II: January 15 (midnight EST)    Regular Decision: February 15 (midnight EST)        College Scholarship Service Noncustodial PROFILE     The CSS Noncustodial PROFILE is also required, if applicable;     Students who have families with separated, divorced, or single parents must also complete the Non-Custodial Parent form, which complements the CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE. NYU requires noncustodial parents to report their income, assets and other information as part of the financial aid application process to assess an applicant\u2019s eligibility for scholarship or other types of aid.   Providing such information does not necessarily mean that the student\u2019s noncustodial parent will be expected or required to contribute to educational costs.   Under certain circumstances NYU will consider waiving the requirement for the CSS Noncustodial PROFILE in the event the information cannot be obtained. Please see the CSS Noncustodial PROFILE Waiver Request form available (October to February) on the Applications and Forms menu in the column at right.   If the CSS Noncustodial PROFILE is required but not submitted, and NYU does not grant the applicant a waiver of this requirement, the student will not be considered for need-based NYU scholarship or grant funds. Please note that this is important because the amount of scholarship a student receives in their first year at NYU is typically the amount they will continue to receive each year if they remain otherwise eligible. Thus, if a student does not receive any NYU grant or scholarship in their freshman year they will likely not receive any in subsequent years. Failing to submit the CSS Noncustodial PROFILE (or the waiver request) for the first year can therefore affect eligibility in future years.     CSS Noncustodial PROFILE priority deadlines for Freshmen applicants:           Early Decision I: November 20 (midnight EST)    Early Decision II: January 20 (midnight EST)    Regular Decision: February 20 (midnight EST)        Please note that the deadlines for the CSS Noncustodial PROFILE application occur 5 days after the corresponding deadlines for the CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE application to allow additional time to provide the information required.             3. NYS Tuition Assistance Program (TAP)   In addition to the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA), New York State residents must also submit an application for the New York State Tuition Assistance Program (TAP). TAP grants are available to qualified students attending New York University.    Start the TAP application process by completing the FAFSA at http://www.fafsa.gov/ . New York State will use your FAFSA information as part of your application for TAP; you can link to the online TAP application directly from the FAFSA on the Web confirmation page.    You will be asked to establish a PIN (Personal Identification Number) for TAP. The TAP PIN will allow you complete your application online, keep track of your application information, or make changes later. Information from your FAFSA and your family's calculated NYS net taxable income will be pre-filled on your TAP on the Web application. Follow the instructions provided.       You must list &quot;New York University&quot; as a recipient and include our state school code number 0555 when completing your TAP application.     If you choose not to apply online, an Express TAP Application (ETA) will be mailed to you by the New York State Higher Education Services Corporation (HESC). Information from your FAFSA and your family's calculated NYS net taxable income will be pre-printed on your ETA. Review this information, change any incorrect items, complete any missing items, then SIGN AND MAIL THE FORM USING THE RETURN ENVELOPE.    If you provide an e-mail address on your FAFSA, HESC will use that address to contact you about your TAP application, give you processing updates, or award information. Please respond to any requests or instructions sent by HESC. If you have submitted applications, you can check the status of your TAP at any time.    If you have already received TAP, you must renew your grant each year by returning to TAP on the Web (via the online FAFSA process) to review and confirm your HESC data. You must submit the FAFSA for each academic year to continue your TAP eligibility. Based upon the data reported on your FAFSA, you will receive confirmation from HESC about your grant eligibility and award. Be sure to verify that all information is accurate, and submit any necessary corrections immediately.                                                         Priority Dates and Deadlines   All students should apply for financial aid every year. Students who miss a financial aid priority deadline are still encouraged to file the FAFSA and will be considered for federal student aid if eligible, but funds become increasingly limited. If you have not applied, do so immediately . Remember, to meet the specified deadline your application, with all necessary signatures, must be received and validated by the processor and released to NYU by the date shown below for priority consideration.   Freshman Applicants: In order to be considered for NYU scholarship, you must complete all required applications by our deadlines . Please review the Applications and Forms section of this website to find out which applications are relevant to you. Late CSS Profile applications will not be accepted for scholarship consideration.

It may surprise you to learn that most full-time undergraduate students at New York University would not be able to pay their educational costs without financial assistance. These students are able to attend NYU only because they applied for and received financial aid.    While we believe that the primary responsibility for meeting college costs rests with the student and the family, New York University as well as the state and federal governments can help. Although NYU is not able to meet the full need of every student, by combining the various types of funds available we use every method possible to coordinate adequate resources to enable you to invest in a higher education at NYU.    If you believe you will need any amount of financial assistance to attend NYU, we strongly encourage you to apply for financial aid immediately.

They may take the form of University scholarships, federal or state grants, or outside scholarships.   For most undergraduates, eligibility for a merit-based and/or need-based scholarship is determined upon entrance to the University based on prior academic strengths and, if you apply for financial aid , your demonstrated financial need. Typically you will continue to receive for subsequent academic years the amount of scholarship you received for your first year (subject to the availability of funds), as long as the following criteria are met:       You are a full-time student (at least 12 points).   You applied for financial aid on time.   You are meeting the Satisfactory Academic Progress standards.   You have approximately the same amount of financial need that you had in prior years.       New York University Scholarships   Descriptions of University-Wide and School-Based scholarships at NYU for which you may qualify are provided in the Undergraduate Admissions area of the NYU website. All admitted undergraduate students are automatically considered for these programs based on academic merit. Except where noted, no separate application form is required.   Graduate students are usually offered scholarships for each separate academic year as determined by their individual schools within NYU.   Note: If your eligibility for any federal aid you receive is jeopardized for reasons other than financial need or academic merit (e.g. if you are in default on a federal loan, or if you did not respond to the University's requests for tax information and income verification ), then your NYU scholarship may also be affected.       Federal Grant Programs                                                  FEDERAL PELL GRANT                               The Federal Pell Grant Program provides assistance to undergraduate students who demonstrate financial need according to economic criteria and program requirements established by the federal government. To be eligible, you must enroll in a degree program and be matriculated for your first bachelor's degree. (You are not eligible if you have already completed a bachelor's degree.) An estimated award will be listed in your award package if we think you will be eligible. Your Student Aid Report (SAR) contains the official evaluation of your eligibility from the U.S. Department of Education. When you review your SAR, follow the instructions to make changes if necessary\u2014including updating your record to reflect actual tax figures if you used estimated data in order to meet the NYU application deadline\u2014and then save the final SAR for your records. You may also review and make changes to your SAR in the &quot;FAFSA Follow-up&quot; area of the FAFSA Web site .                                                              TEACHER EDUCATION ASSISTANCE FOR COLLEGE AND HIGHER EDUCATION (TEACH) GRANT (Steinhardt students only)                               Through the College Cost Reduction and Access Act of 2007, Congress created the Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grant Program that provides grants of up to $3,965* per year to students who intend to teach in a public or private elementary or secondary school that serves students from low-income families.     Be a U.S. citizen or eligible non-citizen.   Be enrolled as an undergraduate, post-baccalaureate, or graduate student in a postsecondary educational institution that has chosen to participate in the TEACH Grant Program.   Be enrolled in course work that is necessary to begin a career in teaching or plan to complete such course work. Such course work may include subject area courses (e.g., math courses for a student who intends to be a math teacher).   Meet certain academic achievement requirements (generally, scoring above the 75th percentile on a college admissions test or maintaining a cumulative GPA of at least 3.25).   Complete an online TEACH Grant Entrance Counseling session each eligible year.   Sign a TEACH Grant Agreement to Serve each eligible year.     * Per federal mandate, the maximum amount for TEACH Grant awards for academic year 2013-2014 (first disbursed on or after 10/1/13 and before 10/1/14) is $3,965. The maximum amount for TEACH Grant awards for academic year 2014-2015 (first disbursed on or after 10/1/14 and before 10/1/15) is $3,708.                                                              FEDERAL SUPPLEMENTAL EDUCATION OPPORTUNITY GRANTS (FSEOG)                               The FSEOG program is funded by the U.S. Department of Education and administered by New York University to provide assistance to students with exceptional financial need. All students who qualify are automatically considered for this grant. However, our funds from this program are very limited.                                                              VETERANS BENEFITS                               The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs offers education grant assistance to qualified U.S. military service members and their families.   &gt; more                        State Scholarship and Grant Programs   New York State offers a wide variety of grants and scholarships to residents, subject to the annual availability of funds. Although application is made directly to the state and grants are awarded by the state, the amount each student is expected to receive is estimated and taken into account by NYU when assembling the student's financial aid package.                                                  NEW YORK STATE TUITION ASSISTANCE PROGRAM (TAP)                               Legal residents of the state of New York who are enrolled in a full-time or part-time degree program may be eligible for awards under this program. The award varies, depending on income and tuition cost. A separate application is necessary. &gt; more                                                              AID FOR PART-TIME STUDY (APTS)                               A financial aid program to help New York State residents pursuing part-time undergraduate degree study offers awards in amounts of up to $2,000 per academic year. To be eligible, the student must have filed a FAFSA and demonstrate financial need, must not have exhausted their TAP eligibility, must be otherwise eligible for financial aid, and must be enrolled for 3 to 11 credit points per term. A separate application is necessary, and is available here .

Some students from outside New York State may qualify for funds from their own state scholarship programs that can be used at New York University. Contact your state financial aid agency (call 1-800-433-3243 to obtain contact information) to ask about program requirements and application procedures. When you receive an eligibility notice from your state program, you should submit it immediately to the NYU Office of Financial Aid.          Scholarships and Grants from Other Organizations   In addition to the sources of gift aid described above, you may also be eligible for a private scholarship or grant from an outside organization or agency. Some sources to explore are employers, unions, professional organizations, and community and special interest groups.   Many extensive scholarship search services are available free online, and a representative sample is included on the drop menu below. The scholarships and information presented by such services are not verified or endorsed by NYU. You must notify the Office of Financial Aid if you receive funds from any outside organization.

Outside scholarships are considered a financial aid resource and must be added to a student's financial aid award. The Office of Financial Aid first applies the outside scholarship to a student's unmet need that is not already covered by financial aid. In some cases, loans not based on financial need may be reduced (private loans, Federal Unsubsidized Loans, Federal PLUS Loans, Graduate PLUS). If the student's need is already met by need-based aid, then that aid is replaced with the outside scholarship. Need-based loans are first replaced. If the outside scholarship exceeds the loan amounts, work-study and need-based grants are the next to be replaced. In most cases it is not necessary to reduce an NYU scholarship. Total aid (including outside assistance) cannot exceed the cost of attendance.

ELIGIBILITY: Preferred consideration is given to the dependents and spouses of uniformed members of the Fire Department of the City of New York (FDNY), the New York Police Department (NYPD), the Port Authority Police Department (PAPD), and other emergency response workers who died at the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001. (The dependents of other victims of 9/11 are not eligible.) There is no New York State residency requirement. Students must apply and be admitted to a four-year undergraduate degree program at New York University under normal admission standards.    Transfer students from other undergraduate programs are also eligible.    Students in graduate, professional, non-degree, or non-credit programs are not eligible for these scholarships.    Students must maintain full-time matriculation during each semester in which they receive scholarship funds and they must maintain satisfactory academic progress to continue to be eligible. Students may receive scholarship funds for up to eight semesters at NYU.     HOW TO APPLY: Once admitted, eligible students must first submit the FAFSA and also apply for the New York State World Trade Center Memorial Scholarship . NYU scholarship funds will then be used to accommodate any remaining need, up to the full cost of education at New York University.     COSTS COVERED: Scholarship awards may be used to support tuition, registration fees, and room and board (for NYU housing only), but not health services or other activity and support fees.

Applicants to NYU's New York Campus   Domestic Students : Students who are U.S. citizens or eligible non-citizens and who wish to be considered for financial aid when applying for admission to NYU New York should complete:     The Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) (for new freshmen and continuing students, to be considered for federal financial aid).   The CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE (to be considered for institutional [non-government] financial aid). The CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE is required for new undergraduate domestic students applying for the 2015-2016 academic year who wish to be considered for institutional (non-government) financial aid funds. It is not required for transfer applicants, returning undergraduate students, graduate students, or adult students applying to The Paul McGhee Division at the NYU School of Continuing and Professional Studies.     The New York State Tuition Assistance Program (TAP) grant application, for New York State residents only.   Students seeking financial aid for summer courses must also complete a NYU Summer Aid Application (available from February through July, see the Applications and Forms menu in the column at right).     Admission to NYU New York is need-blind for domestic applicants, and financial support will be tailored for each individual family based upon the results of the FAFSA, PROFILE and TAP applications.   International Students : NYU offers limited financial support in the form of institutional grants/scholarships to international freshmen admitted to our New York campus beginning with the Fall 2013 term. Grants/scholarships will be based upon a combination of financial need and academic merit. Students who are not U.S. citizens or eligible non-citizens and who wish to be considered for institutional financial aid when applying for admission to the NYU New York campus should complete ONLY the CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE to be considered for institutional financial aid funds. International students cannot apply for financial support after they are admitted. Admission to NYU New York is need-aware for international applicants; New York University will consider a family's financial need as reported on the PROFILE when evaluating the student's application for admission.   New York Undocumented Students : Individuals applying for admission as an undocumented undergraduate student may be eligible for NYU scholarship funds. To be considered, please submit:     The CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE.   The Undocumented Student Financial Aid Application (available beginning in October, see the Applications and Forms menu at right).     Please read more information about New York Undocumented Students .   Applicants to NYU's Abu Dhabi Campus   Domestic and International students : All students, regardless of citizenship status (except Emirati nationals), who are applying for admission ONLY to NYU Abu Dhabi (that is, they do not wish to be considered for any other NYU campus) need to complete ONLY the CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE to be considered for institutional financial aid funds. (The CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE is not required for Emirati nationals, who will be automatically evaluated for Exceptional Emirati Scholarship upon acceptance.) International students cannot apply for financial support after they are admitted. Admission to NYU Abu Dhabi is need-blind for all applicants, and financial support will be tailored for each individual family based upon the results of the PROFILE. Students applying ONLY to NYU Abu Dhabi are not required to complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA).   For more information please see NYU Abu Dhabi Financial Support .   Applicants to NYU's Shanghai Campus   Domestic Students : Students who are U.S. citizens or eligible non-citizens and who wish to be considered for financial aid when applying for admission to NYU Shanghai should complete:     The Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) (to be considered for federal financial aid).

International Students and Chinese Nationals : Students who are not U.S. citizens or eligible non-citizens and who wish to be considered for financial aid when applying for admission to the NYU Shanghai campus should complete ONLY the CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE to be considered for institutional financial aid funds.

For more information please see Financial Aid at NYU Shanghai .              FAFSA, CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE and TAP     1. Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA)   Students must submit the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) to be considered for any federal financial aid funds. The FAFSA is a confidential fiinancial statement detailing information about your family\u2019s financial circumstances. When you have completed the form, you submit it directly to the U.S. Department of Education. Using a formula mandated by Congress, the U.S. Department of Education makes an evaluation of your family\u2019s financial strength and estimates the amount your family can contribute annually toward your educational expenses. The Department of Education then sends your family\u2019s financial information and its estimate of family contribution to each college you designate to receive the information. (NOTE TO DENTAL STUDENTS: College of Dentistry students seeking certain federal education loans for the health professions (e.g. the Health Professions Student Loan [HPSL] and Loans for Disadvantaged Students [LDS]) must include parents financial data on the FAFSA even if they are financially independent of their parents.)   The FAFSA is available each year beginning January 1, and should be completed as soon as possible, but not later than February 15 (midnight EST) for new freshmen , and not later than May 1 (midnight EDT) for most other students (see Financial Aid Application Priority Deadlines at column upper right for details). Students who miss the FAFSA priority deadline are still encouraged to apply and will be considered for federal student aid, if eligible, but funds become increasingly limited.   Graduate students should refer to their school or department for specific program deadlines.     Click here to begin and submit the FAFSA . Alternatively, you can complete the paper version, which may be found in your high school or college or by calling 1-800-4-FED-AID.   REQUIRED every year for U.S. citizen and eligible non-citizen undergraduate students, transfer students, and graduate students at NYU New York campus, and adult students applying to The Paul McGhee Division at the NYU School of Continuing and Professional Studies, New York campus.   REQUIRED every year for U.S. citizen and eligible non-citizen undergraduate students, transfer students, and graduate students at NYU Shanghai.     NOT REQUIRED for international students at NYU New York campus.   NOT REQUIRED for students at NYU Abu Dhabi.   NOT REQUIRED for international students and Chinese nationals at NYU Shanghai.   You must list &quot;New York University&quot; as a recipient and include our federal school code number 002785 when completing your FAFSA.     Do not wait until your taxes are done before submitting the FAFSA. Although it is better to do your taxes early, it is acceptable to use estimates of your income when you initially file the FAFSA. You can make corrections later on the FAFSA website.     YOUR FAFSA PIN:  Students and parents of dependent students may use a PIN (Personal Identification Number) to sign the FAFSA electronically and avoid the need to print and mail a signature page. The PIN can be used each year to apply for federal student aid and to review your record online at the U.S. Department of Education. Get your Federal Student Aid PIN at www.pin.ed.gov .   FAFSA priority deadlines for Freshmen applicants:         Early and Regular Decision: February 15 (midnight EST)        FAFSA priority deadlines for Transfer applicants:         Fall/Summer Admission: April 1 (midnight EDT)    Spring Admission: November 1 (midnight EDT)           2. College Scholarship Service Financial Aid PROFILE   The CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE application is administered by the College Scholarship Service (the financial aid division of The College Board) and collects information used by many private universities to award institutional (non-government) financial aid funds.   The CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE can be submitted in the fall as early as October 1 , but not later than February 15 (midnight EST).       Click here to begin and submit the CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE .   REQUIRED the first year for new undergraduate U.S. citizens and eligible non-citizens applying to NYU New York campus who wish to be considered for institutional (non-government) financial aid funds.   NOT REQUIRED for U.S. citizen and eligible non-citizen returning undergraduate students, transfer students, and graduate students at NYU New York campus, or adult students applying to The Paul McGhee Division at the NYU School of Continuing and Professional Studies, New York campus.   REQUIRED every year for international students at NYU New York campus who wish to be considered for institutional (non-government) financial aid funds.   REQUIRED every year for all students at NYU Abu Dhabi who wish to be considered for institutional (non-government) financial aid funds. (NOTE: it is not required for Emirati nationals, who will be automatically evaluated for Exceptional Emirati Scholarship upon acceptance.)   REQUIRED every year for international (not US, not Chinese nationals) students at NYU Shanghai who wish to be considered for institutional (non-government) financial aid funds. (NOTE: it is not required for Chinese nationals who complete the Gaokao college entrance examination instead of the SAT college admission test).   You must list &quot;New York University&quot; as a recipient and include our CSS school code number 2785 when completing your CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE.   Do not wait until your taxes are done before submitting the PROFILE. Although it is better to do your taxes early, it is acceptable to use estimates of your income when you initially file the PROFILE.   NYU does not participate in the CSS IDOC program.   CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE Help: telephone 305-829-9793.     CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE priority deadlines for Freshmen applicants:         Early Decision I: November 15 (midnight EST)    Early Decision II: January 15 (midnight EST)    Regular Decision: February 15 (midnight EST)        College Scholarship Service Noncustodial PROFILE     The CSS Noncustodial PROFILE is also required, if applicable;     Students who have families with separated, divorced, or single parents must also complete the Non-Custodial Parent form, which complements the CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE. NYU requires noncustodial parents to report their income, assets and other information as part of the financial aid application process to assess an applicant\u2019s eligibility for scholarship or other types of aid.   Providing such information does not necessarily mean that the student\u2019s noncustodial parent will be expected or required to contribute to educational costs.   Under certain circumstances NYU will consider waiving the requirement for the CSS Noncustodial PROFILE in the event the information cannot be obtained. Please see the CSS Noncustodial PROFILE Waiver Request form available (October to February) on the Applications and Forms menu in the column at right.   If the CSS Noncustodial PROFILE is required but not submitted, and NYU does not grant the applicant a waiver of this requirement, the student will not be considered for need-based NYU scholarship or grant funds. Please note that this is important because the amount of scholarship a student receives in their first year at NYU is typically the amount they will continue to receive each year if they remain otherwise eligible. Thus, if a student does not receive any NYU grant or scholarship in their freshman year they will likely not receive any in subsequent years. Failing to submit the CSS Noncustodial PROFILE (or the waiver request) for the first year can therefore affect eligibility in future years.     CSS Noncustodial PROFILE priority deadlines for Freshmen applicants:           Early Decision I: November 20 (midnight EST)    Early Decision II: January 20 (midnight EST)    Regular Decision: February 20 (midnight EST)        Please note that the deadlines for the CSS Noncustodial PROFILE application occur 5 days after the corresponding deadlines for the CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE application to allow additional time to provide the information required.             3. NYS Tuition Assistance Program (TAP)   In addition to the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA), New York State residents must also submit an application for the New York State Tuition Assistance Program (TAP). TAP grants are available to qualified students attending New York University.    Start the TAP application process by completing the FAFSA at http://www.fafsa.gov/ . New York State will use your FAFSA information as part of your application for TAP; you can link to the online TAP application directly from the FAFSA on the Web confirmation page.    You will be asked to establish a PIN (Personal Identification Number) for TAP. The TAP PIN will allow you complete your application online, keep track of your application information, or make changes later. Information from your FAFSA and your family's calculated NYS net taxable income will be pre-filled on your TAP on the Web application. Follow the instructions provided.       You must list &quot;New York University&quot; as a recipient and include our state school code number 0555 when completing your TAP application.     If you choose not to apply online, an Express TAP Application (ETA) will be mailed to you by the New York State Higher Education Services Corporation (HESC). Information from your FAFSA and your family's calculated NYS net taxable income will be pre-printed on your ETA. Review this information, change any incorrect items, complete any missing items, then SIGN AND MAIL THE FORM USING THE RETURN ENVELOPE.    If you provide an e-mail address on your FAFSA, HESC will use that address to contact you about your TAP application, give you processing updates, or award information. Please respond to any requests or instructions sent by HESC. If you have submitted applications, you can check the status of your TAP at any time.    If you have already received TAP, you must renew your grant each year by returning to TAP on the Web (via the online FAFSA process) to review and confirm your HESC data. You must submit the FAFSA for each academic year to continue your TAP eligibility. Based upon the data reported on your FAFSA, you will receive confirmation from HESC about your grant eligibility and award. Be sure to verify that all information is accurate, and submit any necessary corrections immediately.                                                         Priority Dates and Deadlines   All students should apply for financial aid every year. Students who miss a financial aid priority deadline are still encouraged to file the FAFSA and will be considered for federal student aid if eligible, but funds become increasingly limited. If you have not applied, do so immediately . Remember, to meet the specified deadline your application, with all necessary signatures, must be received and validated by the processor and released to NYU by the date shown below for priority consideration.   Freshman Applicants: In order to be considered for NYU scholarship, you must complete all required applications by our deadlines . Please review the Applications and Forms section of this website to find out which applications are relevant to you. Late CSS Profile applications will not be accepted for scholarship consideration.

It may surprise you to learn that most full-time undergraduate students at New York University would not be able to pay their educational costs without financial assistance. These students are able to attend NYU only because they applied for and received financial aid.    While we believe that the primary responsibility for meeting college costs rests with the student and the family, New York University as well as the state and federal governments can help. Although NYU is not able to meet the full need of every student, by combining the various types of funds available we use every method possible to coordinate adequate resources to enable you to invest in a higher education at NYU.    If you believe you will need any amount of financial assistance to attend NYU, we strongly encourage you to apply for financial aid immediately.

They may take the form of University scholarships, federal or state grants, or outside scholarships.   For most undergraduates, eligibility for a merit-based and/or need-based scholarship is determined upon entrance to the University based on prior academic strengths and, if you apply for financial aid , your demonstrated financial need. Typically you will continue to receive for subsequent academic years the amount of scholarship you received for your first year (subject to the availability of funds), as long as the following criteria are met:       You are a full-time student (at least 12 points).   You applied for financial aid on time.   You are meeting the Satisfactory Academic Progress standards.   You have approximately the same amount of financial need that you had in prior years.       New York University Scholarships   Descriptions of University-Wide and School-Based scholarships at NYU for which you may qualify are provided in the Undergraduate Admissions area of the NYU website. All admitted undergraduate students are automatically considered for these programs based on academic merit. Except where noted, no separate application form is required.   Graduate students are usually offered scholarships for each separate academic year as determined by their individual schools within NYU.   Note: If your eligibility for any federal aid you receive is jeopardized for reasons other than financial need or academic merit (e.g. if you are in default on a federal loan, or if you did not respond to the University's requests for tax information and income verification ), then your NYU scholarship may also be affected.       Federal Grant Programs                                                  FEDERAL PELL GRANT                               The Federal Pell Grant Program provides assistance to undergraduate students who demonstrate financial need according to economic criteria and program requirements established by the federal government. To be eligible, you must enroll in a degree program and be matriculated for your first bachelor's degree. (You are not eligible if you have already completed a bachelor's degree.) An estimated award will be listed in your award package if we think you will be eligible. Your Student Aid Report (SAR) contains the official evaluation of your eligibility from the U.S. Department of Education. When you review your SAR, follow the instructions to make changes if necessary\u2014including updating your record to reflect actual tax figures if you used estimated data in order to meet the NYU application deadline\u2014and then save the final SAR for your records. You may also review and make changes to your SAR in the &quot;FAFSA Follow-up&quot; area of the FAFSA Web site .                                                              TEACHER EDUCATION ASSISTANCE FOR COLLEGE AND HIGHER EDUCATION (TEACH) GRANT (Steinhardt students only)                               Through the College Cost Reduction and Access Act of 2007, Congress created the Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grant Program that provides grants of up to $3,965* per year to students who intend to teach in a public or private elementary or secondary school that serves students from low-income families.     Be a U.S. citizen or eligible non-citizen.   Be enrolled as an undergraduate, post-baccalaureate, or graduate student in a postsecondary educational institution that has chosen to participate in the TEACH Grant Program.   Be enrolled in course work that is necessary to begin a career in teaching or plan to complete such course work. Such course work may include subject area courses (e.g., math courses for a student who intends to be a math teacher).   Meet certain academic achievement requirements (generally, scoring above the 75th percentile on a college admissions test or maintaining a cumulative GPA of at least 3.25).   Complete an online TEACH Grant Entrance Counseling session each eligible year.   Sign a TEACH Grant Agreement to Serve each eligible year.     * Per federal mandate, the maximum amount for TEACH Grant awards for academic year 2013-2014 (first disbursed on or after 10/1/13 and before 10/1/14) is $3,965. The maximum amount for TEACH Grant awards for academic year 2014-2015 (first disbursed on or after 10/1/14 and before 10/1/15) is $3,708.                                                              FEDERAL SUPPLEMENTAL EDUCATION OPPORTUNITY GRANTS (FSEOG)                               The FSEOG program is funded by the U.S. Department of Education and administered by New York University to provide assistance to students with exceptional financial need. All students who qualify are automatically considered for this grant. However, our funds from this program are very limited.                                                              VETERANS BENEFITS                               The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs offers education grant assistance to qualified U.S. military service members and their families.   &gt; more                        State Scholarship and Grant Programs   New York State offers a wide variety of grants and scholarships to residents, subject to the annual availability of funds. Although application is made directly to the state and grants are awarded by the state, the amount each student is expected to receive is estimated and taken into account by NYU when assembling the student's financial aid package.                                                  NEW YORK STATE TUITION ASSISTANCE PROGRAM (TAP)                               Legal residents of the state of New York who are enrolled in a full-time or part-time degree program may be eligible for awards under this program. The award varies, depending on income and tuition cost. A separate application is necessary. &gt; more                                                              AID FOR PART-TIME STUDY (APTS)                               A financial aid program to help New York State residents pursuing part-time undergraduate degree study offers awards in amounts of up to $2,000 per academic year. To be eligible, the student must have filed a FAFSA and demonstrate financial need, must not have exhausted their TAP eligibility, must be otherwise eligible for financial aid, and must be enrolled for 3 to 11 credit points per term. A separate application is necessary, and is available here .

Some students from outside New York State may qualify for funds from their own state scholarship programs that can be used at New York University. Contact your state financial aid agency (call 1-800-433-3243 to obtain contact information) to ask about program requirements and application procedures. When you receive an eligibility notice from your state program, you should submit it immediately to the NYU Office of Financial Aid.          Scholarships and Grants from Other Organizations   In addition to the sources of gift aid described above, you may also be eligible for a private scholarship or grant from an outside organization or agency. Some sources to explore are employers, unions, professional organizations, and community and special interest groups.   Many extensive scholarship search services are available free online, and a representative sample is included on the drop menu below. The scholarships and information presented by such services are not verified or endorsed by NYU. You must notify the Office of Financial Aid if you receive funds from any outside organization.

Outside scholarships are considered a financial aid resource and must be added to a student's financial aid award. The Office of Financial Aid first applies the outside scholarship to a student's unmet need that is not already covered by financial aid. In some cases, loans not based on financial need may be reduced (private loans, Federal Unsubsidized Loans, Federal PLUS Loans, Graduate PLUS). If the student's need is already met by need-based aid, then that aid is replaced with the outside scholarship. Need-based loans are first replaced. If the outside scholarship exceeds the loan amounts, work-study and need-based grants are the next to be replaced. In most cases it is not necessary to reduce an NYU scholarship. Total aid (including outside assistance) cannot exceed the cost of attendance.

ELIGIBILITY: Preferred consideration is given to the dependents and spouses of uniformed members of the Fire Department of the City of New York (FDNY), the New York Police Department (NYPD), the Port Authority Police Department (PAPD), and other emergency response workers who died at the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001. (The dependents of other victims of 9/11 are not eligible.) There is no New York State residency requirement. Students must apply and be admitted to a four-year undergraduate degree program at New York University under normal admission standards.    Transfer students from other undergraduate programs are also eligible.    Students in graduate, professional, non-degree, or non-credit programs are not eligible for these scholarships.    Students must maintain full-time matriculation during each semester in which they receive scholarship funds and they must maintain satisfactory academic progress to continue to be eligible. Students may receive scholarship funds for up to eight semesters at NYU.     HOW TO APPLY: Once admitted, eligible students must first submit the FAFSA and also apply for the New York State World Trade Center Memorial Scholarship . NYU scholarship funds will then be used to accommodate any remaining need, up to the full cost of education at New York University.     COSTS COVERED: Scholarship awards may be used to support tuition, registration fees, and room and board (for NYU housing only), but not health services or other activity and support fees.

Although merit-based scholarships are available, NYU is committed to using the vast majority of its scholarship funds to assist students whose families are unable to pay the full cost of an NYU education. All students are automatically considered, and there is no separate application necessary for NYU scholarships.     more about scholarships and grants              Loans Available: Federal and Private   A financial aid package at NYU may suggest several types of loans for which a student is eligible, based on certain criteria (such as anticipated points/credits, housing status, financial need, etc.) and, for campus-administered loans, the availability of funds.   Some federal loan programs, such as the Perkins Loan, Health Professions Student Loan, and Nursing Loan, allocate limited funds to New York University for campus-based disbursement and administration of the loans. NYU will require you to complete a promissory note to ensure appropriate loan disbursement and corresponding credit on your Bursar bill. You should carefully read the instructions and complete the signing process on NYU Albert . You will not receive credit on your bursar's bill if you do not sign your promissory note.   Other federal loans are secured and disbursed to the student in cooperation with the U.S. Department of Education. Your award package may include information about a &quot;suggested loan.&quot; This means that you are eligible for the type and amount of loan specified, based upon the information we have about you at the time the award is offered. It does not mean you will automatically receive the loan, but rather informs you of your current eligibility and how to apply. The suggested loan amount in your award package is the maximum you are eligible for and is the amount that NYU has certified for you. If you wish to borrow an amount lower than suggested, please contact the Office of Financial Aid for instructions.   A variety of additional, private (non-federal) alternative loans are also available from individual lending institutions.   Please think carefully about your obligations as a borrower before pursuing any educational loan. Consider your educational investment at NYU, as well as your long-term financial commitments when borrowing.

The Federal Perkins Loan is a low interest rate loan made to qualifying NYU students who demonstrate financial need. New York University is your lender for a Perkins Loan. You are considered for a Federal Perkins Loan automatically; however, once you have been offered the loan, you must sign and return a promissory note to receive it. The appropriate credit will be applied to your account at the Office of the Bursar.   A signed Master Promissory Note (MPN) is required only once and remains valid for up to 10 years. Students are required to complete a Truth in Lending Statement and a Statement of Rights and Responsibilities each year as their eligibility is renewed. If you are eligible for a Perkins Loan, your award package will indicate the amount. Please note that if you decide not to accept the loan, your eligibility for Perkins will be canceled in subsequent years.   You must begin to repay your loan once you graduate, leave school, or drop below half-time enrollment status. You are allowed a grace period before beginning repayment. If you are a new borrower, you have 9 months before interest begins to accrue on your loan and 12 months before your first payment is due.          Federal Nursing Student Loan   The federally funded Nursing Student Loan may be offered to students who demonstrate financial need and enroll at least half-time in the College of Nursing. The annual interest rate is 5 percent, and interest does not accrue while the student remains enrolled at least half-time in a nursing program.              Health Professions Student Loan Program   The Health Professions Student Loan Program provides long-term, low-interest loans to   students at the College of Dentistry who demonstrate \ufb01nancial need. The annual interest rate   is currently 5 percent, and interest does not accrue while the student remains enrolled as a   full-time student at a school eligible to participate in the health professions program.               Private (Non-Federal) Alternative Loans   NYU students should apply for all eligible financial assistance available before considering a private, alternative loan. Private loan interest rates, terms, conditions and eligibility requirements will vary, and the borrower (and co-borrower, if applicable) should first compare a variety of private student loans offered by banks and other education loan providers and apply only for the alternative loan that best suits their needs.   Please think carefully about your obligations as a borrower before pursuing any educational loan. Consider your educational investment at NYU, as well as your long-term financial commitments when borrowing.       more about private loans                                   Frequently Asked Questions Find what you're looking for (and much more) in our responses to regular inquiries from students and families. Read More             Student Employment   Most financial aid award packages include work-study. This means that you are eligible to participate in the Federal Work-Study Program, and may earn up to the amount recommended in your package. Federal Work-Study jobs, generally averaging from 15 to 20 hours per week, are secured through The Wasserman Center for Career Development , located at 133 East 13th Street. Positions in various on-campus departments and organizations are available (though not guaranteed).   Important Notice: Work-Study earnings are not credited on your Bursar bill, but are paid directly to the student on a bi-weekly basis. Money earned from employment is normally used for books, transportation, and personal expenses.   Work-Study is not available at all Study Away locations.   Students are not required to meet their earnings expectation through the Federal Work-Study Program, and may choose not to accept Federal Work-Study and seek instead employment in an on-campus or off-campus job in which wages are paid entirely by the employer's budget.   New York University provides a wide range of employment opportunities for students, and all are encouraged to take advantage of the placement services (including summer jobs) offered by The Wasserman Center for Career Development. Students may use the center immediately upon payment of their tuition deposit.   Important information for graduate students :  Graduate assistantships are available in some schools. Graduate assistantships and teaching fellowships provide tuition remission and a stipend. Duties include teaching, research, and other activities related to departmental needs. All applicants for assistantships, whether or not other types of financial aid are requested, should contact their department directly for information, instructions, and applications. A graduate assistantship may affect eligibility for some forms of financial aid. Please contact the Office of Financial Aid, as well as your department, if your award package does not indicate your assistantship. Work-Study is not awarded during the Summer Sessions, however there are still jobs available during that time.               Study Away   Financial aid for the NYU Study Away Program comes in many forms. Scholarships are available to many students who are approved for the program, based on financial need, academic merit, or both. Also, most federal and New York State need-based financial aid can be applied to study away, and additional assistance may be available to students demonstrating further need.* NYU students who participate in Study Away remain matriculated at NYU, pay NYU tuition, and receive financial aid just as they would if attending classes at Washington Square.   Students who attend a foreign university not directly affiliated with NYU must complete and sign a consortium agreement (which arranges NYU financial aid payments to the hosting university) and must confirm in advance their eligibility to transfer course credit(s) to an NYU degree program.   Students not enrolled at NYU who apply to the Study Away program will use financial aid awarded from their home institution, and should visit their financial aid office and ask to have a consortium agreement established with the NYU Financial Aid Office.   * Global Pathways Scholarship  All admitted Study Away undergraduate students applying for financial aid will be automatically evaluated for an additional need-based award: the Global Pathways Scholarship will add up to $4,000 per semester (depending on demonstrated need) to cover the additional costs of studying away. Students will receive an award notification beginning in June (for fall semester) and in November (for spring semester).

(And what is \"Work-Study\"?)                                                          Go to Student Employment                                                                                                                                                                            I have financial aid now, but what about next year? Is it necessary to apply again?                                                       Yes, you must apply every year by submitting the FAFSA to determine and renew your financial aid (including NYU scholarships).   Each year the U.S. Department of Education will send to you a renewal reminder containing important information about your Federal Student Aid PIN and the FAFSA application process. (If you included a valid e-mail address on your FAFSA last year, you will receive the reminder by e-mail. Otherwise it will be mailed to your permanent address.) You will need your Federal Student Aid PIN to access your pre-filled FAFSA on the Web application that contains much of your application data from last year.   Visit the PIN web site at www.pin.ed.gov to verify your existing PIN, to request a duplicate if you have forgotten your PIN, or to request a new PIN if you (and your parents, if applicable) don't have one. (You use the same PIN each year, so you probably have one already).   It is possible to submit the FAFSA online without a PIN, but you must provide answers to all questions on a new FAFSA and you must print, sign, and mail the signature page after you submit the application, which will slow the process.   After January 1 but not later than May 1, access your FAFSA on the FAFSA website and revise the information to reflect your income for the preceding year (and other information only if it has changed), then submit the application. Be sure that you specify NYU (federal school code 002785) as the recipient of your information.   You should receive your Student Aid Report (SAR) within a few weeks after submitting the FAFSA. Call 1-800-4-FED-AID (1-800-433-3243) if you don't receive it. You may also view your SAR on the FAFSA website and make changes if necessary.   If you apply correctly and on time you can expect your NYU financial aid award notification by mid June (for returning undergraduates), describing your aid package for the next academic year.   Remember that the FAFSA and all necessary signatures must be received and validated by the processor and released to NYU no later than May 1 (not postmarked May 1), or the department deadline specified by your NYU school, if different. If you delay, a loss of aid could result. Remember, you must apply each year to renew your financial aid. May 1 is the priority deadline for most schools at NYU. Applying late could make you ineligible for certain types of aid, and funds become more limited. If you submitted a FAFSA last year and received an NYU scholarship, you should submit the FAFSA again each year by the NYU deadline to ensure normal processing.   TAP GRANT:   If you are a New York resident and received a state TAP grant, you must renew your grant award for next year to ensure credit for TAP on your Bursar bill. Click here for more information about the TAP application process.   CSS/FINANCIAL AID PROFILE:   The CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE is NOT REQUIRED for U.S. citizen and eligible non-citizen returning undergraduate students, transfer students, and graduate students at NYU New York campus, or adult students applying to The Paul McGhee Division at the NYU School of Continuing and Professional Studies, New York campus.     The CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE is REQUIRED every year for international students at NYU New York campus.     The CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE is REQUIRED every year for all students at NYU Abu Dhabi. (NOTE: it is not required for Emirati nationals, who will be automatically evaluated for Exceptional Emirati Scholarship upon acceptance.)     The CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE is REQUIRED every year for all students at NYU Shanghai. (NOTE: it is not required for Chinese nationals who complete the Gaokao college entrance examination instead of the SAT college admission test).                                                                                                                                                                        How do I get more financial aid?                                                       Review your FAFSA   Most student aid is based upon financial need, which is determined by the results of your FAFSA. The first step you should take is to ensure that the information you submitted on your FAFSA is correct. If your initial submission contained errors, you should correct your data on the FAFSA website at www.fafsa.gov . If your original data was correct when first submitted but your financial circumstances have changed since you filed the FAFSA, then, depending upon your situation, you may be eligible for review through a process called Professional Judgment. This process allows a financial aid administrator, under specific circumstances, to review your FAFSA eligibility based on new documentation, which will possibly change your eligibility for federal student aid. To determine if you are eligible, you should complete and submit the Professional Judgment Worksheet, available on our Applications and Forms menu . We will review your circumstances and notify you about opportunities for additional grants, federal loans, and alternative loans.   Change in Eligibility Increase   If you have enrolled for additional credit points and your tuition and/or fees have increased, if your housing status has changed (i.e. &quot;off campus&quot; vs. &quot;on campus&quot;), or if your grade level has changed, then your eligibility for federal loans (and possibly other types of student aid) may be reevaluated. Contact the Office of Financial Aid or send an e-mail message to explain your status change at NYU and to request that your aid be reviewed and/or your federal loan amount be increased if you are deemed eligible. If so, we will certify the additional amount(s) and send you a revised financial aid award notification. (Please note that annual and aggregate maximum borrowing limits apply to the Federal Stafford Loan .)   This change may also affect your eligibility for private student loans. Once you have maximized your federal loan eligibility then you may apply for additional private loan amounts to meet the cost of attendance. (See our information about Private Loans .) Once we have received approval from your lender, the Office of Financial Aid will certify the private loan and then notify you accordingly.   Individual Budget Appeal   If you find that your miscellaneous education-related expenses for the academic year (e.g. books and supplies, computer equipment, etc.) will exceed those projected in NYU's estimated budget for your total cost of attendance (see Tuition, Fees, and Expenses ), please submit the Budget Appeal form, also available on our Applications and Forms menu.   General Scholarship Increase Request   Returning undergraduate students who have submitted their FAFSA and wish to increase or add scholarship funding to their financial aid package may do so via the annual appeal process. During appeal season, our online Appeal Form for Returning Undergraduates is available on the Applications and Forms menu. Students must meet the specified appeal deadline and include an explanation of why they are seeking additional funding. Appeal results are typically based on financial need and academic performance. The amount of appeal funds available varies each year, and individual NYU schools work closely with the Office of Financial Aid throughout the process to make the appeal determination.   NYU graduate students should consult with the admissions/financial aid representative in their school or program department (see &quot;School Financial Aid Contacts&quot; on our alphabetical list of References and Resources .   Conclusion   Regardless of your status, we strongly encourage all students to explore the many private scholarships available.   You also may find NYU Payment Plans to be helpful. Although they are not a form of financial aid, NYU Payment Plans provide a good way to budget and plan your payments for each semester.                                                                                                                                                                        I will attend NYU in the summer. Is there any student aid available then?                                                       Usually yes. To be considered for ANY type of financial aid in the summer you must submit the NYU Summer Financial Aid Application, which is available on our Applications and Forms menu beginning in February. A Summer Financial Aid Application is also available for visiting non-NYU students.                                                                                                                                                                          I will enroll in a January Term course. Is financial aid available?                                                       NYU Undergraduate Students :   NYU New York undergraduates enrolling for January Term either in New York or at an NYU Study Away site will automatically be reviewed for additional scholarship eligibility. No application is needed. The review will be based upon financial need and the number of credits the student is enrolled for in January. The amount of scholarship awarded will be proportional to the amount of tuition the students' scholarship covered during an academic year semester. Students will be reviewed within a week after they register and will be notified via Albert accordingly. Students who do not have scholarship during the academic year are not eligible for January Term scholarship consideration.   Students needing additional financial aid for January Term will be able to seek out alternative loans, as additional federal loans are not available. Students seeking alternative loans are encouraged to relay to their potential lender the number of credits they will be taking, as some have minimum enrollment criteria. Private loan eligibility cannot exceed the cost of attendance for January term minus any other aid students may receive for the term. NYU cannot recommend or endorse any particular private lender. Students are encouraged to research their options carefully.   Students who change January Term enrollment or who do not attend in January will have their January award adjusted or cancelled.   NYU Graduate Students :   Generally, grants/scholarships are not available to NYU graduate students for the January Term, although graduate students should consult with their school's student services office or financial aid contact if they have questions.   Visiting non-NYU Students :   NYU grants/scholarships are not available to visiting non-NYU students for the January Term. However, visiting non-NYU students currently receiving federal financial aid at their home school may be able to apply a portion of it to their attendance at NYU by implementing a Consortium Agreement. Please consult with the financial aid office at your home school to determine if you can complete a Consortium Agreement for New York University.     In addition, visiting non-NYU students who are receiving institutional scholarship or grant funds from their home school while attending January Term at NYU must notify New York University.   Visiting non-NYU students will receive further information and instructions upon registration for January Term at NYU.   All students :   All students (NYU and visiting non-NYU) may apply for a private (non-federal) alternative loan for the January Term.                                                                                                                                                                        I have deferred my enrollment at NYU. How does this affect my financial aid?                                                         Go to Eligibility for Financial Aid: Deferred Enrollment                                                                                                                                                                            I will graduate at the end of the fall semester. Can I have aid awarded for the following spring semester applied to my fall account?                                                       No.   Most financial aid, such as Federal Direct Loans, Federal Direct PLUS Loans, TAP, Pell Grant, Perkins Loan, and NYU scholarship, is based on full academic year attendance, so if you are enrolled for one semester only, you will be awarded the appropriate portion for which you are eligible.                                                                                                                                                                        My grade level will advance in the spring. Will I be eligible for more financial aid once I become a Sophomore/Junior/Senior?                                                       You might be eligible for more Federal Subsidized or Federal Unsubsidized Loans. Once your grades have been posted on the Student Information System after the fall semester, if your grade level has increased from a Freshman level to a Sophomore level (32 points earned), or has changed from the Sophomore level to a Junior level (64 points earned) you may be eligible for more Federal Subsidized Loan or Federal Unsubsidized Loan. If you would like your eligibility for a loan increase to be reviewed, send an e-mail message to the Office of Financial Aid from your NYU email account with your specific request. If you are eligible, the loan amount will be increased and you will receive a notice to log on the Student Center and accept that amount. A new loan application is not required. Funds will be disbursed to your Bursar account in accordance with federal disbursement schedules. Also, please note that the increase could affect your loan eligibility for the upcoming summer if you plan to attend and receive federal loans in the summer.                                                                                                                                                                        I am an Undergraduate student considering an internal transfer to another NYU school in the spring. How will my financial aid be affected?                                                       In most cases the amount of financial aid you receive will not be affected. If your total credit points, your housing status, and your financial aid application information is the same as it was for the fall semester, the amount of financial aid you receive should remain the same.   PLEASE NOTE:     Departmental scholarships are not transferable to another school.   School of Continuing and Professional Studies (SCPS) students enrolled full-time in the General Studies Program, McGhee Division, the Hotel and Tourism Management Program, or the Recreation and Leisure Studies Program may transfer to another undergraduate school at NYU without affecting their financial aid.     If you are uncertain of your status, send an e-mail message to the Office of Financial Aid.                                                                                                                                                                        Who do I speak to about a question or problem with my bill?                                                       Billing transactions and associated student account issues are administered by the NYU Office of the Bursar .    See also NYU Albert to view your billing information record, including financial aid credits.    If some financial aid items are not listed on your bill, please make sure you do not have any \u2018holds\u2019 listed on your account and you are registered for the appropriate number of credits Financial Aid has anticipated for you. Also, please be sure you have accepted the item you wanted on Albert, completed all the necessary paperwork and allow 3-5 business days for this to reflect on your Bursar account.    Keep in mind that you will not receive an updated bill until your scheduled billing date . However, current changes and adjustments are visible on NYU Albert .    It is important to note that in some cases the student aid information initially shown on Albert may not exactly match the official Financial Aid Awards you subsequently receive.                                                                                                                                                                         How do I apply for a loan?                                                         Go to Direct Loan Instructions .                                                                                                                                                                          What are alternative loans, and why would I apply for such a loan?                                                         Go to Private (Non-Federal) Alternative Loans .                                                                                                                                                                          I received a Sub/Unsub loan/Perkins Loan/PLUS Loan that I do not want. Do I have to sign the Promissory Note(s) for these loans?                                                       If you were offered ANY aid you do not wish to use, please \u2018decline\u2019 the aid on NYU Albert. This will remove the item from your \u2018To Do\u2019 List.   If you have received loan promissory note, and you do not wish to use the loan, you DO NOT have to sign the promissory note. Please disregard the loans promissory notes.                                                                                                                                                                        My student application for a Federal Graduate PLUS Loan has been denied. What now?                                                         If you are not initially approved for a Federal Graduate PLUS Loan, you will receive an endorser packet directly from the U.S. Department of Education. This packet explains that a PLUS Loan may still be acquired if someone else with an acceptable credit rating -- such as your spouse, a relative, or friend -- agrees to endorse or cosign the loan. Contact the Office of Financial Aid for further instructions.   Please note that if you receive the Federal Direct PLUS Loan based on a credit-worthy endorser, the PLUS Master Promissory Note (MPN) that you have completed will expire with that endorsed loan. A new PLUS MPN will be required for any subsequent PLUS Loan for which you apply.   Graduate students who are originally credit denied for a Direct PLUS Loan, but have obtained approval by appeal or endorser, are required to complete a new PLUS Loan Counseling session. The federal Department of Education will contact the borrower in these cases and direct them to studentloans.gov to complete PLUS Loan Counseling. Your PLUS Loan cannot disburse to your Bursar bill until you have completed the PLUS Loan Counseling.   The U.S. Department of Education does not inform the NYU Office of Financial Aid about the specific reason for the denial of a Federal PLUS Loan. If you feel that there are extenuating circumstances and you wish to appeal the credit denial, you must contact the Direct Loan Origination Center toll-free at 1-800-557-7394.                                                                                                                                                                          How long do federal Direct PLUS Loan credit decisions remain valid?                                                       Credit approval is valid for 90 days. Your credit is evaluated by Direct Loans every time you request a new loan unless you have had a credit decision within the preceding 90 days.                                                                                                                                                                        How can I consolidate my student loans?                                                         Go to References and Resources for information about Loan Consolidation, Loan Deferment, Loan Forgiveness, and Loan Repayment.                                                                                                                                                                          My parents don't support me and won't contribute to my education, so why am I still considered a \"dependent\" student?                                                       It's a federal definition.   There are basic requirements a student must meet to be considered an independent student (see The Guide to Federal Student Aid for criteria). If you do not meet these requirements but you still believe you are truly independent of your parents, you may appeal for a \"dependency override\" with our office. The example below describes the conditions of an acceptable override, but if your situation is different please bring it to our attention for review.   INVOLUNTARY DISSOLUTION OF FAMILY   To demonstrate the \"involuntary dissolution\" of your family you must present:     A letter written by you which states that you do not and cannot have contact with your parents and also explains what precipitated the dissolution of the family.   A letter from a third party (someone not related to you) stating that you do not and cannot have contact with your parents. The letter must be written by someone:     who is professional (preferably your social worker or case worker, a member of the clergy, or a lawyer who has been represented you in legal proceedings), and;   who has personal, first-hand knowledge of your familial situation.     A copy of your completed FAFSA, which must be submitted as if you were an independent student.     If you can provide the appropriate documentation, a dependency override will be considered for you and your financial aid award may be changed based upon an independent status. (Note that just because a student is considered \"independent\" does not necessarily mean a student's aid will increase.)                                                                                                                                                                        What academic standards must I maintain at NYU to be eligible for financial aid?                                                         Go to Satisfactory Academic Progress .                                                                                                                                                                          Why hasn't financial aid been credited on my Bursar bill?                                                       If no student aid of any kind has been deducted from your bill, chances are you did not submit the required financial aid applications , or, if you did, you may have applied later than NYU's priority deadline (see sidebar above right), which may have affected your aid eligibility. If you have already applied and received your Student Aid Report (SAR) from the federal processors, in most cases you should have received a notice from us to view your financial aid award on NYU Albert. Verify on NYU Albert that your FAFSA data has been &quot;received&quot; by us (it will be listed in your &quot;To Do&quot; list as received if it is truly received by NYU).   If your FAFSA information was received by NYU more than 3 weeks ago and you have not received a financial aid award, you should first refer to NYU Albert to see if there are any &quot;holds&quot; on your account. A hold on your account may delay your financial aid awards. If there is a hold, please rectify that situation. The delay could be caused by circumstances concerning your aid eligibility. For example, you may not be meeting the satisfactory academic progress standards required to maintain student aid, or further documents may be required from you before we are able to process your award. If there are no holds, and if your award still seems delayed, then contact the Office of Financial Aid . Our counselors can discuss details with you and estimate when you can expect an award.                                                                                                                                                                        I haven't yet applied, but my bill is due soon. I know processing takes several weeks from start to finish. Is there any type of interim aid I can have while I wait?                                                       There is no interim aid. Students often ask if they can take out private, non-federal loans while they wait for their financial aid application to be processed and their federal loans to be disbursed. Students are discouraged from pursuing this because it also takes a few weeks to receive alternative loans, and if you take out alternative loans in advance of your federal loans, you may inadvertently take out too much private loan, which you would then have to return. This can be costly. Or, if you didn't want to return the private loan funds your federal aid eligibility could be adversely affected. The best strategy is to apply for financial aid as soon as possible, and, in the interim, work out a payment plan with the Bursar. If you're eligible for financial aid and you've already made a payment to the Bursar, you will be refunded the amount of overpayment.                                                                                                                                                                         When can I expect my loan refund?                                                       Loan refunds are administered through the NYU Office of the Bursar , and there are important elements to consider if you are anticipating a credit balance. For example, because your loans can not be released to NYU before your designated disbursement date, and because once they are disbursed certain basic enrollment criteria must first be verified (e.g. you normally must be enrolled for at least 6 points) before the loan amount is applied to your account balance, a refund resulting from your student loan will usually not be confirmed and processed until a few days after your disbursement date.                                                                                                                                                                        My financial aid award was based on anticipated credits and housing status, but my plans have changed. What do I do?                                                       Contact the Office of Financial Aid if any of the conditions of your initial award has changed. Depending on the changes, your aid may or may not be affected, but it is always better to inform the Office of Financial Aid of your plans so adjustments can be made, if necessary, early in the semester. If you fail to inform the Office of Financial Aid, then any discrepancies that exist between your anticipated and actual registered credit points will appear during enrollment audit and adjustments will be made at that time. It is the obligation of the Office of Financial Aid to adjust aid according to University policy and federal regulations.                                                                                                                                                                        Why has my citizenship status been requested? What are the citizenship requirements for federal aid?                                                       Students may be required to verify their U.S. citizenship status to confirm eligibility for some federal grant programs, and non-citizens are subject to different regulations which may require supporting documentation, depending upon the type of financial aid sought.       Go to Citizenship Documentation                                                                                                                                                                            Is it too late to apply for aid now that NYU's priority deadline has passed? Is there any aid I can get while I'm waiting for my federal aid eligibility?                                                       You are strongly encouraged to apply for financial aid even if you missed the NYU priority deadline (see Financial Aid Deadlines in the column above right). You may not qualify for the same amounts or types of funds if you did not apply on time. However, there are still alternatives available. For example, you will likely be eligible for some form of federal loan, and possibly federal grants and Federal Work-Study.                                                                                                                                                                         I have been asked to provide verification of my financial aid eligibility. What now?                                                         Go to Verification                                                                                                                                                                            Does NYU have ROTC?                                                       NYU does not have an ROTC program on campus. However, NYU students can participate in ROTC through other schools in New York while attending NYU. An Army ROTC program is available at Fordham University and Air Force ROTC is available at Manhattan College.

Do I need to make an appointment to meet with a financial aid counselor?                                                       To best serve as many students as possible, we do not ordinarily schedule individual appointments (although an appointment can be arranged in an emergency). To meet with a financial aid counselor, please visit us any time during office hours.

There is some financial aid credited on my bill this semester, but I was also expecting other credits. What happened to my TAP Grant?                                                       If you are a New York State resident, submitted a FAFSA, and applied for TAP using either TAP on the Web or a printed Express TAP Application (ETA), you should have received a TAP award certificate from the New York State Higher Education Services Corporation (HESC) . Contact HESC at 1-888-NYS-HESC (1-888-697-4372) if more than a few weeks have passed without notification after submitting the FAFSA.   HESC will also advise the NYU Office of the Bursar about your eligibility. If you have received your TAP award certificate but credit has not yet been applied to your bill, write a note on the bill and pay the appropriate remaining balance.                                                                                                                                                                        There is some financial aid credited on my bill this semester, but I was also expecting other credits. What happened to my Pell Grant?                                                       To be eligible for a Pell Grant you must be an undergraduate, have not earned a prior degree, and have an Estimated Family Contribution (as calculated by the government) of $5,273 or less. If you were eligible for Pell last year, you may not be eligible this year \u2014 it can vary depending upon your family and your resources. If you think you are Pell eligible and you subsequently received a request from NYU for documents to verify your FAFSA data, your Pell Grant may not be applied to your bill until the verification review is complete. Use NYU Albert to see if you have any outstanding document requests (please check the To Do list). Also, if you changed your Student Aid Report (SAR) to update any information the changes could have affected your Pell eligibility.                                                                                                                                                                        There is some financial aid credited on my bill this semester, but I was also expecting other credits. What happened to my scholarship?                                                       If you filed a FAFSA last year and received a scholarship, but didn't submit the FAFSA again this year, your scholarship amount could be affected. Most scholarships at NYU are based on a combination of need and merit. Review the letter that you received from our office when you were initially awarded. If you have not already submitted the FAFSA and you need to, do so right away. Depending on the availability of funding, late filers may not get their full scholarship.                                                                                                                                                                        There is some financial aid credited on my bill this semester, but I was also expecting other credits. What happened to my Perkins Loan?                                                       If the federal processors received your FAFSA later than the March 1 deadline (see sidebar above right), you may not have been offered a Perkins Loan. There is a limited amount of federal Perkins funding available to New York University and we must give priority to those who apply on time.    There are a few other reasons why your loan may not be on your bill. On Albert you need to accept your Perkins loan and wait 1 day. After 1 day has passed you must then e-sign your MPN, and print, sign, and mail your Perkins Rights and Responsibilities/Entrance Interview and you Truth-in-Lending in order to receive credit for this loan. Credit will be posted to your Bursar account 24 to 48 hours after you have completed all these steps and after we have received the printed documents.                                                                                                                                                                         There is some financial aid credited on my bill this semester, but I was also expecting other credits. What happened to my Federal Stafford Loan and/or Federal PLUS Loan?                                                       Be sure that you have completed the acceptance process for the Federal Stafford Loan and/or the Federal PLUS Loan to ensure the proper disbursement of funds. If a Stafford and/or PLUS Loan amount was suggested on your financial aid award letter, follow the instructions to secure your loan(s) and then deduct the pending loan amount from your bill (minus the origination fee) and pay the remainder.                                                                                                                                                                        There is some financial aid credited on my bill this semester, but I was also expecting other credits. What happened to my Private Loans?                                                       Your private loan must be approved by the lender and certified by NYU before you will be given credit for that loan. If it has been approved since the date of your bill, simply deduct the semester portion of the approved loan from your bill.                                                                                                                                                                        There is some financial aid credited on my bill this semester, but I was also expecting other credits. What happened to my Federal Work-Study?                                                       Federal Work-Study is not credited on your bill because it represents a potential amount yet to be earned in bi-weekly paychecks during the year. If suggested Work-Study is included in your financial aid package, it means you are eligible to participate in the Federal Work-Study Program .

Frequently Asked Questions                                                                                                                            I just accepted my Direct Loan(s), but now I want to change the amount. How can I make changes to my loan amounts?                                                       Once you have accepted your Direct Loan amounts on NYU Albert you cannot make further changes online.

I have just been offered an increase or an additional Federal Direct Loan on my award letter. Do I have to complete all of the steps again?                                                       Each loan type (undergraduate/graduate Federal Direct Loan, Federal Direct Parent PLUS Loan and Graduate PLUS Loan) requires its own Master Promissory Note, or MPN, and Entrance Counseling (except Parent PLUS). So, if your increase is to an existing loan type you do NOT need to complete the MPN and Entrance Counseling again. However, you will still need to accept your increase on NYU Albert . If your increase or additional loan is a loan type you were not previously awarded, you WILL need to complete the MPN and Entrance Counseling (except Parent PLUS) in addition to accepting it on NYU Albert .                                                                                                                                                                        How/when do my Direct Loans get posted to my tuition account?                                                       Once you accept your loans on NYU Albert ,  sign your MPN, and complete Entrance Counseling, credit is then posted  to your account. The credit is provisional and does not change to real  credit until 10 days before the start of the loan period.                                                                                                                                                                        What if I want to return some loan funds after I have received a disbursement from Direct Loans?                                                       Within 120 Days of Disbursement:   You have the right to  cancel all or part of any disbursement of a Federal Direct Loan without  being charged interest and other loan fees as long as the cancellation  is processed within 120 days of the original disbursement date. The  disbursement date is the date the funds were applied to your NYU Bursar  bill during any given semester.   To request a cancellation, you must make your request through the NYU Bursar\u2019s Office by completing a Request to Return Loan Funds Form and submitting it to the Bursar as instructed on the form.   More Than 120 Days After Disbursement:   If  you wish to cancel all or part of any disbursement of your loan more  than 120 days after it was disbursed, you are actually repaying part of  your loan and you must pay any accrued interest and/or fees. You cannot  cancel your loan, but you can make a payment directly to your federal  loan servicer. Borrowers are assigned to one of the five servicers,  which include ACS, Great Lakes, NelNet, PHEAA, and Sallie Mae. If you  are not sure which of the five centers is your assigned servicer, visit  and log into the federal government\u2019s National Student Loan Data System to determine your servicer. You may also call 1-800-4-FED-AID to locate your servicer.                                                                                                                                                                        When can I expect my Direct Loan refund?                                                       Loan refunds are administered through the Office of the Bursar ,  and there are important elements to consider if you are anticipating a  credit balance. For example, because your loans can not be released to  NYU before your designated disbursement date, and because once they are  disbursed certain basic enrollment criteria must first be verified (e.g.  you normally must be enrolled for at least 6 points) before the loan  amount is applied to your account balance, a refund resulting from your  student loan will usually not be confirmed and processed until a few  days after your disbursement date.   IMPORTANT for Summer students :   Please note that if you are eligible for loans in the summer, those  loans do not disburse until July 1, and for those eligible for a refund,  you should not rely on those funds until at least one week after  disbursement.                                                                                                                                                                        How can I reduce my federal loans?                                                       If you have completed the acceptance process for a Federal Direct Loan and/or a Federal Direct PLUS Loan but no longer want to borrow the full amount, contact the Office of Financial Aid as soon as possible to authorize a reduction.   Once you have accepted your Direct Loan amounts on NYU Albert you cannot make further changes online. Please notify us to make adjustments to your awards:     Email to the Office of Financial Aid .   College of Dentistry students: email to dental.financial.aid@nyu.edu   School of Medicine students: email to laverne.walker@nyumc.org   Graduate Stern School of Business: email to fin-aid@stern.nyu.edu   School of Law: email to law.finaid@nyu.edu     Upon receipt of your request (typically within 3 weeks) a Financial Aid Counselor will update your loan.                                                                                                                                                                        My parent's application for a Federal PLUS Loan has been denied. What now?                                                         If the parent borrower is not initially approved for a Federal PLUS Loan, they will receive an endorser packet directly from the U.S. Department of Education. This packet explains that a PLUS Loan may still be acquired if someone else with an acceptable credit rating -- such as the parent applicant's spouse, a relative, or friend -- agrees to endorse or cosign the loan. Contact Direct Loans Applicant Services at 1-800-557-7394 for additional instructions for endorsers.   Parents also have the option to appeal the Department of Education\u2019s PLUS denial. For instructions on how to appeal, please contact the Department of Education\u2019s Applicant Services at 1-800-557-7394.   Please note that if the parent borrower receives the Federal PLUS Loan based on a credit-worthy endorser, the PLUS Master Promissory Note (MPN) that the parent completed will expire with that endorsed loan. A new PLUS MPN will be required for any subsequent PLUS Loan for which the parent applies.   Parent borrowers who are originally credit denied for a Direct PLUS Loan, but have obtained approval by appeal or endorser, are required to complete a new PLUS Loan Counseling session. The federal Department of Education will contact the borrower in these cases and direct them to studentloans.gov to complete PLUS Loan Counseling. Your PLUS Loan cannot disburse to your Bursar bill until you have completed the PLUS Loan Counseling.   The U.S. Department of Education does not inform the NYU Office of Financial Aid about the specific reason for the denial of a Federal PLUS Loan. To appeal for reconsideration, contact the Direct Loan Origination Center toll-free at 1-800-557-7394.   In the event a denial is final, the student may contact the Office of Financial Aid to request consideration for an additional Federal Direct Unsubsidized Loan. Freshman and Sophomores may be eligible for a maximum of $4,000 in additional funds, and Juniors and Seniors may be eligible for a maximum of $5,000 in additional funds. Please note: if at a later time during the academic year a parent becomes eligible or is approved with a co-signor for a Parent PLUS loan, the additional Unsubsidized Loan will be canceled.                                                                                                                                                                          I completed my Subsidized/Unsubsidized Master Promissory Note (MPN) on www.studentloans.gov. Why is it still requested on my Albert To Do list?                                                       Usually, this occurs when the subsidized and/or unsubsidized loans have not yet originated. Origination means that your loan data is being sent to the Department of Education for processing. The checklist item for the MPN will not update to a received status until the loan(s) successfully originate.                                                                                                                                                                          I am a transfer student and I completed my Subsidized/Unsubsidized MPN for my previous school. Do I have to do a new one for NYU?                                                       No, your completed Subsidized/Unsubsidized MPN can be used for your loans at NYU, provide they are still valid and in an active status.                                                                                                                                                                          I am a transfer student and I completed my Undergraduate Entrance Counseling for my previous school. Do I have to do a new one for NYU?                                                       No, your completed Undergraduate Entrance Counseling session can be used for your loans at NYU. However, you must contact NYU\u2019s Office of Financial Aid to let us know. Otherwise, we would not know that you ever completed one in the past and your Entrance Counseling checklist item on your Albert To Do list would stay in a requested status. Once we confirm that a counseling session was completed previously we will update your NYU records.                                                                                                                                                                          How does my parent borrower apply for a Federal Direct Parent PLUS Loan?                                                       You, the student, must start the process by accepting the offered Federal Direct Parent PLUS Loan on your Albert account. You can do so by logging in to Albert and then clicking on the Accept/Decline Financial Aid link and following the instructions.   Your parent borrower will be asked to complete the Federal Direct PLUS Loan Request and Master Promissory Note by visiting the Direct Loan Web site at www.studentloans.gov . They must sign in using the same PIN number that was assigned to them to access your FAFSA. If they do not remember their PIN, they may request a duplicate from the Official PIN site .   The U.S. Department of Education will conduct a credit check that is valid for only 90 days. Your parent borrower should not apply more than 90 days before the start of fall semester to avoid credit expiration.   Shortly after the PLUS Loan originates to the Department of Education, an email from the NYU Office of Financial Aid will be sent to the parent borrower (only if the PLUS Loan was credit approved). The approved parent must complete the PLUS Loan process by logging in to the NYU Student System as instructed in this email and by providing the dollar amount of the Parent PLUS Loan that is desired and the parent must actively accept the PLUS Loan on the same page.                                                                                                                                                                          Who completes the Master Promissory Note for my parent borrower\u2019s endorsed (co-signed) Parent PLUS Loan -- my parent or the endorser?                                                       Even if your parent borrower has had to obtain an endorser for their Federal Direct PLUS Loan, they are still the borrower on the loan. Therefore, the parent borrower must complete the MPN.                                                                                                                                                                          My parent borrower was approved for a Parent PLUS Loan by completing the PLUS Loan Request on www.studentloans.gov. Why did they receive an email from the Office of Financial Aid asking them to complete a PLUS Loan confirmation process?                                                       Federal regulations require a parent borrower to actively accept each Parent PLUS Loan and indicate the final amount they wish to accept for each loan. The email with instructions on completing the final PLUS Loan confirmation is sent to the parent borrower after the loan has been originated and we are in receipt of the approved credit decision. This is your parent borrower\u2019s opportunity to accept the loan for the amount that was originated or reduce the amount if they do not need the entire loan.   For subsequent PLUS Loans in your undergraduate career, your parent borrower may not be required to complete a new PLUS Loan Request on www.studentloans.gov , but they will be required to complete the final PLUS Loan confirmation process through our site.                                                                                                                                                                          Does my parent borrower have to complete a new Federal Direct PLUS Loan Master Promissory Note if . . .                                                       . . . they already did one for a previous school?   No, if your parent borrower has already completed a PLUS Loan MPN for any school (without an endorser) they do not have to complete a new one.   . . . they already did one for my PLUS loan from last year?   No, if your parent borrower was credit approved on their own for a Federal Direct PLUS Loan in a previous semester or year they do not have to complete a new one.   . . . their previous PLUS Loan was approved with an endorser (co-signer)?   Yes, if their previous PLUS Loan required an endorser for credit approval they must complete a new Master Promissory Note for the next PLUS Loan. This is because each endorsed (co-signed) Parent PLUS Loan must have its own MPN \u2013 the MPN for an endorsed loan cannot be used for any subsequent loan.                                                                                                                                                                          My parent borrower received a refund from the Parent PLUS Loan. Can they return the refund check if they do not need the funds?                                                       Yes. Parent borrowers have the right to cancel all or part of any disbursement of a federal Parent PLUS Loan without being charged interest and other loan fees as long as the cancellation is processed within 120 days of the original disbursement date. The disbursement date is the date the funds were applied to your NYU Bursar bill during any given semester.   To request a cancellation, they must make the request through the NYU Bursar\u2019s Office by completing a Request to Return Loan Funds Form and submitting it to the Bursar as instructed on the form.   If they wish to cancel all or part of any disbursement of their loan more than 120 days after it was disbursed, they are actually repaying part of their loan and they must pay any accrued interest and/or fees. They cannot cancel their loan, but they can make a payment directly to your federal loan servicer. Borrowers are assigned to one of the five servicers, which include ACS, Great Lakes, NelNet, PHEAA, and Sallie Mae. If they are not sure which of the five centers is their assigned servicer, visit and log into the federal government\u2019s National Student Loan Data System to determine their servicer. They may also call 1-800-4-FED-AID to locate your servicer.                                                                                                                                                                          I received a refund from my Subsidized/Unsubsidized loan. Can I return the refund check if I do not need the funds?                                                       Yes -- please see the FAQ above regarding parent borrowers returning refunds from a Parent PLUS Loan. The same rules apply to your Subsidized/Unsubsidized loan.

The Department of Education then sends your family\u2019s financial information and its estimate of family contribution to each college you designate to receive the information. (NOTE TO DENTAL STUDENTS: College of Dentistry students seeking certain federal education loans for the health professions (e.g. the Health Professions Student Loan [HPSL] and Loans for Disadvantaged Students [LDS]) must include parents financial data on the FAFSA even if they are financially independent of their parents.)   The FAFSA is available each year beginning January 1, and should be completed as soon as possible, but not later than February 15 (midnight EST) for new freshmen , and not later than May 1 (midnight EDT) for most other students (see Financial Aid Application Priority Deadlines at column upper right for details). Students who miss the FAFSA priority deadline are still encouraged to apply and will be considered for federal student aid, if eligible, but funds become increasingly limited.   Graduate students should refer to their school or department for specific program deadlines.     Click here to begin and submit the FAFSA . Alternatively, you can complete the paper version, which may be found in your high school or college or by calling 1-800-4-FED-AID.   REQUIRED every year for U.S. citizen and eligible non-citizen undergraduate students, transfer students, and graduate students at NYU New York campus, and adult students applying to The Paul McGhee Division at the NYU School of Continuing and Professional Studies, New York campus.   REQUIRED every year for U.S. citizen and eligible non-citizen undergraduate students, transfer students, and graduate students at NYU Shanghai.     NOT REQUIRED for international students at NYU New York campus.   NOT REQUIRED for students at NYU Abu Dhabi.   NOT REQUIRED for international students and Chinese nationals at NYU Shanghai.   You must list &quot;New York University&quot; as a recipient and include our federal school code number 002785 when completing your FAFSA.     Do not wait until your taxes are done before submitting the FAFSA. Although it is better to do your taxes early, it is acceptable to use estimates of your income when you initially file the FAFSA. You can make corrections later on the FAFSA website.     YOUR FAFSA PIN:  Students and parents of dependent students may use a PIN (Personal Identification Number) to sign the FAFSA electronically and avoid the need to print and mail a signature page. The PIN can be used each year to apply for federal student aid and to review your record online at the U.S. Department of Education. Get your Federal Student Aid PIN at www.pin.ed.gov .   FAFSA priority deadlines for Freshmen applicants:         Early and Regular Decision: February 15 (midnight EST)        FAFSA priority deadlines for Transfer applicants:         Fall/Summer Admission: April 1 (midnight EDT)    Spring Admission: November 1 (midnight EDT)           2. College Scholarship Service Financial Aid PROFILE   The CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE application is administered by the College Scholarship Service (the financial aid division of The College Board) and collects information used by many private universities to award institutional (non-government) financial aid funds.   The CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE can be submitted in the fall as early as October 1 , but not later than February 15 (midnight EST).       Click here to begin and submit the CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE .   REQUIRED the first year for new undergraduate U.S. citizens and eligible non-citizens applying to NYU New York campus who wish to be considered for institutional (non-government) financial aid funds.   NOT REQUIRED for U.S. citizen and eligible non-citizen returning undergraduate students, transfer students, and graduate students at NYU New York campus, or adult students applying to The Paul McGhee Division at the NYU School of Continuing and Professional Studies, New York campus.   REQUIRED every year for international students at NYU New York campus who wish to be considered for institutional (non-government) financial aid funds.   REQUIRED every year for all students at NYU Abu Dhabi who wish to be considered for institutional (non-government) financial aid funds. (NOTE: it is not required for Emirati nationals, who will be automatically evaluated for Exceptional Emirati Scholarship upon acceptance.)   REQUIRED every year for international (not US, not Chinese nationals) students at NYU Shanghai who wish to be considered for institutional (non-government) financial aid funds. (NOTE: it is not required for Chinese nationals who complete the Gaokao college entrance examination instead of the SAT college admission test).   You must list &quot;New York University&quot; as a recipient and include our CSS school code number 2785 when completing your CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE.   Do not wait until your taxes are done before submitting the PROFILE. Although it is better to do your taxes early, it is acceptable to use estimates of your income when you initially file the PROFILE.   NYU does not participate in the CSS IDOC program.   CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE Help: telephone 305-829-9793.     CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE priority deadlines for Freshmen applicants:         Early Decision I: November 15 (midnight EST)    Early Decision II: January 15 (midnight EST)    Regular Decision: February 15 (midnight EST)        College Scholarship Service Noncustodial PROFILE     The CSS Noncustodial PROFILE is also required, if applicable;     Students who have families with separated, divorced, or single parents must also complete the Non-Custodial Parent form, which complements the CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE. NYU requires noncustodial parents to report their income, assets and other information as part of the financial aid application process to assess an applicant\u2019s eligibility for scholarship or other types of aid.   Providing such information does not necessarily mean that the student\u2019s noncustodial parent will be expected or required to contribute to educational costs.   Under certain circumstances NYU will consider waiving the requirement for the CSS Noncustodial PROFILE in the event the information cannot be obtained. Please see the CSS Noncustodial PROFILE Waiver Request form available (October to February) on the Applications and Forms menu in the column at right.   If the CSS Noncustodial PROFILE is required but not submitted, and NYU does not grant the applicant a waiver of this requirement, the student will not be considered for need-based NYU scholarship or grant funds. Please note that this is important because the amount of scholarship a student receives in their first year at NYU is typically the amount they will continue to receive each year if they remain otherwise eligible. Thus, if a student does not receive any NYU grant or scholarship in their freshman year they will likely not receive any in subsequent years. Failing to submit the CSS Noncustodial PROFILE (or the waiver request) for the first year can therefore affect eligibility in future years.     CSS Noncustodial PROFILE priority deadlines for Freshmen applicants:           Early Decision I: November 20 (midnight EST)    Early Decision II: January 20 (midnight EST)    Regular Decision: February 20 (midnight EST)        Please note that the deadlines for the CSS Noncustodial PROFILE application occur 5 days after the corresponding deadlines for the CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE application to allow additional time to provide the information required.             3. NYS Tuition Assistance Program (TAP)   In addition to the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA), New York State residents must also submit an application for the New York State Tuition Assistance Program (TAP). TAP grants are available to qualified students attending New York University.    Start the TAP application process by completing the FAFSA at http://www.fafsa.gov/ . New York State will use your FAFSA information as part of your application for TAP; you can link to the online TAP application directly from the FAFSA on the Web confirmation page.    You will be asked to establish a PIN (Personal Identification Number) for TAP. The TAP PIN will allow you complete your application online, keep track of your application information, or make changes later. Information from your FAFSA and your family's calculated NYS net taxable income will be pre-filled on your TAP on the Web application. Follow the instructions provided.       You must list &quot;New York University&quot; as a recipient and include our state school code number 0555 when completing your TAP application.     If you choose not to apply online, an Express TAP Application (ETA) will be mailed to you by the New York State Higher Education Services Corporation (HESC). Information from your FAFSA and your family's calculated NYS net taxable income will be pre-printed on your ETA. Review this information, change any incorrect items, complete any missing items, then SIGN AND MAIL THE FORM USING THE RETURN ENVELOPE.    If you provide an e-mail address on your FAFSA, HESC will use that address to contact you about your TAP application, give you processing updates, or award information. Please respond to any requests or instructions sent by HESC. If you have submitted applications, you can check the status of your TAP at any time.    If you have already received TAP, you must renew your grant each year by returning to TAP on the Web (via the online FAFSA process) to review and confirm your HESC data. You must submit the FAFSA for each academic year to continue your TAP eligibility. Based upon the data reported on your FAFSA, you will receive confirmation from HESC about your grant eligibility and award. Be sure to verify that all information is accurate, and submit any necessary corrections immediately.                                                         Priority Dates and Deadlines   All students should apply for financial aid every year. Students who miss a financial aid priority deadline are still encouraged to file the FAFSA and will be considered for federal student aid if eligible, but funds become increasingly limited. If you have not applied, do so immediately . Remember, to meet the specified deadline your application, with all necessary signatures, must be received and validated by the processor and released to NYU by the date shown below for priority consideration.   Freshman Applicants: In order to be considered for NYU scholarship, you must complete all required applications by our deadlines . Please review the Applications and Forms section of this website to find out which applications are relevant to you. Late CSS Profile applications will not be accepted for scholarship consideration. The FAFSA can be filed at any time to be reviewed for federal aid eligibility.

Regardless of your family's financial circumstances, paying for college will probably require a substantial commitment of your resources over the next several years. It may surprise you to learn that most full-time undergraduate students at New York University would not be able to pay their educational costs without financial assistance. These students are able to attend NYU only because they applied for and received financial aid.    While we believe that the primary responsibility for meeting college costs rests with the student and the family, New York University as well as the state and federal governments can help. Although NYU is not able to meet the full need of every student, by combining the various types of funds available we use every method possible to coordinate adequate resources to enable you to invest in a higher education at NYU.    If you believe you will need any amount of financial assistance to attend NYU, we strongly encourage you to apply for financial aid immediately.

Review important information to ensure the proper disbursement of your financial aid awards .   If you have been awarded Federal Direct Loans, be sure to read our instructions to secure those Direct Loans . These instructions are applicable also to returning students who may have borrowed federal loans in the past. You are encouraged to review the definitions of the loans before pursuing these or any educational loan. Please think carefully about your obligations as a borrower before pursuing any educational loan. Consider your educational investment at NYU, as well as your long term financial commitments, when borrowing.   Read the Financial Aid Guide , which provides essential information to accompany your NYU financial aid award package for the academic year.   Students must meet the standards of Satisfactory Academic Progress to remain eligible for financial aid. Be sure to follow the requirements of your program/department.

They may take the form of University scholarships, federal or state grants, or outside scholarships.   For most undergraduates, eligibility for a merit-based and/or need-based scholarship is determined upon entrance to the University based on prior academic strengths and, if you apply for financial aid , your demonstrated financial need. Typically you will continue to receive for subsequent academic years the amount of scholarship you received for your first year (subject to the availability of funds), as long as the following criteria are met:       You are a full-time student (at least 12 points).   You applied for financial aid on time.   You are meeting the Satisfactory Academic Progress standards.   You have approximately the same amount of financial need that you had in prior years.       New York University Scholarships   Descriptions of University-Wide and School-Based scholarships at NYU for which you may qualify are provided in the Undergraduate Admissions area of the NYU website. All admitted undergraduate students are automatically considered for these programs based on academic merit. Except where noted, no separate application form is required.   Graduate students are usually offered scholarships for each separate academic year as determined by their individual schools within NYU.   Note: If your eligibility for any federal aid you receive is jeopardized for reasons other than financial need or academic merit (e.g. if you are in default on a federal loan, or if you did not respond to the University's requests for tax information and income verification ), then your NYU scholarship may also be affected.       Federal Grant Programs                                                  FEDERAL PELL GRANT                               The Federal Pell Grant Program provides assistance to undergraduate students who demonstrate financial need according to economic criteria and program requirements established by the federal government. To be eligible, you must enroll in a degree program and be matriculated for your first bachelor's degree. (You are not eligible if you have already completed a bachelor's degree.) An estimated award will be listed in your award package if we think you will be eligible. Your Student Aid Report (SAR) contains the official evaluation of your eligibility from the U.S. Department of Education. When you review your SAR, follow the instructions to make changes if necessary\u2014including updating your record to reflect actual tax figures if you used estimated data in order to meet the NYU application deadline\u2014and then save the final SAR for your records. You may also review and make changes to your SAR in the &quot;FAFSA Follow-up&quot; area of the FAFSA Web site .                                                              TEACHER EDUCATION ASSISTANCE FOR COLLEGE AND HIGHER EDUCATION (TEACH) GRANT (Steinhardt students only)                               Through the College Cost Reduction and Access Act of 2007, Congress created the Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grant Program that provides grants of up to $3,965* per year to students who intend to teach in a public or private elementary or secondary school that serves students from low-income families.     Be a U.S. citizen or eligible non-citizen.   Be enrolled as an undergraduate, post-baccalaureate, or graduate student in a postsecondary educational institution that has chosen to participate in the TEACH Grant Program.   Be enrolled in course work that is necessary to begin a career in teaching or plan to complete such course work. Such course work may include subject area courses (e.g., math courses for a student who intends to be a math teacher).   Meet certain academic achievement requirements (generally, scoring above the 75th percentile on a college admissions test or maintaining a cumulative GPA of at least 3.25).   Complete an online TEACH Grant Entrance Counseling session each eligible year.   Sign a TEACH Grant Agreement to Serve each eligible year.     * Per federal mandate, the maximum amount for TEACH Grant awards for academic year 2013-2014 (first disbursed on or after 10/1/13 and before 10/1/14) is $3,965. The maximum amount for TEACH Grant awards for academic year 2014-2015 (first disbursed on or after 10/1/14 and before 10/1/15) is $3,708.                                                              FEDERAL SUPPLEMENTAL EDUCATION OPPORTUNITY GRANTS (FSEOG)                               The FSEOG program is funded by the U.S. Department of Education and administered by New York University to provide assistance to students with exceptional financial need. All students who qualify are automatically considered for this grant. However, our funds from this program are very limited.                                                              VETERANS BENEFITS                               The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs offers education grant assistance to qualified U.S. military service members and their families.   &gt; more                        State Scholarship and Grant Programs   New York State offers a wide variety of grants and scholarships to residents, subject to the annual availability of funds. Although application is made directly to the state and grants are awarded by the state, the amount each student is expected to receive is estimated and taken into account by NYU when assembling the student's financial aid package.                                                  NEW YORK STATE TUITION ASSISTANCE PROGRAM (TAP)                               Legal residents of the state of New York who are enrolled in a full-time or part-time degree program may be eligible for awards under this program. The award varies, depending on income and tuition cost. A separate application is necessary. &gt; more                                                              AID FOR PART-TIME STUDY (APTS)                               A financial aid program to help New York State residents pursuing part-time undergraduate degree study offers awards in amounts of up to $2,000 per academic year. To be eligible, the student must have filed a FAFSA and demonstrate financial need, must not have exhausted their TAP eligibility, must be otherwise eligible for financial aid, and must be enrolled for 3 to 11 credit points per term. A separate application is necessary, and is available here .

Some students from outside New York State may qualify for funds from their own state scholarship programs that can be used at New York University. Contact your state financial aid agency (call 1-800-433-3243 to obtain contact information) to ask about program requirements and application procedures. When you receive an eligibility notice from your state program, you should submit it immediately to the NYU Office of Financial Aid.          Scholarships and Grants from Other Organizations   In addition to the sources of gift aid described above, you may also be eligible for a private scholarship or grant from an outside organization or agency. Some sources to explore are employers, unions, professional organizations, and community and special interest groups.   Many extensive scholarship search services are available free online, and a representative sample is included on the drop menu below. The scholarships and information presented by such services are not verified or endorsed by NYU. You must notify the Office of Financial Aid if you receive funds from any outside organization.

Outside scholarships are considered a financial aid resource and must be added to a student's financial aid award. The Office of Financial Aid first applies the outside scholarship to a student's unmet need that is not already covered by financial aid. In some cases, loans not based on financial need may be reduced (private loans, Federal Unsubsidized Loans, Federal PLUS Loans, Graduate PLUS). If the student's need is already met by need-based aid, then that aid is replaced with the outside scholarship. Need-based loans are first replaced. If the outside scholarship exceeds the loan amounts, work-study and need-based grants are the next to be replaced. In most cases it is not necessary to reduce an NYU scholarship. Total aid (including outside assistance) cannot exceed the cost of attendance.

ELIGIBILITY: Preferred consideration is given to the dependents and spouses of uniformed members of the Fire Department of the City of New York (FDNY), the New York Police Department (NYPD), the Port Authority Police Department (PAPD), and other emergency response workers who died at the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001. (The dependents of other victims of 9/11 are not eligible.) There is no New York State residency requirement. Students must apply and be admitted to a four-year undergraduate degree program at New York University under normal admission standards.    Transfer students from other undergraduate programs are also eligible.    Students in graduate, professional, non-degree, or non-credit programs are not eligible for these scholarships.    Students must maintain full-time matriculation during each semester in which they receive scholarship funds and they must maintain satisfactory academic progress to continue to be eligible. Students may receive scholarship funds for up to eight semesters at NYU.     HOW TO APPLY: Once admitted, eligible students must first submit the FAFSA and also apply for the New York State World Trade Center Memorial Scholarship . NYU scholarship funds will then be used to accommodate any remaining need, up to the full cost of education at New York University.     COSTS COVERED: Scholarship awards may be used to support tuition, registration fees, and room and board (for NYU housing only), but not health services or other activity and support fees.

Although merit-based scholarships are available, NYU is committed to using the vast majority of its scholarship funds to assist students whose families are unable to pay the full cost of an NYU education. All students are automatically considered, and there is no separate application necessary for NYU scholarships.     more about scholarships and grants              Loans Available: Federal and Private   A financial aid package at NYU may suggest several types of loans for which a student is eligible, based on certain criteria (such as anticipated points/credits, housing status, financial need, etc.) and, for campus-administered loans, the availability of funds.   Some federal loan programs, such as the Perkins Loan, Health Professions Student Loan, and Nursing Loan, allocate limited funds to New York University for campus-based disbursement and administration of the loans. NYU will require you to complete a promissory note to ensure appropriate loan disbursement and corresponding credit on your Bursar bill. You should carefully read the instructions and complete the signing process on NYU Albert . You will not receive credit on your bursar's bill if you do not sign your promissory note.   Other federal loans are secured and disbursed to the student in cooperation with the U.S. Department of Education. Your award package may include information about a &quot;suggested loan.&quot; This means that you are eligible for the type and amount of loan specified, based upon the information we have about you at the time the award is offered. It does not mean you will automatically receive the loan, but rather informs you of your current eligibility and how to apply. The suggested loan amount in your award package is the maximum you are eligible for and is the amount that NYU has certified for you. If you wish to borrow an amount lower than suggested, please contact the Office of Financial Aid for instructions.   A variety of additional, private (non-federal) alternative loans are also available from individual lending institutions.   Please think carefully about your obligations as a borrower before pursuing any educational loan. Consider your educational investment at NYU, as well as your long-term financial commitments when borrowing.

The Federal Perkins Loan is a low interest rate loan made to qualifying NYU students who demonstrate financial need. New York University is your lender for a Perkins Loan. You are considered for a Federal Perkins Loan automatically; however, once you have been offered the loan, you must sign and return a promissory note to receive it. The appropriate credit will be applied to your account at the Office of the Bursar.   A signed Master Promissory Note (MPN) is required only once and remains valid for up to 10 years. Students are required to complete a Truth in Lending Statement and a Statement of Rights and Responsibilities each year as their eligibility is renewed. If you are eligible for a Perkins Loan, your award package will indicate the amount. Please note that if you decide not to accept the loan, your eligibility for Perkins will be canceled in subsequent years.   You must begin to repay your loan once you graduate, leave school, or drop below half-time enrollment status. You are allowed a grace period before beginning repayment. If you are a new borrower, you have 9 months before interest begins to accrue on your loan and 12 months before your first payment is due.          Federal Nursing Student Loan   The federally funded Nursing Student Loan may be offered to students who demonstrate financial need and enroll at least half-time in the College of Nursing. The annual interest rate is 5 percent, and interest does not accrue while the student remains enrolled at least half-time in a nursing program.              Health Professions Student Loan Program   The Health Professions Student Loan Program provides long-term, low-interest loans to   students at the College of Dentistry who demonstrate \ufb01nancial need. The annual interest rate   is currently 5 percent, and interest does not accrue while the student remains enrolled as a   full-time student at a school eligible to participate in the health professions program.               Private (Non-Federal) Alternative Loans   NYU students should apply for all eligible financial assistance available before considering a private, alternative loan. Private loan interest rates, terms, conditions and eligibility requirements will vary, and the borrower (and co-borrower, if applicable) should first compare a variety of private student loans offered by banks and other education loan providers and apply only for the alternative loan that best suits their needs.   Please think carefully about your obligations as a borrower before pursuing any educational loan. Consider your educational investment at NYU, as well as your long-term financial commitments when borrowing.       more about private loans                                   Frequently Asked Questions Find what you're looking for (and much more) in our responses to regular inquiries from students and families. Read More             Student Employment   Most financial aid award packages include work-study. This means that you are eligible to participate in the Federal Work-Study Program, and may earn up to the amount recommended in your package. Federal Work-Study jobs, generally averaging from 15 to 20 hours per week, are secured through The Wasserman Center for Career Development , located at 133 East 13th Street. Positions in various on-campus departments and organizations are available (though not guaranteed).   Important Notice: Work-Study earnings are not credited on your Bursar bill, but are paid directly to the student on a bi-weekly basis. Money earned from employment is normally used for books, transportation, and personal expenses.   Work-Study is not available at all Study Away locations.   Students are not required to meet their earnings expectation through the Federal Work-Study Program, and may choose not to accept Federal Work-Study and seek instead employment in an on-campus or off-campus job in which wages are paid entirely by the employer's budget.   New York University provides a wide range of employment opportunities for students, and all are encouraged to take advantage of the placement services (including summer jobs) offered by The Wasserman Center for Career Development. Students may use the center immediately upon payment of their tuition deposit.   Important information for graduate students :  Graduate assistantships are available in some schools. Graduate assistantships and teaching fellowships provide tuition remission and a stipend. Duties include teaching, research, and other activities related to departmental needs. All applicants for assistantships, whether or not other types of financial aid are requested, should contact their department directly for information, instructions, and applications. A graduate assistantship may affect eligibility for some forms of financial aid. Please contact the Office of Financial Aid, as well as your department, if your award package does not indicate your assistantship. Work-Study is not awarded during the Summer Sessions, however there are still jobs available during that time.               Study Away   Financial aid for the NYU Study Away Program comes in many forms. Scholarships are available to many students who are approved for the program, based on financial need, academic merit, or both. Also, most federal and New York State need-based financial aid can be applied to study away, and additional assistance may be available to students demonstrating further need.* NYU students who participate in Study Away remain matriculated at NYU, pay NYU tuition, and receive financial aid just as they would if attending classes at Washington Square.   Students who attend a foreign university not directly affiliated with NYU must complete and sign a consortium agreement (which arranges NYU financial aid payments to the hosting university) and must confirm in advance their eligibility to transfer course credit(s) to an NYU degree program.   Students not enrolled at NYU who apply to the Study Away program will use financial aid awarded from their home institution, and should visit their financial aid office and ask to have a consortium agreement established with the NYU Financial Aid Office.   * Global Pathways Scholarship  All admitted Study Away undergraduate students applying for financial aid will be automatically evaluated for an additional need-based award: the Global Pathways Scholarship will add up to $4,000 per semester (depending on demonstrated need) to cover the additional costs of studying away. Students will receive an award notification beginning in June (for fall semester) and in November (for spring semester).

Where is my award?                                                       NYU students who apply for financial aid in accordance with our priority deadlines are evaluated for financial aid and notified about the specific types and amounts of aid offered.   Students will be awarded their financial aid online via NYU Albert . An email with the appropriate link will be sent to you once your financial aid award package is available. Information about how to secure your aid will be provided in your financial aid award package and on your &quot;To Do&quot; list on Self-Service. All communication regarding your financial aid will be available to you via &quot;self service&quot; on NYU Albert .   Award schedule:     New Freshmen: Early April   Returning Undergraduates: Beginning mid June   New Graduates: varies by school; generally April/May   Returning Graduates: mid July     Students should also review important information to ensure the proper disbursement of their financial aid awards .                                                                                                                                                                            How do I apply for financial aid?                                                       All students are encouraged to apply every year for financial assistance. NYU requires the CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE application (to be considered for institutional [non-government] financial aid), the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) (for new freshmen and continuing students, to be considered for federal financial aid), and, for residents of New York State, the New York State Tuition Assistance Program (TAP) application.

(And what is \"Work-Study\"?)                                                          Go to Student Employment                                                                                                                                                                            I have financial aid now, but what about next year? Is it necessary to apply again?                                                       Yes, you must apply every year by submitting the FAFSA to determine and renew your financial aid (including NYU scholarships).   Each year the U.S. Department of Education will send to you a renewal reminder containing important information about your Federal Student Aid PIN and the FAFSA application process. (If you included a valid e-mail address on your FAFSA last year, you will receive the reminder by e-mail. Otherwise it will be mailed to your permanent address.) You will need your Federal Student Aid PIN to access your pre-filled FAFSA on the Web application that contains much of your application data from last year.   Visit the PIN web site at www.pin.ed.gov to verify your existing PIN, to request a duplicate if you have forgotten your PIN, or to request a new PIN if you (and your parents, if applicable) don't have one. (You use the same PIN each year, so you probably have one already).   It is possible to submit the FAFSA online without a PIN, but you must provide answers to all questions on a new FAFSA and you must print, sign, and mail the signature page after you submit the application, which will slow the process.   After January 1 but not later than May 1, access your FAFSA on the FAFSA website and revise the information to reflect your income for the preceding year (and other information only if it has changed), then submit the application. Be sure that you specify NYU (federal school code 002785) as the recipient of your information.   You should receive your Student Aid Report (SAR) within a few weeks after submitting the FAFSA. Call 1-800-4-FED-AID (1-800-433-3243) if you don't receive it. You may also view your SAR on the FAFSA website and make changes if necessary.   If you apply correctly and on time you can expect your NYU financial aid award notification by mid June (for returning undergraduates), describing your aid package for the next academic year.   Remember that the FAFSA and all necessary signatures must be received and validated by the processor and released to NYU no later than May 1 (not postmarked May 1), or the department deadline specified by your NYU school, if different. If you delay, a loss of aid could result. Remember, you must apply each year to renew your financial aid. May 1 is the priority deadline for most schools at NYU. Applying late could make you ineligible for certain types of aid, and funds become more limited. If you submitted a FAFSA last year and received an NYU scholarship, you should submit the FAFSA again each year by the NYU deadline to ensure normal processing.   TAP GRANT:   If you are a New York resident and received a state TAP grant, you must renew your grant award for next year to ensure credit for TAP on your Bursar bill. Click here for more information about the TAP application process.   CSS/FINANCIAL AID PROFILE:   The CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE is NOT REQUIRED for U.S. citizen and eligible non-citizen returning undergraduate students, transfer students, and graduate students at NYU New York campus, or adult students applying to The Paul McGhee Division at the NYU School of Continuing and Professional Studies, New York campus.     The CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE is REQUIRED every year for international students at NYU New York campus.     The CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE is REQUIRED every year for all students at NYU Abu Dhabi. (NOTE: it is not required for Emirati nationals, who will be automatically evaluated for Exceptional Emirati Scholarship upon acceptance.)     The CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE is REQUIRED every year for all students at NYU Shanghai. (NOTE: it is not required for Chinese nationals who complete the Gaokao college entrance examination instead of the SAT college admission test).                                                                                                                                                                        How do I get more financial aid?                                                       Review your FAFSA   Most student aid is based upon financial need, which is determined by the results of your FAFSA. The first step you should take is to ensure that the information you submitted on your FAFSA is correct. If your initial submission contained errors, you should correct your data on the FAFSA website at www.fafsa.gov . If your original data was correct when first submitted but your financial circumstances have changed since you filed the FAFSA, then, depending upon your situation, you may be eligible for review through a process called Professional Judgment. This process allows a financial aid administrator, under specific circumstances, to review your FAFSA eligibility based on new documentation, which will possibly change your eligibility for federal student aid. To determine if you are eligible, you should complete and submit the Professional Judgment Worksheet, available on our Applications and Forms menu . We will review your circumstances and notify you about opportunities for additional grants, federal loans, and alternative loans.   Change in Eligibility Increase   If you have enrolled for additional credit points and your tuition and/or fees have increased, if your housing status has changed (i.e. &quot;off campus&quot; vs. &quot;on campus&quot;), or if your grade level has changed, then your eligibility for federal loans (and possibly other types of student aid) may be reevaluated. Contact the Office of Financial Aid or send an e-mail message to explain your status change at NYU and to request that your aid be reviewed and/or your federal loan amount be increased if you are deemed eligible. If so, we will certify the additional amount(s) and send you a revised financial aid award notification. (Please note that annual and aggregate maximum borrowing limits apply to the Federal Stafford Loan .)   This change may also affect your eligibility for private student loans. Once you have maximized your federal loan eligibility then you may apply for additional private loan amounts to meet the cost of attendance. (See our information about Private Loans .) Once we have received approval from your lender, the Office of Financial Aid will certify the private loan and then notify you accordingly.   Individual Budget Appeal   If you find that your miscellaneous education-related expenses for the academic year (e.g. books and supplies, computer equipment, etc.) will exceed those projected in NYU's estimated budget for your total cost of attendance (see Tuition, Fees, and Expenses ), please submit the Budget Appeal form, also available on our Applications and Forms menu.   General Scholarship Increase Request   Returning undergraduate students who have submitted their FAFSA and wish to increase or add scholarship funding to their financial aid package may do so via the annual appeal process. During appeal season, our online Appeal Form for Returning Undergraduates is available on the Applications and Forms menu. Students must meet the specified appeal deadline and include an explanation of why they are seeking additional funding. Appeal results are typically based on financial need and academic performance. The amount of appeal funds available varies each year, and individual NYU schools work closely with the Office of Financial Aid throughout the process to make the appeal determination.   NYU graduate students should consult with the admissions/financial aid representative in their school or program department (see &quot;School Financial Aid Contacts&quot; on our alphabetical list of References and Resources .   Conclusion   Regardless of your status, we strongly encourage all students to explore the many private scholarships available.   You also may find NYU Payment Plans to be helpful. Although they are not a form of financial aid, NYU Payment Plans provide a good way to budget and plan your payments for each semester.                                                                                                                                                                        I will attend NYU in the summer. Is there any student aid available then?                                                       Usually yes. To be considered for ANY type of financial aid in the summer you must submit the NYU Summer Financial Aid Application, which is available on our Applications and Forms menu beginning in February. A Summer Financial Aid Application is also available for visiting non-NYU students.                                                                                                                                                                          I will enroll in a January Term course. Is financial aid available?                                                       NYU Undergraduate Students :   NYU New York undergraduates enrolling for January Term either in New York or at an NYU Study Away site will automatically be reviewed for additional scholarship eligibility. No application is needed. The review will be based upon financial need and the number of credits the student is enrolled for in January. The amount of scholarship awarded will be proportional to the amount of tuition the students' scholarship covered during an academic year semester. Students will be reviewed within a week after they register and will be notified via Albert accordingly. Students who do not have scholarship during the academic year are not eligible for January Term scholarship consideration.   Students needing additional financial aid for January Term will be able to seek out alternative loans, as additional federal loans are not available. Students seeking alternative loans are encouraged to relay to their potential lender the number of credits they will be taking, as some have minimum enrollment criteria. Private loan eligibility cannot exceed the cost of attendance for January term minus any other aid students may receive for the term. NYU cannot recommend or endorse any particular private lender. Students are encouraged to research their options carefully.   Students who change January Term enrollment or who do not attend in January will have their January award adjusted or cancelled.   NYU Graduate Students :   Generally, grants/scholarships are not available to NYU graduate students for the January Term, although graduate students should consult with their school's student services office or financial aid contact if they have questions.   Visiting non-NYU Students :   NYU grants/scholarships are not available to visiting non-NYU students for the January Term. However, visiting non-NYU students currently receiving federal financial aid at their home school may be able to apply a portion of it to their attendance at NYU by implementing a Consortium Agreement. Please consult with the financial aid office at your home school to determine if you can complete a Consortium Agreement for New York University.     In addition, visiting non-NYU students who are receiving institutional scholarship or grant funds from their home school while attending January Term at NYU must notify New York University.   Visiting non-NYU students will receive further information and instructions upon registration for January Term at NYU.   All students :   All students (NYU and visiting non-NYU) may apply for a private (non-federal) alternative loan for the January Term.                                                                                                                                                                        I have deferred my enrollment at NYU. How does this affect my financial aid?                                                         Go to Eligibility for Financial Aid: Deferred Enrollment                                                                                                                                                                            I will graduate at the end of the fall semester. Can I have aid awarded for the following spring semester applied to my fall account?                                                       No.   Most financial aid, such as Federal Direct Loans, Federal Direct PLUS Loans, TAP, Pell Grant, Perkins Loan, and NYU scholarship, is based on full academic year attendance, so if you are enrolled for one semester only, you will be awarded the appropriate portion for which you are eligible.                                                                                                                                                                        My grade level will advance in the spring. Will I be eligible for more financial aid once I become a Sophomore/Junior/Senior?                                                       You might be eligible for more Federal Subsidized or Federal Unsubsidized Loans. Once your grades have been posted on the Student Information System after the fall semester, if your grade level has increased from a Freshman level to a Sophomore level (32 points earned), or has changed from the Sophomore level to a Junior level (64 points earned) you may be eligible for more Federal Subsidized Loan or Federal Unsubsidized Loan. If you would like your eligibility for a loan increase to be reviewed, send an e-mail message to the Office of Financial Aid from your NYU email account with your specific request. If you are eligible, the loan amount will be increased and you will receive a notice to log on the Student Center and accept that amount. A new loan application is not required. Funds will be disbursed to your Bursar account in accordance with federal disbursement schedules. Also, please note that the increase could affect your loan eligibility for the upcoming summer if you plan to attend and receive federal loans in the summer.                                                                                                                                                                        I am an Undergraduate student considering an internal transfer to another NYU school in the spring. How will my financial aid be affected?                                                       In most cases the amount of financial aid you receive will not be affected. If your total credit points, your housing status, and your financial aid application information is the same as it was for the fall semester, the amount of financial aid you receive should remain the same.   PLEASE NOTE:     Departmental scholarships are not transferable to another school.   School of Continuing and Professional Studies (SCPS) students enrolled full-time in the General Studies Program, McGhee Division, the Hotel and Tourism Management Program, or the Recreation and Leisure Studies Program may transfer to another undergraduate school at NYU without affecting their financial aid.     If you are uncertain of your status, send an e-mail message to the Office of Financial Aid.                                                                                                                                                                        Who do I speak to about a question or problem with my bill?                                                       Billing transactions and associated student account issues are administered by the NYU Office of the Bursar .    See also NYU Albert to view your billing information record, including financial aid credits.    If some financial aid items are not listed on your bill, please make sure you do not have any \u2018holds\u2019 listed on your account and you are registered for the appropriate number of credits Financial Aid has anticipated for you. Also, please be sure you have accepted the item you wanted on Albert, completed all the necessary paperwork and allow 3-5 business days for this to reflect on your Bursar account.    Keep in mind that you will not receive an updated bill until your scheduled billing date . However, current changes and adjustments are visible on NYU Albert .    It is important to note that in some cases the student aid information initially shown on Albert may not exactly match the official Financial Aid Awards you subsequently receive.                                                                                                                                                                         How do I apply for a loan?                                                         Go to Direct Loan Instructions .                                                                                                                                                                          What are alternative loans, and why would I apply for such a loan?                                                         Go to Private (Non-Federal) Alternative Loans .                                                                                                                                                                          I received a Sub/Unsub loan/Perkins Loan/PLUS Loan that I do not want. Do I have to sign the Promissory Note(s) for these loans?                                                       If you were offered ANY aid you do not wish to use, please \u2018decline\u2019 the aid on NYU Albert. This will remove the item from your \u2018To Do\u2019 List.   If you have received loan promissory note, and you do not wish to use the loan, you DO NOT have to sign the promissory note. Please disregard the loans promissory notes.                                                                                                                                                                        My student application for a Federal Graduate PLUS Loan has been denied. What now?                                                         If you are not initially approved for a Federal Graduate PLUS Loan, you will receive an endorser packet directly from the U.S. Department of Education. This packet explains that a PLUS Loan may still be acquired if someone else with an acceptable credit rating -- such as your spouse, a relative, or friend -- agrees to endorse or cosign the loan. Contact the Office of Financial Aid for further instructions.   Please note that if you receive the Federal Direct PLUS Loan based on a credit-worthy endorser, the PLUS Master Promissory Note (MPN) that you have completed will expire with that endorsed loan. A new PLUS MPN will be required for any subsequent PLUS Loan for which you apply.   Graduate students who are originally credit denied for a Direct PLUS Loan, but have obtained approval by appeal or endorser, are required to complete a new PLUS Loan Counseling session. The federal Department of Education will contact the borrower in these cases and direct them to studentloans.gov to complete PLUS Loan Counseling. Your PLUS Loan cannot disburse to your Bursar bill until you have completed the PLUS Loan Counseling.   The U.S. Department of Education does not inform the NYU Office of Financial Aid about the specific reason for the denial of a Federal PLUS Loan. If you feel that there are extenuating circumstances and you wish to appeal the credit denial, you must contact the Direct Loan Origination Center toll-free at 1-800-557-7394.                                                                                                                                                                          How long do federal Direct PLUS Loan credit decisions remain valid?                                                       Credit approval is valid for 90 days. Your credit is evaluated by Direct Loans every time you request a new loan unless you have had a credit decision within the preceding 90 days.                                                                                                                                                                        How can I consolidate my student loans?                                                         Go to References and Resources for information about Loan Consolidation, Loan Deferment, Loan Forgiveness, and Loan Repayment.                                                                                                                                                                          My parents don't support me and won't contribute to my education, so why am I still considered a \"dependent\" student?                                                       It's a federal definition.   There are basic requirements a student must meet to be considered an independent student (see The Guide to Federal Student Aid for criteria). If you do not meet these requirements but you still believe you are truly independent of your parents, you may appeal for a \"dependency override\" with our office. The example below describes the conditions of an acceptable override, but if your situation is different please bring it to our attention for review.   INVOLUNTARY DISSOLUTION OF FAMILY   To demonstrate the \"involuntary dissolution\" of your family you must present:     A letter written by you which states that you do not and cannot have contact with your parents and also explains what precipitated the dissolution of the family.   A letter from a third party (someone not related to you) stating that you do not and cannot have contact with your parents. The letter must be written by someone:     who is professional (preferably your social worker or case worker, a member of the clergy, or a lawyer who has been represented you in legal proceedings), and;   who has personal, first-hand knowledge of your familial situation.     A copy of your completed FAFSA, which must be submitted as if you were an independent student.     If you can provide the appropriate documentation, a dependency override will be considered for you and your financial aid award may be changed based upon an independent status. (Note that just because a student is considered \"independent\" does not necessarily mean a student's aid will increase.)                                                                                                                                                                        What academic standards must I maintain at NYU to be eligible for financial aid?                                                         Go to Satisfactory Academic Progress .                                                                                                                                                                          Why hasn't financial aid been credited on my Bursar bill?                                                       If no student aid of any kind has been deducted from your bill, chances are you did not submit the required financial aid applications , or, if you did, you may have applied later than NYU's priority deadline (see sidebar above right), which may have affected your aid eligibility. If you have already applied and received your Student Aid Report (SAR) from the federal processors, in most cases you should have received a notice from us to view your financial aid award on NYU Albert. Verify on NYU Albert that your FAFSA data has been &quot;received&quot; by us (it will be listed in your &quot;To Do&quot; list as received if it is truly received by NYU).   If your FAFSA information was received by NYU more than 3 weeks ago and you have not received a financial aid award, you should first refer to NYU Albert to see if there are any &quot;holds&quot; on your account. A hold on your account may delay your financial aid awards. If there is a hold, please rectify that situation. The delay could be caused by circumstances concerning your aid eligibility. For example, you may not be meeting the satisfactory academic progress standards required to maintain student aid, or further documents may be required from you before we are able to process your award. If there are no holds, and if your award still seems delayed, then contact the Office of Financial Aid . Our counselors can discuss details with you and estimate when you can expect an award.                                                                                                                                                                        I haven't yet applied, but my bill is due soon. I know processing takes several weeks from start to finish. Is there any type of interim aid I can have while I wait?                                                       There is no interim aid. Students often ask if they can take out private, non-federal loans while they wait for their financial aid application to be processed and their federal loans to be disbursed. Students are discouraged from pursuing this because it also takes a few weeks to receive alternative loans, and if you take out alternative loans in advance of your federal loans, you may inadvertently take out too much private loan, which you would then have to return. This can be costly. Or, if you didn't want to return the private loan funds your federal aid eligibility could be adversely affected. The best strategy is to apply for financial aid as soon as possible, and, in the interim, work out a payment plan with the Bursar. If you're eligible for financial aid and you've already made a payment to the Bursar, you will be refunded the amount of overpayment.                                                                                                                                                                         When can I expect my loan refund?                                                       Loan refunds are administered through the NYU Office of the Bursar , and there are important elements to consider if you are anticipating a credit balance. For example, because your loans can not be released to NYU before your designated disbursement date, and because once they are disbursed certain basic enrollment criteria must first be verified (e.g. you normally must be enrolled for at least 6 points) before the loan amount is applied to your account balance, a refund resulting from your student loan will usually not be confirmed and processed until a few days after your disbursement date.                                                                                                                                                                        My financial aid award was based on anticipated credits and housing status, but my plans have changed. What do I do?                                                       Contact the Office of Financial Aid if any of the conditions of your initial award has changed. Depending on the changes, your aid may or may not be affected, but it is always better to inform the Office of Financial Aid of your plans so adjustments can be made, if necessary, early in the semester. If you fail to inform the Office of Financial Aid, then any discrepancies that exist between your anticipated and actual registered credit points will appear during enrollment audit and adjustments will be made at that time. It is the obligation of the Office of Financial Aid to adjust aid according to University policy and federal regulations.                                                                                                                                                                        Why has my citizenship status been requested? What are the citizenship requirements for federal aid?                                                       Students may be required to verify their U.S. citizenship status to confirm eligibility for some federal grant programs, and non-citizens are subject to different regulations which may require supporting documentation, depending upon the type of financial aid sought.       Go to Citizenship Documentation                                                                                                                                                                            Is it too late to apply for aid now that NYU's priority deadline has passed? Is there any aid I can get while I'm waiting for my federal aid eligibility?                                                       You are strongly encouraged to apply for financial aid even if you missed the NYU priority deadline (see Financial Aid Deadlines in the column above right). You may not qualify for the same amounts or types of funds if you did not apply on time. However, there are still alternatives available. For example, you will likely be eligible for some form of federal loan, and possibly federal grants and Federal Work-Study.                                                                                                                                                                         I have been asked to provide verification of my financial aid eligibility. What now?

NYU does not have an ROTC program on campus. However, NYU students can participate in ROTC through other schools in New York while attending NYU. An Army ROTC program is available at Fordham University and Air Force ROTC is available at Manhattan College.

Do I need to make an appointment to meet with a financial aid counselor?                                                       To best serve as many students as possible, we do not ordinarily schedule individual appointments (although an appointment can be arranged in an emergency). To meet with a financial aid counselor, please visit us any time during office hours.   FALL AND SPRING SEMESTER  Monday: 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m.  Tuesday: 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m.  Wednesday: 9:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m.  Thursday: 9:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m.  Friday: 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m.   SPRING RECESS AND SUMMER HOURS  Monday to Friday 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m.   See our contact information for additional information, extended hours and special announcements.                                                                                                                                                                        There is some financial aid credited on my bill this semester, but I was also expecting other credits. What happened to my TAP Grant?                                                       If you are a New York State resident, submitted a FAFSA, and applied for TAP using either TAP on the Web or a printed Express TAP Application (ETA), you should have received a TAP award certificate from the New York State Higher Education Services Corporation (HESC) . Contact HESC at 1-888-NYS-HESC (1-888-697-4372) if more than a few weeks have passed without notification after submitting the FAFSA.   HESC will also advise the NYU Office of the Bursar about your eligibility. If you have received your TAP award certificate but credit has not yet been applied to your bill, write a note on the bill and pay the appropriate remaining balance.                                                                                                                                                                        There is some financial aid credited on my bill this semester, but I was also expecting other credits. What happened to my Pell Grant?                                                       To be eligible for a Pell Grant you must be an undergraduate, have not earned a prior degree, and have an Estimated Family Contribution (as calculated by the government) of $5,273 or less. If you were eligible for Pell last year, you may not be eligible this year \u2014 it can vary depending upon your family and your resources. If you think you are Pell eligible and you subsequently received a request from NYU for documents to verify your FAFSA data, your Pell Grant may not be applied to your bill until the verification review is complete. Use NYU Albert to see if you have any outstanding document requests (please check the To Do list). Also, if you changed your Student Aid Report (SAR) to update any information the changes could have affected your Pell eligibility.                                                                                                                                                                        There is some financial aid credited on my bill this semester, but I was also expecting other credits. What happened to my scholarship?                                                       If you filed a FAFSA last year and received a scholarship, but didn't submit the FAFSA again this year, your scholarship amount could be affected. Most scholarships at NYU are based on a combination of need and merit. Review the letter that you received from our office when you were initially awarded. If you have not already submitted the FAFSA and you need to, do so right away. Depending on the availability of funding, late filers may not get their full scholarship.                                                                                                                                                                        There is some financial aid credited on my bill this semester, but I was also expecting other credits. What happened to my Perkins Loan?                                                       If the federal processors received your FAFSA later than the March 1 deadline (see sidebar above right), you may not have been offered a Perkins Loan. There is a limited amount of federal Perkins funding available to New York University and we must give priority to those who apply on time.    There are a few other reasons why your loan may not be on your bill. On Albert you need to accept your Perkins loan and wait 1 day. After 1 day has passed you must then e-sign your MPN, and print, sign, and mail your Perkins Rights and Responsibilities/Entrance Interview and you Truth-in-Lending in order to receive credit for this loan. Credit will be posted to your Bursar account 24 to 48 hours after you have completed all these steps and after we have received the printed documents.                                                                                                                                                                         There is some financial aid credited on my bill this semester, but I was also expecting other credits. What happened to my Federal Stafford Loan and/or Federal PLUS Loan?                                                       Be sure that you have completed the acceptance process for the Federal Stafford Loan and/or the Federal PLUS Loan to ensure the proper disbursement of funds. If a Stafford and/or PLUS Loan amount was suggested on your financial aid award letter, follow the instructions to secure your loan(s) and then deduct the pending loan amount from your bill (minus the origination fee) and pay the remainder.                                                                                                                                                                        There is some financial aid credited on my bill this semester, but I was also expecting other credits. What happened to my Private Loans?                                                       Your private loan must be approved by the lender and certified by NYU before you will be given credit for that loan. If it has been approved since the date of your bill, simply deduct the semester portion of the approved loan from your bill.                                                                                                                                                                        There is some financial aid credited on my bill this semester, but I was also expecting other credits. What happened to my Federal Work-Study?                                                       Federal Work-Study is not credited on your bill because it represents a potential amount yet to be earned in bi-weekly paychecks during the year. If suggested Work-Study is included in your financial aid package, it means you are eligible to participate in the Federal Work-Study Program .

Frequently Asked Questions                                                                                                                            I just accepted my Direct Loan(s), but now I want to change the amount. How can I make changes to my loan amounts?                                                       Once you have accepted your Direct Loan amounts on NYU Albert you cannot make further changes online. Please notify us to make adjustments to your awards:     Email to the Office of Financial Aid .

I have just been offered an increase or an additional Federal Direct Loan on my award letter. Do I have to complete all of the steps again?                                                       Each loan type (undergraduate/graduate Federal Direct Loan, Federal Direct Parent PLUS Loan and Graduate PLUS Loan) requires its own Master Promissory Note, or MPN, and Entrance Counseling (except Parent PLUS). So, if your increase is to an existing loan type you do NOT need to complete the MPN and Entrance Counseling again. However, you will still need to accept your increase on NYU Albert . If your increase or additional loan is a loan type you were not previously awarded, you WILL need to complete the MPN and Entrance Counseling (except Parent PLUS) in addition to accepting it on NYU Albert .                                                                                                                                                                        How/when do my Direct Loans get posted to my tuition account?                                                       Once you accept your loans on NYU Albert ,  sign your MPN, and complete Entrance Counseling, credit is then posted  to your account. The credit is provisional and does not change to real  credit until 10 days before the start of the loan period.                                                                                                                                                                        What if I want to return some loan funds after I have received a disbursement from Direct Loans?                                                       Within 120 Days of Disbursement:   You have the right to  cancel all or part of any disbursement of a Federal Direct Loan without  being charged interest and other loan fees as long as the cancellation  is processed within 120 days of the original disbursement date. The  disbursement date is the date the funds were applied to your NYU Bursar  bill during any given semester.   To request a cancellation, you must make your request through the NYU Bursar\u2019s Office by completing a Request to Return Loan Funds Form and submitting it to the Bursar as instructed on the form.   More Than 120 Days After Disbursement:   If  you wish to cancel all or part of any disbursement of your loan more  than 120 days after it was disbursed, you are actually repaying part of  your loan and you must pay any accrued interest and/or fees. You cannot  cancel your loan, but you can make a payment directly to your federal  loan servicer. Borrowers are assigned to one of the five servicers,  which include ACS, Great Lakes, NelNet, PHEAA, and Sallie Mae. If you  are not sure which of the five centers is your assigned servicer, visit  and log into the federal government\u2019s National Student Loan Data System to determine your servicer. You may also call 1-800-4-FED-AID to locate your servicer.                                                                                                                                                                        When can I expect my Direct Loan refund?                                                       Loan refunds are administered through the Office of the Bursar ,  and there are important elements to consider if you are anticipating a  credit balance. For example, because your loans can not be released to  NYU before your designated disbursement date, and because once they are  disbursed certain basic enrollment criteria must first be verified (e.g.  you normally must be enrolled for at least 6 points) before the loan  amount is applied to your account balance, a refund resulting from your  student loan will usually not be confirmed and processed until a few  days after your disbursement date.   IMPORTANT for Summer students :   Please note that if you are eligible for loans in the summer, those  loans do not disburse until July 1, and for those eligible for a refund,  you should not rely on those funds until at least one week after  disbursement.                                                                                                                                                                        How can I reduce my federal loans?                                                       If you have completed the acceptance process for a Federal Direct Loan and/or a Federal Direct PLUS Loan but no longer want to borrow the full amount, contact the Office of Financial Aid as soon as possible to authorize a reduction.   Once you have accepted your Direct Loan amounts on NYU Albert you cannot make further changes online. Please notify us to make adjustments to your awards:     Email to the Office of Financial Aid .   College of Dentistry students: email to dental.financial.aid@nyu.edu   School of Medicine students: email to laverne.walker@nyumc.org   Graduate Stern School of Business: email to fin-aid@stern.nyu.edu   School of Law: email to law.finaid@nyu.edu     Upon receipt of your request (typically within 3 weeks) a Financial Aid Counselor will update your loan.                                                                                                                                                                        My parent's application for a Federal PLUS Loan has been denied. What now?                                                         If the parent borrower is not initially approved for a Federal PLUS Loan, they will receive an endorser packet directly from the U.S. Department of Education. This packet explains that a PLUS Loan may still be acquired if someone else with an acceptable credit rating -- such as the parent applicant's spouse, a relative, or friend -- agrees to endorse or cosign the loan. Contact Direct Loans Applicant Services at 1-800-557-7394 for additional instructions for endorsers.   Parents also have the option to appeal the Department of Education\u2019s PLUS denial. For instructions on how to appeal, please contact the Department of Education\u2019s Applicant Services at 1-800-557-7394.   Please note that if the parent borrower receives the Federal PLUS Loan based on a credit-worthy endorser, the PLUS Master Promissory Note (MPN) that the parent completed will expire with that endorsed loan. A new PLUS MPN will be required for any subsequent PLUS Loan for which the parent applies.   Parent borrowers who are originally credit denied for a Direct PLUS Loan, but have obtained approval by appeal or endorser, are required to complete a new PLUS Loan Counseling session. The federal Department of Education will contact the borrower in these cases and direct them to studentloans.gov to complete PLUS Loan Counseling. Your PLUS Loan cannot disburse to your Bursar bill until you have completed the PLUS Loan Counseling.   The U.S. Department of Education does not inform the NYU Office of Financial Aid about the specific reason for the denial of a Federal PLUS Loan. To appeal for reconsideration, contact the Direct Loan Origination Center toll-free at 1-800-557-7394.   In the event a denial is final, the student may contact the Office of Financial Aid to request consideration for an additional Federal Direct Unsubsidized Loan. Freshman and Sophomores may be eligible for a maximum of $4,000 in additional funds, and Juniors and Seniors may be eligible for a maximum of $5,000 in additional funds. Please note: if at a later time during the academic year a parent becomes eligible or is approved with a co-signor for a Parent PLUS loan, the additional Unsubsidized Loan will be canceled.                                                                                                                                                                          I completed my Subsidized/Unsubsidized Master Promissory Note (MPN) on www.studentloans.gov. Why is it still requested on my Albert To Do list?                                                       Usually, this occurs when the subsidized and/or unsubsidized loans have not yet originated. Origination means that your loan data is being sent to the Department of Education for processing. The checklist item for the MPN will not update to a received status until the loan(s) successfully originate.                                                                                                                                                                          I am a transfer student and I completed my Subsidized/Unsubsidized MPN for my previous school. Do I have to do a new one for NYU?                                                       No, your completed Subsidized/Unsubsidized MPN can be used for your loans at NYU, provide they are still valid and in an active status.                                                                                                                                                                          I am a transfer student and I completed my Undergraduate Entrance Counseling for my previous school. Do I have to do a new one for NYU?                                                       No, your completed Undergraduate Entrance Counseling session can be used for your loans at NYU. However, you must contact NYU\u2019s Office of Financial Aid to let us know. Otherwise, we would not know that you ever completed one in the past and your Entrance Counseling checklist item on your Albert To Do list would stay in a requested status. Once we confirm that a counseling session was completed previously we will update your NYU records.                                                                                                                                                                          How does my parent borrower apply for a Federal Direct Parent PLUS Loan?                                                       You, the student, must start the process by accepting the offered Federal Direct Parent PLUS Loan on your Albert account. You can do so by logging in to Albert and then clicking on the Accept/Decline Financial Aid link and following the instructions.   Your parent borrower will be asked to complete the Federal Direct PLUS Loan Request and Master Promissory Note by visiting the Direct Loan Web site at www.studentloans.gov . They must sign in using the same PIN number that was assigned to them to access your FAFSA. If they do not remember their PIN, they may request a duplicate from the Official PIN site .   The U.S. Department of Education will conduct a credit check that is valid for only 90 days. Your parent borrower should not apply more than 90 days before the start of fall semester to avoid credit expiration.   Shortly after the PLUS Loan originates to the Department of Education, an email from the NYU Office of Financial Aid will be sent to the parent borrower (only if the PLUS Loan was credit approved). The approved parent must complete the PLUS Loan process by logging in to the NYU Student System as instructed in this email and by providing the dollar amount of the Parent PLUS Loan that is desired and the parent must actively accept the PLUS Loan on the same page.                                                                                                                                                                          Who completes the Master Promissory Note for my parent borrower\u2019s endorsed (co-signed) Parent PLUS Loan -- my parent or the endorser?                                                       Even if your parent borrower has had to obtain an endorser for their Federal Direct PLUS Loan, they are still the borrower on the loan. Therefore, the parent borrower must complete the MPN.                                                                                                                                                                          My parent borrower was approved for a Parent PLUS Loan by completing the PLUS Loan Request on www.studentloans.gov. Why did they receive an email from the Office of Financial Aid asking them to complete a PLUS Loan confirmation process?                                                       Federal regulations require a parent borrower to actively accept each Parent PLUS Loan and indicate the final amount they wish to accept for each loan. The email with instructions on completing the final PLUS Loan confirmation is sent to the parent borrower after the loan has been originated and we are in receipt of the approved credit decision. This is your parent borrower\u2019s opportunity to accept the loan for the amount that was originated or reduce the amount if they do not need the entire loan.   For subsequent PLUS Loans in your undergraduate career, your parent borrower may not be required to complete a new PLUS Loan Request on www.studentloans.gov , but they will be required to complete the final PLUS Loan confirmation process through our site.                                                                                                                                                                          Does my parent borrower have to complete a new Federal Direct PLUS Loan Master Promissory Note if . . .                                                       . . . they already did one for a previous school?   No, if your parent borrower has already completed a PLUS Loan MPN for any school (without an endorser) they do not have to complete a new one.   . . . they already did one for my PLUS loan from last year?   No, if your parent borrower was credit approved on their own for a Federal Direct PLUS Loan in a previous semester or year they do not have to complete a new one.   . . . their previous PLUS Loan was approved with an endorser (co-signer)?   Yes, if their previous PLUS Loan required an endorser for credit approval they must complete a new Master Promissory Note for the next PLUS Loan. This is because each endorsed (co-signed) Parent PLUS Loan must have its own MPN \u2013 the MPN for an endorsed loan cannot be used for any subsequent loan.                                                                                                                                                                          My parent borrower received a refund from the Parent PLUS Loan. Can they return the refund check if they do not need the funds?                                                       Yes. Parent borrowers have the right to cancel all or part of any disbursement of a federal Parent PLUS Loan without being charged interest and other loan fees as long as the cancellation is processed within 120 days of the original disbursement date. The disbursement date is the date the funds were applied to your NYU Bursar bill during any given semester.   To request a cancellation, they must make the request through the NYU Bursar\u2019s Office by completing a Request to Return Loan Funds Form and submitting it to the Bursar as instructed on the form.   If they wish to cancel all or part of any disbursement of their loan more than 120 days after it was disbursed, they are actually repaying part of their loan and they must pay any accrued interest and/or fees. They cannot cancel their loan, but they can make a payment directly to your federal loan servicer. Borrowers are assigned to one of the five servicers, which include ACS, Great Lakes, NelNet, PHEAA, and Sallie Mae. If they are not sure which of the five centers is their assigned servicer, visit and log into the federal government\u2019s National Student Loan Data System to determine their servicer. They may also call 1-800-4-FED-AID to locate your servicer.                                                                                                                                                                          I received a refund from my Subsidized/Unsubsidized loan. Can I return the refund check if I do not need the funds?                                                       Yes -- please see the FAQ above regarding parent borrowers returning refunds from a Parent PLUS Loan. The same rules apply to your Subsidized/Unsubsidized loan.
