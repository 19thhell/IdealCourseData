Students can act, direct, design, write and animate teacher resources attached to our TYA season. Recent productions have included Kindertransport and Alice: the Looking-glass Girl .    Students study the history and criticism of TYA and take internships with companies such as the New Victory Theatre on 42 nd Street. Playwriting courses are offered where students learn the craft of scripting TYA texts and workshop these in our experimental Black Box studio.    A storytelling season is offered annually where New York&rsquo;s finest artists perform for family audiences in the legendary, and newly renovated, Provincetown Playhouse . Students can study storytelling and learn the artistry which powers it.    A traveling troupe of student players, Shakespeare to Go , take clever cuts of the Bard around the New York City schools. Recent productions have included A Midsummer Night&rsquo;s Dream and Romeo and Juliet . Students take class in Shakespearean education, and collaborate with a youth ensemble dedicated to this effort. In the summer, our Looking for Shakespeare project brings young people from across the country who create their own adaptation of a classic play. In the process students study dramaturgy, playmaking, and theatre design.    Theatrix! the student run club offers the chance to experiment in TYA in a range of artistic modalities, from performer to producer. A play development series is offered each summer which bring to campus national and international playwrights who workshop original material with Educational Theatre students. Guest artists have included Jose Cruz Gonzalez, Louis Lowry, Diane Samuels, and Susan Zeder. Partnerships have been developed with cultural institutions such as the Kennedy Center.    Study abroad opportunities have occurred in Africa, Brazil, England and Ireland where students have studied TYA in urban and rural settings, such as the Unicorn Theatre and The Ark and visited venues like Stratford East, and attended shows at the Udderbelly. Graduates land impressive positions in worldwide TYA centers and cultural houses. Groundbreaking studies in TYA have been authored by NYU faculty and graduates.    Beyond TYA, the program offers courses in acting, directing, theatre design, and dramatic literature for adult populations. Students devise theatre for all ages, as well as refine their craft in indigenous, classic, and contemporary drama. The program is committed to building the next generation of teaching artists, and privileges the making, presenting and assessing of theatre. Courses in creative play, physical theatre, masks and puppetry, Brecht and Beckett, world drama, voice and speech for the actor are just a few which build the artistic repertoire of NYU Steinhardt Educational Theatre students.    A well-rounded curriculum in theatre for young audiences and play production sets our NYU program apart from other colleges, and prepares future leaders in the field.
