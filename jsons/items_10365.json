Speakers on the Square...in Brooklyn: NYU in Space    Featuring: Charlie Camarda (POLY &rsquo;74), Lee Morin (GSAS &rsquo;78, MED &rsquo;81, &rsquo;82), and Paolo Nespoli (POLY &rsquo;88)       Thursday, October 23, 2014    Thank you to all who joined us for Speakers on the Square... in Brooklyn: The Future of Space Exploration, which took place in Downtown Brooklyn at the NYU Polytechnic School of Engineering's Pfizer Auditorium on Thursday, October 23, 2014. The evening featured a moderated panel discussion with astronaut alumni Charlie Camarda (POLY &rsquo;74), Lee Morin (GSAS &rsquo;78, MED &rsquo;81, &rsquo;82), and Paolo Nespoli (POLY &rsquo;88). It was a pleasure to welcome NYU alumni to Brooklyn to discuss the topic of space exploration and the University&rsquo;s contribution to science and engineering.         Billy Crystal    Monday, September 15, 2014            With a shtick that hearkened back to a bygone era, renaissance man Billy Crystal (TSOA '70) would rightfully earn his place as one of Hollywood's most endearing stars. Comedian-actor-writer-director-producer-emcee-author, were all hats the perpetually peppy entertainer wore at one time or another. As a frequent host of the annual Academy Awards, Crystal also found himself regarded as arguably the best emcee the ceremony had ever had. In addition to onscreen efforts, Crystal would lend his vocal talents to the Disney/Pixar mega-hit Monsters, Inc . In 1984 when Crystal joined the cast of Saturday Night Live he took television by storm by creating the character Fernando, a superficial nightclub performer for whom everything is \"mahvelous.\" As either a performer or a personality, Crystal remains one of the most versatile, prolific and beloved figures in entertainment.      At this event, co-hosted with the Hudson Union Society, Crystal discussed the most powerful and memorable moments of his storied life and provided a roadmap to the absurdities and challenges that come along with aging. He reflected on everything from his legendary stint at Saturday Night Live , to making City Slickers , When Harry Met Sally , Analyze This , Monsters Inc ., to his long run as host of the Academy Awards.    Each paid attendee received Billy Crystal&rsquo;s paperback book Still Foolin&rsquo; &lsquo;Em , which is a triumphant counter punch to the indignities of aging, from the beloved comedian who for forty years has captured the anxieties and joys of many generations.       A Conversation with Mayor Bill de Blasio    Featuring: Bill de Blasio, Mayor of New York City (WSUC '84)       Thursday, April 17, 2014          NYU alumnus and current Mayor of New York City, Bill de Blasio (WSUC '84) joined us on campus for a conversation with NYU Trustee and alumna Maria Bartiromo (WSUC '89) and NYU students about his experiences at NYU, the issues facing New York City, and his vision for the future.    Mayor Bill de Blasio is the fourth NYU alumnus (and the first from outside of the Law School) to serve as the Mayor of New York City. We were so proud to welcome him back to his alma mater for this evening of conversation and celebration of NYU.      Joining him on stage was Maria Bartiromo (WSUC '89) to guide the evening's opening conversation, followed by a panel discussion with NYU students.    Mayor Bill de Blasio is the 109th Mayor of New York City. From his early days as a young City Hall staffer, to serving on his local school board, to his most recent position as Public Advocate for the City of New York, Bill de Blasio has spent his life fighting to ensure that every New Yorker&mdash;in every neighborhood throughout our five boroughs&mdash;gets a fair shot.      As mayor, Bill is committed to making sure every child gets a great education, protecting our streets and our communities, and building a city where New Yorkers from all five boroughs can start businesses, raise their families, and afford to live in their own neighborhoods.

Maria Bartiromo is a member of the Board of Trustees of New York University, the Board of Directors of the Young Global Leaders of the World Economic Forum, the Council on Foreign Relations, the Economic Club of New York and the Board of Directors of The National Italian American Foundation.      Maria graduated from New York University, where she studied journalism and economics. She has also served as an adjunct professor at NYU Stern School of Business.

She is the anchor of Opening Bell with Maria Bartiromo on FBN (9-11 AM/ET) and hosts Sunday Morning Futures with Maria Bartiromo, a Sunday business program (10 AM/ET) on FOX News Channel.       Eat, Drink, Vote: A Guide to Food Politics    Featuring: Marion Nestle, NYU Professor with Chair, Nutrition, Food Studies, and Public Health       Tuesday, March 25, 2014       What&rsquo;s wrong with the US food system? Why is half the world starving while the other half battles obesity? Who decides our food issues, and why can&rsquo;t we do better with labeling, safety, or school food? These are complex questions that are hard to answer in an engaging way for a broad audience. But everybody eats, and food politics affects us all.      See what happens when Nestle teams up with The Cartoonist Group syndicate to present some of her favorite cartoons on issues ranging from dietary advice to genetic engineering to childhood obesity. Using the cartoons as illustration and commentary, she engages on some of today&rsquo;s most pressing issues in food politics.       Baseball as a Road to God: Seeing Beyond the Game    Featuring: NYU President John Sexton    Thursday, May 9, 2013         For more than a decade, John Sexton has used baseball to illustrate the elements of spiritual life in a wildly popular undergraduate course at NYU. Using some of the great works of baseball fiction as well as the actual game's fantastic moments, its legendary characters, and its routine rituals, Sexton teaches that through the game we can touch the spiritual dimensions of life.      NYU President John Sexton; co-authors Tom Oliphant and Peter Schwartz; and longtime course instructor, Jim Traub; discussed the elements of our lives that lie beyond what can be captured in words alone&mdash;ineffable truths that we know by experience rather than by logic or analysis.          The Girls of Atomic City: The Untold Story of the Women Who Helped Win World War II    Featuring: Denise Kiernan (WSC '91, STEINHARDT '02) , Author    March 11, 2013         What you do here, What you see here, What you hear here, please let it stay here&hellip;    Imagine boarding a bus or train knowing that your destination was a total mystery. The only thing you&rsquo;ve been told is that your work will help end World War II, and that everything will be taken care of for you. This was the case for thousands of young women who were recruited by the US government in 1943 to serve the top-secret Manhattan Project. They came from across the East Coast and the South, from Alabama to Western Pennsylvania to New Jersey. Their destination was &ldquo;Site X,&rdquo; or Oak Ridge, TN&mdash;a secret city that appeared on no maps. The individuals working there, though they had no idea at the time, were enriching uranium for the first atomic bomb used in combat.    NYU alumna Denise Kiernan discussed The Girls of Atomic City , the never before told, true story of remarkable, hardworking, determined young women and the crucial role they played in one of the most significant moments in US history.          The Promise of Urban Science   The Role of NYU's New Center for Urban Science and Progress (CUSP)    On September 19, 2012, Steven Koonin, Director of CUSP, and Jerry Hultin, President of the Polytechnic Institute of NYU, gave a special lecture on why NYU CUSP is so critical, and how informatics applies to the study and operation of urban systems. The discussion highlighted the rationale, structure, and substance of the Center's work in conjunction with the urban experience that exists across all of NYU&mdash;specifically, how NYU and CUSP will enrich New York City, the lives of New Yorkers, and the world.       For the first time in history, more than half of the world's population lives in urban areas. In just a few more decades, 70 percent of the world's estimated nine billion people will live in cities. Enabling those cities to deliver services effectively, efficiently, and sustainably while promoting and improving their citizens' safety, health, prosperity, and creativity will be among the most important undertakings of this century.

Speakers on the Square...in Brooklyn: NYU in Space    Featuring: Charlie Camarda (POLY &rsquo;74), Lee Morin (GSAS &rsquo;78, MED &rsquo;81, &rsquo;82), and Paolo Nespoli (POLY &rsquo;88)       Thursday, October 23, 2014    Thank you to all who joined us for Speakers on the Square... in Brooklyn: The Future of Space Exploration, which took place in Downtown Brooklyn at the NYU Polytechnic School of Engineering's Pfizer Auditorium on Thursday, October 23, 2014. The evening featured a moderated panel discussion with astronaut alumni Charlie Camarda (POLY &rsquo;74), Lee Morin (GSAS &rsquo;78, MED &rsquo;81, &rsquo;82), and Paolo Nespoli (POLY &rsquo;88). It was a pleasure to welcome NYU alumni to Brooklyn to discuss the topic of space exploration and the University&rsquo;s contribution to science and engineering.         Billy Crystal    Monday, September 15, 2014            With a shtick that hearkened back to a bygone era, renaissance man Billy Crystal (TSOA '70) would rightfully earn his place as one of Hollywood's most endearing stars. Comedian-actor-writer-director-producer-emcee-author, were all hats the perpetually peppy entertainer wore at one time or another. As a frequent host of the annual Academy Awards, Crystal also found himself regarded as arguably the best emcee the ceremony had ever had. In addition to onscreen efforts, Crystal would lend his vocal talents to the Disney/Pixar mega-hit Monsters, Inc . In 1984 when Crystal joined the cast of Saturday Night Live he took television by storm by creating the character Fernando, a superficial nightclub performer for whom everything is \"mahvelous.\" As either a performer or a personality, Crystal remains one of the most versatile, prolific and beloved figures in entertainment.      At this event, co-hosted with the Hudson Union Society, Crystal discussed the most powerful and memorable moments of his storied life and provided a roadmap to the absurdities and challenges that come along with aging. He reflected on everything from his legendary stint at Saturday Night Live , to making City Slickers , When Harry Met Sally , Analyze This , Monsters Inc ., to his long run as host of the Academy Awards.    Each paid attendee received Billy Crystal&rsquo;s paperback book Still Foolin&rsquo; &lsquo;Em , which is a triumphant counter punch to the indignities of aging, from the beloved comedian who for forty years has captured the anxieties and joys of many generations.       A Conversation with Mayor Bill de Blasio    Featuring: Bill de Blasio, Mayor of New York City (WSUC '84)       Thursday, April 17, 2014          NYU alumnus and current Mayor of New York City, Bill de Blasio (WSUC '84) joined us on campus for a conversation with NYU Trustee and alumna Maria Bartiromo (WSUC '89) and NYU students about his experiences at NYU, the issues facing New York City, and his vision for the future.    Mayor Bill de Blasio is the fourth NYU alumnus (and the first from outside of the Law School) to serve as the Mayor of New York City. We were so proud to welcome him back to his alma mater for this evening of conversation and celebration of NYU.      Joining him on stage was Maria Bartiromo (WSUC '89) to guide the evening's opening conversation, followed by a panel discussion with NYU students.    Mayor Bill de Blasio is the 109th Mayor of New York City. From his early days as a young City Hall staffer, to serving on his local school board, to his most recent position as Public Advocate for the City of New York, Bill de Blasio has spent his life fighting to ensure that every New Yorker&mdash;in every neighborhood throughout our five boroughs&mdash;gets a fair shot.      As mayor, Bill is committed to making sure every child gets a great education, protecting our streets and our communities, and building a city where New Yorkers from all five boroughs can start businesses, raise their families, and afford to live in their own neighborhoods.

Maria Bartiromo is a member of the Board of Trustees of New York University, the Board of Directors of the Young Global Leaders of the World Economic Forum, the Council on Foreign Relations, the Economic Club of New York and the Board of Directors of The National Italian American Foundation.

Eat, Drink, Vote: A Guide to Food Politics    Featuring: Marion Nestle, NYU Professor with Chair, Nutrition, Food Studies, and Public Health       Tuesday, March 25, 2014       What&rsquo;s wrong with the US food system? Why is half the world starving while the other half battles obesity? Who decides our food issues, and why can&rsquo;t we do better with labeling, safety, or school food? These are complex questions that are hard to answer in an engaging way for a broad audience. But everybody eats, and food politics affects us all.      See what happens when Nestle teams up with The Cartoonist Group syndicate to present some of her favorite cartoons on issues ranging from dietary advice to genetic engineering to childhood obesity. Using the cartoons as illustration and commentary, she engages on some of today&rsquo;s most pressing issues in food politics.       Baseball as a Road to God: Seeing Beyond the Game    Featuring: NYU President John Sexton    Thursday, May 9, 2013         For more than a decade, John Sexton has used baseball to illustrate the elements of spiritual life in a wildly popular undergraduate course at NYU. Using some of the great works of baseball fiction as well as the actual game's fantastic moments, its legendary characters, and its routine rituals, Sexton teaches that through the game we can touch the spiritual dimensions of life.      NYU President John Sexton; co-authors Tom Oliphant and Peter Schwartz; and longtime course instructor, Jim Traub; discussed the elements of our lives that lie beyond what can be captured in words alone&mdash;ineffable truths that we know by experience rather than by logic or analysis.          The Girls of Atomic City: The Untold Story of the Women Who Helped Win World War II    Featuring: Denise Kiernan (WSC '91, STEINHARDT '02) , Author    March 11, 2013         What you do here, What you see here, What you hear here, please let it stay here&hellip;    Imagine boarding a bus or train knowing that your destination was a total mystery. The only thing you&rsquo;ve been told is that your work will help end World War II, and that everything will be taken care of for you. This was the case for thousands of young women who were recruited by the US government in 1943 to serve the top-secret Manhattan Project. They came from across the East Coast and the South, from Alabama to Western Pennsylvania to New Jersey. Their destination was &ldquo;Site X,&rdquo; or Oak Ridge, TN&mdash;a secret city that appeared on no maps. The individuals working there, though they had no idea at the time, were enriching uranium for the first atomic bomb used in combat.    NYU alumna Denise Kiernan discussed The Girls of Atomic City , the never before told, true story of remarkable, hardworking, determined young women and the crucial role they played in one of the most significant moments in US history.          The Promise of Urban Science   The Role of NYU's New Center for Urban Science and Progress (CUSP)    On September 19, 2012, Steven Koonin, Director of CUSP, and Jerry Hultin, President of the Polytechnic Institute of NYU, gave a special lecture on why NYU CUSP is so critical, and how informatics applies to the study and operation of urban systems. The discussion highlighted the rationale, structure, and substance of the Center's work in conjunction with the urban experience that exists across all of NYU&mdash;specifically, how NYU and CUSP will enrich New York City, the lives of New Yorkers, and the world.       For the first time in history, more than half of the world's population lives in urban areas. In just a few more decades, 70 percent of the world's estimated nine billion people will live in cities. Enabling those cities to deliver services effectively, efficiently, and sustainably while promoting and improving their citizens' safety, health, prosperity, and creativity will be among the most important undertakings of this century.

More than any other architectural firm in the early 20th century, McKim, Mead, and White put their stamp on New York City by creating memorable Beaux-Arts buildings such as the former Pennsylvania Station, Brooklyn Museum, and the second Madison Square Garden, as well as the Washington Square arch and NYU's University Heights campus.
