The CORE is comprised of four areas of the liberal arts:       Expository Writing    Foreign Language    Foundations of Contemporary Culture    Foundations of Scientific Inquiry       Descriptions of these areas and courses which fulfill the requirements are listed below. Some of these requirements can also be fulfilled through Advanced Placement test scores.    Expository Writing    Media, Culture, and Communication students must complete two courses in expository writing and pass the Writing Proficiency Examination.    Freshmen students who complete EXPOS-UA 0001, Writing the Essay, with a grade of \"C\" or better are certified as proficient, and are not required to sit for the exam. In addition, students must enroll in and successfully complete ACE-UE 0110, The Advanced College Essay: Education and the Professions.    Students enrolled in the Higher Education Opportunity Programs (HEOP) completing 0005 and 0006 (Prose Writing I and II) with grades of \"C\" or better are deemed proficient.    Transfer students entering the Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development must pass the Proficiency Examination administered by the Expository Writing Program. This exam determines whether additional coursework in Expository Writing will be required for proficiency certification and is given during orientation. Transfer students who pass the examination and transfer in two courses in writing composition or the equivalent will not be required to complete additional course work in expository writing.    If the students pass and transfer in only one course, they will be required to complete EXPOS-UA 0001, Writing the Essay. The course, Writing the Essay, is significantly different from most writing courses students have taken at two and four year colleges and provides the foundation for writing in the university.    If the students fail and have received transfer credit for either one or two courses in expository writing or the equivalent, they will be required to complete at least one expository writing course, EXPOS-UA 0013 (Writing Tutorial), or EXPOS-UA 0004 (International Writing Workshop 1) as determined by the Expository Writing Program.    Placement may vary depending on the writing issues present in the examination. Students who achieve a letter grade of \"C\" or above in Writing Tutorial are certified as proficient. Students who do not achieve a \"C\" or above must take the Proficiency Exam.    International Students completing EXPOS-UA 0004/0009 (International Writing Workshop 1/International Writing Workshop 2) will take the proficiency examination at the end of their writing-course sequence. If the students fail, they will be required to complete one expository writing course, EXPOS-UA 0013, Writing Tutorial.    Foreign Languages    Media, Culture, and Communication students must complete two semesters of foreign language. MCC students are not exempt from the foreign language requirement but may satisfy it through AP test scores .    Students who will register for any language with which they have prior experience (studied in high school, college or study abroad programs or who are bilingual or multilingual) are required to take a placement examination to determine which level is appropriate.    Placement exams are offered during the first week of classes as well as once a month throughout the semester. The placement test schedule is available at nyu.edu/cas/placementexams .    Foundations of Contemporary Culture    The Foundations of Contemporary Culture (FCC) sequence of the College Core Curriculum is a series of four coordinated courses in the humanities and social sciences. Within each of the four offerings, students are free to pursue their particular interests through their choice of individual classes offered through the CORE plan in the College of Arts and Science or options in Steinhardt's Liberal Arts Core (see course listings below). The four course headings are: Texts and Ideas, Cultures and Contexts, Societies and the Social Sciences, and Expressive Cultures.    Texts and Ideas This requirement can be satisfied through the following courses or AP test scores:       AP American History, European History or World History with a score of 4 or 5       NYUSteinhardt courses that will satisfy the Texts and Ideas requirement:       PHED-UE 10 / LIBAR-UE 501 Learning and the Meaning of Life       All other options for these courses are offered through CAS's College Core Curriculum .    Cultures and Contexts There are NO Advanced Placement test scores that satisfy this requirement. All other options for these courses are offered through CAS's College Core Curriculum .    Societies and the Social Sciences This requirement can be satisfied through the following courses or AP test scores:       AP Macroeconomics, Microeconomics, Politics, or Psychology with a score of 4 or 5       NYU Steinhardt courses that will satisfy the Societies and the Social Sciences requirement:       SOED-UE 0020 / LIBAR-UE 0202 Power, Resistance, Identity: American Social Movements    SOED-UE 1030 / LIBAR-UE 0201 Art and the City: A Sociological Perspective    INTE-UE 1545 / LIBAR-UE 0531 Interdisciplinary Perspectives on the New Immigration    HSED-UE 1033 / LIBAR-UE 0551 Culture Wars in America    HSED-UE 0610 / LIBAR-UE 0552 Education and the American Dreams: Historical Perspectives    HSED-UE 1010 / LIBAR-UE 0553 History of Professions in the United States    HSED-UE 1005 / LIBAR-UE 0554 Introduction to Education: Historical and Contemporary Perspectives    APSY-UE 0010 / LIBAR-UE 0631 Survey of Developmental Psychology    APSY-UE 0019 / LIBAR-UE 0632 Introduction to Personality Theories    APSY-UE 1271 / APSY-UE 1271 Developmental Psychology Across the Lifespan       College of Arts &amp; Sciences Departmental courses that will satisfy the Societies and the Social Sciences requirement:       ANTH-UA 0001 Human Society and Culture (Anthropology)    ANTH-UA 0003 Archaeology: Early Societies and Cultures (Anthropology)    SCA-UA 0001 Concepts in Social and Cultural Analysis (Social and Cultural Analysis)    SCA-UA 0401 Approaches to Gender and Sexuality Studies (Social and Cultural Analysis)    SCA-UA 0601 Introduction to Metropolitan Studies (Social and Cultural Analysis)    ECON-UA 9001 Economic Principles I (P) (Economics)    ECON-UA 9002 Economic Principles II (P) (Economics)    POLSC-AD 0156 Power and Politics in America (Politics)    POLSC-AD 0150 Comparative Politics (Politics)    HIST-UA 0009 U.S. History to 1865 (History)    HIST-UA 0010 Modern America (History)    LING-UA 0001 Language (Linguistics)    LING-UA 0015 Language and Society (Linguistics)    LING-UA 0047 The Language of America's Ethnic Minorities (Linguistics)    LING-UA 0030 Language in Latin America (Linguistics)    LING-UA 0058 Introduction to African Languages (Linguistics)    LING-UA 9058 Introduction to African Languages (Linguistics)    PSYCH-UA 0001 Introduction to Psychology (Psychology)    RELST-UA 0001 Theories and Methods in the Study of Religion (Religious Studies)    SOC-UA 0001 Introduction to Sociology (Sociology)    SOC-UA 0002 Introduction to Sociology (Honors) (Sociology)    SOC-UA 0135 Race and Ethnicity (Sociology)    SOC-UA 0205 Social Movements, Protest and Conflict (Sociology)    SOC-UA 0386 Ideas and Institutions in American Society (Sociology)    SOC-UA 0417 Sociology of Law (Sociology)       Expressive Culture This requirement can be satisfied through the following courses or AP test scores:       AP English Literature with a score of 4 or 5       NYUSteinhardt departmental courses that will satisfy the Expressive Cultures requirement:       ARTCR-UE 0010 / LIBAR-UE 0941 Art: Practice and Ideas    ARTCR-UE 0055 / LIBAR-UE 0942 Art of Now    ARTCR-UE 0152 / LIBAR-UE 0943 Internet and Contemporary Art    MPAET-UE 0060 / LIBAR-UE 0171 Introduction to Theatre as Art Form for Non-Majors       CAS departmental courses that will satisfy the Expressive Culture requirement:       COLIT-UA 0110 Tragedy    COLIT-UA 0111 Comedy    ARTH-UA 0001 History of Western Art I    ARTH-UA 0002 History of Western Art II    FREN-UA 0166/0866 La Belle &Eacute;poque    GERM-UA 0152 Introduction to German Literature       All other options for these courses are offered through CAS's College Core Curriculum .    Foundations of Scientific Inquiry    The Foundations of Scientific Inquiry (FSI) is a series of three coordinated courses in quantitative reasoning and the natural sciences. The three areas are Quantitative Reasoning, Natural Sciences I, and Natural Sciences II. Together, these courses ensure that every student gains a fundamental understanding of how mathematics and laboratory experimentation advance scientific investigation. While some students acquire this background through other coursework, FSI courses are especially designed to meet the need of non-science students.

The CORE is comprised of four areas of the liberal arts:       Expository Writing    Foreign Language    Foundations of Contemporary Culture    Foundations of Scientific Inquiry       Descriptions of these areas and courses which fulfill the requirements are listed below. Some of these requirements can also be fulfilled through Advanced Placement test scores.    Expository Writing    Media, Culture, and Communication students must complete two courses in expository writing and pass the Writing Proficiency Examination.    Freshmen students who complete EXPOS-UA 0001, Writing the Essay, with a grade of \"C\" or better are certified as proficient, and are not required to sit for the exam. In addition, students must enroll in and successfully complete ACE-UE 0110, The Advanced College Essay: Education and the Professions.    Students enrolled in the Higher Education Opportunity Programs (HEOP) completing 0005 and 0006 (Prose Writing I and II) with grades of \"C\" or better are deemed proficient.    Transfer students entering the Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development must pass the Proficiency Examination administered by the Expository Writing Program. This exam determines whether additional coursework in Expository Writing will be required for proficiency certification and is given during orientation. Transfer students who pass the examination and transfer in two courses in writing composition or the equivalent will not be required to complete additional course work in expository writing.    If the students pass and transfer in only one course, they will be required to complete EXPOS-UA 0001, Writing the Essay. The course, Writing the Essay, is significantly different from most writing courses students have taken at two and four year colleges and provides the foundation for writing in the university.    If the students fail and have received transfer credit for either one or two courses in expository writing or the equivalent, they will be required to complete at least one expository writing course, EXPOS-UA 0013 (Writing Tutorial), or EXPOS-UA 0004 (International Writing Workshop 1) as determined by the Expository Writing Program.    Placement may vary depending on the writing issues present in the examination. Students who achieve a letter grade of \"C\" or above in Writing Tutorial are certified as proficient. Students who do not achieve a \"C\" or above must take the Proficiency Exam.    International Students completing EXPOS-UA 0004/0009 (International Writing Workshop 1/International Writing Workshop 2) will take the proficiency examination at the end of their writing-course sequence. If the students fail, they will be required to complete one expository writing course, EXPOS-UA 0013, Writing Tutorial.    Foreign Languages    Media, Culture, and Communication students must complete two semesters of foreign language. MCC students are not exempt from the foreign language requirement but may satisfy it through AP test scores .    Students who will register for any language with which they have prior experience (studied in high school, college or study abroad programs or who are bilingual or multilingual) are required to take a placement examination to determine which level is appropriate.    Placement exams are offered during the first week of classes as well as once a month throughout the semester. The placement test schedule is available at nyu.edu/cas/placementexams .    Foundations of Contemporary Culture    The Foundations of Contemporary Culture (FCC) sequence of the College Core Curriculum is a series of four coordinated courses in the humanities and social sciences. Within each of the four offerings, students are free to pursue their particular interests through their choice of individual classes offered through the CORE plan in the College of Arts and Science or options in Steinhardt's Liberal Arts Core (see course listings below). The four course headings are: Texts and Ideas, Cultures and Contexts, Societies and the Social Sciences, and Expressive Cultures.

Foundations of Scientific Inquiry    The Foundations of Scientific Inquiry (FSI) is a series of three coordinated courses in quantitative reasoning and the natural sciences. The three areas are Quantitative Reasoning, Natural Sciences I, and Natural Sciences II. Together, these courses ensure that every student gains a fundamental understanding of how mathematics and laboratory experimentation advance scientific investigation. While some students acquire this background through other coursework, FSI courses are especially designed to meet the need of non-science students. Within each of the three offerings, students are free to pursue their particular interests through their choice of individual classes.

Certificate Program in Culture and Media     The Departments of Anthropology and Cinema Studies offer a specialized joint course of study leading to a New York State Certificate in Culture and Media for NYU graduate students who are also pursuing their PhD degrees in Anthropology or Cinema Studies. The program\u2019s philosophy takes a broad approach to the relationships   between culture and media in a number of domains including: ethnographic   film\u2019s significance for the fields of anthropology and cinema/media   studies; problems in representation of cultures through media; the   development of media in indigenous, Diaspora, and non-Western   communities; the emerging social and cultural formations shaped by new   media practices; the political economy shaping the production,   distribution and consumption of media worldwide; and the impact of new   media technologies on these processes.   This graduate program provides a focused course of studies   integrating production with theory and research. Training in this   program will enable students to pursue the following:   -Production work in state-of-the-art digital video based on their   own research, resulting in a twenty-thirty minute documentary.

[7]/[8] ANTH GA 1218-19 &amp; ANTH GA 1218-19    VIDEO PRODUCTION SEMINAR (Stout/Furjanic/Vail) 8 PTS   (Prerequisite: Sight and Sound Documentary or equivalent)         COURSE DESCRIPTIONS (REQUIRED)    CULTURE &amp; MEDIA I (Ganti/Ginsburg)    This course offers a critical revision of the history of the genre of ethnographic film, the central debates it has engaged around cross-cultural representation, and the theoretical and cinematic responses to questions of the screen representation of culture, from the early romantic constructions of Robert Flaherty to current work in film, television and video on the part of indigenous people throughout the world. Ethnographic film has a peculiar and highly contested status within anthropology, cinema studies, and documentary practice. In this seminar, we will situate ethnographic film within the wider project of the representation of cultural lives, and especially \"natives\". Starting with what are regarded as the first examples of the genre, we will examine how these emerged in a particular intellectual context and political economy. We will then consider the key works that have defined the genre, and the epistemological and formal innovations associated with them, addressing questions concerning social theory, documentary, as well as the institutional structures through which they are funded, distributed, and seen by various audiences. Throughout the course we will keep in mind the properties of film as a signifying practice, its status as a form of anthropological knowledge, and the ethical and political concerns raised by cross-cultural representation.   CULTURE &amp; MEDIA II: ETHNOGRAPHY OF MEDIA (Ginsburg/Ganti)    In the last decade, a new field \u2014 the ethnography of media \u2014 has emerged as an exciting new arena of research. While claims about media in peoples lives are made on a daily basis, surprisingly little research has actually attempted to look at how media is part of the naturally occurring lived realities of people\u2019s lives. In the last decade, anthropologists and media scholars interested in film, television, and video have been turning their attention increasingly beyond the text and empiricist notions of audiences, (stereotypically associated with the ethnography of media), to consider, ethnographically, the complex social worlds in which media is produced, circulated and consumed, at home and elsewhere. This work theorizes media studies from the point of view of cross-cultural ethnographic realities and anthropology from the perspective of new spaces of communication focusing on the social, economic and political life of media and how it makes a difference in the daily lives of people as a practice, whether in production, reception, or circulation.    The class will be organized around case studies that interrogate broader issues that are particularly endemic to questions of cross-cultural media including debates over cultural imperialism vs. the autonomy of local producers/consumers, the instability and stratification of reception, the shift from national to transnational circuits of production and consumption, the increasing complicity of researchers with their subjects over representations of culture, and the historically and culturally contingent ways in which images are read and used. These concerns are addressed in a variety of locations, from the complex circulation of films, photos, and lithographs, to the ever increasing range of televisual culture \u2014 from state sponsored melodramas, religious epics and soap operas, to varieties of public television; to the activist use of video, radio, the internet, and small media.    CULTURAL THEORY AND THE DOCUMENTARY (Toby Lee)    This course considers the actual and possible forms of relation between theories of culture and society and the mode of nonfiction cinema known as (social) documentary. From one perspective, theory is a discourse of explanation that is applied, concurrently or retroactively, to the images of culture presented in documentary films: films present raw material of culture to be theorized aesthetically, sociologically, psychologically, historically, politically, and so on. But at the same time, documentary filmmaking can be conceived as an intellectual discourse, what its founders called \u201ca method of philosophic reasoning\u201d (Paul Rotha), one meant to reflect or challenge certain cultural and social ideas. Despite the order of terms in the title of this course, what theory means to documentary, and vice versa, has always been an open question. This course explores various ways to answer the question.    SIGHT AND SOUND DOCUMENTARY (SUMMER COURSE) (Marco Williams)    The intensive six week summer course teaches students to look at their world and to develop the ability to create compelling and dramatic stories in which real people are the characters and real life is the plot. Through close study and analysis of feature length and short documentaries, and hands-on directing, shooting, sound-recording, editing and re-editing, students will rigorously explore the possibilities and the power of non-fiction story telling for film and video. The course is a dynamic combination of individual and group production work, in which each student will be expected to complete five projects. While tuition is covered, please be advised that there is a lab fee of approximately $600.   VIDEO PRODUCTION SEMINAR (Stout/Furjanic/Vail )    A two-semester seminar that provides training and equipment for advanced graduate students to produce a media ethnography or short documentary. During the fall semester, in-class instruction, lab exercises, and readings introduce digital audio and video production, including shooting and editing with HD cameras, professional audio equipment, and Final Cut Pro non-linear editing systems. Focusing on ethnographic media practices, students also address key representational, methodological, and ethical issues in the production of ethnographic documentary. By the completion of the fall term, students will have chosen a topic and field site for their final projects and completed a short video (5-10 minutes). During the spring semester, students continue to work intensively on their projects by shooting, editing, and screening their footage. The course culminates in a public screening of students\u2019 completed, 20-30 min. ethnographic documentaries. Attendance in class and lab sessions is mandatory, and students who fail to complete all fall assignments will not be allowed to register for the spring semester. Students should come into the class with a well-developed project idea.    THE SEMINAR IS RESTRICTED TO STUDENTS IN THE PROGRAM IN CULTURE AND MEDIA. IT IS LIMITED TO TEN STUDENTS AND REQUIRES PERMISSION OF THE INSTRUCTOR. Culture &amp; Media I and Sight and Sound Documentary (summer session) are mandatory pre-requisites. There is no lab fee, but students are expected to provide their own videotapes. For a list of recent student documentaries click here.    SELECTED ELECTIVE COURSES/ CINEMA STUDIES and ANTHROPOLOGY/FALL 2014       Culture, Meaning and Society ANTH-GA 1222 (Rogers) This introduction to sociocultural anthropology is designed for graduate students working primarily in other disciplines, and is intended to give them a grasp of specifically anthropological ways of defining researchable questions, collecting data, and drawing inference. In the first half of the semester, we will consider the 20thcentury development of some of the basic concepts and practices that have defined the discipline (notably the culture concept, ethnographic fieldwork methods). In the second half of the semester, we will read a series of recent ethnographic case-studies to further explore current anthropological approaches to a selection of specific topics. These will be chosen largely as a function of student interests, but may include gender, religion, education, among others. *** Open only to non-Anthropology Graduate students.  Documentary Traditions CINE GT 1400 (Bagnall) Mondays 6:20 \u2013 9 PM   Fourteen sessions are devoted to a comparison of current documentaries with those made in earlier decades to illustrate how the art has responded to social, political, and economic realities and to changes in technology and systems of distribution. Undergraduates who take the course for 3 points are required to keep journals in which they respond to each session and compare observations with those made when viewing at least one documentary of their choice seen outside class, as well as in response to critical essays provided at each session and references in the text. Those wishing to earn an extra point (register for one point of H56.1097 Independent Study) may write a substantial term paper based on a topic approved by the instructor. French New Wave CINE GT 1513 (Stam) This course offers an historical and critical overview of one of the most dynamic and influential film movements within the history of the cinema -- the French New Wave \u2013 a movement that has influenced filmmakers all over the world. After examining the philosophical underpinnings of the movement in philosophical existentialism (Jean-Paul Sartre, Simone de Beauvoir) and the theoretical underpinnings in the film criticism of Cahiers du Cinema, we will examine key films and directors. We will explore the three core groups that together formed the New Wave, notably 1) the Cahiers directors (Truffaut, Godard, Chabrol, Rivette, Rohmer); 2) the Left Bank directors (Resnais, Duras, Varda, Marker); and 3) Cinema Verite (Jean Rouch, Edgar Morin). While we will focus largely on the films themselves, we will situate New Wave films within a broader spectrum of philosophy, literature, and the art. Some key themes in the course will be: first-person auteur cinema; artistic modernism and the New Wave; the relation between film and the other arts; the revolution in film language; the filmic adaptation of novels; and feminism and the New Wave; race, gender and sexuality; the evolution of style; and the political evolution leading up to the near-revolution of May 1968. The course will approach the New Wave through 1) critical writing, including by the directors themselves; 2) the screening of a chronologically arranged series of feature films; and 3) the analysis of short clips related to the larger themes. The goal of the course is for students to gain an overall sense of the historical importance of the New Wave, of the characteristic styles and themes of the key directors, and of some of the theories that circulated around such films. Topics in Documentary Film CINE GT 2002 (Lee) The term \"expanded documentary\" points both to the ways in which traditional documentary practices have diversified and transformed over the last few decades, particularly with changes in media technologies, as well as to different ways we might re-examine other film, media and art traditions through the lens of documentary practice. In this course, we consider how the documentary impulse functions in film, video, animation, sound; in the gallery, in the archive, in public space, in cyberspace; in forms linear and nonlinear, online and off. We also investigate the role of documentation in relation to performance and social practice art. In tracing these variations of documentary practice over time, we approach these expanded forms of non-fiction media not as addenda to documentary traditions, but rather as opportunities to reflect critically on those traditions, to connect present developments to historical precedents, and to pry open our sense of documentary as form, endeavor and practice. (Cross-listed with CINE-UT 417) Nonfiction Film History CINE GT 2307 (Streible, TBA) This course introduces students to the study of nonfiction film. It explores the history and theory of nonfiction cinema, including\u2014but not limited to\u2014documentary film. The established milestones of the international tradition of documentary\u2014from the romantic mythmaking of Robert Flaherty to the leftist collectives and state propaganda projects of the 1930s and 1940s, through cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9 of the 1960s and the activist and personal styles of recent decades\u2014are considered. But the course also places documentary in a broader context that includes forms of nonfiction typically segregated from the traditional conception of documentary. Some are somewhat familiar forms, such as actualities, travelogues, and newsreels. Others have been largely ignored by scholars until quite recently: sponsored, industrial, educational, scientific, and medical films; home movies and other amateur films; outtakes and other archival footage. Viewed both as discrete works of cinema and as artifacts of social and cultural significance, such orphaned films pose problems of history, culture, and aesthetics that challenge traditional conceptions of making, viewing, and studying films. Students read primary historical sources, as well as new scholarly approaches to the global history of nonfiction film, and to the possible uses and meanings of this vast archive.   Adv. Sem. Paradigms of Globalization CINE GT 2835 (Choi) This course examines multiple histories, structures, theories and key concepts of globalization, linking them with issues in the nation-state, post/modernity, post/colonialism, cultural imperialism, post/Fordism, empire, and trans/national identities. It brings together different forms of knowledge from anthropology, sociology, cultural studies, and political economy to bear on film and media studies troubled by geo-cultural uncertainty and convergence. ***Those students interested in taking this seminar should email JungBong Choi at jbc7@nyu.edu . The email should state your status in the grad program, any relevant past courses/ reading/ research, your particular interest in the seminar, and particular project, if any, that you would like to work on during the seminar. Adv. Sem. Comparative Post-colonialism CINE GT 3207 (Stam) Alongside and in the aftermath of the \"culture wars\" in the United States, many battle lines, national and transnational, have formed around such inter-related issues as \"postcoloniality,\" \"comparative imperialism,\"\"critical race\" and so forth. Challenged and debated from many directions, the terms themselves have become subject to diverse political force-fields, in some ways becoming sliding signifiers onto which diverse groups project their hopes and fears, their fantasies and anxieties. Our seminar will focus on the ways these debates are articulated differently in three zones: the Anglo-American, the French and Francophone, and the Brazilian Lusophone. What will interest us specifically will be the process of translation through which the debates are filtered. How do the debates\"travel\" and what happens to them during the voyage? What happens in the movement from one geographical space and cultural semantics into another? How do these movements translate? What are the different vocabularies? How do the terms themselves shift political and epistemological valence? What happens, then, when \"multiculturalism\" or\"postcoloniality,\" for example, are seen through other national grids, or enter other \"intellectual fields?\" How are \"out-of-place\" ideas reinvoiced, indigenized, co-opted, contained, hybridized, recontextualized, resisted? What is elided or added, or subtly changed, in the process of cross-cultural translation? How do the debates get grafted onto other, preexisting debates? What are the mirrors and grids and prisms through which the debates are seen? What is the role of national narcissism and exceptionalism? What anxieties and Utopians come into play when debates travel? Our approach throughout will be transdisciplinary, drawing on cultural studies, media studies, literary theory, and so forth.We will address the ways that popular culture can filter and reframe the debates. Popular culture, in this sense, will be invoked as illustrative of our larger themes but also as a form of intellectual/cultural agency in a globalized world. ***Those students interested in taking this seminar should email Robert Stam at rps1@nyu.edu by April 15. The email should state your status in the grad program, any relevant past courses/reading/research, your particular interest in the seminar, and particular project, if any, that you would like to work on during the seminar.
