Aphrodisias is one of the most important archaeological sites of the Greek and Roman periods in Turkey. The city was famous in antiquity for its cult of Aphrodite and for its marble sculptors. It enjoyed a long, prosperous existence from the second century BCE through the sixth century CE, and its buildings, marble sculpture, and public inscriptions are remarkably well preserved. The excavations document the social history and visual culture of an ancient city in unusually fine detail.      The site has been investigated systematically by the NYU project since 1961, first under the direction of the late Professor Kenan Erim, and since 1991 that of Professor R.R.R. Smith. The current project focuses on the recording and conservation of previously excavated monuments, on establishing permanent systems for the documentation and conservation, and on targeted new excavations \u2013 as well as on scientific research and publication.    NYU Excavations at Aphrodisias are sponsored by the Institute of Fine Arts in cooperation with the Faculty of Arts and Science, NYU and receives invaluable support from private individuals, foundations, and corporations    To help support the NYU Excavations at Aphrodisias you may donate now online, or for more information about becoming a Friend of Aphrodisias, contact the Aphrodisias Office at 212-992-5877 or email: aphrodisias.info@nyu.edu .
