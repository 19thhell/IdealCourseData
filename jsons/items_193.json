Hoffman was granted the Grand Jury Best Actress award and, now, Stewart and the film's producer, Stern MBA student Alex Scharfman, have announced plans to distribute the feature for free via the film's website.      http://www.lylemovie.com/    The decision to eschew more traditional sales and distribution paths for feature films is still innovative, but of increasing interest and value to members of the Graduate Film community. Tisch's Cinema Research Institute has been exploring similar distribution options through the work of http://missionmosaic.wix.com/cinemaresearchinst#!forests-blog/cnpg \">Forest Conner , Artel Great , Josh Penn, and Michael Gottwald . Stewart's decision to take her latest feature directly to audiences is therefore a highly-anticipated and exciting venture for all independent filmmakers and advocates for independent artists.

Women. Comedy. Read On!                          Last week Indiewire caught up with Grad Film alumnae AnnaRose King and Jennifer Suhr to talk about their newly distributed web series - AMERICAN VIRAL , women in modern comedy writing, and how they've found ways to make movies and television through their all-female film collective, LaTiDa.     AMERICAN VIRAL: writer/director Shandor Garrison (Grad Film alumnus), writer/director Jennifer Suhr, lead actress Zandy Hartig, and writer/director AnnaRose King     Here's a hint at their intelligent and insightful interview (qualities that surprise no one who's met AnnaRose and Jennifer):    The great thing about web series is that...it's much more egalitarian. The networks tend to play it safe, and I get it because they're investing money, but you also want to see them try to do stuff that can prove that, oh people like funny dudes but they like funny women as well. The more they can see that with people making their own stuff and getting a response, the easier that it gets. - J.S.    I think the thing I find most exciting about whole featured content and this independent culture is that you have people actually who are the creators on the ground level, creating stories and shaping how storytelling is going. They\u2019re profiling and showing atypical characters, atypical leading ladies, leading male characters. - A.K.

Together, the filmmaker and executive will develop the project submitted during the application process. HBO will provide a series of master classes taught by HBO executives and creative talent.    At the completion of the development process, each project will be considered for production as a 10-15 minute film or a series of webisodes to air on various HBO platforms including, but not limited to, HBO GO, HBO, HBO's YouTube channel, HBO.com, film festivals, charity screenings and other outlets.

Professor Schock embodies the essence of the Tisch faculty: she is a committed educator and a working industry professional.    In 2011, Schock was appointed as an assistant arts professor in the Graduate Film program. She served as head of the directing area and is known for developing strong writing, directing, and directing the actor curricula. Currently, she is co-adapting the Miles Wilson story On Tour with Max, a feature-length indie film with Rex Pickett, author of Sideways, and also a television pilot, The Plains, with Norm Leonard. Schock is a member of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, and since 2005 has served on the invitation-only Executive Committee for Short Films and Feature Animation. She is a contributor to Filmmaker magazine.    Prior to coming to New York, Schock taught at Tisch Asia for three years, overseeing the writing curriculum and second-year studies. She previously taught at Chapman University and was an invited guest lecturer at Aalto University (Helsinki) and the California Institute for the Arts.    Schock was vice president of production at Joan Micklin Silver\u2019s Silverfilm Productions, where she oversaw the development of screenplays from Pulitzer Prize winning playwright Lynn Nottage and novelist Alan Furst.    In 2000, Schock directed Pickett\u2019s My Mother Dreams the Satan\u2019s Disciples in New York and earned the Academy Award\u00ae for Best Short Film (Live Action). The film won over 15 awards from various festivals and organizations, including the DGA\u2019s prestigious Ida Lupino Award.    Schock was the assistant to David Fincher when he directed Alien 3 in London for 20th Century Fox. She also was also the assistant to producer Michael Nozik on TriStar\u2019s Thunderheart directed by Michael Apted.

She was a student of the late, legendary film critic Manny Farber, whom she credits as her foremost influence.    Professor Schock lives in Manhattan with her husband, John Martin, and their 14-year old daughter, Ingrid.    While I ask you to join me in welcoming Professor Schock to her role as chair, I also take this opportunity to thank John Tintori for nine transformative years as chair. He hands over to Barbara a department of outstanding faculty and a well-earned, stellar international reputation.

New York\u2019s University\u2019s Graduate Film Program has announced the selections for the 3rd annual Purple List, a short list of the best feature screenplays generated from within the Graduate Film community:           Dagny is a 3rd Year Graduate Film student , Laura and Abu are 4th Year Thesis Grad Film students , and Brett is an alumnus of the Graduate Film Program.    The 2014 Annual Purple List was selected by a panel of industry experts including this year documentary filmmaker Eugene Jarecki, IFP Labs\u2019 Amy Dotson, cinematographer Chris Manley and actor Peter Dinklage.    The Purple List writer/directors presented scenes from their scripts during a staged reading at Tisch School of the Arts on April 9. The readings were exceptionally well-received by a packed house of filmmakers, potential investors, and students aspiring to join the Purple List cohort. In June, the 2014 Purple List writers will pursue the development of their feature scripts in Los Angeles.        Founded by Grad Film alumni Ash Bhalla & Shandor Garrison when they were students in the Program, the NYU Purple List has been an effective tool in drawing attention to the Tisch Graduate Film Program\u2019s young talent and helping first time feature directors in getting their work produced. In the first two years of the Purple List six of the thirteen projects have wrapped principal photography, with a seventh, Grad Film thesis student Pamela Romanowsky\u2019s THE ADDERALL DIARIES (Purple List 2013) starting to shoot in May.    Purple List films premiered two consecutive years at Sundance: Grad Film alumnus Shaka King\u2019s NEWLYWEEDS (PL 2012), premiered at Sundance in 2013 and was picked up and distributed nationwide by Phase 4 films. Grad Film Thesis student Desiree Akhavan\u2019s, APPROPRIATE BEHAVIOR (PL 2013), made its debut at Sundance 2014 to rave reviews.    Another 2013 Purple List team, Grad Film alumnus Josef Wladyka and Grad Film thesis student Alan Blanco , received a $90,000 grant from the San Francisco Film Society for their debut feature, MANOS SUCIAS, which wrapped in Colombia last summer.    NYU is the only program in the country that encourages its students to produce feature length films. John Tintori, Chair of the Graduate Film Program at NYU, has been a strong supporter of the Purple List since its inception. \u201cSome of the world\u2019s best filmmakers have been trained at NYU,\u201d said Tintori.\u201d The Purple List identifies the next wave of these incredibly talented storytellers and positions them to join the ranks of the feature filmmakers who have emerged from NYU for decades and continue to wow the industry and audiences with auteur-driven films like LIFE OF PI, APPROPRIATE BEHAVIOR, WOLF OF WALL STREET, and FORT TILDEN. \u201d    Congratulations to the 2014 Purple List - we can't wait to see your films on big screens everywhere!

The NYU Graduate Film Program had a kind of amazing experience at SXSW this year. Here's what happened:    The Grad Film Program found out in February that five feature-length thesis films would premiere and screen at the SXSW Film Festival in 2014, and we got to work scouting a location to throw a party and finagling tickets to screenings of the thesis films.     We were and are exceptionally proud of the fantastic thesis films that premiered during SXSW and, of course, of the truly wonderful thesis and recent alumni filmmakers who created such diverse, entertaining, and beautifully crafted feature narrative and documentary films. Pictured here, the 6 writer/directors of the five thesis feature films at SXSW: Anja Marquardt (SHE'S LOST CONTROL), Jon Matthews (SURVIVING CLIFFSIDE), Sarah-Violet Bliss and Charles Rogers (FORT TILDEN), Leah Meyerhoff (I BELIEVE IN UNICORNS), and Darius Clark Monroe (EVOLUTION OF A CRIMINAL) . Photo credits: Grad Film thesis student (and FORT TILDEN DP) Brian Lannin and Mary Cybulski.    Of course we were also delighted by the strong showing of NYU student and graduate films also screening at the festival: feature doc, THE GREAT INVISIBLE , directed by Grad Film alumna Margaret Brown , short doc, DAVID HOCKNEY IN THE NOW , directed by Grad Film alumna Lucy Walker , narrative feature, ONLY LOVERS LEFT ALIVE , directed by Grad Film alumnus Jim Jarmusch , narrative short, THE KARMAN LINE , and directed by current Grad Film student Oscar Sharp .     Grad Film thesis students and alumni - along with their cast and crew - at the NYU @ SXSW reception at the W Austin. It was wonderful to see everyone there, and to toast to your successes on display at SXSW!     Jon's SURVIVING CLIFFSIDE, enjoyed its world premiere in 4 theaters simultaneously at the AMC VCC, Darius' EVOLUTION OF A CRIMINAL, premiered in the Alamo Drafthouses and AMC theaters throughout Austin, and SV and Charles' FORT TILDEN, packed two Alamo Drafthouse theaters for simultaneous screenings on its opening night at SXSW. Each screening and Q&A to follow demonstrated the exceptional talent, intelligence, and individual voices of the Grad Film thesis students. We couldn't have been more proud!         Oh, and then FORT TILDEN won the SXSW Narrative Feature Grand Jury Prize, and THE GREAT INVISIBLE won the SXSW Documentary Feature Grand Jury Prize!!     Congratualtions to Grad Film alumna, Margaret Brown!

It is our pleasure to congratulate four recipients of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences Institutional Grant Program for 2013.    Graduate Film third year students Apolline Berty, Alexandra Keyes, Ruth Marantz, and Jean Pesce each received grant money from AMPAS in support of their film internships, which were also completed by the end of 2013:    Apolline Berty was able to learn about the inner workings at a film and media company, and to attend the Cannes Film Festival. Cinetic Media offered internship seminars with executives which gave her insight to its sister companies. She learned how a sales company selects projects, works with clients, and engages distributors.  Alexandra Keyes learned about day-to-day administration, festival applications, and screener deliveries. She helped coordinate Magnolia\u2019s schedule at Cannes, and traveled to France to assist there as well. Alexandra\u2019s role grew in late summer, and she has since been hired as a part-time paid employee at Magnolia.    Ruth Marantz interned in the locations department for an independent film called Fidelio, about the life of Stanley Kubrick. The film was produced by O.D.D. Entertainment and directed by Jason Dubin, and was shot in New York City. Ruth learned about securing locations for films, negotiating fees, securing parking permits, and other responsibilities related to location scouting.    Jean Pesce interned with Electric City Entertainment in West Hollywood. Jean got to work on interviews for a documentary film about basketball legend Sonny Vaccaro. She also helped assemble a crew for a film that was to be shot in New York (but was shelved). Additionally, Jean read scripts and wrote coverage, and helped with the wrap of Tim Burton\u2019s Big Eyes.    Grants awarded by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences reflect fundamental goals of the Academy \u2013 to advance the art and science of motion pictures and to foster cooperation among the creative leaders of the motion picture industry for cultural, educational and technical progress.    The Tisch School of the Arts is grateful to AMPAS for their generosity in supporting film internships for our students.

A 2013 Purple List script, APPROPRIATE BEHAVIOR, Desi's film is about Shirin: \"one of those closeted, bisexual, Iranian types living in Brooklyn. She's not quite Persian enough, not quite gay enough, not quite anything enough. After being dumped by her girlfriend Maxine, Shirin faces an unimaginable task: trading the idyllic lesbian haven of Park Slope for a shared artist\u2019s loft in Bushwick. Unable to let go of the memories of their excruciating highs and lows, the endearingly superficial narcissist finds herself plotting to win back her ex.\" APPROPRIATE BEHAVIOR was edited by Grad Film thesis student Sara Shaw.    Desi's achievements place her among the Women of Sundance, as covered by Filmmaker Magazine's Danielle Lurie , and her deadpan but honest performance as Shirin earned made her a Sundance breakout star, according to IndieWire .         Also premiering in Sundance's NEXT program was Tisch Drama Alumna Madeleine Olnek's THE FOXY MERKINS , produced by Grad Film thesis student Laura Terruso and shot by Grad Film thesis student Anna Stypko . The film follows two lesbian hookers, Margaret and Jo, as they navigate the bizarre fetishes and sexual needs of their diverse clientele. \"Unflinchingly outrageous, subversive, and poignant\" the film captures \"Olnek's singular directorial vision\" ( Collider ).        Actor Boyd Holbrook, director Sara Colangelo and actor Jacob Lofland (Photo by Chris Pizzello/Invision/AP)    Recent Grad Film alumna Sara Colangelo debuted her first feature film, based on her thesis film, LITTLE ACCIDENTS in the Premiere Program this year.

Last, but not least, Grad Film alumnus Lyle Vincent shot two of the most highly regarded films of the year: COOTIES , and A GIRL WALKS HOME ALONE AT NIGHT . Lyle was recognized for his work on both films by The Hollywood Reporter ( A GIRL WALKS HOME , COOTIES )    and Variety ( A GIRL WALKS HOME , COOTIES ). The cliffsnotes: Lyle's framing is inspired, his use of widescreen magnificent, the black and white of A GIRL is gorgeous, and his lensing in both films is expert.

Grad Film professor Kasi Lemmons' BLACK NATIVITY opens in theaters across the United States tomorrow, November 27. The Grad Film Program is lucky to count Kasi among its full time faculty - her writing and directing talents are abundantly evident in her latest film; don't miss it in theaters!       BLACK NATIVITY is based on Langston Hughes' 1961 play, and set in modern-day Harlem. Kasi reflects on the film - its inception and its themes - in a recent New York Times article about the film and her career. She notes that it begs questions about faith and is true to her storytelling center in its examination of complicated families and belief in things unseen through a child\u2019s perspective.    The film is one in a carefully-selected and lovingly crafted canon of films written and directed by Kasi Lemmons. Its confluence of musical moments, complex relationships, and fluidity of time make BLACK NATIVITY both a unique film and the evidence of Kasi's strong, visionary direction. The film opens tomorrow, November 27, in theaters nationwide.

Darren Walker, President of the Ford Foundation and Chairman of the Gish Fund selection committee, noted that the committee sought to honor Spike Lee's \"brilliance and unwavering courage in using film to challenge conventional thinking, and for the passion for justice he feels in his soul.\"    Professor Lee's impressive body of work has been lauded in industry reports of the Gish Fund's selection; his influence was most astutely noted in The Los Angeles Times' report:. \"... on the strength of Lee\u2019s 1986 debut SHE'S GOTTA HAVE IT \u2013 and his most groundbreaking work, the searing urban drama DO THE RIGHT THING (1989), which landed Lee Oscar nominations for best original screenplay, best film and best director \u2013 the Brooklyn-based filmmaker is recognized as helping usher in a new era for African American directors.\"    The Graduate Film Program is delighted to celebrate Professor Lee as the 2013 Gish Prize recipient and is especially proud to celebrate him as a distinguished alumnus of the Graduate Film Program.

Variety's Peter Debruge notes in his review of the film that, \"Instead of scandalizing viewers, the film attempts to capture the truth about what contempo teens experience, depicting the casual racism, misogyny and self-destructive experimentation that accompanies the rocky passage from childhood to a fully formed personal identity.\" Debruge also applauds the film for having gone to \"impressive lengths to develop the characters and shape their experience into something meaningful.\"    Written and directed by Gia Coppola, PALO ALTO is based on James' short stories published in his book of essays by the same title and co-stars Emma Roberts and Keegan Allen, who lead an impressive cast. While commercial release date is still uncertain, the film's trailer is available here:                                                                         Posted by Miranda Sherman on September 12, 2013 12:00 PM                                   | Permalink                                                          September 11, 2013                Alex Rockwell's LITTLE FEET Receives Charmed Review                          Grad Film Professor of Directing Alex Rockwell's latest film, LITTLE FEET , premiered at the Toronto Film Festival last week, and was warmly received by The Hollywood Reporter .

Last week Indiewire caught up with Grad Film alumnae AnnaRose King and Jennifer Suhr to talk about their newly distributed web series - AMERICAN VIRAL , women in modern comedy writing, and how they've found ways to make movies and television through their all-female film collective, LaTiDa.     AMERICAN VIRAL: writer/director Shandor Garrison (Grad Film alumnus), writer/director Jennifer Suhr, lead actress Zandy Hartig, and writer/director AnnaRose King     Here's a hint at their intelligent and insightful interview (qualities that surprise no one who's met AnnaRose and Jennifer):    The great thing about web series is that...it's much more egalitarian. The networks tend to play it safe, and I get it because they're investing money, but you also want to see them try to do stuff that can prove that, oh people like funny dudes but they like funny women as well. The more they can see that with people making their own stuff and getting a response, the easier that it gets. - J.S.    I think the thing I find most exciting about whole featured content and this independent culture is that you have people actually who are the creators on the ground level, creating stories and shaping how storytelling is going. They\u2019re profiling and showing atypical characters, atypical leading ladies, leading male characters. - A.K.

Each was selected based on the strength of existing short films:       Jamal's short thesis film, REFORM, is about a young Hasidic man caught at the crossroads of a devastating and tragic secret. He was the recipient of a Hollywood Foreign Press Association Grant Award for his thesis film.         Sasie Sealy's film, THE ELEPHANT GARDEN, is about a young girl's struggle to reconcile the shifting boundaries between childhood and adolescence when her older sister gets her first boyfriend, won the Student Visionary Award at the 2008 Tribeca Film Festival.    The program will be held in Los Angeles from June 3-26, 2014, during which time finalists will be paired with an HBO development executive who will serve as his/her mentor throughout the process. Together, the filmmaker and executive will develop the project submitted during the application process. HBO will provide a series of master classes taught by HBO executives and creative talent.    At the completion of the development process, each project will be considered for production as a 10-15 minute film or a series of webisodes to air on various HBO platforms including, but not limited to, HBO GO, HBO, HBO's YouTube channel, HBO.com, film festivals, charity screenings and other outlets.

Barbara Schock  Incoming Chair of the Graduate Film Program  at NYU Tisch School of the Arts    A Letter from Mary Schmidt Campbell, Dean of the Tisch School of the Arts    Dear Faculty, Administrators, and Staff:    I am pleased to announce Barbara Schock, a Tisch School of the Arts assistant arts professor and Oscar-winning independent filmmaker/director, as the incoming chair of the school\u2019s Graduate Film program. Professor Schock embodies the essence of the Tisch faculty: she is a committed educator and a working industry professional.    In 2011, Schock was appointed as an assistant arts professor in the Graduate Film program. She served as head of the directing area and is known for developing strong writing, directing, and directing the actor curricula. Currently, she is co-adapting the Miles Wilson story On Tour with Max, a feature-length indie film with Rex Pickett, author of Sideways, and also a television pilot, The Plains, with Norm Leonard. Schock is a member of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, and since 2005 has served on the invitation-only Executive Committee for Short Films and Feature Animation. She is a contributor to Filmmaker magazine.    Prior to coming to New York, Schock taught at Tisch Asia for three years, overseeing the writing curriculum and second-year studies. She previously taught at Chapman University and was an invited guest lecturer at Aalto University (Helsinki) and the California Institute for the Arts.    Schock was vice president of production at Joan Micklin Silver\u2019s Silverfilm Productions, where she oversaw the development of screenplays from Pulitzer Prize winning playwright Lynn Nottage and novelist Alan Furst.    In 2000, Schock directed Pickett\u2019s My Mother Dreams the Satan\u2019s Disciples in New York and earned the Academy Award\u00ae for Best Short Film (Live Action). The film won over 15 awards from various festivals and organizations, including the DGA\u2019s prestigious Ida Lupino Award.    Schock was the assistant to David Fincher when he directed Alien 3 in London for 20th Century Fox. She also was also the assistant to producer Michael Nozik on TriStar\u2019s Thunderheart directed by Michael Apted.    Originally from South Dakota, Schock earned a B.A. in English Literature from the University of California at San Diego and an M.F.A. in film directing from the American Film Institute. She was a student of the late, legendary film critic Manny Farber, whom she credits as her foremost influence.    Professor Schock lives in Manhattan with her husband, John Martin, and their 14-year old daughter, Ingrid.    While I ask you to join me in welcoming Professor Schock to her role as chair, I also take this opportunity to thank John Tintori for nine transformative years as chair. He hands over to Barbara a department of outstanding faculty and a well-earned, stellar international reputation.

New York\u2019s University\u2019s Graduate Film Program has announced the selections for the 3rd annual Purple List, a short list of the best feature screenplays generated from within the Graduate Film community:           Dagny is a 3rd Year Graduate Film student , Laura and Abu are 4th Year Thesis Grad Film students , and Brett is an alumnus of the Graduate Film Program.    The 2014 Annual Purple List was selected by a panel of industry experts including this year documentary filmmaker Eugene Jarecki, IFP Labs\u2019 Amy Dotson, cinematographer Chris Manley and actor Peter Dinklage.    The Purple List writer/directors presented scenes from their scripts during a staged reading at Tisch School of the Arts on April 9. The readings were exceptionally well-received by a packed house of filmmakers, potential investors, and students aspiring to join the Purple List cohort. In June, the 2014 Purple List writers will pursue the development of their feature scripts in Los Angeles.        Founded by Grad Film alumni Ash Bhalla & Shandor Garrison when they were students in the Program, the NYU Purple List has been an effective tool in drawing attention to the Tisch Graduate Film Program\u2019s young talent and helping first time feature directors in getting their work produced. In the first two years of the Purple List six of the thirteen projects have wrapped principal photography, with a seventh, Grad Film thesis student Pamela Romanowsky\u2019s THE ADDERALL DIARIES (Purple List 2013) starting to shoot in May.    Purple List films premiered two consecutive years at Sundance: Grad Film alumnus Shaka King\u2019s NEWLYWEEDS (PL 2012), premiered at Sundance in 2013 and was picked up and distributed nationwide by Phase 4 films. Grad Film Thesis student Desiree Akhavan\u2019s, APPROPRIATE BEHAVIOR (PL 2013), made its debut at Sundance 2014 to rave reviews.    Another 2013 Purple List team, Grad Film alumnus Josef Wladyka and Grad Film thesis student Alan Blanco , received a $90,000 grant from the San Francisco Film Society for their debut feature, MANOS SUCIAS, which wrapped in Colombia last summer.    NYU is the only program in the country that encourages its students to produce feature length films. John Tintori, Chair of the Graduate Film Program at NYU, has been a strong supporter of the Purple List since its inception. \u201cSome of the world\u2019s best filmmakers have been trained at NYU,\u201d said Tintori.\u201d The Purple List identifies the next wave of these incredibly talented storytellers and positions them to join the ranks of the feature filmmakers who have emerged from NYU for decades and continue to wow the industry and audiences with auteur-driven films like LIFE OF PI, APPROPRIATE BEHAVIOR, WOLF OF WALL STREET, and FORT TILDEN. \u201d    Congratulations to the 2014 Purple List - we can't wait to see your films on big screens everywhere!

The NYU Graduate Film Program had a kind of amazing experience at SXSW this year. Here's what happened:    The Grad Film Program found out in February that five feature-length thesis films would premiere and screen at the SXSW Film Festival in 2014, and we got to work scouting a location to throw a party and finagling tickets to screenings of the thesis films.     We were and are exceptionally proud of the fantastic thesis films that premiered during SXSW and, of course, of the truly wonderful thesis and recent alumni filmmakers who created such diverse, entertaining, and beautifully crafted feature narrative and documentary films. Pictured here, the 6 writer/directors of the five thesis feature films at SXSW: Anja Marquardt (SHE'S LOST CONTROL), Jon Matthews (SURVIVING CLIFFSIDE), Sarah-Violet Bliss and Charles Rogers (FORT TILDEN), Leah Meyerhoff (I BELIEVE IN UNICORNS), and Darius Clark Monroe (EVOLUTION OF A CRIMINAL) . Photo credits: Grad Film thesis student (and FORT TILDEN DP) Brian Lannin and Mary Cybulski.    Of course we were also delighted by the strong showing of NYU student and graduate films also screening at the festival: feature doc, THE GREAT INVISIBLE , directed by Grad Film alumna Margaret Brown , short doc, DAVID HOCKNEY IN THE NOW , directed by Grad Film alumna Lucy Walker , narrative feature, ONLY LOVERS LEFT ALIVE , directed by Grad Film alumnus Jim Jarmusch , narrative short, THE KARMAN LINE , and directed by current Grad Film student Oscar Sharp .     Grad Film thesis students and alumni - along with their cast and crew - at the NYU @ SXSW reception at the W Austin. It was wonderful to see everyone there, and to toast to your successes on display at SXSW!     Jon's SURVIVING CLIFFSIDE, enjoyed its world premiere in 4 theaters simultaneously at the AMC VCC, Darius' EVOLUTION OF A CRIMINAL, premiered in the Alamo Drafthouses and AMC theaters throughout Austin, and SV and Charles' FORT TILDEN, packed two Alamo Drafthouse theaters for simultaneous screenings on its opening night at SXSW. Each screening and Q&A to follow demonstrated the exceptional talent, intelligence, and individual voices of the Grad Film thesis students. We couldn't have been more proud!         Oh, and then FORT TILDEN won the SXSW Narrative Feature Grand Jury Prize, and THE GREAT INVISIBLE won the SXSW Documentary Feature Grand Jury Prize!!     Congratualtions to Grad Film alumna, Margaret Brown!         Congratulations to FORT TILDEN writer/directors Sarah-Violet Bliss and Charles Rogers, cinematographer Brian Lannin, producers Geoff Mansfield and Mollye Asher and the Grad Film thesis student-laden crew : Katrina Whalen (production design), Devin Landin (UPM), Ingrid Jungermann (first AD), Heather Fink (additional sound recordist), Zack Schamberg (assistant camera), Claire Harlam (wardrobe), and Bohdana Smyrnova (PA).

It is our pleasure to congratulate four recipients of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences Institutional Grant Program for 2013.    Graduate Film third year students Apolline Berty, Alexandra Keyes, Ruth Marantz, and Jean Pesce each received grant money from AMPAS in support of their film internships, which were also completed by the end of 2013:    Apolline Berty was able to learn about the inner workings at a film and media company, and to attend the Cannes Film Festival. Cinetic Media offered internship seminars with executives which gave her insight to its sister companies. She learned how a sales company selects projects, works with clients, and engages distributors.  Alexandra Keyes learned about day-to-day administration, festival applications, and screener deliveries. She helped coordinate Magnolia\u2019s schedule at Cannes, and traveled to France to assist there as well. Alexandra\u2019s role grew in late summer, and she has since been hired as a part-time paid employee at Magnolia.    Ruth Marantz interned in the locations department for an independent film called Fidelio, about the life of Stanley Kubrick. The film was produced by O.D.D. Entertainment and directed by Jason Dubin, and was shot in New York City. Ruth learned about securing locations for films, negotiating fees, securing parking permits, and other responsibilities related to location scouting.    Jean Pesce interned with Electric City Entertainment in West Hollywood. Jean got to work on interviews for a documentary film about basketball legend Sonny Vaccaro. She also helped assemble a crew for a film that was to be shot in New York (but was shelved). Additionally, Jean read scripts and wrote coverage, and helped with the wrap of Tim Burton\u2019s Big Eyes.    Grants awarded by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences reflect fundamental goals of the Academy \u2013 to advance the art and science of motion pictures and to foster cooperation among the creative leaders of the motion picture industry for cultural, educational and technical progress.    The Tisch School of the Arts is grateful to AMPAS for their generosity in supporting film internships for our students.

A 2013 Purple List script, APPROPRIATE BEHAVIOR, Desi's film is about Shirin: \"one of those closeted, bisexual, Iranian types living in Brooklyn. She's not quite Persian enough, not quite gay enough, not quite anything enough. After being dumped by her girlfriend Maxine, Shirin faces an unimaginable task: trading the idyllic lesbian haven of Park Slope for a shared artist\u2019s loft in Bushwick. Unable to let go of the memories of their excruciating highs and lows, the endearingly superficial narcissist finds herself plotting to win back her ex.\" APPROPRIATE BEHAVIOR was edited by Grad Film thesis student Sara Shaw.

The Grad Film Program is lucky to count Kasi among its full time faculty - her writing and directing talents are abundantly evident in her latest film; don't miss it in theaters!       BLACK NATIVITY is based on Langston Hughes' 1961 play, and set in modern-day Harlem. Kasi reflects on the film - its inception and its themes - in a recent New York Times article about the film and her career. She notes that it begs questions about faith and is true to her storytelling center in its examination of complicated families and belief in things unseen through a child\u2019s perspective.    The film is one in a carefully-selected and lovingly crafted canon of films written and directed by Kasi Lemmons. Its confluence of musical moments, complex relationships, and fluidity of time make BLACK NATIVITY both a unique film and the evidence of Kasi's strong, visionary direction. The film opens tomorrow, November 27, in theaters nationwide.

The spectrum of genre and theme tackled by Grad Film students and alumni is an exciting expression of the myriad voices that have come through and continue to elevate and energize the program. Take a look:    RBC's Emerging Storytellers, the premiere talent pool for new voices on the independent scene, presents 5 of its total 25 U.S. narrative features in early-stage development to Grad Film alumni this year. Grad Film alumni Shaka King, Dee Rees, Eleanor Burke and Ron Eyal were all recognized by IFP as Emerging Storytellers, and their projects developed exponentially as a result .      Grad Film alumnus Stephen Dypiangco will co-direct with Patrick Epino AWESOME ASIAN BAD GUYS - a comedy about two offbeat filmmakers who must assemble a volatile group of \"Asian bad guy\" actors to take down LA's most nefarious mobster.

Grad Film alumna Nikyatu Jusu will direct her dramatic thriller, FREE THE TOWN . The film centers on a Native virgin, a Brooklyn teen, and a European filmmaker as they collide in the midst of witch-hunting hysteria in Freetown, Sierra Leone. Fellow Grad Film alumnus Daniel Patterson is slated as DP.    Grad Film alumnae Sasie Sealy and Angela Cheng co-wrote LUCKY GRANDMA , which Sasie will direct. The film is a dark comedy about a chain-smoking, gambling Chinese grandma who ends up on the wrong side of luck and the law.    Grad Film thesis student Shripriya Mahesh will direct her first feature, VARENYA , a drama centering on a South Indian Hindu priest who accepts a young apprentice and is forced to question the doctrines of his religion.      IFP's Independent Filmmaker Labs are year-long mentorship programs supporting 20 U.S. first-features in post-production through completion, marketing, and distribution.      Grad Film thesis student Darius Clark Monroe has been accepted into the Documentary Lab with his feature doc, also his thesis, EVOLUTION OF A CRIMINAL . Grad Film esteemed alumnus and Artistic Director Spike Lee is executive producer on the film, in which Darius returns home to examine how his actions affected the lives of friends, family, and victims.    2013 CRI Fellow Josh Penn is producing ROOTS AND WEB , also accepted by the Documentary Lab, directed by Sara Dosa. The doc, set in Oregon's mushroom hunting camps, centers on two soldiers who discover a new family in the woods and learn to heal the wounds of war.      The No Borders International Co-Production Market is the premiere U.S. forum for buyers, sales agents, and financiers to meet with established, international independent producers presenting 42 new narrative feature projects in late-stage development.    Grad Film alumnus Vatche Boulghourjian's TRAMONTANE will be among those films selected.

The Spotlight on Documentaries presents 50 documentary features ranging from an early financing stage to those nearing completion.      Grad Film alumnus Mitch McCabe's MAKE ME NORMAL - a doc asking if Americans are medicalizing \"normal\" - will be among those presented. Through the film, Mitch endeavors to discover what'd led to our \"Disorder Culture,\" and what happened to \"normal.\"    Kanbar's own Eric Juhola - ace Production Office Supervisor - will present his doc, U NTITLED TRANSGENDER YOUTH DOCUMENTARY , in the Spotlight . The film follows a landmark transgender rights case in Colorado, where a 6-year-old transgender girl is banned from the girls' bathroom at her elementary school.      The Trans Atlantic Partners - a collaboration between IFP, the Erich Pommer Institute based in Europe, and Strategic Partners based in Canada - is an international co-production training program presenting 26 U.S. and international screenplays with established producers attached.   Grad Film alumnus Ryan Silbert will produce an untitled project in this year's TAP cycle.

Last week Indiewire caught up with Grad Film alumnae AnnaRose King and Jennifer Suhr to talk about their newly distributed web series - AMERICAN VIRAL , women in modern comedy writing, and how they've found ways to make movies and television through their all-female film collective, LaTiDa.     AMERICAN VIRAL: writer/director Shandor Garrison (Grad Film alumnus), writer/director Jennifer Suhr, lead actress Zandy Hartig, and writer/director AnnaRose King     Here's a hint at their intelligent and insightful interview (qualities that surprise no one who's met AnnaRose and Jennifer):    The great thing about web series is that...it's much more egalitarian. The networks tend to play it safe, and I get it because they're investing money, but you also want to see them try to do stuff that can prove that, oh people like funny dudes but they like funny women as well. The more they can see that with people making their own stuff and getting a response, the easier that it gets. - J.S.    I think the thing I find most exciting about whole featured content and this independent culture is that you have people actually who are the creators on the ground level, creating stories and shaping how storytelling is going. They\u2019re profiling and showing atypical characters, atypical leading ladies, leading male characters. - A.K.

The program will be held in Los Angeles from June 3-26, 2014, during which time finalists will be paired with an HBO development executive who will serve as his/her mentor throughout the process. Together, the filmmaker and executive will develop the project submitted during the application process. HBO will provide a series of master classes taught by HBO executives and creative talent.    At the completion of the development process, each project will be considered for production as a 10-15 minute film or a series of webisodes to air on various HBO platforms including, but not limited to, HBO GO, HBO, HBO's YouTube channel, HBO.com, film festivals, charity screenings and other outlets.

Barbara Schock  Incoming Chair of the Graduate Film Program  at NYU Tisch School of the Arts    A Letter from Mary Schmidt Campbell, Dean of the Tisch School of the Arts    Dear Faculty, Administrators, and Staff:    I am pleased to announce Barbara Schock, a Tisch School of the Arts assistant arts professor and Oscar-winning independent filmmaker/director, as the incoming chair of the school\u2019s Graduate Film program. Professor Schock embodies the essence of the Tisch faculty: she is a committed educator and a working industry professional.    In 2011, Schock was appointed as an assistant arts professor in the Graduate Film program. She served as head of the directing area and is known for developing strong writing, directing, and directing the actor curricula. Currently, she is co-adapting the Miles Wilson story On Tour with Max, a feature-length indie film with Rex Pickett, author of Sideways, and also a television pilot, The Plains, with Norm Leonard. Schock is a member of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, and since 2005 has served on the invitation-only Executive Committee for Short Films and Feature Animation. She is a contributor to Filmmaker magazine.    Prior to coming to New York, Schock taught at Tisch Asia for three years, overseeing the writing curriculum and second-year studies. She previously taught at Chapman University and was an invited guest lecturer at Aalto University (Helsinki) and the California Institute for the Arts.    Schock was vice president of production at Joan Micklin Silver\u2019s Silverfilm Productions, where she oversaw the development of screenplays from Pulitzer Prize winning playwright Lynn Nottage and novelist Alan Furst.    In 2000, Schock directed Pickett\u2019s My Mother Dreams the Satan\u2019s Disciples in New York and earned the Academy Award\u00ae for Best Short Film (Live Action). The film won over 15 awards from various festivals and organizations, including the DGA\u2019s prestigious Ida Lupino Award.    Schock was the assistant to David Fincher when he directed Alien 3 in London for 20th Century Fox.

She was a student of the late, legendary film critic Manny Farber, whom she credits as her foremost influence.    Professor Schock lives in Manhattan with her husband, John Martin, and their 14-year old daughter, Ingrid.    While I ask you to join me in welcoming Professor Schock to her role as chair, I also take this opportunity to thank John Tintori for nine transformative years as chair.

New York\u2019s University\u2019s Graduate Film Program has announced the selections for the 3rd annual Purple List, a short list of the best feature screenplays generated from within the Graduate Film community:           Dagny is a 3rd Year Graduate Film student , Laura and Abu are 4th Year Thesis Grad Film students , and Brett is an alumnus of the Graduate Film Program.    The 2014 Annual Purple List was selected by a panel of industry experts including this year documentary filmmaker Eugene Jarecki, IFP Labs\u2019 Amy Dotson, cinematographer Chris Manley and actor Peter Dinklage.    The Purple List writer/directors presented scenes from their scripts during a staged reading at Tisch School of the Arts on April 9. The readings were exceptionally well-received by a packed house of filmmakers, potential investors, and students aspiring to join the Purple List cohort. In June, the 2014 Purple List writers will pursue the development of their feature scripts in Los Angeles.        Founded by Grad Film alumni Ash Bhalla & Shandor Garrison when they were students in the Program, the NYU Purple List has been an effective tool in drawing attention to the Tisch Graduate Film Program\u2019s young talent and helping first time feature directors in getting their work produced. In the first two years of the Purple List six of the thirteen projects have wrapped principal photography, with a seventh, Grad Film thesis student Pamela Romanowsky\u2019s THE ADDERALL DIARIES (Purple List 2013) starting to shoot in May.    Purple List films premiered two consecutive years at Sundance: Grad Film alumnus Shaka King\u2019s NEWLYWEEDS (PL 2012), premiered at Sundance in 2013 and was picked up and distributed nationwide by Phase 4 films. Grad Film Thesis student Desiree Akhavan\u2019s, APPROPRIATE BEHAVIOR (PL 2013), made its debut at Sundance 2014 to rave reviews.    Another 2013 Purple List team, Grad Film alumnus Josef Wladyka and Grad Film thesis student Alan Blanco , received a $90,000 grant from the San Francisco Film Society for their debut feature, MANOS SUCIAS, which wrapped in Colombia last summer.    NYU is the only program in the country that encourages its students to produce feature length films. John Tintori, Chair of the Graduate Film Program at NYU, has been a strong supporter of the Purple List since its inception. \u201cSome of the world\u2019s best filmmakers have been trained at NYU,\u201d said Tintori.\u201d The Purple List identifies the next wave of these incredibly talented storytellers and positions them to join the ranks of the feature filmmakers who have emerged from NYU for decades and continue to wow the industry and audiences with auteur-driven films like LIFE OF PI, APPROPRIATE BEHAVIOR, WOLF OF WALL STREET, and FORT TILDEN. \u201d    Congratulations to the 2014 Purple List - we can't wait to see your films on big screens everywhere!

The NYU Graduate Film Program had a kind of amazing experience at SXSW this year. Here's what happened:    The Grad Film Program found out in February that five feature-length thesis films would premiere and screen at the SXSW Film Festival in 2014, and we got to work scouting a location to throw a party and finagling tickets to screenings of the thesis films.     We were and are exceptionally proud of the fantastic thesis films that premiered during SXSW and, of course, of the truly wonderful thesis and recent alumni filmmakers who created such diverse, entertaining, and beautifully crafted feature narrative and documentary films. Pictured here, the 6 writer/directors of the five thesis feature films at SXSW: Anja Marquardt (SHE'S LOST CONTROL), Jon Matthews (SURVIVING CLIFFSIDE), Sarah-Violet Bliss and Charles Rogers (FORT TILDEN), Leah Meyerhoff (I BELIEVE IN UNICORNS), and Darius Clark Monroe (EVOLUTION OF A CRIMINAL) . Photo credits: Grad Film thesis student (and FORT TILDEN DP) Brian Lannin and Mary Cybulski.    Of course we were also delighted by the strong showing of NYU student and graduate films also screening at the festival: feature doc, THE GREAT INVISIBLE , directed by Grad Film alumna Margaret Brown , short doc, DAVID HOCKNEY IN THE NOW , directed by Grad Film alumna Lucy Walker , narrative feature, ONLY LOVERS LEFT ALIVE , directed by Grad Film alumnus Jim Jarmusch , narrative short, THE KARMAN LINE , and directed by current Grad Film student Oscar Sharp .     Grad Film thesis students and alumni - along with their cast and crew - at the NYU @ SXSW reception at the W Austin. It was wonderful to see everyone there, and to toast to your successes on display at SXSW!     Jon's SURVIVING CLIFFSIDE, enjoyed its world premiere in 4 theaters simultaneously at the AMC VCC, Darius' EVOLUTION OF A CRIMINAL, premiered in the Alamo Drafthouses and AMC theaters throughout Austin, and SV and Charles' FORT TILDEN, packed two Alamo Drafthouse theaters for simultaneous screenings on its opening night at SXSW. Each screening and Q&A to follow demonstrated the exceptional talent, intelligence, and individual voices of the Grad Film thesis students. We couldn't have been more proud!         Oh, and then FORT TILDEN won the SXSW Narrative Feature Grand Jury Prize, and THE GREAT INVISIBLE won the SXSW Documentary Feature Grand Jury Prize!!     Congratualtions to Grad Film alumna, Margaret Brown!         Congratulations to FORT TILDEN writer/directors Sarah-Violet Bliss and Charles Rogers, cinematographer Brian Lannin, producers Geoff Mansfield and Mollye Asher and the Grad Film thesis student-laden crew : Katrina Whalen (production design), Devin Landin (UPM), Ingrid Jungermann (first AD), Heather Fink (additional sound recordist), Zack Schamberg (assistant camera), Claire Harlam (wardrobe), and Bohdana Smyrnova (PA). Congratulations too, to Clare McNulty, Bridey Elliott, and Griffin Newman for their outstanding performances!

It is our pleasure to congratulate four recipients of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences Institutional Grant Program for 2013.    Graduate Film third year students Apolline Berty, Alexandra Keyes, Ruth Marantz, and Jean Pesce each received grant money from AMPAS in support of their film internships, which were also completed by the end of 2013:    Apolline Berty was able to learn about the inner workings at a film and media company, and to attend the Cannes Film Festival. Cinetic Media offered internship seminars with executives which gave her insight to its sister companies. She learned how a sales company selects projects, works with clients, and engages distributors.  Alexandra Keyes learned about day-to-day administration, festival applications, and screener deliveries. She helped coordinate Magnolia\u2019s schedule at Cannes, and traveled to France to assist there as well. Alexandra\u2019s role grew in late summer, and she has since been hired as a part-time paid employee at Magnolia.    Ruth Marantz interned in the locations department for an independent film called Fidelio, about the life of Stanley Kubrick. The film was produced by O.D.D. Entertainment and directed by Jason Dubin, and was shot in New York City. Ruth learned about securing locations for films, negotiating fees, securing parking permits, and other responsibilities related to location scouting.    Jean Pesce interned with Electric City Entertainment in West Hollywood. Jean got to work on interviews for a documentary film about basketball legend Sonny Vaccaro. She also helped assemble a crew for a film that was to be shot in New York (but was shelved). Additionally, Jean read scripts and wrote coverage, and helped with the wrap of Tim Burton\u2019s Big Eyes.    Grants awarded by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences reflect fundamental goals of the Academy \u2013 to advance the art and science of motion pictures and to foster cooperation among the creative leaders of the motion picture industry for cultural, educational and technical progress.    The Tisch School of the Arts is grateful to AMPAS for their generosity in supporting film internships for our students.

A 2013 Purple List script, APPROPRIATE BEHAVIOR, Desi's film is about Shirin: \"one of those closeted, bisexual, Iranian types living in Brooklyn. She's not quite Persian enough, not quite gay enough, not quite anything enough. After being dumped by her girlfriend Maxine, Shirin faces an unimaginable task: trading the idyllic lesbian haven of Park Slope for a shared artist\u2019s loft in Bushwick. Unable to let go of the memories of their excruciating highs and lows, the endearingly superficial narcissist finds herself plotting to win back her ex.\" APPROPRIATE BEHAVIOR was edited by Grad Film thesis student Sara Shaw.    Desi's achievements place her among the Women of Sundance, as covered by Filmmaker Magazine's Danielle Lurie , and her deadpan but honest performance as Shirin earned made her a Sundance breakout star, according to IndieWire .

Grad Film professor Kasi Lemmons' BLACK NATIVITY opens in theaters across the United States tomorrow, November 27. The Grad Film Program is lucky to count Kasi among its full time faculty - her writing and directing talents are abundantly evident in her latest film; don't miss it in theaters!       BLACK NATIVITY is based on Langston Hughes' 1961 play, and set in modern-day Harlem. Kasi reflects on the film - its inception and its themes - in a recent New York Times article about the film and her career. She notes that it begs questions about faith and is true to her storytelling center in its examination of complicated families and belief in things unseen through a child\u2019s perspective.    The film is one in a carefully-selected and lovingly crafted canon of films written and directed by Kasi Lemmons. Its confluence of musical moments, complex relationships, and fluidity of time make BLACK NATIVITY both a unique film and the evidence of Kasi's strong, visionary direction. The film opens tomorrow, November 27, in theaters nationwide.
