Additionally, all incoming students receive undergraduate teaching positions during the second year. These positions involve designing and teaching a semester-long introductory course in creative writing for undergraduates, as well as attending a teaching practicum offered by the program. Compensation for teaching is approximately $4,800 per course. Many students also receive additional funding from the literary outreach fellowship programs listed below.      Graduate Program Fellowships The Rona Jaffe Foundation Graduate Fellowship in Creative Writing is  awarded each year to support one incoming female student. The  fellowship provides full tuition and a generous stipend. No separate  application is necessary to be considered for this fellowship.       In recognition of the special contributions women writers  make to our culture and society, Rona Jaffe (1931-2005) established The Rona Jaffe Foundation Writers\u2019  Awards program in 1995. It is the only national literary awards program of its  kind dedicated to supporting women writers exclusively. Since the program  began, the Foundation has awarded more than $1 million to emergent women  writers. The Foundation has also established fellowships for women writers in  Ms. Jaffe's honor at several distinguished institutions, including The Rona  Jaffe Foundation Graduate Fellowship in Creative Writing at NYU.      The Fromer Fellowship , The Jan Gabrial Fellowship , and The Lillian Vernon Fellowship provide  varying levels of support and are awarded annually to incoming  students. No separate application is necessary for any of these  fellowships. A generous gift from the Axinn Foundation has established the Axinn Foundation Fellowship. To be awarded each year to a graduating student of exceptional promise, the fellowship is designed to provide emerging writers with time dedicated exclusively to writing, as well as invaluable guidance under an assigned faculty mentor during the final stages of writing and preparing a book for publication. In consultation with the Director of the Creative Writing Program and the Dean of the Graduate School, the recipient is selected by a faculty committee and appointed as the Axinn Foundation Writer-in-Residence for the academic year following graduation. As Writer-in-Residence, the fellow also has the opportunity to teach one undergraduate class. The appointment carries a generous stipend and includes full benefits. Literary Outreach Fellowships The  Creative Writing Program is committed to developing innovative literary  outreach programs that enable students to teach creative writing in  both traditional and non-traditional settings, focusing on underserved  and marginalized communities. NYU's outreach initiatives serve as  national models in the field. These vital programs are based in the  belief that creative talent can flourish in even the most challenging  circumstances. The outreach programs also enable students to train as  teachers in the field, preparing them for teaching positions in schools  and other professional settings upon graduation. We hope to continue to  raise funds for these initiatives in order to expand and strengthen our  efforts.

The  fellowship provides full tuition and a generous stipend. No separate  application is necessary to be considered for this fellowship.       In recognition of the special contributions women writers  make to our culture and society, Rona Jaffe (1931-2005) established The Rona Jaffe Foundation Writers\u2019  Awards program in 1995. It is the only national literary awards program of its  kind dedicated to supporting women writers exclusively. Since the program  began, the Foundation has awarded more than $1 million to emergent women  writers. The Foundation has also established fellowships for women writers in  Ms. Jaffe's honor at several distinguished institutions, including The Rona  Jaffe Foundation Graduate Fellowship in Creative Writing at NYU.      The Fromer Fellowship , The Jan Gabrial Fellowship , and The Lillian Vernon Fellowship provide  varying levels of support and are awarded annually to incoming  students.

As a bridge to understand our global and local surroundings through a different set of lens than what we are generally used to seeing, both generational and gender-wise, the Institute of African American Affairs at New York University presents a year-long series of conversations with young diasporic women of African descent writing new visions of the world. By charting their own spaces and territories, they introduce a new creativity that recasts issues of style, gender and transformation. Their works go beyond the literature strictly about and reserved for women; their own powerful voices to the social, political and literary arts landscapes becomes critical. As we enter the second decade of a young century terms such as \u201cdiaspora\u201d \u201cgender\u201d and \u201cculture\u201d are not so discrete and easily categorized. The ways that women writers of African descent have defined and expressed themselves globally have always been complex and pose challenges not just for the writer but for audiences as well. A younger generation has had to contend with overlapping modernities and transnational migrations which have complicated the meanings of certain terms, identities and experiences. It prompts us to rethink the geographical boundaries and conceptual paradigms surrounding the production of cultural knowledge from these women writers and their diasporic communities. What are the new questions and challenges posed by their works via both the personal and the public? What does it mean to write from that perspective and explore various themes both within and outside the prescribed category of gender and race? How do cultural linkages and the notion of national origin factor in writing and reading within and outside these \u201cboundaries?\u201d Whether by personal choice or imposed, do these categories suggest an influence that is usually thought of either outside or against the mainstream? What are the processes that permit or discourage changes in our understanding of the kinds of writing these women produce? Scholars, artists, critics, students and the general public are invited for a dialogue and exchange of views with these women writers in conversations on the importance of their writings and cultural contributions in today\u2019s world.

It is the story of a group of women who live in a land that at times defeats them, among people who often disappoint and baffle them. Through their trials and hardships, the women support each other, unified by their foreignness, their distance from home and the choices they have made, as ultimately they are wooed by this strange place that they come to call home.
