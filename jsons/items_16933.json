They are advanced seminars for juniors and seniors who are politics majors. To take any undergraduate field seminar, students must first have completed four courses in politics, one of which must be the core in that subfield. They must also have a 3.0 cumulative GPA or the permission of the instructor. Enrollment is limited.     Analytical Politics Quantitative Methods in Political Science POL-UA 800 Offered every semester. 4 points. Introduces students to the use of quantitative methods in the study of politics. Begins with a brief review of the basic elements of scientific thinking and their application to the social sciences. Next, students are introduced to probability theory and statistics with a view to testing hypotheses about politics. Students learn to use statistical software to organize and analyze data. Political Engineering: The Design of Institutions POL-UA 810 Offered every year. 4 points. Institutions are the rules by which societies govern themselves. The tools of economic theory, game theory, and social choice theory are applied to the rational choice analysis of political institutions, whose consequences for society are derived from assumptions about what individuals seek to maximize. Introduction to Political Psychology POL-UA 812 Offered every year. 4 points. Offers a broad overview of political psychology, a field that uses experimental methods and theoretical ideas from psychology as tools to help understand political processes. It introduces important concepts from psychology, offering new ways of thinking about subjects as varied as personality, the dynamics of social groups, and the ways in which emotion affects decision making, and then applies these concepts to various topics within political science, including the media and political advertising, race relations, the legitimacy of government institutions, and the formation of opinions and ideologies. In addition, by describing political psychology experimentation in detail, the course teaches about how the scientific method can be applied to the study of politics. Introduction to Game Theory in Political Science POL-UA 840 Offered every year. 4 points. Game theory is a mathematical tool used to study strategic interactions. Whenever the choices made by two or more distinct decision makers have an effect on the others' outcomes, the interaction between them is game-theoretic in nature. As suggested by its recent emergence into popular culture, game theory has been applied widely, in attempts to address phenomena in a variety of academic disciplines, including political science, economics, and biology. Because much of politics is about allocation of scarce goods, such as power and wealth, and the competition for these goods, much of politics would seem to be a natural fit for the language of game theory. Doing Political Economy: Approaches to Public Policy POL-UA 842 Offered every semester. 4 points. Political economy is a field of inquiry that has made great strides in recent years in explaining political and economic behavior by characterizing the incentives of actors and the context in which these actors make decisions and influence outcomes. The purpose of this course is to introduce students to these theoretical approaches and show how they can be used to address contemporary policy questions. Games, Strategy, and Politics POL-UA 844 Offered every year. 4 points. Theories of political strategy with emphasis on the theory of games. Uses of strategy in defense and deterrence policies of nations, guerrilla warfare of revolutionaries and terrorists, bargaining and negotiation processes, coalitions and the enforcement of collective action, and voting in committees and elections. Secrecy and deception as political strategies and the uses of power, with some applications outside political science. Social Choice and Politics POL-UA 845 Offered every other year. 4 points. Introduces students to social choice theory applied to political science. It focuses on (1) individual choice, (2) group choice, (3) collective action, and (4) institutions. It looks at models of individuals' voting behavior, the incentive structures of interest groups, and the role of institutions. The emphasis is analytical, though students are not expected to have a background in formal mathematics. Experimental Methods in Political Science POL-UA 846 Prerequisites: Quantitative Methods in Political Science (POL-UA 800) or equivalent. Offered every other year. 4 points. Designed to provide an introduction to experimental methods in political science. Emphasizes several different styles of laboratory experiments, but field experiments (and briefly, survey experiments) are also discussed. Undergraduate Field Seminar: Analytical Politics POL-UA 895 Prerequisites: cumulative GPA of 3.0 and four previous courses in politics or permission of the instructor. Offered every year. 4 points. Advanced seminar for juniors and seniors in analytical politics. The specific topic of the seminar is announced each year.     Political Theory Political Theory (Core course) POL-UA 100 Offered every semester. 4 points. Introduces students to some outstanding theories of politics. The theories treated offer alternative conceptions of political life, and they are examined from both theoretical and historical perspectives. Among the theorists included are Plato, Aristotle, Locke, Machiavelli, Hobbes, Rousseau, Mill, and Marx. Topics in Premodern Political Philosophy POL-UA 110 Formerly Political Thought from Plato to Machiavelli. Identical to MEDI-UA 110. Offered every other year. 4 points. Intensive introduction to the major themes of Western political thought. Topics in Modern Political Thought: 1500 to the Present POL-UA 120 Offered every year. 4 points. Examines the development of political thought from Machiavelli to Nietzsche through a careful study of primary works. Authors include Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau, Hegel, Marx, and Nietzsche. Ethics, Politics, and Public Policy POL-UA 130 Offered once a year. 4 points. Students systematically evaluate ethically controversial public policy issues using concepts of normative political theory. In the first half of the course, we consider the means by which policy is implemented: Under what conditions, if any, might we permit political actors to do bad in order to do good? In the second half, we consider the ends of public policy: What is it that we want the state to accomplish, and at what cost? Substantive policy topics vary from semester to semester. Theories of Justice POL-UA 138 Prerequisite: Political Theory (POL-UA 100). Offered every year. 4 points. Aims to help students think more rigorously about questions of justice by examining the strengths and weaknesses of competing contemporary theories of justice. We survey a range of influential approaches to understanding justice, including those advocated by libertarians, utilitarians, egalitarians, feminists, communitarians, and Marxists. This course should help students to (1) recognize that political convictions rest on underlying moral assumptions; (2) learn how to interrogate, challenge, and defend these assumptions; and (3) gain some appreciation of how these issues have been addressed by major figures in contemporary political theory. Socialist Theory POL-UA 140 Offered in the fall. 4 points. Concentrates on those socialist schools\u2014Christian socialism, utopian socialism, Marxism, Fabianism, and anarchism\u2014that have proved to be the most successful. Presents their major theories and examines the usefulness of such theories in helping us to understand and, in some cases, alter the world in which we live. Nationalism and Ethnic Conflict POL-UA 150 Prerequisite: Political Theory (POL-UA 100). Offered every year. 4 points. Seeks to explain the varied forms of nationalism and extremism. To that end, we bring various psychological, economic, anthropological, and sociological theories to bear on the origins and development of nationalist movements. We attempt to understand the historical phases of nationalist development, from the early cases of Great Britain and the United States, through the later cases of Europe and Latin America, the anticolonial cases of Africa and much of Asia, and, finally, the often religiously-based movements of the present era. We also read some of the normative literature that has tried to justify nationalism, both in the abstract and in particular cases. Democracy and Dictatorship POL-UA 160 Offered every other year. 4 points. Democracy and dictatorships have traditionally been analyzed in terms of their apparently different institutional characteristics and legal foundations. Examines these traditional interpretations but leans heavily toward ideological and contextual factors. Challenges traditional distinctions between democracy and dictatorship. American Political Thought POL-UA 170 Prerequisite: Political Theory (POL-UA 100). Offered every year. 4 points. Study of American political ideas and debate from colonial times to the present. Topics include Puritanism, revolution and independence, the framing of the Constitution, Hamiltonian nationalism, Jeffersonian republicanism, Jacksonian democracy, pro-slavery and antislavery thought, Civil War and Reconstruction, social Darwinism and laissez-faire, the reformist thought of populism, progressivism and socialism, legal realism, the New Deal and 20th-century liberalism, modern conservatism, civil rights, and war protest. Readings and discussion are based on original and interpretative sources. Undergraduate Field Seminar: Political Theory POL-UA 195 Prerequisites: Political Theory (POL-UA 100) and three other politics courses, junior or senior standing, and a minimum 3.0 GPA, or permission of the instructor. Offered every semester. 4 points. Advanced seminar for juniors and seniors in political theory. The specific topic of the seminar is announced each year.      American Government and Politics Power and Politics in America (Core course) POL-UA 300 Offered every semester. 4 points. A survey of national political institutions and behavior in the United States, which introduces students to a variety of analytical concepts and approaches useful for the study of domestic politics. Concepts typically covered include public goods and collective action; preference aggregation and the median voter theorem; delegation, representation, and accountability; agenda control; interbranch bargaining; and the mechanisms of private influence on public policy. Public Policy POL-UA 306 Prerequisite: Power and Politics in America (POL-UA 300). Offered in the fall. 4 points. Introduction to public policymaking in American federal government. The issues politicians address at election time often have little to do with what they actually do in office. The course examines the way the agenda is set and issues are processed in Washington. Covers Congress, the bureaucracy, program implementation, policy analysis, and budgeting. Students do a special project on an important current issue. In recent years, these issues have included Social Security reform, Medicare, and illegal immigration. The Presidency POL-UA 310 Prerequisite: Power and Politics in America (POL-UA 300). Offered every other year. 4 points. Study of the American presidency, its origins, and roles, including those of commander-in-chief; director of foreign policy; leader in legislation, administration, and party affairs; manager of the economy; and dispenser of social justice. The president is also viewed as a decision maker and compared with the heads of other governments. Readings include the works of presidents and their associates, analytical commentaries by observers of the presidency, and biographies. The Biology of Politics POL-UA 311 Offered every year. 4 points. Why do we participate in politics? Who tends to participate? When are we most likely to participate? Political scientists have traditionally focused on factors such as demography, socioeconomic status, motivation, electoral institutions, and social norms to answer these questions. Recently, however, scholars have begun to explore the possibility that genetic differences may, at least in part, help to explain individual differences in political participation. Controversies in Public Policy: Logic and Evidence POL-UA 315 Offered in the fall. 4 points. Uses logic and evidence to analyze issues of public policy. Applies sabermetrics (logic and evidence applied to baseball, as seen in the film Moneyball) to such vastly more important topics as improving schools, designing health policy, and dealing with climate change. Congress and Legislative Assemblies POL-UA 320 Prerequisite: Power and Politics in America (POL-UA 300). Offered every other year. 4 points. Origin, structure, functions, and dynamics of legislatures in the United States. Although some attention is given to state legislatures and municipal lawmaking bodies, the major emphasis is on the Congress. Readings include a textbook, official sources such as the Congressional Record and Congressional District Data Book, and new behavioral studies and commentaries. The American Constitution POL-UA 330 Offered every semester. 4 points. Interpretation of the U.S. Constitution through the reading of Supreme Court opinions. Distribution of constitutional power among Congress, the president, and the federal courts; between the national government and the states; and among the states. Constitutional law and American political and economic development. Cases are read and discussed closely for their legal and philosophical content. Civil Liberties POL-UA 332 Offered every semester. 4 points. Interpretation of the Bill of Rights, the Civil War amendments, and other rights in the U.S. Constitution through the reading of Supreme Court opinions. Topics include freedom of speech and press; free exercise of religion and separation of church and state; the right of privacy; rights of the criminally accused; equal protection of the law against race, gender, and other discrimination; and the rights of franchise and citizenship. Cases are read and discussed closely for their legal and philosophical content. The United States Supreme Court POL-UA 333 Prerequisite: The American Constitution (POL-UA 330) or Civil Liberties (POL-UA 332). Offered every other year. 4 points. Institutional examination of the third branch of government as chief interpreter of the Constitution and reviewer of the work of government. Considers the structure, procedures, personnel, and informal organization of the court, along with the appointment process. Gives some attention to the impact of the court's decisions and to public opinion about the court. Emphasis on the court's political role in a democratic polity. American Law and Legal System POL-UA 334 Offered every other year. 4 points. Introduction to law and the legal system through the reading of actual cases. Topics include the adjudication of conflict, the structure and functions of trial and appellate courts, civil and criminal procedure, judicial remedies, judicial decision making, and the limits of judicial relief. Uses tort, contract, property, divorce, and other law for illustration. Law and Society POL-UA 335 Identical to LWSOC-UA 1, SCA-UA 722. Offered every other year. 4 points. Critically examines the relationship between law and political and social movements such as the civil rights movement, the women's movement, and the labor and environmental movements. Emphasis on law as a political process, legal remedies for racial and gender discrimination, and class-action torts. Deals with the politics of rights and the limits and possibilities of law as a process for social change. Gender in Law POL-UA 336 Identical to SCA-UA 723. Offered every other year. 4 points. Examines the relationship between gender politics, legal theory, and social policy. Studies the role that the legal arena and certain historical conditions have played in creating, revising, and protecting particular gender identities and not others and examines the political effects of those legal constructions. Analyzes the major debates in feminist legal theory, including theories of equality, the problem of essentialism, and the relevance of standpoint epistemology. In addition to examining how the law understands sex discrimination in the workplace and the feminization of the legal profession, the course also addresses to what extent understandings of gender affect how law regulates the physical body by looking at the regulation of reproduction and of consensual sexual activity. In light of all of the above, the course considers to what extent law is or is not an effective political resource in reforming notions of gender in law and society. The Rule of Law POL-UA 337 Prerequisite: Power and Politics in America (POL-UA 300). Offered every year. 4 points. The rule of law requires that people in positions of authority should exercise their power within a constraining framework of public laws rather than on the basis of their own preferences or their own ideology. This course explores the theory surrounding the rule of law ideal. It focuses on the political conditions that promote the rule of law as well as on the challenges to the rule of law in times of emergencies. Topics include the connection between law and morality, the political foundation of the rule of law, the interaction among political institutions in promoting or subverting the rule of law, the rule of law in times of crisis, the effects of emergency powers on the rule of law, and the rule of law and terrorism prevention.

Private Influence in Public Policy POL-UA 341 Prerequisite: Power and Politics in America (POL-UA 300). Offered every year. 4 points. In this course, we will examine the role of private influence in public policy from a variety of theoretical and empirical perspectives. Course topics will include in-depth analysis of mechanisms of influence (e.g., selection of sympathetic incumbents, the provision of incentives for public officials, and the provision of information), objects of influence (voter choices, legislative behavior, bureaucratic decisions), collective action, and organizational maintenance. Special attention will be paid to the overcoming the challenges associated with demonstrating influence empirically. American Public Opinion POL-UA 342 Prerequisite: Power and Politics in America (POL-UA 300). Offered every other year. 4 points. Covers two areas of great importance to American democratic society. One area deals with the attempts made to define, identify, survey, analyze, and evaluate the influence of what is referred to as public opinion. The other concerns how citizens unite in interest groups to influence or pressure government. Role and methods of interest groups in American society and their relationship to political parties, elected and appointed officeholders, and the democratic process. A study of who governs in the United States. The Election Process POL-UA 344 Prerequisite: Power and Politics in America (POL-UA 300). Offered every other year. 4 points. Provides an understanding of election processes in the United States through different theoretical approaches to the study of campaigns and elections and the testing of empirical hypotheses. Analyzes campaign strategies of political candidates, the use of polls and media in campaigns, and the effects of issues and personalities on election outcomes. Evaluates the role of presidential primaries and elections in the functioning of a democracy. Bureaucracy and Public Policy POL-UA 350 Prerequisite: Power and Politics in America (POL-UA 300). Offered every year. 4 points. Bureaucracies are inescapably embedded in the American political environment, and political conflicts within administrative agencies are ubiquitous. We examine the major questions political scientists ask about public bureaucracies: How have they evolved to their current form? Why do bureaucrats engage in behavior that many of us consider pathological or arbitrary? How can unelected government officials be made more accountable to their elected counterparts and to citizens? In addressing these questions and others, we draw on cases of government in action in a number of different public policy areas. The Politics of Administrative Law POL-UA 354 Offered every other year. 4 points. Examines legal, political, and economic issues in government regulation. Covers such classic debates and issues as the historical origins of regulation, the legal philosophy of administrative regulation, the relationship between courts and agencies, the political and social conflicts surrounding regulatory politics, and the role of law in state formation. Urban Government and Politics POL-UA 360 Identical to SCA-UA 753. Prerequisite: Power and Politics in America (POL-UA 300). Offered every other year. 4 points. Study of politics and politicians in the contemporary American city. Evolution of local party organizations, the rise and fall of party \"bosses,\" and the predicament of the ordinary citizen in the urban community. Patterns of city politics against the background of American social and cultural history, including the impulse toward reform and the effects of reform efforts on the distribution of power in the community.

Particular emphasis is placed on the United States. International comparisons are also present. The course assumes that students have had exposure to microeconomics and finance but not to political theory. A brief introduction to political theory is provided. The approach is similar to that used in microeconomics, except that transactions are made through voting institutions rather than through economic exchange. Honors Seminar: Courts, Rights, and Politics POL-UA 396 Prerequisites: Power and Politics in America (POL-UA 300), three other politics courses, junior or senior standing, and a minimum 3.5 GPA. Offered every year. 4 points. When we look at the protection of civil rights and liberties in the United States, we typically restrict our attention to prominent cases decided by the Supreme Court. We do so on the theory that rights and liberties are generally abused by legislative majorities, and protected by independent courts. But many important rights and liberties in the U.S. have been protected by legislative majorities, not by the federal courts. The federal courts have in fact blocked many efforts by legislatures to protect rights and liberties. Using a variety of materials, this seminar reexamines the premise that rights are best protected by independent courts. We look at the record of rights protections both in the United States and more globally. We read court cases, historical accounts, works of political theory, and statistical analyses. We also collect our own data and conduct analyses of that data. U.S. Foreign Policy POL-UA 710 Offered every year. 4 points. See \"International Politics,\" below.

The U.S. elections are used as the frame of reference for examining the effect of institutions and voting behavior. Other countries are discussed to illustrate how cross-national differences in voting behavior and institutions can affect the electoral processes. This comparative perspective provides a better way to understand the U.S. electoral process. Western European Politics POL-UA 510 Identical to EURO-UA 510.

We then analyze the impact of this transformation on attempts by European states first to maintain control of their frontiers, and then to incorporate immigrants into the national community.
