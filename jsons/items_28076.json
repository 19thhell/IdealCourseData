Location: NYU, 721 Broadway, New York NY 10003, 9th floor conference room.   Please RSVP, see below!     If there is one thing that video game historians can agree on, it is the pivotal importance of the 1983 crash of the video game market. Yet, the crash went largely unnoticed in Europe where consoles were few and the industry only nascent. The history of European video games in 1980\u2019s is better described as a period of unbroken growth and unprecedented experimentation in game design. In this session, our two speakers will discuss the history of early European experimental and independent games, and show how they prefigured much of what is happening in the video games today.   The two speakers of the day are Jaroslav \u0160velch from Charles University (Prague) and Jesper Juul from the NYU Game Center.   [EXPAND Click here to read the talk descriptions and speaker bios.]   The Talks   \u0160velch : The Unintended Avant-garde \u2013 Two stories from 1980\u2032s European game development   The talk discusses two separate stories from the history of computer games, united by the fact that the games at the center of these stories broke new grounds without much impact or commercial success. First, we will discuss the British game \u201cDeus Ex Machina\u201d, probably the first commercially released art game, designed\u00a0 in 1984 by Mel Croucher, whose mission to express abstract human experiences in many ways resembles today\u2019s indie and art games. Secondly, we will talk about the text adventure game \u201cThe Adventures of Indiana Jones on Wenceslas Square in Prague on January 16, 1989\u2033, which preceded editorial game design of games like Raid Gaza in being a response to contemporary events \u2013 in this case, the violently suppressed anti-regime demonstration in Czechoslovakia.   Juul : Indie Games are from Europe   In this talk, I will return to some of the most influential European games of the mid-1980\u2019s and show how they contain both forgotten possibilities that we have yet to bring to fruition, as well as the seeds of many of the current themes in video games, such as the independent developer, games as experiment and personal expression, and the kind of short-turnaround cloning that we find in mobile distribution channels. At the same time, the discussion of video games in the especially the UK gaming press at the time was decidedly un-romantic, avoiding any discussion of games as an art form, vehicle of expression, or indeed as anything more than utility.   Speaker bios   Jaroslav \u0160velch \u00a0is a Ph.D. candidate, lecturer and researcher at Charles University, and currently also a research intern at Microsoft Research New England. He holds a Bachelor\u2019s degree in Journalism and Master\u2019s degrees in Media Studies, and Linguistics and Phonetics/Translation Studies, all from Charles University in Prague. His research focuses on social uses of entertainment technology, history of computer games, language management online and the concepts of monstrosity and adversity in virtual spaces.

He is a visiting arts professor at the NYU Game Center, and has previously worked at the Singapore-MIT GAMBIT Lab at MIT, the Danish Design School, and at the IT University of Copenhagen. His book\u00a0 Half-Real \u00a0on video game theory was published by MIT press in 2005. His book\u00a0 A Casual Revolution \u00a0examines how puzzle games, music games, and the Nintendo Wii brought video games to a new audience.

Location: NYU, 721 Broadway, New York NY 10003, 9th floor conference room.   Please RSVP, see below!     If there is one thing that video game historians can agree on, it is the pivotal importance of the 1983 crash of the video game market. Yet, the crash went largely unnoticed in Europe where consoles were few and the industry only nascent. The history of European video games in 1980\u2019s is better described as a period of unbroken growth and unprecedented experimentation in game design. In this session, our two speakers will discuss the history of early European experimental and independent games, and show how they prefigured much of what is happening in the video games today.   The two speakers of the day are Jaroslav \u0160velch from Charles University (Prague) and Jesper Juul from the NYU Game Center.   [EXPAND Click here to read the talk descriptions and speaker bios.]   The Talks   \u0160velch : The Unintended Avant-garde \u2013 Two stories from 1980\u2032s European game development   The talk discusses two separate stories from the history of computer games, united by the fact that the games at the center of these stories broke new grounds without much impact or commercial success. First, we will discuss the British game \u201cDeus Ex Machina\u201d, probably the first commercially released art game, designed\u00a0 in 1984 by Mel Croucher, whose mission to express abstract human experiences in many ways resembles today\u2019s indie and art games. Secondly, we will talk about the text adventure game \u201cThe Adventures of Indiana Jones on Wenceslas Square in Prague on January 16, 1989\u2033, which preceded editorial game design of games like Raid Gaza in being a response to contemporary events \u2013 in this case, the violently suppressed anti-regime demonstration in Czechoslovakia.   Juul : Indie Games are from Europe   In this talk, I will return to some of the most influential European games of the mid-1980\u2019s and show how they contain both forgotten possibilities that we have yet to bring to fruition, as well as the seeds of many of the current themes in video games, such as the independent developer, games as experiment and personal expression, and the kind of short-turnaround cloning that we find in mobile distribution channels. At the same time, the discussion of video games in the especially the UK gaming press at the time was decidedly un-romantic, avoiding any discussion of games as an art form, vehicle of expression, or indeed as anything more than utility.   Speaker bios   Jaroslav \u0160velch \u00a0is a Ph.D. candidate, lecturer and researcher at Charles University, and currently also a research intern at Microsoft Research New England. He holds a Bachelor\u2019s degree in Journalism and Master\u2019s degrees in Media Studies, and Linguistics and Phonetics/Translation Studies, all from Charles University in Prague. His research focuses on social uses of entertainment technology, history of computer games, language management online and the concepts of monstrosity and adversity in virtual spaces.   Jesper Juul \u00a0has been working with the development of video game theory since the late 1990\u2032s. He is a visiting arts professor at the NYU Game Center, and has previously worked at the Singapore-MIT GAMBIT Lab at MIT, the Danish Design School, and at the IT University of Copenhagen. His book\u00a0 Half-Real \u00a0on video game theory was published by MIT press in 2005. His book\u00a0 A Casual Revolution \u00a0examines how puzzle games, music games, and the Nintendo Wii brought video games to a new audience. His upcoming book\u00a0 The Art of Failure\u00a0 will be published in spring 2013. He maintains the blog The Ludologist on \u201cgame research and other important things\u201d.\u00a0Jesper Juul co-edits the Playful Thinking book series for MIT Press.   The theory seminars are aimed at researchers, industry professionals and students.

Game Center Director Frank Lantz will moderate a discussion between NYC developers who can share insights from different perspectives within the New York scene:   Wade Tinney &#8211; Founding partner and CEO of casual and social game company Large Animal Games, one of the city&#8217;s oldest and most respected development shops.   Zach Wilson &#8211; Senior Level Designer at Kaos Studios, one of New York&#8217;s only triple A big budget developers and creators of the hotly anticipated title Homefront.   Lewis Kofsky &#8211; Partner and Executive Producer at Curious Pictures, an entertainment, animation and production company which recently became a fullfledged game studio.   The panel will discuss the unique challenges and opportunities facing game development companies in New York and discuss their thoughts about how the local scene will evolve as it continues to grow over the next few years.   Starting at 7:00 PM at 721 Broadway, Room 006, this event will be open to students, faculty, and the general public. We welcome everyone, whether you&#8217;re currently studying or teaching games or you are simply curious about this rapidly evolving field. Please come, and feel free to bring any interested NYU colleagues.   Refreshments will be served.
