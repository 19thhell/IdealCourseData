Emergency repairs include major leaks and flooding, inoperative door locks, and any problem that endangers property or safety. In case of an emergency, contact the front desk or any member of the residence hall staff immediately.   Please note: The Office of Residential Life and Housing Services reserve the right to enter student rooms for emergencies, health and safety inspections, and general maintenance purposes. Since NYU residence halls are in service 12 months of the year, it may be necessary for the facilities staff to do painting or other work in your room during your occupancy. Every effort will be made to notify residents of such work in advance.   Room Painting/Construction   Students are not permitted to paint their rooms. Individual rooms are painted by the Housing Facilities Department on a rotating basis. If a room is to be painted while occupied, the resident will be notified in advance. Lofts or other structural modifications to an assigned residence hall space are prohibited.                                                Hours and Locations   Every residence hall has its own resource center open 7 days a week, 10am-10pm.   Specific locations may vary, so check out your hall's web page for more info.

Please note: The Office of Residential Life and Housing Services reserve the right to enter student rooms for emergencies, health and safety inspections, and general maintenance purposes.

Individual rooms are painted by the Housing Facilities Department on a rotating basis. If a room is to be painted while occupied, the resident will be notified in advance. Lofts or other structural modifications to an assigned residence hall space are prohibited.                                                Hours and Locations   Every residence hall has its own resource center open 7 days a week, 10am-10pm.   Specific locations may vary, so check out your hall's web page for more info.
