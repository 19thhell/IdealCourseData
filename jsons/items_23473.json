The Domestic Violence Advocacy Project operates two public service programs for students, supervised by Sanctuary for Families, a New York organization that assists battered women.   Through the Courtroom Advocates Program (CAP), law students assist women at Family Court in getting orders of protection from their batterers. For example, student advocates help the women draft their complaints, answer any questions, and assist the women when they appear before the judge.   In the Uncontested Divorce Project, students are trained to assist women in obtaining a divorce from their batterer.   Prior to participating in these programs, law students participate in a full day of training run by Sanctuary for Families. DVAP also brings in speakers throughout the year and sponsors events for Domestic Violence Awareness Month.    This year, DVAP is organizing a performance of The Vagina Monologues for the law school. The performance dates are February 13-15, 2013.
