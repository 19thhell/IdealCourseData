Courses         Description |    Syllabi |    Evaluations           Through experience, reading, historical perspective, analysis and discussion with experts, the course will focus on essential questions concerning the health of the US political system, particularly means by which presidential candidates are selected and elected. The course will examine lessons from the 1960 through the 2012 campaigns and elections in an effort to understand the current political condition of the US and the path on which the country is headed. The course will analyze American presidential campaigns and elections since 1960. The course will also help students better understand public opinion polls and the nature and structure of American public opinion. Students will examine ways in which American news media transmit information about presidential campaigns and elections, issues, and candidates, and learn about the impact of news upon political behavior and what people do with the information they receive through the news media. In an effort better to understand the relationship (or disconnect) between theory and practice in this field, students will meet practitioners \u2013 people who are involved with presidential politics on a daily basis. By the end of the term, students will be able to make sound, informed and reliable judgments about the health of the American presidential selection system. Students will never look at conventional wisdom in the same way again.

Courses         Description |    Syllabi |    Evaluations           This is an advanced seminar for students who have taken the introductory course on social entrepreneurship, or have focused on similar coursework in past study. Each student will be responsible for developing an original blueprint for social innovation: a creative proposal for solving a societal problem. Over the course of the term, students are expected to turn their blueprint into a reality. To help them do so, the coursework will focus on the skill building necessary to complete the projects. Students will also find support in the instructor, teaching assistant, and their fellow classmates, as well as financial support in the form of seed money, provided by a generous donor, who has \"adopted the class,\" for project completion. Guest lecturers who have particular experience and expertise on the weekly topic will be presenting at various points throughout the term.

Courses         Description |    Syllabi |    Evaluations          This course will focus on four broad movements in post-war America: the movement for African-American Civil Rights; the Gay and Lesbian Civil Rights Movements; the Conservative Movement; and the Consumer Movement. The course will familiarize students with these movements that span post-war American history, putting each in its historical context from the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) to Stonewall to Unsafe at Any Speed to California's Proposition 13. Students will also learn how these movements illustrate the variety of tactics and strategies employed by advocates of social change including boycotts, litigation, regulatory action, electoral politics, marches, and voter referenda.

Courses         Description |    Syllabi |    Evaluations           Through experience, reading, historical perspective, analysis and discussion with experts, the course will focus on essential questions concerning the health of the US political system, particularly means by which presidential candidates are selected and elected. The course will examine lessons from the 1960 through the 2012 campaigns and elections in an effort to understand the current political condition of the US and the path on which the country is headed. The course will analyze American presidential campaigns and elections since 1960. The course will also help students better understand public opinion polls and the nature and structure of American public opinion. Students will examine ways in which American news media transmit information about presidential campaigns and elections, issues, and candidates, and learn about the impact of news upon political behavior and what people do with the information they receive through the news media. In an effort better to understand the relationship (or disconnect) between theory and practice in this field, students will meet practitioners \u2013 people who are involved with presidential politics on a daily basis. By the end of the term, students will be able to make sound, informed and reliable judgments about the health of the American presidential selection system. Students will never look at conventional wisdom in the same way again.

Courses         Description |    Syllabi |    Evaluations           Nonprofits must communicate effectively with clients, policymakers, donors, and other key audiences in order to create social change. Using the \"brandraising\" model (Jossey-Bass, 2009), this course will lay out a framework for effective nonprofit communications. The course will explore how newer channels and tools such as social media can support a nonprofit's mission, where and how branding fits in, how nonprofits leverage communications in order to fundraise, advocate and make programs work, and more.
