A total of three courses (12 credits) are required if Africa is chosen as  the second field.      New York University\u2019s Department of History includes a Ph.D. field in the study of the African Diaspora. As the African Diaspora is as much a conceptual landscape as anything else, the field encourages research agendas that explore connections involving communities of the African-descended that extend beyond geopolitical boundaries, as well as the interrogation of relationships of varying nature and scope with Africa. Lines of inquiry can extend in any direction, and can focus on the cultural, social, political, scientific, and economic, or on any combination thereof.    Study of the African Diaspora at NYU is linked closely to the study of Africa, a separate but related Ph.D course of study. Students in the African Diaspora acquire a familiarity with the dimension of Africa most related to their interests, and their professional development is keenly shaped by the experience. This is by design.    While housed in History and fundamentally historical in approach and training, the study of the African Diaspora, to be successful, must necessarily be informed by methods and perspectives derived from disciplines outside of History. Interdisciplinary, a method in its own right, is therefore embraced by the African Diaspora field.      Related Programs . Within the History Department are a number of parallel Ph.D. fields whose curricula greatly enhance the study of the African Diaspora. In addition to the field in African History are those concerning the Atlantic World, Latin American and the Caribbean, Europe, and the U.S.    Outside of the History Department is a wealth of programs and scholars with which students of the African Diaspora can connect.
