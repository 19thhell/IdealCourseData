Students may enroll in either IDSEM-UG 1789 or ARTS-UG 1609. Students enrolled in IDSEM-UG 1789 will focus their work on the written critical analysis of video; students enrolled in ARTS-UG 1609 will focus their work on the production of video work. All students in this team-taught course share some assignments, written and production-based. Please note this course includes an additional, required meeting hour (Mon, 6:20-7:35) for weekly video screenings. Students enrolled in ARTS-UG 1609 should also note that they will not receive credit toward either the liberal arts foundation or interdisciplinary seminar requirement.                    Description       This course investigates video as an artistic medium, a tool of surveillant culture, and a means for everyday witnessing, watching, documenting, remembering, and giving oneself to be seen. We will begin by tracing the invention of the medium from the mid-1950s, and the subsequent effect on both artists and non-artists as video technology became more commonplace and affordable in the 1970s. We will consider the history of video art, from William Wegman, Vito Acconci, Gary Hill, and Linda Benglis, to Bill Viola, Eija-Liisa Ahtila, and Walid Raad, among many others. Examining the history of video as an art form will require that we make sense of the interaction between artistic and non-artistic uses of the medium, as well as the ways in which artists do the work of representing important aspects of life in the visual field as such technological innovations as video have transformed that experience. What does video offer as a mode of representation that other mediums do not? Are there things that video does particularly well? Conversely, what are the blind spots of the medium? While all students will write critical papers as well as produce short video projects, students are asked to elect to enroll in one of two course code options; Option 1 (Video as Interdisciplinary Seminar, wherein major work completed is of the written type) or Option 2 (Video as Arts Workshop, wherein major work completed is artwork/ video projects). All students meet together regardless of Option elected, and all students are also required to attend weekly screenings of videos in addition to regular course meeting hours.

phrases as translational research or implementation science appeared, the forerunner of Information for Practice (IP) was conceived. Beginning in 1993 as a resource for social workers using Gopher space, the thread that was to become the current Information for Practice emerged. This service has constantly evolved over the past 20 years into a unique international resource for social care/social welfare/social work professionals, that focuses on aggregating news and new scholarship for professional practice. IP is a constantly updated, free service.   Try out the variety of IP services and learn more about IP.

Students may enroll in either IDSEM-UG 1789 or ARTS-UG 1609. Students enrolled in IDSEM-UG 1789 will focus their work on the written critical analysis of video; students enrolled in ARTS-UG 1609 will focus their work on the production of video work. All students in this team-taught course share some assignments, written and production-based. Please note this course includes an additional, required meeting hour (Mon, 6:20-7:35) for weekly video screenings. Students enrolled in ARTS-UG 1609 should also note that they will not receive credit toward either the liberal arts foundation or interdisciplinary seminar requirement.                    Description       This course investigates video as an artistic medium, a tool of surveillant culture, and a means for everyday witnessing, watching, documenting, remembering, and giving oneself to be seen. We will begin by tracing the invention of the medium from the mid-1950s, and the subsequent effect on both artists and non-artists as video technology became more commonplace and affordable in the 1970s. We will consider the history of video art, from William Wegman, Vito Acconci, Gary Hill, and Linda Benglis, to Bill Viola, Eija-Liisa Ahtila, and Walid Raad, among many others. Examining the history of video as an art form will require that we make sense of the interaction between artistic and non-artistic uses of the medium, as well as the ways in which artists do the work of representing important aspects of life in the visual field as such technological innovations as video have transformed that experience. What does video offer as a mode of representation that other mediums do not? Are there things that video does particularly well? Conversely, what are the blind spots of the medium? While all students will write critical papers as well as produce short video projects, students are asked to elect to enroll in one of two course code options; Option 1 (Video as Interdisciplinary Seminar, wherein major work completed is of the written type) or Option 2 (Video as Arts Workshop, wherein major work completed is artwork/ video projects). All students meet together regardless of Option elected, and all students are also required to attend weekly screenings of videos in addition to regular course meeting hours.

phrases as translational research or implementation science appeared, the forerunner of Information for Practice (IP) was conceived. Beginning in 1993 as a resource for social workers using Gopher space, the thread that was to become the current Information for Practice emerged. This service has constantly evolved over the past 20 years into a unique international resource for social care/social welfare/social work professionals, that focuses on aggregating news and new scholarship for professional practice. IP is a constantly updated, free service.   Try out the variety of IP services and learn more about IP.

Thinking about how we interface with these tools beyond the mouse and keyboard, we can approach software and electronics as artists and designers and explore new paradigms of interaction with machines and each other. This introductory course will provide students hands-on experience with screen-based and physical interaction design through programming and electronics using microcontrollers, electronics, and writing our own software. Fundamentals of programming and circuit design will supplement readings on human-computer interaction and design theory. Weekly lab exercises encourage students to experiment freely, creating their own novel interfaces and controls for working with machines.

VISAR-AD 110 Drawing By Seeing                                                                              This workshop class is open to all levels of artistic experience. The premise is that customary perception (drawing what you &ldquo;know&rdquo;) is in conflict with aesthetic perception (drawing what you actually &ldquo;see&rdquo;). Each exercise reinforces an essential principle such as: &ldquo;the whole is greater than the sum of its parts&rdquo; and &ldquo;dynamic perception results in an integrated, dynamic drawing.&rdquo; Students learn how to maintain a unified drawing while at the same time articulate detail. Later sessions address how to apply this experience to individual artistic goals. There are PowerPoint discussions of relevant examples of drawing from the history of drawing.

VISAR-AD 113 Photography as Art and Practice                                                                              Students learn the history, criticism, and variety of theoretical approaches to photography while developing their own skills in the photographic media. The course begins with the origins of the medium in France, England, and the U.S. in the 1830s, and proceeds to a broader look at photography throughout the world. Photography is considered as art, medium of communication, formulator of political and propaganda concepts, advertising tool, and aspect of popular culture, and students produce a portfolio of their photographs.

Our goal is to help students develop the skills of painting and experience it as an art form rich in possibilities for the direct expression of feelings, perceptions and ideas.

VISAR-AD 118 Types of Art: From Calligraphy and Stone Carving to Digital Type                                                                              Type Design is the art and craft of designing typefaces. From calligraphy and stone carving to digital type, the history of type recounts the discoveries and technological progress made through human inventions. While some typefaces are insignificant and forgotten, others will survive mankind, such as Futura engraved on the Apollo 11 plaque, left on the Moon. Some of typefaces were revolutionary, others reactionary. But behind each of them there was an inventor. Students will follow the &#39;traces&#39; and the stories of the type masters who shaped our visual typographical landscapes. Western and Arabic versions of typefaces will be examined and students will learn to identify and combine fonts on real visual design layouts. We will see how typefaces can become visual metaphors of towns and nations - Johnston Underground is London - or marketing tools for the advertising industry. Typography and type design in the digital age will be investigated via practical exercises and printing workshops. The course will include calligraphy classes with the U.A.E. State calligrapher Mohammed Mandi at the National Theater Art Workshop, Abu Dhabi.    Monday March 3 to Monday April 14 (6 classes during term time) will consist of a Calligraphy Course with Mohammed Mandi at the National Theater Art Workshop, Abu Dhabi from 5-8pm. This will replace the usual Monday class.

VISAR-AD 125 Finding The Way: Wayfinding and Graphic Design in the Built Environment                                                                   Wayfinding encompasses all of the ways in which people orient themselves via the organization and usage of sensory cues from the external environment. In visual communication studies nowadays - informed by the constant advance of technologies, the demand for sustainable models and the inputs from cognitive scientists - the concept of wayfinding has grown to the point that it has become a broad field of research in its own, encompassing interdisciplinary relationship with architecture and design.  The course will explore the visual design component of wayfinding, and include lab classes and workshops around the Saadyat Campus signage system, with specific attention to multilingual display and accessible design for people with cognitive or physical disabilities. Students will study and compare sign systems implemented in western capitals and elaborate on the application (and misapplications) of these system in the U.A.E.

VISAR-AD 126 Interventions: Three-Dimensional Thinking                                                        In this seminar we will study the new NYU Campus in Abu Dhabi and use the campus grounds as a site to develop temporary sculptural interventions in this public or semipublic space. We will begin by coming to terms with conceptualisations of sculpture since the 1960s that have understood the physical location of the work of art as a integral to our perception of it. The evolution of context-related sculpture since the 1960s led in the 1980s and 1990s to the need to distinguish between site-dominating, site-adapted, site-specific, and site-determined approaches. We will discuss the differences between them in class and ask how the interventions developed in class relate to the architectural, institutional, social, and cultural circumstances of the campus. This includes questioning what sort of public a sculptural intervention should take into account and how this public differs from the audience at an art gallery. What qualities does public space have that are distinct from those of private space and what characterizes a semipublic space? Over the course of the seminar, we will work out the basic conditions within which we will be allowed to make sculptural interventions on campus. The selected sites will be analyzed in detail. The students will develop their proposals for interventions with the aid of photographic documentation, models, and a project description before realizing the interventions in coordination with the university administration and presenting them to the public for a limited time.

Students explore multiple aspects of visual design from aesthetics to user interfaces and usability, with special consideration of signage in Abu Dhabi. They also develop graphic designs that respond to the Abu Dhabi environment. Practical exercises that emphasize visual communication skills are central to the class. Students become familiar with the design procedures at the core of successful visual identity systems, thus developing their skills in research methodologies, data gathering, analysis, decision making, brainstorming and creative solutions, team work and monitoring.

Any theme/subject and photographic style may be chosen as long as some access to that subject can be gained. Students explore how to approach their subject, develop a theme, and how to choose images that reflect their experiences. They keep a journal, and a final presentation will include a group of photographs and a short personal essay.

How the mind constructs pictures from visual data is an extremely complicated set of behaviors that are biological, psychological, social, and cultural. Students are given in-depth exposure to the conditions that are necessary for artworks to &ldquo;read&rdquo; and how these conditions have a profound effect on the way people engage with art. This exposure allows students to explore ideas of limits and how the limit or horizon of what is possible can be elaborated and expanded on in art. Students engage in group and one-on-one discussions of projects made in response to readings and assignments whose goal is to foster ideas of exploration and consistency in a creative practice.    *Prerequistes: VISAR-AD 112, or, VISAR-AD 122, or, VISAR-AD 123, or VISAR-AD 124.
