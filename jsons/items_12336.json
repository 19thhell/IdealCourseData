How can the literary   imagination reflect and transform geographic and cosmographic   technology? How can reading literary and scientific texts alongside one   another shape our understanding of the boundaries between humanistic and   scientific inquiry? This course will consider major renaissance epics   and romances as worldmaking documents. Text with include Dante's   Inferno, Ariosto's Orlando Gurioso, Spenser's Faerie Queene and Milton's   Paradis Lost. We will read these words in light of Renaissance thinking   about space and spatiality including selections from Plato, Ortelius,   Copernicus, and Kepler. Junior Theory Seminar: What do we mean by Subjectivity? Basterra      We like to  think of ourselves as free: freedom would seem to be a horizon toward we are  intimately oriented. We like to consider  ourselves autonomous subjects with initiative and the ability to act in the  world. But isn\u2019t subjectivity  constituted in relationship to what is other?    The subject of vision in painting, the one who sees, emerges in relation  to the object being seen; the voice speaking in a poem and calling itself \u2018I\u2019  becomes a subject in the act of addressing a \u2018you\u2019; the self-conscious subject  reflects on itself by taking itself for another; the ethical subject is chosen  and called. It is perhaps surprising,  however, to think of the very freedom which (we hope) defines our sameness as  something other. This seminar explores  the counterintuitive relationship of subjectivity to freedom, and of freedom to  action, establishing a conversation between philosophical texts by Kant, Hegel,  Deleuze, Nancy and Levinas, and a range of literary and artistic works.  Topics in 18th Century Literature: Comparative Melancholies Gadberry      Twentieth- and  twenty-first-century thinkers looked back to the seventeenth and eighteenth  centuries as they theorized the black dog dogging modernity: melancholy. Our  course will return to these earlier texts, putting early modern, Enlightenment,  and Romantic literatures in conversation with modern and post-modern  psychoanalytic, philosophical, and political-theoretical works. Our course will  be both formal and historical. We will ask how our primary texts understand  (and create) structures of melancholy and how these texts communicate the  losses we cannot avow. And we\u2019ll also examine how varying forms of melancholy  have shaped our subjectivities and societies as we study a history of  melancholy coinciding with and subtending modernity\u2019s origins \u2013 a history that  includes the emergence of the modern nation-state, of the colony, and of capital.      Our seventeenth- and  eighteenth-century texts will include: Shakespeare, Hamlet; Burton, The Anatomy  of Melancholy (selections); Defoe, Robinson Crusoe; Charles Brockden Brown,  Wieland; Claire de Durfort Duras, Ourika; Goethe, The Sorrows of Young Werther;  and poems by Coleridge, Blair, Young, Keats, and others. Among our modern  readings will be works by Freud, Lacan, Benjamin, Butler, Fanon, Brown, Klein,  Kristeva, and others.      Topics: Transnational America Garcia Beginning with Randolph Bourne's \"Trans-National America\" (1916), this course examines different transnational and globalized conceptions of \"America\" across literature and criticism from both the twentieth century and twenty-first century. We consider transnational American literatures not only for the different meanings they attach to \"America,\" but also for the divergent moments of literary, cultural and intellectual history they reveal. Much of the course is devoted to the interventions of critics such as Bourne, W.E.B. Du Bois, Alain Locke, whose writings we examine in terms of literary-theoretical resonances with works by Jean Toomer, Willa Cather, Henry James, Nella Larsen, Teju Cole and Joseph O'Neill, among others.  Readings in Comtemporary Literary Theory: Image Iampolski      The course is designed to introduce students to the  theoretical framework of modern thinking about images. Images mediate our  relations with the world and are responsible for the primordial elaboration of  meaning from the surrounding chaotic complexity. We will start with biological  evolution and the emergence of vision and the unparalleled variety of striking  appearances in living beings that emerged around the famous Cambrian explosion.  We will use the data provided by cognitive sciences to understand the  anthropological role of images, the use of images in cults and rituals. Special  attention will be paid to the emergence of art and to its modern developments  in photography and contemporary media. We will discuss the role of images in  the rise and transformations of modern subjectivity. The social role of images  in modern society will be surveyed. The readings will include among others many  influential thinkers and scholars such as Jakob von Uexk\u00fcll, Heidegger,  Merleau-Ponty, Kracauer, Benjamin, Foucault, Panofsky, Gombrich, Marion,  Didi-Huberman etc. Topics in 20th Century Literature: Literature &amp; the Figure of the Disappeared in Spain and the Southern Cone Matos-Martin     In the twentieth century, Spain  and many countries in Latin America have shared the common experience of  dictatorship. In this course, we will explore representations of the traumatic  dictatorial histories in Spain and the countries of the Southern Cone, focusing  primarily on the figure of the \u201cdesaparecido\u201d in Spanish Civil War and the  early years of the Franco regime, Argentina\u2019s \u201cdirty war\u201d and Pinochet\u2019s  dictatorship in Chile. Taking a comparative approach, we will study literary  and visual sources such as short stories, novels, poems, painting, fiction  films or documentaries, and we will examine topics such as the politics of  memory, fascism, political disappearance, war, resistance or violence. Some  authors and filmmakers whose works we might engage include Alberto M\u00e9ndez,  Luisa Valenzuela, Andr\u00e9s Wood, Marco Bechis, Guillermo del Toro, Agust\u00edn  Villaronga, Pablo Picasso, Pablo Neruda, Rafael Alberti, Jorge Sempr\u00fan,  Patricio Guzm\u00e1n, Juan Gelman, Roberto Bola\u00f1o and Gast\u00f3n Birab\u00e9n. Primary  materials will be paired with texts by leading cultural and political thinkers  working on questions of memory, fascism, terror and violence. Intro to Comp Lit: Classic Screw-Ups and Epic Fails: From Faust To Kathy Acker &amp; Dennis Cooper Ronell      The course aims to introduce some  thrilling aspects of reading and thinking in the void of achievement. We will  explore the way literature exemplarily treats and exposes snags, flaws,  addictive roller coaster itineraries, sexual confusion, rhetorical static,  material abuse and gender trouble, permanent identity crises, the intrusive  disruption of life\u2019s narrative, forms of destructive pleasure, failing health  and other disturbances that inflect the way we write and think and truck.  Staying close to the texts in question, we will locate philosophical  predicaments, cover-ups and inflations with which literature regularly  contends, if according to covert maneuvers. All the while learning how to  deconstruct, we will consider the way Stupidity insinuates itself into themes  of knowing, evades our cognitive scanners and becomes the uncanny double of mastery  or intelligence.

Topics in Film &amp; Literatue: Documents, Documentary, Fiction Vatulescu      What do we mean by document,  documentary, and fiction? How have these concepts and their relationships  changed through time? This course starts by considering the beginnings of  documentary in literature, film, and the visual arts, from the controversial  coining of the term in 1926. We will explore representative works from  foundational moments in the evolution of documentary\u2014the beginnings of the newsreel,  Soviet and Nazi propaganda, American depression era documentary books, the  cin\u00e9ma-v\u00e9rit\u00e9 movement, and the rise of autobiographical/personal documentary  films. How has the emergence of this new term and its development affected our  other key concepts\u2014document and fiction? What is the relationship between  documentary modes and particular media and technologies\u2014print, photography,  cinema, video, and digital? Other topics include the role of the artist,  indexicality and representation, literature as historical document, \u201cfiction in  the archives,\u201d false documents and forgery, collage, illustration, and other  uses of the document in twentieth century art. This semester\u2019s special topics  are 1) word/image relations and 2) the archive. Theoretical forays around and  into the archive will be complemented by hands-on research in the Tamiment  archive or in an archive of your choice.    Senior Seminar in Comparative Literature: Honors Thesis Vatulescu This seminar, limited to senior Comparative Literature majors engaged in writing a senior honors thesis, is designed to be a writing workshop. Students will articulate and research a thesis topic, identify an appropriate critical approach and methodology, and write at least one chapter of their thesis. Periodical writing installments give the students the opportunity to receive feed-back from their peers and instructor as well as to learn to critique others' work-in-progress. Permission of the DUGS is required to enroll in the course. Students must also have a 3.65 or better GPA, both overall and in the major.

My book An Atheism that is not Humanist Emerges in French Thought (forthcoming spring 2010) addresses the development of French \u201cantihumanism\u201d from 1925 through 1955, which I treat as an intellectual, theological, and philosophical problem. Against the backdrop of political attacks against \u201cbourgeois\u201d humanism that gained force in the interwar period and reached their apex in the late 1940s, the book traces (a) the gradual rejection of secular rationalism\u2019s expectation of progress toward a more human and fundamentally equal future\u2014in other words, the mid-century anti-utopian turn in atheism, and (b) the emergence of a negative anthropology, that is to say the epistemological and existential rejection of man as a foundation of knowledge, meaning, and action, joined by an attempt to explain the specifically human aspect of existence by reference to man\u2019s dependence on the world he finds himself inhabiting and engaging, rather than on any specific or given \u201chuman nature.\u201d (Among the figures examined are Al. Koyr\u00e9, Al. Koj\u00e8ve, J. Wahl, Emm. Levinas, G. Bataille, M. Heidegger, M. Merleau-Ponty, and M. Blanchot.)    Within the framework of 20th-century French intellectual history, I am particularly interested in links and between philosophy, theology, and philosophy of science; and my approach to philosophical and conceptual problems as well as cultural history in An Atheism that is not Humanist tries to work in . From these interests have emerged projects on Georges Canguilhem (two book translations\u2014 Knowledge of Life and the forthcoming Writings on Medicine and a small number of essays), on the Jesuit Hegelian philosopher Gaston Fessard, and on the biologist and philosopher Henri Atlan (an editing project of his major essays in English, also forthcoming).    My research at present extends from the effort to address intellectual-historical problems at these parallel and often intertwined levels. I am working on two projects. The first is a project on transparency (transparency of the real, visual transparency, social transparency) and related notions in post-WWII France; the idea is to discuss the post-war dismantling of transparency as social goal and central premise of the relationship between man and world. The second (still at the planning stage) is a research project on the figure of the New Man from the Enlightenment through the early twentieth century, and its relation to certain other concepts and tropes, such as the regeneration or transformation of human nature    I also write on cinema.    Teaching Interests:    I teach courses in modern European intellectual history, particularly the interwar and post WWII period; courses in the history of particular concepts and conceptual constellations in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries; and also courses on certain figures of 20th-century thought. I am interested in reading texts with interdisciplinary attention to questions bridging philosophy, science, theology, and literature, as well as with attention to their rhetorical and conceptual complexity.

How can the literary   imagination reflect and transform geographic and cosmographic   technology? How can reading literary and scientific texts alongside one   another shape our understanding of the boundaries between humanistic and   scientific inquiry? This course will consider major renaissance epics   and romances as worldmaking documents. Text with include Dante's   Inferno, Ariosto's Orlando Gurioso, Spenser's Faerie Queene and Milton's   Paradis Lost. We will read these words in light of Renaissance thinking   about space and spatiality including selections from Plato, Ortelius,   Copernicus, and Kepler. Junior Theory Seminar: What do we mean by Subjectivity? Basterra      We like to  think of ourselves as free: freedom would seem to be a horizon toward we are  intimately oriented. We like to consider  ourselves autonomous subjects with initiative and the ability to act in the  world. But isn\u2019t subjectivity  constituted in relationship to what is other?    The subject of vision in painting, the one who sees, emerges in relation  to the object being seen; the voice speaking in a poem and calling itself \u2018I\u2019  becomes a subject in the act of addressing a \u2018you\u2019; the self-conscious subject  reflects on itself by taking itself for another; the ethical subject is chosen  and called. It is perhaps surprising,  however, to think of the very freedom which (we hope) defines our sameness as  something other. This seminar explores  the counterintuitive relationship of subjectivity to freedom, and of freedom to  action, establishing a conversation between philosophical texts by Kant, Hegel,  Deleuze, Nancy and Levinas, and a range of literary and artistic works.  Topics in 18th Century Literature: Comparative Melancholies Gadberry      Twentieth- and  twenty-first-century thinkers looked back to the seventeenth and eighteenth  centuries as they theorized the black dog dogging modernity: melancholy. Our  course will return to these earlier texts, putting early modern, Enlightenment,  and Romantic literatures in conversation with modern and post-modern  psychoanalytic, philosophical, and political-theoretical works. Our course will  be both formal and historical. We will ask how our primary texts understand  (and create) structures of melancholy and how these texts communicate the  losses we cannot avow. And we\u2019ll also examine how varying forms of melancholy  have shaped our subjectivities and societies as we study a history of  melancholy coinciding with and subtending modernity\u2019s origins \u2013 a history that  includes the emergence of the modern nation-state, of the colony, and of capital.      Our seventeenth- and  eighteenth-century texts will include: Shakespeare, Hamlet; Burton, The Anatomy  of Melancholy (selections); Defoe, Robinson Crusoe; Charles Brockden Brown,  Wieland; Claire de Durfort Duras, Ourika; Goethe, The Sorrows of Young Werther;  and poems by Coleridge, Blair, Young, Keats, and others. Among our modern  readings will be works by Freud, Lacan, Benjamin, Butler, Fanon, Brown, Klein,  Kristeva, and others.      Topics: Transnational America Garcia Beginning with Randolph Bourne's \"Trans-National America\" (1916), this course examines different transnational and globalized conceptions of \"America\" across literature and criticism from both the twentieth century and twenty-first century. We consider transnational American literatures not only for the different meanings they attach to \"America,\" but also for the divergent moments of literary, cultural and intellectual history they reveal. Much of the course is devoted to the interventions of critics such as Bourne, W.E.B. Du Bois, Alain Locke, whose writings we examine in terms of literary-theoretical resonances with works by Jean Toomer, Willa Cather, Henry James, Nella Larsen, Teju Cole and Joseph O'Neill, among others.  Readings in Comtemporary Literary Theory: Image Iampolski      The course is designed to introduce students to the  theoretical framework of modern thinking about images. Images mediate our  relations with the world and are responsible for the primordial elaboration of  meaning from the surrounding chaotic complexity. We will start with biological  evolution and the emergence of vision and the unparalleled variety of striking  appearances in living beings that emerged around the famous Cambrian explosion.  We will use the data provided by cognitive sciences to understand the  anthropological role of images, the use of images in cults and rituals. Special  attention will be paid to the emergence of art and to its modern developments  in photography and contemporary media. We will discuss the role of images in  the rise and transformations of modern subjectivity. The social role of images  in modern society will be surveyed. The readings will include among others many  influential thinkers and scholars such as Jakob von Uexk\u00fcll, Heidegger,  Merleau-Ponty, Kracauer, Benjamin, Foucault, Panofsky, Gombrich, Marion,  Didi-Huberman etc. Topics in 20th Century Literature: Literature &amp; the Figure of the Disappeared in Spain and the Southern Cone Matos-Martin     In the twentieth century, Spain  and many countries in Latin America have shared the common experience of  dictatorship. In this course, we will explore representations of the traumatic  dictatorial histories in Spain and the countries of the Southern Cone, focusing  primarily on the figure of the \u201cdesaparecido\u201d in Spanish Civil War and the  early years of the Franco regime, Argentina\u2019s \u201cdirty war\u201d and Pinochet\u2019s  dictatorship in Chile. Taking a comparative approach, we will study literary  and visual sources such as short stories, novels, poems, painting, fiction  films or documentaries, and we will examine topics such as the politics of  memory, fascism, political disappearance, war, resistance or violence. Some  authors and filmmakers whose works we might engage include Alberto M\u00e9ndez,  Luisa Valenzuela, Andr\u00e9s Wood, Marco Bechis, Guillermo del Toro, Agust\u00edn  Villaronga, Pablo Picasso, Pablo Neruda, Rafael Alberti, Jorge Sempr\u00fan,  Patricio Guzm\u00e1n, Juan Gelman, Roberto Bola\u00f1o and Gast\u00f3n Birab\u00e9n. Primary  materials will be paired with texts by leading cultural and political thinkers  working on questions of memory, fascism, terror and violence. Intro to Comp Lit: Classic Screw-Ups and Epic Fails: From Faust To Kathy Acker &amp; Dennis Cooper Ronell      The course aims to introduce some  thrilling aspects of reading and thinking in the void of achievement. We will  explore the way literature exemplarily treats and exposes snags, flaws,  addictive roller coaster itineraries, sexual confusion, rhetorical static,  material abuse and gender trouble, permanent identity crises, the intrusive  disruption of life\u2019s narrative, forms of destructive pleasure, failing health  and other disturbances that inflect the way we write and think and truck.  Staying close to the texts in question, we will locate philosophical  predicaments, cover-ups and inflations with which literature regularly  contends, if according to covert maneuvers. All the while learning how to  deconstruct, we will consider the way Stupidity insinuates itself into themes  of knowing, evades our cognitive scanners and becomes the uncanny double of mastery  or intelligence. Promised: By the end of the class, you will have been able to  comprehend this course description. Prepare to be reset! Topics in Film &amp; Literatue: Documents, Documentary, Fiction Vatulescu      What do we mean by document,  documentary, and fiction? How have these concepts and their relationships  changed through time? This course starts by considering the beginnings of  documentary in literature, film, and the visual arts, from the controversial  coining of the term in 1926. We will explore representative works from  foundational moments in the evolution of documentary\u2014the beginnings of the newsreel,  Soviet and Nazi propaganda, American depression era documentary books, the  cin\u00e9ma-v\u00e9rit\u00e9 movement, and the rise of autobiographical/personal documentary  films. How has the emergence of this new term and its development affected our  other key concepts\u2014document and fiction? What is the relationship between  documentary modes and particular media and technologies\u2014print, photography,  cinema, video, and digital? Other topics include the role of the artist,  indexicality and representation, literature as historical document, \u201cfiction in  the archives,\u201d false documents and forgery, collage, illustration, and other  uses of the document in twentieth century art. This semester\u2019s special topics  are 1) word/image relations and 2) the archive. Theoretical forays around and  into the archive will be complemented by hands-on research in the Tamiment  archive or in an archive of your choice.    Senior Seminar in Comparative Literature: Honors Thesis Vatulescu This seminar, limited to senior Comparative Literature majors engaged in writing a senior honors thesis, is designed to be a writing workshop. Students will articulate and research a thesis topic, identify an appropriate critical approach and methodology, and write at least one chapter of their thesis. Periodical writing installments give the students the opportunity to receive feed-back from their peers and instructor as well as to learn to critique others' work-in-progress. Permission of the DUGS is required to enroll in the course. Students must also have a 3.65 or better GPA, both overall and in the major.

My book An Atheism that is not Humanist Emerges in French Thought (forthcoming spring 2010) addresses the development of French \u201cantihumanism\u201d from 1925 through 1955, which I treat as an intellectual, theological, and philosophical problem. Against the backdrop of political attacks against \u201cbourgeois\u201d humanism that gained force in the interwar period and reached their apex in the late 1940s, the book traces (a) the gradual rejection of secular rationalism\u2019s expectation of progress toward a more human and fundamentally equal future\u2014in other words, the mid-century anti-utopian turn in atheism, and (b) the emergence of a negative anthropology, that is to say the epistemological and existential rejection of man as a foundation of knowledge, meaning, and action, joined by an attempt to explain the specifically human aspect of existence by reference to man\u2019s dependence on the world he finds himself inhabiting and engaging, rather than on any specific or given \u201chuman nature.\u201d (Among the figures examined are Al. Koyr\u00e9, Al. Koj\u00e8ve, J. Wahl, Emm. Levinas, G. Bataille, M. Heidegger, M. Merleau-Ponty, and M. Blanchot.)    Within the framework of 20th-century French intellectual history, I am particularly interested in links and between philosophy, theology, and philosophy of science; and my approach to philosophical and conceptual problems as well as cultural history in An Atheism that is not Humanist tries to work in . From these interests have emerged projects on Georges Canguilhem (two book translations\u2014 Knowledge of Life and the forthcoming Writings on Medicine and a small number of essays), on the Jesuit Hegelian philosopher Gaston Fessard, and on the biologist and philosopher Henri Atlan (an editing project of his major essays in English, also forthcoming).    My research at present extends from the effort to address intellectual-historical problems at these parallel and often intertwined levels. I am working on two projects. The first is a project on transparency (transparency of the real, visual transparency, social transparency) and related notions in post-WWII France; the idea is to discuss the post-war dismantling of transparency as social goal and central premise of the relationship between man and world. The second (still at the planning stage) is a research project on the figure of the New Man from the Enlightenment through the early twentieth century, and its relation to certain other concepts and tropes, such as the regeneration or transformation of human nature    I also write on cinema.    Teaching Interests:    I teach courses in modern European intellectual history, particularly the interwar and post WWII period; courses in the history of particular concepts and conceptual constellations in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries; and also courses on certain figures of 20th-century thought. I am interested in reading texts with interdisciplinary attention to questions bridging philosophy, science, theology, and literature, as well as with attention to their rhetorical and conceptual complexity.
