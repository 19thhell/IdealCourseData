Description       This course explores the idea of metamorphosis, or transformation, by which humans become\u2014among other things--stones, flowers, and stars; animals, gods, monsters; and members of the opposite sex. We read and write about some of the many varieties of metamorphosis, such as those linked with disguise and dissimulation; madness and dissolution; immigration and exile; sickness and healing; and self-creation that reflects self-knowledge. Students write academic essays that develop their own ideas in their own voices, in stages that progress from freewriting and drafting to workshopping, revising and polishing. Throughout the course, we reflect on writing itself as a transformation of subjective, ephemeral impressions into words fixed on paper (or shimmering in cyberspace) through which we communicate with others.

Description       Ovid\u2019s story of Echo and Narcissus from\u00a0 Metamorphoses \u00a0portrays the dangers of refusing to heed the call of the Other. Absorbed by his own image, Narcissus ignores the nymph Echo, who relies upon his words to speak. His solipsism leads to their deaths. This class takes Ovid\u2019s story as a model for investigating how the self is shaped in relation to the other, a question considered by psychologists, writers, philosophers, filmmakers and literary critics. We will read psychological discussions of the development of the self or ego (Freud, Winnicott, Benjamin), literary portrayals of the self in relation to others (Woolf\u2019s\u00a0 Mrs. Dalloway \u00a0, Joyce\u2019s \u201cThe Dead,\u201d Duras\u2019\u00a0 The Ravishing of Lol V. Stein \u00a0), and philosophical essays (Blanchot, Levinas). We will examine the breakdown in the connection between the self and the other due to trauma, reading essays in trauma studies (Caruth and Brison), and the ways in which colonialism and empire shape conceptions of self and other, reading novels (Forster,\u00a0 A Passage To India \u00a0) and theory (Said, Spivak). We will also ask what problems arise specifically when women speak\u2014how Echo finds a voice\u2014viewing the films\u00a0 Spellbound \u00a0and\u00a0 Sunset Boulevard \u00a0.

Description       This course explores the idea of metamorphosis, or transformation, by which humans become\u2014among other things--stones, flowers, and stars; animals, gods, monsters; and members of the opposite sex. We read and write about some of the many varieties of metamorphosis, such as those linked with disguise and dissimulation; madness and dissolution; immigration and exile; sickness and healing; and self-creation that reflects self-knowledge. Students write academic essays that develop their own ideas in their own voices, in stages that progress from freewriting and drafting to workshopping, revising and polishing. Throughout the course, we reflect on writing itself as a transformation of subjective, ephemeral impressions into words fixed on paper (or shimmering in cyberspace) through which we communicate with others. Readings include selections from Ovid\u2019s\u00a0 Metamorphoses \u00a0(Humphries trans.) and a contemporary play based on it by Mary Zimmerman; fairy tales, folk tales and contemporary revisions (ed. Maria Tatar); Kafka\u2019s\u00a0 The Metamorphosis \u00a0; essays on neurological transformation and creative responses to it in Oliver Sacks\u2019s\u00a0 An Anthropologist on Mars \u00a0; and essays on immigration and exile in\u00a0 Letters of Transit \u00a0(ed. Andre Aciman).
