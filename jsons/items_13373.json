The Department of East Asian Studies offers courses on China, Japan, and Korea. The focus of the program is primarily on language and literature and the way in which these three civilizations have interacted with the Western world to reconstitute received cultures into modern societies. By intensive study of Asian culture, the student is encouraged to reflect on the global interrelatedness of human society. Three language sequences are offered: a six-semester Chinese language sequence, a six-semester Japanese language sequence, and a six-semester Korean language sequence. Fourth-year study is also offered in all three languages. In addition, various courses in Asian culture in history, religion, literature, film, philosophy and art are offered in the Department of East Asian Studies and in conjunction with other departments. The program has two objectives: (1) to develop a high level of competence in Chinese, Japanese, or Korean and (2) to introduce students to Asian cultures through the study of translated literary and cultural documents (literature, history, religion, film, and philosophy) created within those societies. Ongoing study of those cultures is encouraged as a means of acquiring a broad comparative perspective. The courses are offered in conjunction with various departments, underscoring the multidisciplinary nature of the program. See Academic Advising for more information about the program.

Focusing on the early-modern to modern period of Chinese and Japanese history (17 th century onwards), the field aims to locate East Asia within a larger global framework. It intends to encourage students to engage broadly with historical questions that emerged from within and that have helped shape the various East Asian societies, in their interactions with each other and in the larger worlds of global commerce, culture, and capitalism.    Specific course guidelines are flexible and are tailored to the needs and abilities of each student. To qualify as PhD candidates, students normally take exams in three fields: a major field, a minor field, and a thematic field. The major and minor can be two separate chronologies of the same national history (e.g. Ming/Qing China, modern China), or two national histories (e.g. modern China and modern Japan). The thematic field should be a theoretical area of interest (e.g. gender studies, social theory, theories of nationalism, etc.); this latter field can be constructed in accordance with student interests and in consultation with a faculty advisor. The exam committee normally consists of three faculty, two of whom should be from the History Department and one of whom can be from a closely affiliated Department or another University (if necessary).    Language Requirement : It is strongly suggested that students already have facility in one Asian language prior to enrollment; summer funding is not normally available for language acquisition and using graduate credits for non-advanced language learning at NYU is not permitted. Students are required to know one Asian language to a degree of research fluency in reading, speaking, and listening and should be able to pass a written translation exam in another language (Asian or European or African). Language exams should be passed by the time students sit for qualifying exams (normally the end of the second year or beginning of third year of study).
