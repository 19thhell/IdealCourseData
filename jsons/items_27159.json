To our knowledge, TiVo does not have any agreements with universities.                                                                Why is the Campus Cable channel line-up different than Time Warner, RCN, or Comcast?                                   Campus Cable is a private, closed-circuit system operated by NYU. As a result, the lineup differs from subscriber services such as TimeWarner, RCN, and Comcast.                                                                Do we have the option to buy premium channels or pay-per-view?                                   The Campus Cable system is a non-addressable system that is provided to all students living in most residence halls. In other words, everyone gets the same channels, and there is no need for a set top box, as one would have in a traditional home setting. As a result, the Campus Cable system provides our viewers with a service that is easy to hook up, and it provides the same cable programming to all rooms.                                                                Can we add the YES Network to the lineup for the Yankees games?                                   Being right here in NYC, we know how you feel. Many viewers would like to see the Yankee games. Unfortunately, the YES channel is not currently on the Campus Cable lineup due to licensing costs, which are similar to premium channel costs. Considering the fact that most students leave campus in May, and the games airing in September are on national local or cable channels, the increase in cost does not balance out for two and half months of programming. As always, we wish to ensure a great channel lineup (over 80 channels!) at no cost to students. As a result, we are unable to add the YES Network to our system at this time. However, we continue to monitor the rates for the this channel should there be a change and will keep you informed of any progress.

To our knowledge, TiVo does not have any agreements with universities.                                                                Why is the Campus Cable channel line-up different than Time Warner, RCN, or Comcast?                                   Campus Cable is a private, closed-circuit system operated by NYU. As a result, the lineup differs from subscriber services such as TimeWarner, RCN, and Comcast.                                                                Do we have the option to buy premium channels or pay-per-view?                                   The Campus Cable system is a non-addressable system that is provided to all students living in most residence halls. In other words, everyone gets the same channels, and there is no need for a set top box, as one would have in a traditional home setting. As a result, the Campus Cable system provides our viewers with a service that is easy to hook up, and it provides the same cable programming to all rooms.                                                                Can we add the YES Network to the lineup for the Yankees games?                                   Being right here in NYC, we know how you feel. Many viewers would like to see the Yankee games. Unfortunately, the YES channel is not currently on the Campus Cable lineup due to licensing costs, which are similar to premium channel costs. Considering the fact that most students leave campus in May, and the games airing in September are on national local or cable channels, the increase in cost does not balance out for two and half months of programming. As always, we wish to ensure a great channel lineup (over 80 channels!) at no cost to students. As a result, we are unable to add the YES Network to our system at this time. However, we continue to monitor the rates for the this channel should there be a change and will keep you informed of any progress.

The system is also integrated with the National Emergency Alert in the event it is triggered by government officials or locally by NYU Protection.

You will see tests performed at various times to ensure its integrity. In the event of an emergency, important information will display on the television, as well as verbal audio reading of the event.

Why is the Campus Cable channel line-up different than Time Warner, RCN, or Comcast?                                   Campus Cable is a private, closed-circuit system operated by NYU. As a result, the lineup differs from subscriber services such as TimeWarner, RCN, and Comcast.                                                                Do we have the option to buy premium channels or pay-per-view?                                   The Campus Cable system is a non-addressable system that is provided to all students living in most residence halls. In other words, everyone gets the same channels, and there is no need for a set top box, as one would have in a traditional home setting. As a result, the Campus Cable system provides our viewers with a service that is easy to hook up, and it provides the same cable programming to all rooms.                                                                Can we add the YES Network to the lineup for the Yankees games?                                   Being right here in NYC, we know how you feel. Many viewers would like to see the Yankee games. Unfortunately, the YES channel is not currently on the Campus Cable lineup due to licensing costs, which are similar to premium channel costs. Considering the fact that most students leave campus in May, and the games airing in September are on national local or cable channels, the increase in cost does not balance out for two and half months of programming. As always, we wish to ensure a great channel lineup (over 80 channels!) at no cost to students. As a result, we are unable to add the YES Network to our system at this time. However, we continue to monitor the rates for the this channel should there be a change and will keep you informed of any progress.

The system is also integrated with the National Emergency Alert in the event it is triggered by government officials or locally by NYU Protection.
