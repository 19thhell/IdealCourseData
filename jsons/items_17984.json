This World Wide network is incorporated into virtually every aspect of modern life. Internet protocols are the standards that applications and devices follow for communication. Based on a set of rules, devices are enabled to communicate through a medium which can be any physical network that follows the set rules.   Internet protocols are built for many different purposes, and so can vary widely. Internet protocols using data have to travel through the internet\u2019s seven major layers to get to the set destination. The internet layers each get the data from the previous layer and add a header to the data so the data can be decoded, pass it to the next layer, and finally to the physical layer which follows its own set of rules depending on the medium involved. Examples of physical layers are phone landlines and cellular networks.   Early networks consisted of two types, circular and star networks. Circular networks are a series of references where the last object references the first, resulting in a closed loop.      Circular Network Topology\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0      Star Network Topology   Star networks consist of one central switch, hub or computer, which acts as a conduit to transmit messages. In a star topology every node (computer workstation or any other peripheral) is connected to central node called hub or switch. The switch is the server and the peripherals are the clients.   The World Wide Web is now much more complicated than these early network topologies. The web today is a series of networks interconnected to each other, and there is no single central device which has a top-to-bottom control over the other devices.      Internet Topology   Wireless Communications in Cities   Networks of wireless communication devices are quickly changing how modern cities work. Traffic engineering is one example of a discipline that is evolving in the era of wireless communication. Routers and cameras on traffic lights collect real-time data that can be used to determine the best strategies for controlling traffic flow, and alert emergency departments to traffic conditions.\u00a0\u00a0 dynamically process the flow of the traffic and improve the best strategies for controlling the traffic with the help of that data. And individuals can now get real-time traffic information on their wireless devices such as cellular phones.   In dense cities like New York City it is a challenge to get good wireless coverage for cellular devices. Tall buildings and high network traffic in these cities make it necessary for carrier companies to use large numbers of antennas. Tall buildings are physical obstacles that prevent radio waves from propagating. Each antenna can support a limited number of devices in its range, and in very crowded areas, dropped calls are common. When more antennas are used in a given area, the chance of interference of radio waves increases. Since each antenna is using its own channel and frequency, two frequencies in one location can cause bad coverage. Or, an area can simply lack coverage.   Procedure   Cell Antenna Activity   Students will address the problem of how to best position cell towers. Each antenna in a city has a sight of about 30 to 35 degrees. The most common method is to install antennas in a triangular shape on buildings. Of course, the size and orientation of buildings in a city are not always the same, and the geometrical way of installing antennas and the antenna type itself may change consequently.   Tell students they will be arranging cell antennas on a map. Their goal is to get the best coverage in their given situation. Discuss the ranges and frequency of each antenna, and the angle that each antenna can be focused to transmit. Discuss how the antennas signals might interfere with each other, which would disrupt the function of the network.   Students should work in groups to produce a map and arrange antennas on it to produce a functioning network with good coverage.   Northrop Grumman Cell Network Simulation Activity   Explain the following scenario to students:   To simulate a cellular network in the Smart City, students will use modulated infrared LEDs as antennas and infrared receivers to send and receive signals. Each antenna in an area has a unique frequency range which assigns a channel to the cell devices in its range once a connection is needed. Each IR LED will represent an antenna in the network. Antennas are connected to arduino modules that will generate a pre-specified code for the LED to send, noting that each antenna has a unique code. The code is sent by modulating the IR light, which means turning the LED on and off a specific number of times in each second, with equal amount of time for an on pulse length and an off pulse length.   Each building in the city will have three antennas connected to one arduino. All antennas on each building will send the same code. After putting together the circuits for the antennas, the students will determine a strategy for positioning the antennas. The antennas (IR LEDs) can be attached to side of the buildings and/or on top of the buildings.   Antennas high up on a building will be able to cover a wider range but are also more likely to generate noise signals as they get farther from the receiver modules. Antennas that are mounted closer to the ground and closer to the receivers will have a better reading but will have less coverage.   When planning a strategy for positioning the antennas, students should keep in mind that if antennas are placed too far apart, there will be uncovered spaces that might cause a \u201cdropped call\u201d for a user (receiver) due to being out of range of the antennas. If antennas are placed too close to one another, there will be an interference of the signals being sent by two antennas and there will be noise reading from the receiver module, or a bad signal.      Assembling the Antennas     Connect the 2N3904 transistor to the mini breadboard.   Connect a 1K resistor to pin three of the transistor and to another row.   Connect a 220 Ohm resistor on one side of the mini breadboard connecting the top and bottom parts of the board.   Insert an LED light with the positive pin connected to the 220 Ohm resistor.   Connect pin 2 of the transistor to the negative pin of the LED with a jumper wire.   Connect the second pin of the 220 Ohm resistor to the second pin of the 1K resistor with a jumper wire.   Connect three 100 Ohm resistors to the second pin of the 220 Ohm resistor and to three different rows.   Connect the three IR LED light positive pins to the three 100 Ohm resistors, and connect the negative pins to the pin three of the transistor.   Connect the 5v pin of the arduino to the 1K resistor. Connect the Gnd pin to pin 1 of the transistor. Connect pin 2 of the transistor to PWM pin 3 of the arduino.       Receiver module:     Connect a visible LED light to a 220 Ohm resistor on a mini breadboard.   Connect the IR receiver (phototransistor) to 470K resistor using male to female jumper wires.   Connect the positive pin of the IR receiver to pin 11 of the arduino.   Connect the negative pins of the LED and IR receiver to the Gnd pin of the arduino.   Connect the Vcc pin (5v) of the arduino to the resistors.         After programming the arduinos connected to the antennas with different codes using the IRsend arduino code example, the antennas can either be powered by cables connected to the computer or by 9 volt batteries (preferred).   Connecting the receiver to the computer and programming it with the related arduino code, the IR receiver (phototransistor) can be held close to the antennas to receive the transmitted values. These values can be read from the arduino serial monitor. If the shown values are not the values transmitted by the antennas (manually preset for each antenna) it is considered noise. This can be due to overlapping of the ranges of two antennas, or a bad range (issues with distance). If nothing is outputted from the serial monitor, the antenna is out of range.   Investigating Questions     Where in your model city were you most likely to get a bad signal or no coverage? Is that the same as in a real city?   What are some important uses of cellular networks in cities?   What would you want the cellular network in your smart city to be able to do?

In today\u2019s cities, internet protocols, securely engineered networks, and wireless technology allow for cheaper and more efficient connectivity with a much wider range of accessibly.   Engineering Connection:   Over the past three decades, methods of communication have changed greatly with technological advances. Wireless communication has introduced new pathways for data transmission, and electronic engineering has been speeding microprocessors allowing greater amountsn of data to flow at much higher speeds.

This World Wide network is incorporated into virtually every aspect of modern life. Internet protocols are the standards that applications and devices follow for communication. Based on a set of rules, devices are enabled to communicate through a medium which can be any physical network that follows the set rules.   Internet protocols are built for many different purposes, and so can vary widely. Internet protocols using data have to travel through the internet\u2019s seven major layers to get to the set destination. The internet layers each get the data from the previous layer and add a header to the data so the data can be decoded, pass it to the next layer, and finally to the physical layer which follows its own set of rules depending on the medium involved. Examples of physical layers are phone landlines and cellular networks.   Early networks consisted of two types, circular and star networks. Circular networks are a series of references where the last object references the first, resulting in a closed loop.      Circular Network Topology\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0      Star Network Topology   Star networks consist of one central switch, hub or computer, which acts as a conduit to transmit messages. In a star topology every node (computer workstation or any other peripheral) is connected to central node called hub or switch. The switch is the server and the peripherals are the clients.   The World Wide Web is now much more complicated than these early network topologies. The web today is a series of networks interconnected to each other, and there is no single central device which has a top-to-bottom control over the other devices.      Internet Topology   Wireless Communications in Cities   Networks of wireless communication devices are quickly changing how modern cities work. Traffic engineering is one example of a discipline that is evolving in the era of wireless communication. Routers and cameras on traffic lights collect real-time data that can be used to determine the best strategies for controlling traffic flow, and alert emergency departments to traffic conditions.\u00a0\u00a0 dynamically process the flow of the traffic and improve the best strategies for controlling the traffic with the help of that data. And individuals can now get real-time traffic information on their wireless devices such as cellular phones.   In dense cities like New York City it is a challenge to get good wireless coverage for cellular devices. Tall buildings and high network traffic in these cities make it necessary for carrier companies to use large numbers of antennas. Tall buildings are physical obstacles that prevent radio waves from propagating. Each antenna can support a limited number of devices in its range, and in very crowded areas, dropped calls are common. When more antennas are used in a given area, the chance of interference of radio waves increases. Since each antenna is using its own channel and frequency, two frequencies in one location can cause bad coverage. Or, an area can simply lack coverage.   Procedure   Cell Antenna Activity   Students will address the problem of how to best position cell towers. Each antenna in a city has a sight of about 30 to 35 degrees. The most common method is to install antennas in a triangular shape on buildings. Of course, the size and orientation of buildings in a city are not always the same, and the geometrical way of installing antennas and the antenna type itself may change consequently.   Tell students they will be arranging cell antennas on a map. Their goal is to get the best coverage in their given situation. Discuss the ranges and frequency of each antenna, and the angle that each antenna can be focused to transmit. Discuss how the antennas signals might interfere with each other, which would disrupt the function of the network.   Students should work in groups to produce a map and arrange antennas on it to produce a functioning network with good coverage.   Northrop Grumman Cell Network Simulation Activity   Explain the following scenario to students:   To simulate a cellular network in the Smart City, students will use modulated infrared LEDs as antennas and infrared receivers to send and receive signals. Each antenna in an area has a unique frequency range which assigns a channel to the cell devices in its range once a connection is needed. Each IR LED will represent an antenna in the network. Antennas are connected to arduino modules that will generate a pre-specified code for the LED to send, noting that each antenna has a unique code. The code is sent by modulating the IR light, which means turning the LED on and off a specific number of times in each second, with equal amount of time for an on pulse length and an off pulse length.   Each building in the city will have three antennas connected to one arduino. All antennas on each building will send the same code. After putting together the circuits for the antennas, the students will determine a strategy for positioning the antennas. The antennas (IR LEDs) can be attached to side of the buildings and/or on top of the buildings.   Antennas high up on a building will be able to cover a wider range but are also more likely to generate noise signals as they get farther from the receiver modules. Antennas that are mounted closer to the ground and closer to the receivers will have a better reading but will have less coverage.   When planning a strategy for positioning the antennas, students should keep in mind that if antennas are placed too far apart, there will be uncovered spaces that might cause a \u201cdropped call\u201d for a user (receiver) due to being out of range of the antennas. If antennas are placed too close to one another, there will be an interference of the signals being sent by two antennas and there will be noise reading from the receiver module, or a bad signal.      Assembling the Antennas     Connect the 2N3904 transistor to the mini breadboard.   Connect a 1K resistor to pin three of the transistor and to another row.   Connect a 220 Ohm resistor on one side of the mini breadboard connecting the top and bottom parts of the board.   Insert an LED light with the positive pin connected to the 220 Ohm resistor.   Connect pin 2 of the transistor to the negative pin of the LED with a jumper wire.   Connect the second pin of the 220 Ohm resistor to the second pin of the 1K resistor with a jumper wire.   Connect three 100 Ohm resistors to the second pin of the 220 Ohm resistor and to three different rows.   Connect the three IR LED light positive pins to the three 100 Ohm resistors, and connect the negative pins to the pin three of the transistor.   Connect the 5v pin of the arduino to the 1K resistor. Connect the Gnd pin to pin 1 of the transistor. Connect pin 2 of the transistor to PWM pin 3 of the arduino.       Receiver module:     Connect a visible LED light to a 220 Ohm resistor on a mini breadboard.   Connect the IR receiver (phototransistor) to 470K resistor using male to female jumper wires.   Connect the positive pin of the IR receiver to pin 11 of the arduino.   Connect the negative pins of the LED and IR receiver to the Gnd pin of the arduino.   Connect the Vcc pin (5v) of the arduino to the resistors.         After programming the arduinos connected to the antennas with different codes using the IRsend arduino code example, the antennas can either be powered by cables connected to the computer or by 9 volt batteries (preferred).   Connecting the receiver to the computer and programming it with the related arduino code, the IR receiver (phototransistor) can be held close to the antennas to receive the transmitted values. These values can be read from the arduino serial monitor. If the shown values are not the values transmitted by the antennas (manually preset for each antenna) it is considered noise. This can be due to overlapping of the ranges of two antennas, or a bad range (issues with distance). If nothing is outputted from the serial monitor, the antenna is out of range.   Investigating Questions     Where in your model city were you most likely to get a bad signal or no coverage? Is that the same as in a real city?   What are some important uses of cellular networks in cities?   What would you want the cellular network in your smart city to be able to do?

Kedem  Jinyang Li  Dennis E. Shasha  Lakshminarayanan Subramanian  Michael Walfish    Systems and networking research explores how to structure the basic software running on individual computers and how to coordinate between different computers. Significant challenges include how to support increasing numbers of processors in modern computer systems, leverage the many embedded and mobile computing devices, and build services that scale to a global audience.    Robert Grimm is interested in the interaction of programming languages and systems. The focus of his research is on exploring how to leverage programming language technologies for making operating and distributed systems easier to build, extend, and administer. Current efforts include Na Kika, a platform for securely extending web applications and scaling them to a global audience through edge-side hosting, and xtc, a toolkit for making programming languages and their compilers easily extensible. He is using the xtc toolkit to realize the Jeannie language, which combines all of Java and all of C into a new language that eliminates verbose boiler-plate code, enables static error detection across the language boundary, and simplifies dynamic resource management.    Zvi Kedem has conducted research in computational complexity (algebraic complexity, VLSI complexity); computer graphics (surface reconstruction, BSP tree algorithm); database, knowledge-based systems, and data mining (concurrency control, relational discrete event systems, pincer-search algorithm); parallel and distributed systems (parallel algorithms, compilation for special-purpose parallel machines, reliable parallel computations on LANs and the WWW). His research focus is algorithmic techniques for designing computer-based systems.    Jinyang Li 's research interests are in distributed systems and computer networks, and information retrieval systems. Large-scale distributed systems increasingly rely on grassroot deployments, as demonstrated by the popular peer-to-peer file sharing applications and community wireless mesh networks. It is difficult to ensure robustness and security in such distributed systems since the hundreds of nodes comprising these systems are typically unreliable, selfish and potentially malicious. One of the goals of Jinyang's research is to design and build reliable and secure peer-to-peer systems and wireless networks.    Dennis Shasha 's research interests are focused on three areas: algorithmic and visualization support for computational biology, time series analysis, and tree and graph pattern matching. In computational biology, Dennis Shasha works on tools and algorithms for plant genomics and proteomics research. Time series analysis is needed in many areas ranging from physics to finance to music. Dennis Shasha and collaborators are working on efficient algorithms for performing online windowed correlation analysis on very large time series datasets (thousands or even millions of numbers). Graph pattern matching problems also arise in many areas from XML querying to chemistry; Denis Shasha's group developed a number of algorithms and software tools for various graph matching problems. Dennis Shasha also works on several themes in databases: privacy-protection (when the server cannot be trusted as in out-sourcing cases), database tuning, and testing.    Lakshminarayanan Subramanian 's research interests span the areas of networking, distributed systems, security and technologies for developing countries. He is exploring a range of topics including routing protocol design, security issues in routing protocols, quality of service, congestion control, overlay networks and wireless networks. His current focus is on practical security problems in network protocols and distributed systems (enterprise security and byzantine fault tolerant systems) and systems/networking challenges in developing country settings (issues of low cost connectivity solutions for rural villages and how to make distributed systems operate in environments with intermittent power). He is one of the designers of WiLDNet, a lo-cost network deployed in parts of the world from Ghana to Philippines.    Michael Walfish 's research interests are in systems, security, and networking. He has worked on untrusted computation, untrusted storage, failure detection in distributed systems, naming, network architecture, verifiable auctions, and denial-of-service defense.
