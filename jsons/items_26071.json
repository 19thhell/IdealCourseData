The CORE is comprised of four areas of the liberal arts:       Expository Writing    Foreign Language    Foundations of Contemporary Culture    Foundations of Scientific Inquiry       Descriptions of these areas and courses which fulfill the requirements are listed below. Some of these requirements can also be fulfilled through Advanced Placement test scores.    Expository Writing    Media, Culture, and Communication students must complete two courses in expository writing and pass the Writing Proficiency Examination.    Freshmen students who complete EXPOS-UA 0001, Writing the Essay, with a grade of \"C\" or better are certified as proficient, and are not required to sit for the exam. In addition, students must enroll in and successfully complete ACE-UE 0110, The Advanced College Essay: Education and the Professions.

Transfer students entering the Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development must pass the Proficiency Examination administered by the Expository Writing Program. This exam determines whether additional coursework in Expository Writing will be required for proficiency certification and is given during orientation. Transfer students who pass the examination and transfer in two courses in writing composition or the equivalent will not be required to complete additional course work in expository writing.    If the students pass and transfer in only one course, they will be required to complete EXPOS-UA 0001, Writing the Essay. The course, Writing the Essay, is significantly different from most writing courses students have taken at two and four year colleges and provides the foundation for writing in the university.    If the students fail and have received transfer credit for either one or two courses in expository writing or the equivalent, they will be required to complete at least one expository writing course, EXPOS-UA 0013 (Writing Tutorial), or EXPOS-UA 0004 (International Writing Workshop 1) as determined by the Expository Writing Program.    Placement may vary depending on the writing issues present in the examination. Students who achieve a letter grade of \"C\" or above in Writing Tutorial are certified as proficient.

International Students completing EXPOS-UA 0004/0009 (International Writing Workshop 1/International Writing Workshop 2) will take the proficiency examination at the end of their writing-course sequence. If the students fail, they will be required to complete one expository writing course, EXPOS-UA 0013, Writing Tutorial.    Foreign Languages    Media, Culture, and Communication students must complete two semesters of foreign language. MCC students are not exempt from the foreign language requirement but may satisfy it through AP test scores .    Students who will register for any language with which they have prior experience (studied in high school, college or study abroad programs or who are bilingual or multilingual) are required to take a placement examination to determine which level is appropriate.

The CORE is comprised of four areas of the liberal arts:       Expository Writing    Foreign Language    Foundations of Contemporary Culture    Foundations of Scientific Inquiry       Descriptions of these areas and courses which fulfill the requirements are listed below. Some of these requirements can also be fulfilled through Advanced Placement test scores.    Expository Writing    Media, Culture, and Communication students must complete two courses in expository writing and pass the Writing Proficiency Examination.    Freshmen students who complete EXPOS-UA 0001, Writing the Essay, with a grade of \"C\" or better are certified as proficient, and are not required to sit for the exam. In addition, students must enroll in and successfully complete ACE-UE 0110, The Advanced College Essay: Education and the Professions.    Students enrolled in the Higher Education Opportunity Programs (HEOP) completing 0005 and 0006 (Prose Writing I and II) with grades of \"C\" or better are deemed proficient.    Transfer students entering the Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development must pass the Proficiency Examination administered by the Expository Writing Program. This exam determines whether additional coursework in Expository Writing will be required for proficiency certification and is given during orientation. Transfer students who pass the examination and transfer in two courses in writing composition or the equivalent will not be required to complete additional course work in expository writing.    If the students pass and transfer in only one course, they will be required to complete EXPOS-UA 0001, Writing the Essay. The course, Writing the Essay, is significantly different from most writing courses students have taken at two and four year colleges and provides the foundation for writing in the university.    If the students fail and have received transfer credit for either one or two courses in expository writing or the equivalent, they will be required to complete at least one expository writing course, EXPOS-UA 0013 (Writing Tutorial), or EXPOS-UA 0004 (International Writing Workshop 1) as determined by the Expository Writing Program.    Placement may vary depending on the writing issues present in the examination. Students who achieve a letter grade of \"C\" or above in Writing Tutorial are certified as proficient. Students who do not achieve a \"C\" or above must take the Proficiency Exam.    International Students completing EXPOS-UA 0004/0009 (International Writing Workshop 1/International Writing Workshop 2) will take the proficiency examination at the end of their writing-course sequence. If the students fail, they will be required to complete one expository writing course, EXPOS-UA 0013, Writing Tutorial.    Foreign Languages    Media, Culture, and Communication students must complete two semesters of foreign language. MCC students are not exempt from the foreign language requirement but may satisfy it through AP test scores .    Students who will register for any language with which they have prior experience (studied in high school, college or study abroad programs or who are bilingual or multilingual) are required to take a placement examination to determine which level is appropriate.    Placement exams are offered during the first week of classes as well as once a month throughout the semester. The placement test schedule is available at nyu.edu/cas/placementexams .    Foundations of Contemporary Culture    The Foundations of Contemporary Culture (FCC) sequence of the College Core Curriculum is a series of four coordinated courses in the humanities and social sciences. Within each of the four offerings, students are free to pursue their particular interests through their choice of individual classes offered through the CORE plan in the College of Arts and Science or options in Steinhardt's Liberal Arts Core (see course listings below). The four course headings are: Texts and Ideas, Cultures and Contexts, Societies and the Social Sciences, and Expressive Cultures.    Texts and Ideas This requirement can be satisfied through the following courses or AP test scores:       AP American History, European History or World History with a score of 4 or 5       NYUSteinhardt courses that will satisfy the Texts and Ideas requirement:       PHED-UE 10 / LIBAR-UE 501 Learning and the Meaning of Life       All other options for these courses are offered through CAS's College Core Curriculum .    Cultures and Contexts There are NO Advanced Placement test scores that satisfy this requirement. All other options for these courses are offered through CAS's College Core Curriculum .    Societies and the Social Sciences This requirement can be satisfied through the following courses or AP test scores:       AP Macroeconomics, Microeconomics, Politics, or Psychology with a score of 4 or 5       NYU Steinhardt courses that will satisfy the Societies and the Social Sciences requirement:       SOED-UE 0020 / LIBAR-UE 0202 Power, Resistance, Identity: American Social Movements    SOED-UE 1030 / LIBAR-UE 0201 Art and the City: A Sociological Perspective    INTE-UE 1545 / LIBAR-UE 0531 Interdisciplinary Perspectives on the New Immigration    HSED-UE 1033 / LIBAR-UE 0551 Culture Wars in America    HSED-UE 0610 / LIBAR-UE 0552 Education and the American Dreams: Historical Perspectives    HSED-UE 1010 / LIBAR-UE 0553 History of Professions in the United States    HSED-UE 1005 / LIBAR-UE 0554 Introduction to Education: Historical and Contemporary Perspectives    APSY-UE 0010 / LIBAR-UE 0631 Survey of Developmental Psychology    APSY-UE 0019 / LIBAR-UE 0632 Introduction to Personality Theories    APSY-UE 1271 / APSY-UE 1271 Developmental Psychology Across the Lifespan       College of Arts &amp; Sciences Departmental courses that will satisfy the Societies and the Social Sciences requirement:       ANTH-UA 0001 Human Society and Culture (Anthropology)    ANTH-UA 0003 Archaeology: Early Societies and Cultures (Anthropology)    SCA-UA 0001 Concepts in Social and Cultural Analysis (Social and Cultural Analysis)    SCA-UA 0401 Approaches to Gender and Sexuality Studies (Social and Cultural Analysis)    SCA-UA 0601 Introduction to Metropolitan Studies (Social and Cultural Analysis)    ECON-UA 9001 Economic Principles I (P) (Economics)    ECON-UA 9002 Economic Principles II (P) (Economics)    POLSC-AD 0156 Power and Politics in America (Politics)    POLSC-AD 0150 Comparative Politics (Politics)    HIST-UA 0009 U.S. History to 1865 (History)    HIST-UA 0010 Modern America (History)    LING-UA 0001 Language (Linguistics)    LING-UA 0015 Language and Society (Linguistics)    LING-UA 0047 The Language of America's Ethnic Minorities (Linguistics)    LING-UA 0030 Language in Latin America (Linguistics)    LING-UA 0058 Introduction to African Languages (Linguistics)    LING-UA 9058 Introduction to African Languages (Linguistics)    PSYCH-UA 0001 Introduction to Psychology (Psychology)    RELST-UA 0001 Theories and Methods in the Study of Religion (Religious Studies)    SOC-UA 0001 Introduction to Sociology (Sociology)    SOC-UA 0002 Introduction to Sociology (Honors) (Sociology)    SOC-UA 0135 Race and Ethnicity (Sociology)    SOC-UA 0205 Social Movements, Protest and Conflict (Sociology)    SOC-UA 0386 Ideas and Institutions in American Society (Sociology)    SOC-UA 0417 Sociology of Law (Sociology)       Expressive Culture This requirement can be satisfied through the following courses or AP test scores:       AP English Literature with a score of 4 or 5       NYUSteinhardt departmental courses that will satisfy the Expressive Cultures requirement:       ARTCR-UE 0010 / LIBAR-UE 0941 Art: Practice and Ideas    ARTCR-UE 0055 / LIBAR-UE 0942 Art of Now    ARTCR-UE 0152 / LIBAR-UE 0943 Internet and Contemporary Art    MPAET-UE 0060 / LIBAR-UE 0171 Introduction to Theatre as Art Form for Non-Majors       CAS departmental courses that will satisfy the Expressive Culture requirement:       COLIT-UA 0110 Tragedy    COLIT-UA 0111 Comedy    ARTH-UA 0001 History of Western Art I    ARTH-UA 0002 History of Western Art II    FREN-UA 0166/0866 La Belle &Eacute;poque    GERM-UA 0152 Introduction to German Literature       All other options for these courses are offered through CAS's College Core Curriculum .    Foundations of Scientific Inquiry    The Foundations of Scientific Inquiry (FSI) is a series of three coordinated courses in quantitative reasoning and the natural sciences. The three areas are Quantitative Reasoning, Natural Sciences I, and Natural Sciences II. Together, these courses ensure that every student gains a fundamental understanding of how mathematics and laboratory experimentation advance scientific investigation. While some students acquire this background through other coursework, FSI courses are especially designed to meet the need of non-science students. Within each of the three offerings, students are free to pursue their particular interests through their choice of individual classes.
