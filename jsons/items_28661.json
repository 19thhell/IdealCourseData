Often with partnerships arranged through the Office of Civic Engagement , schools throughout the university offer service learning courses (sometimes called community-based learning courses or public service courses), helping students apply their academic experiences to support and enhance the work of neighborhood nonprofit organizations and the populations they serve.   Defining Service Learning   NYU defines service learning courses in accordance with the Community Service Act of 1990 , which established the Corporation for National and Community Service as a federal agency and renewed the nation's focus on volunteerism.   At NYU, service learning can be understood as:     thoughtfully organized service projects integrated with curricula and designed to meet the needs of a community while actively involving students/participants as a method of helping them learn and develop     courses which are coordinated with an elementary school, secondary school, institution of higher education, or community service program, and with the community   courses which help foster civic responsibility   courses which are integrated into and enhance the student academic curriculum   a course that provides structured time for students/participants to reflect on their service experience     Finding Service Learning Courses   For an up-to-date listing of service learning courses or for more information about particular courses, we encourage students to contact their individual schools or reach out to the school that is coordinating a particular course. Students may also reach out to the Office of Civic Engagement .                                              Service Learning Course Development Grants     Funding opportunities may be available to support the development or enhancement courses that include a practicum of volunteer experience either organized by the instructor or developed by students as an integral part of the course.

Often with partnerships arranged through the Office of Civic Engagement , schools throughout the university offer service learning courses (sometimes called community-based learning courses or public service courses), helping students apply their academic experiences to support and enhance the work of neighborhood nonprofit organizations and the populations they serve.   Defining Service Learning   NYU defines service learning courses in accordance with the Community Service Act of 1990 , which established the Corporation for National and Community Service as a federal agency and renewed the nation's focus on volunteerism.   At NYU, service learning can be understood as:     thoughtfully organized service projects integrated with curricula and designed to meet the needs of a community while actively involving students/participants as a method of helping them learn and develop     courses which are coordinated with an elementary school, secondary school, institution of higher education, or community service program, and with the community   courses which help foster civic responsibility   courses which are integrated into and enhance the student academic curriculum   a course that provides structured time for students/participants to reflect on their service experience     Finding Service Learning Courses   For an up-to-date listing of service learning courses or for more information about particular courses, we encourage students to contact their individual schools or reach out to the school that is coordinating a particular course. Students may also reach out to the Office of Civic Engagement .                                              Service Learning Course Development Grants     Funding opportunities may be available to support the development or enhancement courses that include a practicum of volunteer experience either organized by the instructor or developed by students as an integral part of the course.
