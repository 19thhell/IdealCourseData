  Journalism is not just about reporting on individual \"news events.\" More and more, it's about getting a handle on the complicated reality that frames those events - the ever-shifting patterns of culture that determine how we live and what we make of our lives. As the mainstream media expand their cultural coverage and alternative publications and websites proliferate, there has never been more need for engaging, knowledgeable cultural reporting and analysis.   In 1995, cultural critic and longtime\u00a0 Village Voice \u00a0writer Ellen Willis responded to the rapid growth of this field by launching a concentration in Cultural Reporting and Criticism within the Institute's M.A. program. CRC is unique: the only graduate journalism program in the country specifically designed to prepare the next generation of cultural reporters and critics.   The program is dedicated to original, creative, cultural writing; The arts and books and popular culture; the immense variety of social groups, from gay families to Pakistani cabdrivers to obsessive gamers; the explosion of social controversies; the rise of religious fundamentalism, at home and abroad; the changing nature of war; the writer's own experience: all this is fodder for the cultural journalist. Cultural journalism is for writers with an itch to understand connections\u2014between news event and context, present and past, art and society, public and private. Over the last tumultuous decade, the need for such explorations has only intensified.   The CRC concentration is unique, too, in its emphasis on criticism. We are inspired not by the turgid academic criticism that is taught at some universities, but by the\u00a0 Partisan Review/New Yorker \u00a0tradition: that is, well-informed, thought-provoking, inventive criticism that addresses a wide, non-specialized audience and that can intervene in a broader cultural conversation. The critics and writers we study (pictured to the right) include Virginia Woolf, Hannah Arendt, Martha Gellhorn, George Orwell, James Baldwin, Susan Sontag, Joan Didion, V.S Naipaul, Philip Gourevitch, Christopher Hitchens, Janet Malcolm, David Foster Wallace and Pauline Kael.   CRC students are trained to write in a variety of formats, including the cultural essay, the personal essay, the profile, the review, the long-form narrative, the sharp, stylish opinion piece, and the blog post. Graduates have gone on to work as writers, critics, or editors for a bevy of publications , including, currently, the New York Times , the\u00a0 New Yorker , the\u00a0 New Republic, \u00a0 ArtForum, the \u00a0New York Review of Books,The Paris Review, \u00a0 the\u00a0 Los Angeles Times , the \u00a0Daily News, \u00a0 Slate, Fader, Entertainment Weekly, Spin ,\u00a0and the\u00a0 Wall Street Journal,\u00a0 among other places. Several former students have published books: Lauren Sandler, Righteous: Dispatches from the Evangelical Youth Movement , and One and Only: The Freedom of Having an Only Child, and the Joy of Being One ; Katheryn Joyce, The Child Catchers: Rescue, Trafficking, and the New Gospel of Adoption , and Quiverfull; James Westcott, When Marina Abramovic Dies: A Biography ; Thomas Chatterton Williams, Losing My Cool: How a Father's Love and 15,000 Books Beat Hip-Hop Culture ; Juana Libedinsky, English Breakfast ; Ray Huling, Harvesting the Bay: Fathers, Sons, and the Last of the Wild Shellfishermen ; and Jason Bailey, Pulp Fiction: The Complete Story of Quentin Tarantino's Masterpiece .   If you are drawn to the big picture\u2014if you suspect that neither conventional journalism training nor academic specialization is right for you\u2014CRC may be what you're looking for. Our curriculum emphasizes the integration of journalistic skills with the development of each individual writer's distinctive voice. The CRC program is deeply collaborative, and stresses close working relationships between professors and students and the creation of a supportive intellectual community.

  Journalism is not just about reporting on individual \"news events.\" More and more, it's about getting a handle on the complicated reality that frames those events - the ever-shifting patterns of culture that determine how we live and what we make of our lives. As the mainstream media expand their cultural coverage and alternative publications and websites proliferate, there has never been more need for engaging, knowledgeable cultural reporting and analysis.   In 1995, cultural critic and longtime\u00a0 Village Voice \u00a0writer Ellen Willis responded to the rapid growth of this field by launching a concentration in Cultural Reporting and Criticism within the Institute's M.A. program. CRC is unique: the only graduate journalism program in the country specifically designed to prepare the next generation of cultural reporters and critics.   The program is dedicated to original, creative, cultural writing; The arts and books and popular culture; the immense variety of social groups, from gay families to Pakistani cabdrivers to obsessive gamers; the explosion of social controversies; the rise of religious fundamentalism, at home and abroad; the changing nature of war; the writer's own experience: all this is fodder for the cultural journalist. Cultural journalism is for writers with an itch to understand connections\u2014between news event and context, present and past, art and society, public and private. Over the last tumultuous decade, the need for such explorations has only intensified.   The CRC concentration is unique, too, in its emphasis on criticism. We are inspired not by the turgid academic criticism that is taught at some universities, but by the\u00a0 Partisan Review/New Yorker \u00a0tradition: that is, well-informed, thought-provoking, inventive criticism that addresses a wide, non-specialized audience and that can intervene in a broader cultural conversation. The critics and writers we study (pictured to the right) include Virginia Woolf, Hannah Arendt, Martha Gellhorn, George Orwell, James Baldwin, Susan Sontag, Joan Didion, V.S Naipaul, Philip Gourevitch, Christopher Hitchens, Janet Malcolm, David Foster Wallace and Pauline Kael.   CRC students are trained to write in a variety of formats, including the cultural essay, the personal essay, the profile, the review, the long-form narrative, the sharp, stylish opinion piece, and the blog post. Graduates have gone on to work as writers, critics, or editors for a bevy of publications , including, currently, the New York Times , the\u00a0 New Yorker , the\u00a0 New Republic, \u00a0 ArtForum, the \u00a0New York Review of Books,The Paris Review, \u00a0 the\u00a0 Los Angeles Times , the \u00a0Daily News, \u00a0 Slate, Fader, Entertainment Weekly, Spin ,\u00a0and the\u00a0 Wall Street Journal,\u00a0 among other places. Several former students have published books: Lauren Sandler, Righteous: Dispatches from the Evangelical Youth Movement , and One and Only: The Freedom of Having an Only Child, and the Joy of Being One ; Katheryn Joyce, The Child Catchers: Rescue, Trafficking, and the New Gospel of Adoption , and Quiverfull; James Westcott, When Marina Abramovic Dies: A Biography ; Thomas Chatterton Williams, Losing My Cool: How a Father's Love and 15,000 Books Beat Hip-Hop Culture ; Juana Libedinsky, English Breakfast ; Ray Huling, Harvesting the Bay: Fathers, Sons, and the Last of the Wild Shellfishermen ; and Jason Bailey, Pulp Fiction: The Complete Story of Quentin Tarantino's Masterpiece .

  Journalism is not just about reporting on individual \"news events.\" More and more, it's about getting a handle on the complicated reality that frames those events - the ever-shifting patterns of culture that determine how we live and what we make of our lives. As the mainstream media expand their cultural coverage and alternative publications and websites proliferate, there has never been more need for engaging, knowledgeable cultural reporting and analysis.   In 1995, cultural critic and longtime\u00a0 Village Voice \u00a0writer Ellen Willis responded to the rapid growth of this field by launching a concentration in Cultural Reporting and Criticism within the Institute's M.A. program. CRC is unique: the only graduate journalism program in the country specifically designed to prepare the next generation of cultural reporters and critics.   The program is dedicated to original, creative, cultural writing; The arts and books and popular culture; the immense variety of social groups, from gay families to Pakistani cabdrivers to obsessive gamers; the explosion of social controversies; the rise of religious fundamentalism, at home and abroad; the changing nature of war; the writer's own experience: all this is fodder for the cultural journalist. Cultural journalism is for writers with an itch to understand connections\u2014between news event and context, present and past, art and society, public and private. Over the last tumultuous decade, the need for such explorations has only intensified.   The CRC concentration is unique, too, in its emphasis on criticism. We are inspired not by the turgid academic criticism that is taught at some universities, but by the\u00a0 Partisan Review/New Yorker \u00a0tradition: that is, well-informed, thought-provoking, inventive criticism that addresses a wide, non-specialized audience and that can intervene in a broader cultural conversation. The critics and writers we study (pictured to the right) include Virginia Woolf, Hannah Arendt, Martha Gellhorn, George Orwell, James Baldwin, Susan Sontag, Joan Didion, V.S Naipaul, Philip Gourevitch, Christopher Hitchens, Janet Malcolm, David Foster Wallace and Pauline Kael.   CRC students are trained to write in a variety of formats, including the cultural essay, the personal essay, the profile, the review, the long-form narrative, the sharp, stylish opinion piece, and the blog post. Graduates have gone on to work as writers, critics, or editors for a bevy of publications , including, currently, the New York Times , the\u00a0 New Yorker , the\u00a0 New Republic, \u00a0 ArtForum, the \u00a0New York Review of Books,The Paris Review, \u00a0 the\u00a0 Los Angeles Times , the \u00a0Daily News, \u00a0 Slate, Fader, Entertainment Weekly, Spin ,\u00a0and the\u00a0 Wall Street Journal,\u00a0 among other places. Several former students have published books: Lauren Sandler, Righteous: Dispatches from the Evangelical Youth Movement , and One and Only: The Freedom of Having an Only Child, and the Joy of Being One ; Katheryn Joyce, The Child Catchers: Rescue, Trafficking, and the New Gospel of Adoption , and Quiverfull; James Westcott, When Marina Abramovic Dies: A Biography ; Thomas Chatterton Williams, Losing My Cool: How a Father's Love and 15,000 Books Beat Hip-Hop Culture ; Juana Libedinsky, English Breakfast ; Ray Huling, Harvesting the Bay: Fathers, Sons, and the Last of the Wild Shellfishermen ; and Jason Bailey, Pulp Fiction: The Complete Story of Quentin Tarantino's Masterpiece .   If you are drawn to the big picture\u2014if you suspect that neither conventional journalism training nor academic specialization is right for you\u2014CRC may be what you're looking for. Our curriculum emphasizes the integration of journalistic skills with the development of each individual writer's distinctive voice. The CRC program is deeply collaborative, and stresses close working relationships between professors and students and the creation of a supportive intellectual community.

Julie Livingston Visiting Professor of Social &amp; Cultural Analysis and History I am interested in care as a social practice and the human body as a moral condition and mode of experience. Much of my research has focused on the ethical entanglements engendered by bodily vulnerability. I am also a committed ethnographer. My work moves across and often combines the disciplines of history, public health, and anthropology. For the past two decades I have worked mainly in Botswana, in southern Africa. My first book, Debility and the Moral Imagination in Botswana employed historical and anthropological methods to explore the rise in three domains of debility in Botswana over the past century: disability, chronic illness, and senescence. The book pursued pragmatic concerns that arise in the face of debility in a migrant labor regime, and also related epistemological and moral questions that emerge amid profound disruptions of bodily norms. My second book, Improvising Medicine is an ethnography of Botswana\u2019s lone cancer ward. The book narrates the story of this place as a microcosm of global health and the cancer epidemic rapidly emerging in the global south, while also using this setting to query the movement of carcinogenic capitalism, and the master-narratives of cancer in the U.S (and the global north more broadly). I am now beginning research here in New York City on the aftermaths of suicide. Ann Pellegrini Professor of Social &amp; Cultural Analysis and Performance Studies The risk and anxiety of difference have preoccupied my research and writing from my first book Performance Anxieties: Staging Psychoanalysis, Staging Race (1997) to the solo book I am currently completing Excess &amp; Enchantment: Queer Performance Between the Religious and the Secular (which will be published in the Sexual Cultures series at NYU Press). My book projects and articles traverse several disciplines and interdisciplines, but one through-line is an abiding interest in exploring how feelings are lived, experienced, and communicated between and across bodies\u2014and with what risks and possibilities for self and others. Another is the value of the aesthetic for repairing democratic social life. These two lines of interest converge insofar as I am keenly interested in the kinds of practices that make and un-make worlds. In all my work, I proceed with feminist and queer angles of vision as a way to put pressure on normative schemas of embodiment and subjectivity and to illuminate the cross-currents of gender, race, sexuality, and religion as they shape and impress the embodied life of feeling. These crossing or contact points do not always feel good. Far from it. They can even be points of democratic\u2014and psychic\u2014conflict. Social conflicts over difference are a key concern in my co-authored book with Janet R. Jakobsen, Love the Sin: Sexual Regulation and the Limits of Religious Tolerance (2004). Love the Sin analyzes debates over religion and sexuality in the United States. We are particularly interested in how \u201creligion\u201d is invoked\u2014even by the secular U.S. state\u2014to manage and contain supposedly \u201cthreatening\u201d social differences. Another joint project with Jakobsen, the edited volume Secularisms (2008), works explicitly to de-center U.S. conceptions of secularism. Both Love the Sin and Secularisms share a desire to disrupt the Enlightenment narrative that equates secularism with modernity, reason, freedom, peace, and progress. This narrative too often produces a forced choice between \u201cconservative\u201d religion and \u201cprogressive\u201d secularism, a choice not unlike the one often forwarded by secular gender and sexuality studies: to wit, between \u201cbad\u201d religion and the \u201cgoods\u201d of sexual liberation. In our work together, Jakobsen and I have consistently argued against such false choices, moving instead to consider how practices of sexual and religious freedom can be theorized in tandem with, rather than in constant opposition to, one another. My new solo book, Excess &amp; Enchantment , examines how public performances of sexuality and religion converge across a diverse archive of visual and performance art, musical theatre, religious protest, and public displays of mourning. Throughout, I draw on the interdisciplinary methods and questions of gender and sexuality studies, performance studies, affect studies, and psychoanalysis. I have a long-standing interest in psychoanalysis as a critical method for understanding interactions between individuals and their social contexts, self and other, and the inner and outer lives of feeling. But psychoanalysis is not just a diverse body of theory irreducible to the proper name Freud; it is also a critical and creative practice in its own right. In fall 2014, I begin the Respecialization Program at the Institute for Psychoanalytic Training and Research in New York City.  Arely Zimmerman  Assistant Professor/Faculty Fellow of Latino Studies in the Department of Social and Cultural Analysis I hold a Ph.D. from UCLA in political science, with emphasis in political theory and race, ethnicity, and gender. My work is situated at the intersection of contemporary political theory, transnational studies, social movements and Latino/a and Latin American studies. My research agenda revolves around the notion of unauthorized citizenship and the political becoming of undocumented migrants. These interests have emphasized the experiences of US Central American migrant communities as well as undocumented youth. I am currently working on a monograph, Revolutionary Refugees: Central Americans' Fight for Citizenship across Borders . Additional works include, \"Contesting Citizenship from Below: Central Americans and the struggle for Inclusion\" (forthcoming in Latino Studies ) and \"Transmedia Testimonio: Undocumented Youth and Coming Out in the Digital Age\" (forthcoming in International Journal of Communications . Additionally, I am working on a book-length manuscript along with Henry Jenkins and a team of USC researchers that compares several cases of youth's political and digital participation. Prior to coming to NYU, I held appointments in as Chancellor's postdoctoral fellow in the Dept. of Latino/a Studies at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, as well as Mellon postdoctoral fellow in Social Movements at the University of Southern California.
