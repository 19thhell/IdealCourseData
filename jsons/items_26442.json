Part I, the Orientation and Field Instruction Plan, should be completed within the first two weeks of placement. Part II provides a baseline assessment of the student\u2019s skill level, establishes the learning plan for the remainder of the semester, and provides an initial indication of the grade level of the student\u2019s performance in the early stages of placement. Part II should be completed in the 7th week of field placement.

The field instructor, in collaboration with the student, works to evaluate the student\u2019s progress over the course of the year.   Initial Educational Statement   The Initial Educational Statement should be completed by the field instructor and student collaboratively. Part I, the Orientation and Field Instruction Plan, should be completed within the first two weeks of placement. Part II provides a baseline assessment of the student\u2019s skill level, establishes the learning plan for the remainder of the semester, and provides an initial indication of the grade level of the student\u2019s performance in the early stages of placement. Part II should be completed in the 7th week of field placement.

Applicants            1. Apply On Time    Because additional mailing time and processing are required for international credentials, you should have all application materials in our office by the appropriate application deadline.    2. Transcripts and Degree Information    You must have the equivalent of a U.S. bachelor's degree to be considered for admission. Candidates holding an artist diploma may be considered for the music performance, music theory, or composition programs. For each post-secondary school attended, one (1) transcript in the original language and one (1) notarized English translation are required to be submitted with your application. In determining what items to submit, please understand that the Admissions Committee must be able to review four elements related to your prior studies: (1) the courses taken as part of your studies; (2) the grades received for those courses; (3) the actual degree/title conferred and (4) the date the degree was confered/awarded.    Due to accrediting and internship requirements, applicants to the M.S. in clinical nutrition (HOND) who have non-U.S. credentials must present a course-by-course evaluation of their international credentials along with their completed application. A number of agencies can provide this service.       Locate an independent foreign degree evaluation agency       3. Proficiency in English    The ability to communicate effectively in English is crucial to your success as an NYU Steinhardt student. Our goal is to ensure our international graduate candidates are successful in their academic program and in any fieldwork they must complete, therefore, all candidates are assessed using a two-stepped approach :    Step 1: The graduate application using TOEFL    The Test Of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) is mandatory for all applicants whose native language is NOT English and who did not receive the equivalent of a 4 year U.S. undergraduate education from an institution where English is the official language of instruction. Applicants holding or completing a graduate degree from an English speaking institution are still required to submit a TOEFL if their graduate education was LESS THAN four years in duration at an institution where English was the official language of instruction. The TOEFL cannot be waived.    Although we do not have a required TOEFL score, successful applicants score 100 or above on the Internet-based test or 600 or above on the paper-based test.    If you are required to submit a TOEFL score, you must submit your score in two formats :          An official TOEFL score report must be sent to NYU Steinhardt from ETS. NYU Steinhardt's ETS institution code is 2556 ; a departmental code is not required. Visit TOEFL&rsquo;s Website .    A copy of your TOEFL Score must be uploaded into the online application under the \"TOEFL Upload\" section. Since this is an unofficial report for informational purposes only, web printouts or screenshots are acceptable for the upload as long as we can read the scores and your name.          Note: NYU Steinhardt does not accept scores from other equivalent exams such as IELTS.    Step 2: Post-admission assessment using NYU ALI English Language Proficiency Exam    If you are offered admission to NYU Steinhardt you will be required to take the online English Proficiency Exam at NYU&rsquo;s American Language Institute (ALI) . A fee is charged on the day of the exam (phone number: 212-998-7040; ali.test-group@nyu.edu ).    You may be exempted from the exam if English is your first language or if you graduated from a college or university where English was the language of instruction. Having submitted the TOEFL score during the application process does not exempt you from the ALI English Proficiency Exam. Obtaining a specific score on the TOEFL also does not exempt you from taking the exam. Your academic department may require the exam regardless of your English proficiency.    Candidates who must take the ALI English Proficiency Exam will receive their results after they complete the two-part exam. Results of the exam are used as an additional tool to assess English language abilities beyond the TOEFL. In some programs, where English language skills are especially critical, students are expected to comply with ALI recommendations. In other programs where English language skills are less essential to beginning study, our faculty and advisors use the ALI recommendations to make individual determinations about the need for additional English language study in accordance with the demands and expectations of the program, student&rsquo;s career goals, and fieldwork and clinical settings.    Based on your level of achievement on the TOEFL and the ALI English Proficiency Exam, the rigors of your program you may be required to take additional English coursework at NYU ALI during your first semester. Please note that English-language study may increase the overall cost and time to completion of your degree program.    4. Financial Aid    NYU Steinhardt encourages international applicants to investigate scholarship support offered by their home country to support their studies at NYU.    Master's and advanced certificate applicants who are not U.S. citizens or permanent residents are not eligible for federal financial aid and typically do not receive consideration for school-based financial aid.    Full-time doctoral applicants, regardless of country of citizenship, will receive consideration for scholarships, fellowships, and assistantships.    5. Visa Information    Once admitted international applicants will apply for an I-20 to receive an F1 student visa with their acceptance package. Financial documentation will be necessary when applying for a visa. Financial documents should NOT be submitted with the application for admission.    All international applicants wishing to obtain an F1 student visa will list \"New York University\" as the \"expected visa sponsor\" on the graduate admissions application. When completing your application, please be sure to use your full, legal name as it appears on your passport. The use of any other names, such as nicknames, will cause serious delays in applying for your U.S. visa. All international applicants must have an international address as their permanent address. The U.S. government mandates that you include a permanent, international address to receive your visa.    Please be prepared to pay additional fees for processing your I-20 from NYU and your student visa from the U.S. government. Heightened security measures may result in delays in processing your I-20 and your student visa requests. Please apply for these credentials as soon as possible, using overnight and express mail wherever possible.
