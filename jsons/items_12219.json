Sample Syllabus                                                                    Modern Movements in Italian Art, 1860-2012 - ARTH-UA 9850 - 4 points                               This course investigates the scope of Italian artistic ingenuity during the past century and a half and puts it in reference to contemporary art movements. Due to Italy\u2019s strong historical legacy, modern Italian artists and architects have gone through an intense struggle to break from academic models. Initially the new movements, such as Impressionism and Art Nouveau, arrived from outside sources, yet beginning with I Macchiaoli, followed by the Futurists, Neo\u2013 Rationalists, Arte Povera, and Transavanguardia, Italians were frequently originators of the discourses of new artistic movements. The tide of trends periodically seceded from traditions and then returned to them in critical ways, seen in the metaphysical paintings of Giorgio de Chirico or the wistful pavilions of Aldo Rossi. During the past decade Italy has produced several new institutions for contemporary art and architecture, including MART in Rovereto, the Museo del \u2018900 (Museum of the 20th century) in Milan, and MAXXI (Museum of the Arts of the 21st century), devoted specifically to both art and architecture, broadening the historical and critical perspective and providing a stimulus for the art of the future.

Although the Italian peninsula was home to some of the most important ancient civilizations, Italy\u2019s existence as a united country dates only from the nineteenth century, making it younger than the US as a modern nation state. Italy was first unified by the Romans, making Roman antiquity a point of reference throughout history as intellectuals and political leaders dreamed of a unified nation.

Although its size and extent are exceptional. the crisis has many features in common with similar financial-stress driven recession episodes in the past. However, this time there\u2019s something different, with the crisis being global akin to the events that triggered the Great Depression of the 1930s. This crisis spread quickly and rapidly moved from the US to European countries that show the weakest economic indicators (PIIGS: Portugal, Ireland and Italy, Greece and Spain). This course will focus on the long run causes, consequences and EU responses to the crisis, conditionally on the characteristics of the countries involved. We will focus on the long process of European Integration and discuss whether it may represent a possible solution to the recent crisis.

They struggle to direct public debate towards clearer visions of the day\u2019s challenges and to  keep our minds open to wider possibilities and different explanations. They excel at pointing out  the common fallacies of our age. Most often dissenters, in the minority in their own countries,  public intellectuals are deeply committed to independent thinking at (often) considerable  personal sacrifice. Simultaneously observers and participants, \u201cinsiders\u201d and \u201coutsiders\u201d,  consensus builders and social critics, thinkers and occasionally active politicians, these public  figures are central to modern democratic dialogue. Not surprisingly, considerable controversy  accompanies the appearance of (many) university-trained professionals in the public sphere, and  the discussions they initiate have been characterized quite often by bitter and personal attacks.   This course examines the work and contributions of several prominent intellectuals in crucial  periods of contemporary European history over the 20th and 21st centuries, and considers  their important roles in public debate, policy-making and the political process. Their writings  focus on the important issues of their time \u2013 war and peace, economic instability, dictatorship,  European integration, organized crime, the collapse of European communism and post-industrial  capitalism \u2013 concerns that are still very much of relevance and debate today. Finally, the course  also considers the \u201ctheory\u201d of public intellectuals by looking at the writings on their own place  in society and on the models of participation that others, like them, have offered in the past.   The class has a seminar format with discussion of the principal works of a number of public  intellectuals and their biographies framing the weekly sessions. We will also explore the  historical context of these works and consider, with the advantage of hindsight, the relative  accuracy of the positions assumed in the past \u2013 did they really come close to \u201ctelling the  truth\u201d as we understand it today? The reactions of the public, of political leaders, and of other  prominent individuals are also examined to better consider the impact of these intellectuals\u2019  contributions and to appreciate the measure of their commitment to freedom and open  discussion.

Italy is well-known for being a family centered society.  What are the causes and consequences of this phenomenon? Since the 1960s, the family has  undergone a series of changes, due to the women\u2019s movement, decrease of marriages, fall of  birthrate, etc. Is the family loosing its centrality in Italy? According to some scholars, the family  is still one of the few shared values in Italy. The course will investigate the social function of the  family in Italy, from the political unification of the country to the present. We will also analyze  ideas of femininity and masculinity conveyed by the media and their connections to the idea  of Italianness. The imagined Italian community was constructed on the site of the female body  which was meant to epitomize a series of values such as fertility, health, prosperity, purity,  tradition, etc. The course will also map the condition of women and LGBT people in Italy today.

This course closely examines the political, economic, and social situations in Italy during this period, emphasizing the special conditions that produced Renaissance art and literature. The relationship between culture, society, and politics is studied in the case of Florence, in which the hegemony of the Medici house and its patronage brought the city to cultural leadership in the Western world.

This course, where cities are considered to be sources of cultural invention, explores through literature, history, social science and student experience, the evolution of high and popular culture, both modernist and post-modern. Emphasis will be placed on how cultures create bonds between specific interest groups, and how culture becomes the arena for acting out or resolving group conflict. This course will focus on Italian cities, including Florence. Conducted in English.

The approach is multidisciplinary and aims at a comprehensive survey of the music theatre in the context of the Italian cultural heritage. Literary sources, musico-dramatic features, vocal styles are studied in connection with major works that best represent trends and genres in the Italian operatic tradition. Students are expected to master the distinctive characteristics of such genres as favola in musica, intermezzo, opera seria, opera buffa, grand opera, dramma lirico, and the basic elements of Italian versification. Students listen to and watch recorded operas and attend performances in Florence or other Italian cities.

NOTE: This course meets in the center of Florence. Students should allow for 30 minutes commute time between this class and their prior or subsequent class.   The course Photojournalism: Exploring Italian Society focuses on the contemporary life of Florence, a city best known as a UNESCO World Heritage site, but that is also a European city attempting to rise to the challenges that currently confront other urban environments throughout Europe and the world. The course draws its strengths from the unique resources of the program and the city of Florence. From Italian labor protests, to commemoration of historic events, to immigrant populations, mass transit and tourism, Florence has many compelling contemporary visual stories to tell. Students have the unique opportunity to capture these issues in images.   Sample Syllabus                                                                      Photography of Architecture, City and Territory - IPHTI-UT 1210 - 4 points                               City, territory and architecture have been, from the beginning of photography, privileged objects for its practice. Photography has become a tool to strengthen the understanding of architecture, to highlight aesthetic and design ideas and to critically interpret space. This class focuses on architectural photography and the photography of urban space, both in relation to their historical roots and contemporary practice, covering the theoretical connections between architecture and photography. Through course assignments students will learn to confront a variety of challenges presented by photographing different architectural styles. By the end of the course, each student will have produced a portfolio of architectural photography.   This is an intermediate photography course. Each student must have basic knowledge of digital photographic techniques and their own SLR digital camera with manually adjustable aperture and shutter speed, as well as a flash drive to backup your work. The course is a combination of lectures and labs for a total of six hours per week.     Sample Syllabus                                Politics                                                  Comparative Politics- POL-UA 9500- 4 points                               This course will introduce students to the study of comparative politics, which is defined as the study of domestic politics anywhere in the world. As a way of cutting into this vast topic, we specifically focus on the process of democratic transition by analyzing the democratic revolution that has swept the globe during the last thirty-five years. In turn we will explore the causes of democratization, threats to democratization, and factors that may aid in a successful consolidation of democracy. As part of this process, students will be exposed to a wide range of topics in comparative politics, including theories of democratic transitions, the politics of economic reform, voting, parties, and electoral systems, and theories of ethnic conflict.   Please note: this course fulfills the requirement for a \u201ccore\u201d course for Politics majors, the first time such a course has been offered at NYU-Florence, and is taught by Professor Tucker, who normally teaches the course in New York. As such, it is to date the only opportunity *anywhere* to take a politics core course in a small class format. As an introductory course, it is also perfectly appropriate for non-politics majors as well.     Sample Syllabus                                                                         Acton Seminar: Policies and Politics of the European Union - POL-UA 9595 - 4 points                               The European Union is a unique and strange entity. It has 27 states and 500 million people. Its GNP is more or less equal to that of the USA. Many of its members share a common currency and a common monetary policy. Yet it is a union without a state. The spectacular progress in the area of economic integration has not been matched by the creation of a common government and a common identity. The economic giant is still a political dwarf as it has been confirmed time and again whenever there is an international crisis,. Yet so far this strange entity has been working. Its achievements in the economic arena have been remarkable. The course will analyze in an interdisciplinary fashion the making of the Union, its institutions, its policies and its prospects in the very challenging environment of today. Probably more so than in any other period in its history the survival of the Union, as we have known it, will be tested by the impact of the most serious crisis of the post-war period. Particular attention will be given to the new economic governance established by the Union in responding to the problems posed by the poor economic and financial performance of some of its members, i.e. the PIGS (Portugal, Ireland, Greece, Spain).

We have all heard about demographic pressure, social policies, health care planning, inflation, market volatility: these are all concepts which rely heavily on statistical information. Changes have to be managed properly and in an informed way: scientific experiments be they on a medicine, on fertilizer or airbags must be planned as to ensure their validity. Total quality in production is a statistics-based philosophy of management, and if you like a commercial it is also because a statistician has provided information about consumer tastes and behaviour. In this course we will provide an introduction to the tools of statistics but most importantly we will try and understand the rationale behind statistics.

The topics covered in the first part will include the US vision of the new international order, the end of the old European balance of power, the Cold War and the division of Europe, the building of the Western alliance, the collapse of communism in Eastern Europe. The second part of the course will concentrate on contemporary issues ranging from the evolution of NATO to trade relations and the role of the dollar and the euro in the international monetary system.

Analysis of real-world data over the last decades, such as court proceedings and crime statistics, dismisses many of the accepted myths about Italian mafias. We will explore the organization of mafia groups, rules and codes, activities both in legitimate business and illegal markets, and their relationship to politics. This comparative approach will help students identify those factors facilitating the emergence, migration and persistence of organized crime across countries. The course will include a review of the legislative efforts and best-practices designed to prevent and control organized crime in Italy and in the United States.

We will introduce the travelogue Il Milione (The Travels of Marco Polo), discussing the figure of the famous merchant and traveler Polo. Moreover, analyzing the Decameron of Boccaccio, we will consider the role of merchants and travelers in some of his novelle. We will highlight metaphors of traveling in the tradition of amor cortese (courtly love), stressing some images in the poems of the Sicilian and Tuscan School and in the Stil Novo, reading as well from Dante's Rime and Petrarch's Canzoniere, and not forgetting the Women Poets, such as Gaspara Stampa. Finally, we will discuss fantastic journeying to the Moon and spatial movements in the chivalric epic of the Orlando Furioso by Ludovico Ariosto. Through these texts, and constant cross references to the contemporary Italian classics (Calvino and Eco among others), we will study the origins of Italian Literature.

Due to Italy\u2019s strong historical legacy, modern Italian artists and architects have gone through an intense struggle to break from academic models. Initially the new movements, such as Impressionism and Art Nouveau, arrived from outside sources, yet beginning with I Macchiaoli, followed by the Futurists, Neo\u2013 Rationalists, Arte Povera, and Transavanguardia, Italians were frequently originators of the discourses of new artistic movements. The tide of trends periodically seceded from traditions and then returned to them in critical ways, seen in the metaphysical paintings of Giorgio de Chirico or the wistful pavilions of Aldo Rossi. During the past decade Italy has produced several new institutions for contemporary art and architecture, including MART in Rovereto, the Museo del \u2018900 (Museum of the 20th century) in Milan, and MAXXI (Museum of the Arts of the 21st century), devoted specifically to both art and architecture, broadening the historical and critical perspective and providing a stimulus for the art of the future.

Although the Italian peninsula was home to some of the most important ancient civilizations, Italy\u2019s existence as a united country dates only from the nineteenth century, making it younger than the US as a modern nation state. Italy was first unified by the Romans, making Roman antiquity a point of reference throughout history as intellectuals and political leaders dreamed of a unified nation. We examine how Italian identity was formed throughout history, both by Italians and by foreign visitors to Italy, in response to the principal ancient cultures that thrived on the peninsula. The focus is on primary sources\u2014literary works, artifacts, art objects, works of architecture, opera and film\u2014taking advantage of the unique resources of Florence to explore these in their original contexts.

Although its size and extent are exceptional. the crisis has many features in common with similar financial-stress driven recession episodes in the past. However, this time there\u2019s something different, with the crisis being global akin to the events that triggered the Great Depression of the 1930s. This crisis spread quickly and rapidly moved from the US to European countries that show the weakest economic indicators (PIIGS: Portugal, Ireland and Italy, Greece and Spain). This course will focus on the long run causes, consequences and EU responses to the crisis, conditionally on the characteristics of the countries involved. We will focus on the long process of European Integration and discuss whether it may represent a possible solution to the recent crisis.

They struggle to direct public debate towards clearer visions of the day\u2019s challenges and to  keep our minds open to wider possibilities and different explanations. They excel at pointing out  the common fallacies of our age. Most often dissenters, in the minority in their own countries,  public intellectuals are deeply committed to independent thinking at (often) considerable  personal sacrifice. Simultaneously observers and participants, \u201cinsiders\u201d and \u201coutsiders\u201d,  consensus builders and social critics, thinkers and occasionally active politicians, these public  figures are central to modern democratic dialogue. Not surprisingly, considerable controversy  accompanies the appearance of (many) university-trained professionals in the public sphere, and  the discussions they initiate have been characterized quite often by bitter and personal attacks.   This course examines the work and contributions of several prominent intellectuals in crucial  periods of contemporary European history over the 20th and 21st centuries, and considers  their important roles in public debate, policy-making and the political process. Their writings  focus on the important issues of their time \u2013 war and peace, economic instability, dictatorship,  European integration, organized crime, the collapse of European communism and post-industrial  capitalism \u2013 concerns that are still very much of relevance and debate today. Finally, the course  also considers the \u201ctheory\u201d of public intellectuals by looking at the writings on their own place  in society and on the models of participation that others, like them, have offered in the past.   The class has a seminar format with discussion of the principal works of a number of public  intellectuals and their biographies framing the weekly sessions. We will also explore the  historical context of these works and consider, with the advantage of hindsight, the relative  accuracy of the positions assumed in the past \u2013 did they really come close to \u201ctelling the  truth\u201d as we understand it today? The reactions of the public, of political leaders, and of other  prominent individuals are also examined to better consider the impact of these intellectuals\u2019  contributions and to appreciate the measure of their commitment to freedom and open  discussion.

Italy is well-known for being a family centered society.  What are the causes and consequences of this phenomenon? Since the 1960s, the family has  undergone a series of changes, due to the women\u2019s movement, decrease of marriages, fall of  birthrate, etc. Is the family loosing its centrality in Italy? According to some scholars, the family  is still one of the few shared values in Italy. The course will investigate the social function of the  family in Italy, from the political unification of the country to the present. We will also analyze  ideas of femininity and masculinity conveyed by the media and their connections to the idea  of Italianness. The imagined Italian community was constructed on the site of the female body  which was meant to epitomize a series of values such as fertility, health, prosperity, purity,  tradition, etc. The course will also map the condition of women and LGBT people in Italy today.

This course closely examines the political, economic, and social situations in Italy during this period, emphasizing the special conditions that produced Renaissance art and literature. The relationship between culture, society, and politics is studied in the case of Florence, in which the hegemony of the Medici house and its patronage brought the city to cultural leadership in the Western world.

This course, where cities are considered to be sources of cultural invention, explores through literature, history, social science and student experience, the evolution of high and popular culture, both modernist and post-modern. Emphasis will be placed on how cultures create bonds between specific interest groups, and how culture becomes the arena for acting out or resolving group conflict. This course will focus on Italian cities, including Florence. Conducted in English.

The approach is multidisciplinary and aims at a comprehensive survey of the music theatre in the context of the Italian cultural heritage. Literary sources, musico-dramatic features, vocal styles are studied in connection with major works that best represent trends and genres in the Italian operatic tradition. Students are expected to master the distinctive characteristics of such genres as favola in musica, intermezzo, opera seria, opera buffa, grand opera, dramma lirico, and the basic elements of Italian versification. Students listen to and watch recorded operas and attend performances in Florence or other Italian cities.

NOTE: This course meets in the center of Florence. Students should allow for 30 minutes commute time between this class and their prior or subsequent class.   The course Photojournalism: Exploring Italian Society focuses on the contemporary life of Florence, a city best known as a UNESCO World Heritage site, but that is also a European city attempting to rise to the challenges that currently confront other urban environments throughout Europe and the world. The course draws its strengths from the unique resources of the program and the city of Florence. From Italian labor protests, to commemoration of historic events, to immigrant populations, mass transit and tourism, Florence has many compelling contemporary visual stories to tell. Students have the unique opportunity to capture these issues in images.   Sample Syllabus                                                                      Photography of Architecture, City and Territory - IPHTI-UT 1210 - 4 points                               City, territory and architecture have been, from the beginning of photography, privileged objects for its practice. Photography has become a tool to strengthen the understanding of architecture, to highlight aesthetic and design ideas and to critically interpret space. This class focuses on architectural photography and the photography of urban space, both in relation to their historical roots and contemporary practice, covering the theoretical connections between architecture and photography. Through course assignments students will learn to confront a variety of challenges presented by photographing different architectural styles. By the end of the course, each student will have produced a portfolio of architectural photography.   This is an intermediate photography course. Each student must have basic knowledge of digital photographic techniques and their own SLR digital camera with manually adjustable aperture and shutter speed, as well as a flash drive to backup your work. The course is a combination of lectures and labs for a total of six hours per week.     Sample Syllabus                                Politics                                                  Comparative Politics- POL-UA 9500- 4 points                               This course will introduce students to the study of comparative politics, which is defined as the study of domestic politics anywhere in the world. As a way of cutting into this vast topic, we specifically focus on the process of democratic transition by analyzing the democratic revolution that has swept the globe during the last thirty-five years. In turn we will explore the causes of democratization, threats to democratization, and factors that may aid in a successful consolidation of democracy. As part of this process, students will be exposed to a wide range of topics in comparative politics, including theories of democratic transitions, the politics of economic reform, voting, parties, and electoral systems, and theories of ethnic conflict.   Please note: this course fulfills the requirement for a \u201ccore\u201d course for Politics majors, the first time such a course has been offered at NYU-Florence, and is taught by Professor Tucker, who normally teaches the course in New York. As such, it is to date the only opportunity *anywhere* to take a politics core course in a small class format. As an introductory course, it is also perfectly appropriate for non-politics majors as well.

It has 27 states and 500 million people. Its GNP is more or less equal to that of the USA. Many of its members share a common currency and a common monetary policy. Yet it is a union without a state. The spectacular progress in the area of economic integration has not been matched by the creation of a common government and a common identity. The economic giant is still a political dwarf as it has been confirmed time and again whenever there is an international crisis,. Yet so far this strange entity has been working. Its achievements in the economic arena have been remarkable. The course will analyze in an interdisciplinary fashion the making of the Union, its institutions, its policies and its prospects in the very challenging environment of today. Probably more so than in any other period in its history the survival of the Union, as we have known it, will be tested by the impact of the most serious crisis of the post-war period. Particular attention will be given to the new economic governance established by the Union in responding to the problems posed by the poor economic and financial performance of some of its members, i.e. the PIGS (Portugal, Ireland, Greece, Spain).

We have all heard about demographic pressure, social policies, health care planning, inflation, market volatility: these are all concepts which rely heavily on statistical information. Changes have to be managed properly and in an informed way: scientific experiments be they on a medicine, on fertilizer or airbags must be planned as to ensure their validity. Total quality in production is a statistics-based philosophy of management, and if you like a commercial it is also because a statistician has provided information about consumer tastes and behaviour. In this course we will provide an introduction to the tools of statistics but most importantly we will try and understand the rationale behind statistics.

Analysis of real-world data over the last decades, such as court proceedings and crime statistics, dismisses many of the accepted myths about Italian mafias. We will explore the organization of mafia groups, rules and codes, activities both in legitimate business and illegal markets, and their relationship to politics. This comparative approach will help students identify those factors facilitating the emergence, migration and persistence of organized crime across countries. The course will include a review of the legislative efforts and best-practices designed to prevent and control organized crime in Italy and in the United States.

We will read them in translation, but those with sufficient  Arabic competence are encouraged to read the original, or to work comparatively  between the Arabic and English versions.      Rather than a developmental model, in which  modern and contemporary Arabic literature are gauged by how far they have  advanced in relation to Western literary achievement, this course attends to  how literary works function as nodes around which cluster various consequences  \u2013 literary and extra-literary \u2013 and engage with the environments in which they  were written. Participants are encouraged to consider texts through the prisms  of their multiple contexts \u2013 the historical, the social and the cultural, as  well as gender and class \u2013 while attending to them, in contrapuntal fashion, as  works of art.      This course is reading intensive (about  150-200 pages per week) and requires thoughtful analysis of literary texts. We  will consider texts of varying pedigrees: our rallying point in all of our  readings will be the formal elements of the text, such as theme, plot, style  and character. As we discuss these elements, we will investigate how these  works represent modern and contemporary Arab experience, including issues of  modernity and tradition, displacement, migration and exile, oppression and  resistance as well as shifting notions of the nation. We will consider a  variety of perspectives and critical interventions; at all times, we will  consider how literature is, means and does.       Topics in French Literature: An Introduction to Jacques Derrida (1930-2004) Nouis      From Derrida\u2019s critique of  \u201cWestern\u201d categorizations of universality and rationality (logocentrism,  phallogocentrism, humanism, anthropocentrism), to his later reflections on  metaphoricity, translation, and performativity, this course will first explore  the question of \u201cwriting\u201d as it unfolds throughout the 1960\u2019s and beyond. We will  then focus on the more directly political and ethical dimension of Derrida\u2019s  thought, and carefully examine his use of concepts such as hos(ti)pitality,  gift, forgiveness, animality, friendship, faith, and \"\u00e9v\u00e9nement,\"  paying particular attention to his later conversation with Emmanuel Levinas.  Readings will include passages, chapters and essays taken from Writing and  difference (1967), On Grammatology  (1967), Psyche. Inventions of the other (1987), Points..., (1992); Force of Law  (1994); Politics of Friendship (1994); Monolinguism of the Other (1996) ; Of  Hospitality (1997) ; On Cosmopolitanism and Forgiveness (1997); Philosophy in a Time of Terror (2003); The  Beast and the Sovereign (2008), etc. The course and the readings will be in  English. Topics in Labor and the Global Market: Literature, Film &amp; History Forman Globalization has become a  much-debated and deeply controversial topic. In this class, we will focus on  the ways that labor has been represented and understood, especially in  relationship to the development of capitalism in its global form. We will  explore how the movement of capital, commodities, and workers across the globe  and with seeming indifference to national borders shapes the idea of work and  those who perform it. Of equal importance in our study will be the way that  work transforms the structure of the global economy. Some primary questions we  will explore are: How has the demand for labor required migration and imposed  geographical dislocations? How does labor create value within these new  locations? How do some gain control of the work of others? How do workers  organize themselves and develop community in new locations? How does this  relationship of power change over time? Some likely texts for the course  include: Shakespeare, The Tempest; Ngugi wa Thiong'o\u2019s postcolonial play, I  will Marry When I Want; a Haitian novel about a sugar cane worker who migrates  to the Dominican Republic. We will place these fictional texts in conversation  with visual representations by Diego Rivera, works by Marx, by anthropologists  and narrative filmmakers on sex tourism and domestic labor, and by documentary  filmmakers and historians on global corporations and utopian economies.  Topics: What is Critique? Huber      The philosopher  and theorist Michel Foucault argued that critique is a powerful form of  insubordination and a crucial \u201cinstrument for those who fight, resist, and who  no longer want what is.\u201d But how might critical philosophy, which trades in  ideas, help us combat material and pervasive forms of injustice? What is  theory\u2019s relationship to praxis and to politics, and what kind of theory or  practice is critique? The seminar begins with a consideration of the uneasy  place of critique in the western philosophical tradition. We will read Kant,  Marx, Foucault, Butler, Mahmood and Mbembe among others, in order to establish  a sense of how critique emerges as a mode of radical questioning, an art of  unsettling self-evident answers and interfering with established relations of  power. We will consider what the practice of critique entails, and what it  means to suggest, as these authors do, that critique interrogates the  historically specific relationships between power, truth and the subject. In  the last third of the class, we will focus on queer of color critique (Mu\u00f1oz,  Ferguson, Reddy, and Chen), a relatively recent body of scholarship that  exemplifies the urgency, risk and daring of critique as a critical  practice.   Hellscapes and Elysia in the Renaissance and Beyond McHugh     This course explores various representations of otherworlds,  both infernal and paradisal: the realms of the afterlife, regions of marvel or  idyllic bliss, political utopias and dystopias. Readings and discussion focus  on how these imagined lands reflect, critique, and animate the real world, from  antiquity through our own times. The Age of  angst: German and Austrian Intellectual History, 1890-1938 George      This course  explores the profound sense of crisis, uncertainty, and anxiety that pervaded  German and Austrian experience in the late nineteenth and early twentieth  centuries. The era\u2019s radical changes\u2014among them the traumas of war, rapid  industrialization and urbanization, shifting gender roles, and the political  and economic instability of the interwar years\u2014seemed to shake the very bedrock  upon which society had been built. The intellectual responses to this pervasive  sense of upheaval and angst, as well as the challenges and changes themselves,  form the focus of this course, as we explore the relationship between modernity  and crisis in early twentieth-century Germany and Austria. Readings will  include Nietzsche, Freud, Simmel, Weber, Kracauer, Benjamin, and Heidegger.  Introduction  to Theory \u2013 German Media Theory: From Aesthetics to Cultural Techniques Smith      This course  presents a survey of the German strain of media theory from the perspective of  the persistent interchanges and parallels between it and social thought and  forms. We will follow a trajectory that can be roughly outlined by four  movements: 1) Media theory\u2019s ancestors in classical philosophy; 2) The boom in  aesthetic theory that took place in 18th-century German philosophy, one still  based in a humanistic understanding of the world; 3) late 20th-century  discussions of discourse networks and systems theory, which attempt to  de-center the human subject in favor of an understanding of the technical  forces that drive history; and 4) the contemporary understanding of the  intertwined nature of technical media and culture proposed in the school of  \u201ccultural techniques.\u201d Thus this course additionally addresses the ways in  which Media Studies provides a template for understanding the ethical, legal,  and social position of human subject in the \u201cdigital\u201d and technologically  mediated world.  Re-imagining Greek Tragedy: Context, Influence and Performance Taxidou The   encounters with Greek Tragedy throughout the ages have not only shaped   our understanding of theatre in the Western canon, but have also   informed basic concepts and theories of classicism, neo-classicism and   humanism more broadly. A privileged genre in aesthetic theory, its   powerful roles (like Clytemnestra, Oedipus, Antigone) have had a huge   impact on modern thinking, from psychoanalysis and philosophy to legal   and political theory. This course will take an interdisciplinary   approach to Greek Tragedy, bringing together critical languages from   Classics, Theatre Studies, Performance Theory, but also philosophy and   critical theory. Through a series of close readings of key   play-texts by the three tragedians--Aeschylus, Sophocles and   Euripes--this course will analyse the development of Greek tragedy as a   dramatic genre and vehicle for performance within the context of the   democratic city-state. It will also look at the ways these texts have   been re-written and re-imagined for performance within the broader   context of modernity. Literature &amp; Society in the Middle East Igsiz Examines selected works in translation of leading 20th-century poets,   novelists, and short story writers that reflect changing conditions and   mores within Middle Eastern and North African societies. Investigates   such topics as conflicts between traditionalists and modernists, the   impact of urbanization on rural societies, and the existential dilemmas   of men and women.

With eyes cast simultaneously on painting, the graphic arts, sculpture, and architecture, this class will explore a broad range of art patronage that included religious and civic bodies, princely courts, and a growing number of private clients. The course will focus on points of intersection, transition, and the transformations that lead from one tradition to the next. Above all, our approach will encourage critical thinking and a search for unifying connections in studying the underlying logic of image making. Works will be examined on their native terms: both as physical objects, with sensitivity to their particular function and intended reception, and as visual images active within larger contexts.

Due to Italy\u2019s strong historical legacy, modern Italian artists and architects have gone through an intense struggle to break from academic models. Initially the new movements, such as Impressionism and Art Nouveau, arrived from outside sources, yet beginning with I Macchiaoli, followed by the Futurists, Neo\u2013 Rationalists, Arte Povera, and Transavanguardia, Italians were frequently originators of the discourses of new artistic movements. The tide of trends periodically seceded from traditions and then returned to them in critical ways, seen in the metaphysical paintings of Giorgio de Chirico or the wistful pavilions of Aldo Rossi. During the past decade Italy has produced several new institutions for contemporary art and architecture, including MART in Rovereto, the Museo del \u2018900 (Museum of the 20th century) in Milan, and MAXXI (Museum of the Arts of the 21st century), devoted specifically to both art and architecture, broadening the historical and critical perspective and providing a stimulus for the art of the future.

Although the Italian peninsula was home to some of the most important ancient civilizations, Italy\u2019s existence as a united country dates only from the nineteenth century, making it younger than the US as a modern nation state. Italy was first unified by the Romans, making Roman antiquity a point of reference throughout history as intellectuals and political leaders dreamed of a unified nation. We examine how Italian identity was formed throughout history, both by Italians and by foreign visitors to Italy, in response to the principal ancient cultures that thrived on the peninsula.

Simultaneously observers and participants, \u201cinsiders\u201d and \u201coutsiders\u201d,  consensus builders and social critics, thinkers and occasionally active politicians, these public  figures are central to modern democratic dialogue. Not surprisingly, considerable controversy  accompanies the appearance of (many) university-trained professionals in the public sphere, and  the discussions they initiate have been characterized quite often by bitter and personal attacks.   This course examines the work and contributions of several prominent intellectuals in crucial  periods of contemporary European history over the 20th and 21st centuries, and considers  their important roles in public debate, policy-making and the political process. Their writings  focus on the important issues of their time \u2013 war and peace, economic instability, dictatorship,  European integration, organized crime, the collapse of European communism and post-industrial  capitalism \u2013 concerns that are still very much of relevance and debate today. Finally, the course  also considers the \u201ctheory\u201d of public intellectuals by looking at the writings on their own place  in society and on the models of participation that others, like them, have offered in the past.   The class has a seminar format with discussion of the principal works of a number of public  intellectuals and their biographies framing the weekly sessions. We will also explore the  historical context of these works and consider, with the advantage of hindsight, the relative  accuracy of the positions assumed in the past \u2013 did they really come close to \u201ctelling the  truth\u201d as we understand it today? The reactions of the public, of political leaders, and of other  prominent individuals are also examined to better consider the impact of these intellectuals\u2019  contributions and to appreciate the measure of their commitment to freedom and open  discussion.

Italy is well-known for being a family centered society.  What are the causes and consequences of this phenomenon? Since the 1960s, the family has  undergone a series of changes, due to the women\u2019s movement, decrease of marriages, fall of  birthrate, etc. Is the family loosing its centrality in Italy? According to some scholars, the family  is still one of the few shared values in Italy. The course will investigate the social function of the  family in Italy, from the political unification of the country to the present. We will also analyze  ideas of femininity and masculinity conveyed by the media and their connections to the idea  of Italianness. The imagined Italian community was constructed on the site of the female body  which was meant to epitomize a series of values such as fertility, health, prosperity, purity,  tradition, etc. The course will also map the condition of women and LGBT people in Italy today.

Reviewing politics, economics, society, and culture over the past two centuries, the course has a primary goal -- to consider how developments since the 1800s have influenced the lives and formed the outlook of today's Italians. In other words, we are engaged in the historical search for something quite elusive: Italian \u201cidentity\u201d. Topics will include the unification of the country, national identity in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the First World War, and Italian fascism, World War Two and the resistance, the post-war Italian Republic, the economic &quot;miracle&quot;, the South, the Mafia, terrorism, popular culture, and the most recent political and social developments, including Italy and the European Union. Lectures combine with readings and films (taking advantage of Italy\u2019s magnificent post-war cinema).

NOTE: This course meets in the center of Florence. Students should allow for 30 minutes commute time between this class and their prior or subsequent class.   The course Photojournalism: Exploring Italian Society focuses on the contemporary life of Florence, a city best known as a UNESCO World Heritage site, but that is also a European city attempting to rise to the challenges that currently confront other urban environments throughout Europe and the world. The course draws its strengths from the unique resources of the program and the city of Florence. From Italian labor protests, to commemoration of historic events, to immigrant populations, mass transit and tourism, Florence has many compelling contemporary visual stories to tell. Students have the unique opportunity to capture these issues in images.

Photography has become a tool to strengthen the understanding of architecture, to highlight aesthetic and design ideas and to critically interpret space. This class focuses on architectural photography and the photography of urban space, both in relation to their historical roots and contemporary practice, covering the theoretical connections between architecture and photography. Through course assignments students will learn to confront a variety of challenges presented by photographing different architectural styles. By the end of the course, each student will have produced a portfolio of architectural photography.   This is an intermediate photography course. Each student must have basic knowledge of digital photographic techniques and their own SLR digital camera with manually adjustable aperture and shutter speed, as well as a flash drive to backup your work. The course is a combination of lectures and labs for a total of six hours per week.

As a way of cutting into this vast topic, we specifically focus on the process of democratic transition by analyzing the democratic revolution that has swept the globe during the last thirty-five years. In turn we will explore the causes of democratization, threats to democratization, and factors that may aid in a successful consolidation of democracy. As part of this process, students will be exposed to a wide range of topics in comparative politics, including theories of democratic transitions, the politics of economic reform, voting, parties, and electoral systems, and theories of ethnic conflict.   Please note: this course fulfills the requirement for a \u201ccore\u201d course for Politics majors, the first time such a course has been offered at NYU-Florence, and is taught by Professor Tucker, who normally teaches the course in New York. As such, it is to date the only opportunity *anywhere* to take a politics core course in a small class format. As an introductory course, it is also perfectly appropriate for non-politics majors as well.

It has 27 states and 500 million people. Its GNP is more or less equal to that of the USA. Many of its members share a common currency and a common monetary policy. Yet it is a union without a state. The spectacular progress in the area of economic integration has not been matched by the creation of a common government and a common identity. The economic giant is still a political dwarf as it has been confirmed time and again whenever there is an international crisis,. Yet so far this strange entity has been working. Its achievements in the economic arena have been remarkable. The course will analyze in an interdisciplinary fashion the making of the Union, its institutions, its policies and its prospects in the very challenging environment of today. Probably more so than in any other period in its history the survival of the Union, as we have known it, will be tested by the impact of the most serious crisis of the post-war period. Particular attention will be given to the new economic governance established by the Union in responding to the problems posed by the poor economic and financial performance of some of its members, i.e. the PIGS (Portugal, Ireland, Greece, Spain).

Analysis of real-world data over the last decades, such as court proceedings and crime statistics, dismisses many of the accepted myths about Italian mafias. We will explore the organization of mafia groups, rules and codes, activities both in legitimate business and illegal markets, and their relationship to politics. This comparative approach will help students identify those factors facilitating the emergence, migration and persistence of organized crime across countries. The course will include a review of the legislative efforts and best-practices designed to prevent and control organized crime in Italy and in the United States.

Sample Syllabus                                                                    Readings in Medieval and Renaissance Italian Literature - ITAL-UA 9115 - 4 points                               Prerequisite: successful completion of ITAL-UA 30 Advanced Review of Modern Italian or permission of instructor.   This course, conducted in Italian, will present the Classics of the Italian Literature in prose and poetry from the Middle Ages to the Renaissance, through a specific topic: the journey, understood either as a spiritual/existential journey and as a \u2018love\u2019 journey, but also as the real journey of exploration and contact or the imaginary journey. We will relate the topic's historical and social contexts and identities, and comment on the spiritual peregrination of Dante's Commedia and on the epistle of Petrarch's Ascent of Mount Ventoux. We will introduce the travelogue Il Milione (The Travels of Marco Polo), discussing the figure of the famous merchant and traveler Polo. Moreover, analyzing the Decameron of Boccaccio, we will consider the role of merchants and travelers in some of his novelle. We will highlight metaphors of traveling in the tradition of amor cortese (courtly love), stressing some images in the poems of the Sicilian and Tuscan School and in the Stil Novo, reading as well from Dante's Rime and Petrarch's Canzoniere, and not forgetting the Women Poets, such as Gaspara Stampa. Finally, we will discuss fantastic journeying to the Moon and spatial movements in the chivalric epic of the Orlando Furioso by Ludovico Ariosto. Through these texts, and constant cross references to the contemporary Italian classics (Calvino and Eco among others), we will study the origins of Italian Literature.     Sample Syllabus                                                                      Italian Politics - ITAL-UA 9512 or POL-UA 9512 - 4 points                               Italian instruction will be offered for Italian Immersion students.

We will read them in translation, but those with sufficient  Arabic competence are encouraged to read the original, or to work comparatively  between the Arabic and English versions.      Rather than a developmental model, in which  modern and contemporary Arabic literature are gauged by how far they have  advanced in relation to Western literary achievement, this course attends to  how literary works function as nodes around which cluster various consequences  \u2013 literary and extra-literary \u2013 and engage with the environments in which they  were written. Participants are encouraged to consider texts through the prisms  of their multiple contexts \u2013 the historical, the social and the cultural, as  well as gender and class \u2013 while attending to them, in contrapuntal fashion, as  works of art.      This course is reading intensive (about  150-200 pages per week) and requires thoughtful analysis of literary texts. We  will consider texts of varying pedigrees: our rallying point in all of our  readings will be the formal elements of the text, such as theme, plot, style  and character. As we discuss these elements, we will investigate how these  works represent modern and contemporary Arab experience, including issues of  modernity and tradition, displacement, migration and exile, oppression and  resistance as well as shifting notions of the nation. We will consider a  variety of perspectives and critical interventions; at all times, we will  consider how literature is, means and does.       Topics in French Literature: An Introduction to Jacques Derrida (1930-2004) Nouis      From Derrida\u2019s critique of  \u201cWestern\u201d categorizations of universality and rationality (logocentrism,  phallogocentrism, humanism, anthropocentrism), to his later reflections on  metaphoricity, translation, and performativity, this course will first explore  the question of \u201cwriting\u201d as it unfolds throughout the 1960\u2019s and beyond. We will  then focus on the more directly political and ethical dimension of Derrida\u2019s  thought, and carefully examine his use of concepts such as hos(ti)pitality,  gift, forgiveness, animality, friendship, faith, and \"\u00e9v\u00e9nement,\"  paying particular attention to his later conversation with Emmanuel Levinas.  Readings will include passages, chapters and essays taken from Writing and  difference (1967), On Grammatology  (1967), Psyche. Inventions of the other (1987), Points..., (1992); Force of Law  (1994); Politics of Friendship (1994); Monolinguism of the Other (1996) ; Of  Hospitality (1997) ; On Cosmopolitanism and Forgiveness (1997); Philosophy in a Time of Terror (2003); The  Beast and the Sovereign (2008), etc. The course and the readings will be in  English. Topics in Labor and the Global Market: Literature, Film &amp; History Forman Globalization has become a  much-debated and deeply controversial topic. In this class, we will focus on  the ways that labor has been represented and understood, especially in  relationship to the development of capitalism in its global form. We will  explore how the movement of capital, commodities, and workers across the globe  and with seeming indifference to national borders shapes the idea of work and  those who perform it. Of equal importance in our study will be the way that  work transforms the structure of the global economy. Some primary questions we  will explore are: How has the demand for labor required migration and imposed  geographical dislocations? How does labor create value within these new  locations? How do some gain control of the work of others? How do workers  organize themselves and develop community in new locations? How does this  relationship of power change over time? Some likely texts for the course  include: Shakespeare, The Tempest; Ngugi wa Thiong'o\u2019s postcolonial play, I  will Marry When I Want; a Haitian novel about a sugar cane worker who migrates  to the Dominican Republic. We will place these fictional texts in conversation  with visual representations by Diego Rivera, works by Marx, by anthropologists  and narrative filmmakers on sex tourism and domestic labor, and by documentary  filmmakers and historians on global corporations and utopian economies.  Topics: What is Critique? Huber      The philosopher  and theorist Michel Foucault argued that critique is a powerful form of  insubordination and a crucial \u201cinstrument for those who fight, resist, and who  no longer want what is.\u201d But how might critical philosophy, which trades in  ideas, help us combat material and pervasive forms of injustice? What is  theory\u2019s relationship to praxis and to politics, and what kind of theory or  practice is critique? The seminar begins with a consideration of the uneasy  place of critique in the western philosophical tradition. We will read Kant,  Marx, Foucault, Butler, Mahmood and Mbembe among others, in order to establish  a sense of how critique emerges as a mode of radical questioning, an art of  unsettling self-evident answers and interfering with established relations of  power. We will consider what the practice of critique entails, and what it  means to suggest, as these authors do, that critique interrogates the  historically specific relationships between power, truth and the subject. In  the last third of the class, we will focus on queer of color critique (Mu\u00f1oz,  Ferguson, Reddy, and Chen), a relatively recent body of scholarship that  exemplifies the urgency, risk and daring of critique as a critical  practice.   Hellscapes and Elysia in the Renaissance and Beyond McHugh     This course explores various representations of otherworlds,  both infernal and paradisal: the realms of the afterlife, regions of marvel or  idyllic bliss, political utopias and dystopias. Readings and discussion focus  on how these imagined lands reflect, critique, and animate the real world, from  antiquity through our own times. The Age of  angst: German and Austrian Intellectual History, 1890-1938 George      This course  explores the profound sense of crisis, uncertainty, and anxiety that pervaded  German and Austrian experience in the late nineteenth and early twentieth  centuries. The era\u2019s radical changes\u2014among them the traumas of war, rapid  industrialization and urbanization, shifting gender roles, and the political  and economic instability of the interwar years\u2014seemed to shake the very bedrock  upon which society had been built. The intellectual responses to this pervasive  sense of upheaval and angst, as well as the challenges and changes themselves,  form the focus of this course, as we explore the relationship between modernity  and crisis in early twentieth-century Germany and Austria. Readings will  include Nietzsche, Freud, Simmel, Weber, Kracauer, Benjamin, and Heidegger.  Introduction  to Theory \u2013 German Media Theory: From Aesthetics to Cultural Techniques Smith      This course  presents a survey of the German strain of media theory from the perspective of  the persistent interchanges and parallels between it and social thought and  forms. We will follow a trajectory that can be roughly outlined by four  movements: 1) Media theory\u2019s ancestors in classical philosophy; 2) The boom in  aesthetic theory that took place in 18th-century German philosophy, one still  based in a humanistic understanding of the world; 3) late 20th-century  discussions of discourse networks and systems theory, which attempt to  de-center the human subject in favor of an understanding of the technical  forces that drive history; and 4) the contemporary understanding of the  intertwined nature of technical media and culture proposed in the school of  \u201ccultural techniques.\u201d Thus this course additionally addresses the ways in  which Media Studies provides a template for understanding the ethical, legal,  and social position of human subject in the \u201cdigital\u201d and technologically  mediated world.  Re-imagining Greek Tragedy: Context, Influence and Performance Taxidou The   encounters with Greek Tragedy throughout the ages have not only shaped   our understanding of theatre in the Western canon, but have also   informed basic concepts and theories of classicism, neo-classicism and   humanism more broadly. A privileged genre in aesthetic theory, its   powerful roles (like Clytemnestra, Oedipus, Antigone) have had a huge   impact on modern thinking, from psychoanalysis and philosophy to legal   and political theory. This course will take an interdisciplinary   approach to Greek Tragedy, bringing together critical languages from   Classics, Theatre Studies, Performance Theory, but also philosophy and   critical theory. Through a series of close readings of key   play-texts by the three tragedians--Aeschylus, Sophocles and   Euripes--this course will analyse the development of Greek tragedy as a   dramatic genre and vehicle for performance within the context of the   democratic city-state. It will also look at the ways these texts have   been re-written and re-imagined for performance within the broader   context of modernity. Literature &amp; Society in the Middle East Igsiz Examines selected works in translation of leading 20th-century poets,   novelists, and short story writers that reflect changing conditions and   mores within Middle Eastern and North African societies. Investigates   such topics as conflicts between traditionalists and modernists, the   impact of urbanization on rural societies, and the existential dilemmas   of men and women.

Requirements: Two 8 page papers and a presentation on a  class reading.   Unless otherwise noted, readings will  be posted on NYU Classes course site.  Revisiting the Western Classics: Ancient Materialisms: Matter &amp; Gender in Classical Antiquity Bianchi      In the face of the rising popularity of \u201cnew materialisms\u201d it  is important to remember that the notion of \u201cmatter\u201d itself arose in a specific  historical and philosophical context in classical antiquity. Matter, from the  Latin \u2018 materia \u2019 (related to mater, mother) itself emerged from  Aristotle\u2019s Greek innovation hul\u00ea (literally,  wood). In this class we will undertake close readings of key ancient works on  the origin and constitution of the natural world and its intersections with the  human world, including prephilosophical cosmogonies, Presocratic philosophies  of nature, Aeschylus\u2019 Oresteia, Greek  atomism, Plato\u2019s Timaeus , Aristotle\u2019s   Physics, Metaphysics, and Generation of Animals , and Lucretius\u2019 De Rerum Natura, tracing the emergence  of discourses of materiality alongside and in concert with tropes of sex and  gender. To assist us in this endeavor we will draw on contemporary readings including  Heidegger, Kristeva, Irigaray, Loraux, Butler, and Grosz, as well as critically  engaging Bachofen\u2019s 19 th century conception of Mutterrecht . Some background knowledge of psychoanalytic theory is  advised as is knowledge of Greek, however all readings will be in translation. Topics in Caribbean Literature: Comparatism, Contigency, and the Caribbean Dopico  \u201c The Caribbean,\u201d as David Scott has  argued, \u201cis not merely modern\u2026. it is modern in a fundamentally inaugural way.\u201d  What does it mean to think of the Caribbean as an inaugural imaginary? And what does the Caribbean mean in a  post-colonial, post-socialist, post-revolutionary age? A long host of thinkers, writers and artists  of the nineteenth and twentieth century have insisted on the centrality of the  Caribbean as root and rhizome in our understanding of modernity and its  elements: enlightenment and capital, race and empire, sovereignty and  simulation, culture and nation, and, most romantically, or tragically,  revolution. But to think the Caribbean adequately one has to think beyond the  dialectics of roots and rhizome, beyond the poetics of relation, archipelago  and diaspora. This demands too that we read  beyond the tragic and monumental tropes of the Caribbean and read instead minor  forms and minor keys. Thinking and reading the Caribbean requires not only linguistic  and theoretical fluencies, but a capacity to read deep contexts and  contingencies within apparent economies of cultural and material scarcity. It  requires the capacity to engage the master paradigms of modernity and  simultaneously engage the more slippery problems of temporality, contingency,  misunderstanding, as well as the violent and demoralizing mechanisms of  domination, transaction and subordination.  This course considers  key texts and works of the Caribbean archipelago and reads them comparatively  and sometimes against the grain of their national, regional and postcolonial  inscriptions. We will read major cultural works and lesser-known expressions,  major literary works and alongside minor or forgotten forms. We will consider how the cultural monuments  of the Caribbean have occluded collective politics, aesthetic experiments,  insurgent movements and ephemeral forms. We counter pose the monumentality of  literature to the epistemologies and historical consciousness of other cultural  practices, aiming both for the contrapuntal and the counterintuitive. How, for example, have we come to understand  the Haitian Revolution or the Cuban Revolution within grand narratives and what  would it mean to read in them not epic, tragic destinies but more banal  parables about modernity \u2014destinies consonant with other forms of communal  politics, other orders of transaction and betrayal, from Paris, to Prague, from  Berlin to Grenada? Comparative questions abound: What does it mean to read a history of  revolution and civil rights in the Caribbean nineteenth century? What is the  specificity of Caribbean race theory? What is the distance between a history of  literature and a history of print culture in the Caribbean? How does literature  compete with visual aesthetics? How do  we \u201cread\u201d Aponte\u2019s lost book or desacralize Walcott\u2019s Omeros? How does Patrick Chamoiseau destroy the  postcolonial novel? How does Dulce Mar\u00eda Loynaz precede Sebald by half a  century? Why is Virgilio Pi\u00f1era like  Franz Kafka?  We will also ask  about discursive notions of the Caribbean: what and whether the reparative  poetics of relation and antillanit\u00e9 hold . We will engage the divisions between  Francophone, Anglophone, and Hispanophone Caribbean studies and trace cultural  and theoretical genealogies and segregations, asking if the Caribbean has a  common culture beyond the major tropic/al conceits that artists and scholars  have used to bind literary production. We will ask, in the tradition of Edward  Said, whether, like the East, \u201cCaribbeanism\u201d  becomes a career, what the field might mean, and how it exists. What is the place of the Caribbean in the  conceptions and political destinies of the American hemisphere or the Global  South? The syllabus is still  in progress but will include selections from major canonical Caribbean texts  (Casal, Hostos, James, M\u00e9traux, C\u00e9saire, Price Mars, Ma\u00f1ach, Marinello, Ortiz,  Cabrera, Walcott, Brathwaite, Lamming),    theorists and historians of the Caribbean (James, Cesaire, Glissant,  Moreno Fraginals, Ben\u00edtez Rojo, Trouillot, Scott), twentieth century literature (Carpentier,  Burgos, Loynaz, Lezama, Rodr\u00edguez Juli\u00e1, Pi\u00f1era, Walcott) through to the post-colonial Caribbean  Anglophone corpus and onto contemporary writers from Rita Indiana Hern\u00e1ndez to  Marlon James. We will pay special  attention to breaking postcolonial linguistic segregations, but also be mindful  of the operations and problem of genre, print culture, journal, performance,  and the pedagogies of civil society. We  will consider the formation of Caribbean Studies as a field and think of the  ways that journals from Or\u00edgenes and Tropiques , to Callaloo and Small Axe transform critical, artistic  and activist interventions on the Caribbean, and translate to intellectual  practices in the academy.          Comparative Poetics/Proseminar in Poetics &amp; Theory: Prose and Cons: Poetics in the Age of Prose Gadberry The long eighteenth-century has accrued a long   series of appellations, the Age of Reason, the Enlightenment, the   Augustan Age, and the Age of Prose among them. At the end of the   seventeenth century, the famous poet and critic Boileau is said to have   announced that Descartes himself had \u201ccut poetry\u2019s throat\u201d while Matthew   Arnold looked back and deemed even the great poets of the eighteenth   century to be writing prose in their verse. Our course attempts to   uncover the fate of poetics in this \u201cage of prose and reason.\u201d How and   where do we find poetics at a moment at which poetry appears to be dead?   Our inquiry will pursue the longstanding antagonism between philosophy   and poetry as we plumb texts central to the conceptual legacy of the   period before the revival of poetics and poetry with Romanticism. Is   there a poetics of reason, of toleration, of common sense, of   laissez-faire? Just where does poetry go, and what might this have to do   with the birth of criticism? How does a poetics undergird the   subjectivities and, indeed, the systems that authors of the period   imagine? As we read texts of the period, we will engage twentieth- and   twenty-first-century interlocutors who will help us puzzle over what and   where poetry is in the moments of its apparent defeat or disappearance. Early   modern texts may include works by Hobbes, Milton, Locke, Corneille,   Boileau, Pope, Defoe, Baumgarten, Kant, Shaftesbury, Rousseau, and Vico.   Our modern texts may include works by Benjamin, Badiou, Derrida,   Peirce, Wittgenstein, Richards, among others. All texts will be   available in translation, but reading knowledge of French and/or German a   plus.      Culture and Critique: Transnational America Garcia This  seminar examines the transnational turn in U.S. literary studies and the  resulting reconfiguration of the relationship between American Studies and  Comparative Literature. We explore aesthetic renderings of \u201cAmerica\u201d during  different historical junctures and devote special attention to  re-conceptualizations of \u201cAmerica\u201d that create new objects of analysis, both  smaller and larger than the nation-form. If \u201ctrans\u201d is from the Latin for  \u201cover, across or beyond,\u201d we ask what it means to think about American  literature as \u201cover,\u201d \u201cacross,\u201d or \u201cbeyond\u201d the nation form. Along the way, we  examine divergent practices of comparative cultural studies, including theories  of the Black Atlantic, and more recent efforts to globally re-map American  literary cultures and theorize American literature through concepts of the  planetary. Alongside works by such writers as Henry James, W. E. B. Du Bois, Jean  Toomer and Eric Walrond, and more recent contributions by such authors as  Joseph O\u2019Neill and Mohsin Hamid, we consider past and present social theory and  cultural criticism that impinge upon twenty-first century comparative literary  studies and American studies alike. Tropics in Translation: Translation and Comparatism  Halim In various ways, translation has always played a signal role  in comparatism. Aiming to shed light on both issues within translation theory  and the changing nature of Comparative Literature, this course will address the  topic in relation to: World Literature, travelling theory, Translation Studies vis-\u00e0-vis  Comparative Literature, and South-South comparatism, among others. Readings by:  Amal Amireh, Emily Apter, Talal Asad, Susan Bassnett, David Damrosch, Ferial  Ghazoul, Richard Jacquemond, Mohja Kahf, Andr\u00e9 Lefevere, Edward Said, Gayatri  Spivak, Haun Saussy, Harish Trivedi, Lawrence Venuti, and others. Biopolitics and Culture in Contemporary Spain Matos-Martin     The notion of biopolitics is widely used today in many  disciplines and discourses to reflect on issues as diverse as neoliberalism,  globalization, fascism, demographic changes, global security, or health  problems. This notion, however, has been relatively little used in Spain. In  this course students will be introduced to different theories of biopolitics  --with an emphasis on violence and exclusion practices-- as articulated in  Spanish contemporary culture. As such, we will mostly analyze films and literary  texts that address experiences of social and political exclusion, marginality,  precariousness, abandonment or poverty within the modern Spanish context\u2014from  the Spanish Civil War to the current moment of economic crisis. Theoretical  readings will include, among others, Foucault, Agamben, Esposito, Lemke,  Mbembe, Bauman, Lazzarato, Balibar, Butler, Negri and Ranci\u00e8re. Topics in African Literature: Africa--In Theory Sanders     Recently there has been an  explosion in \u201ctheory from the South.\u201d Some of the most exciting interventions  have come from African theorists such as Ato Quayson, Achille Mbembe, Jean and  John Comaroff, and Mahmood Mamdani. Taking recent works by these theorists as  our starting point, we will explore the application and adaptation of  metropolitan thinkers such as Foucault, Derrida, and Schmitt, in order to  theorize \u201cnecropolitics,\u201d genocide, and xenophobia, among other burning issues.  We will also take stock of earlier endeavors by Africanist and Afro-Americanist  thinkers such as Du Bois, Senghor, Mudimbe, Soyinka, and Ngugi to define  critically Africa\u2019s specific contributions to the making (and making sense of)  the world that all of us inhabit. Since a number of these thinkers are also  writers and/or literary theorists, we shall also be analyzing key recent texts  by Ahmadou Kourouma, Phaswane Mpe, and Antjie Krog.
