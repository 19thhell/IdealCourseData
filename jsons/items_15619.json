Instructor: Professor Jonathan Goodman ,    Meeting: Warren Weaver Hall , room 1302, Wednesday evenings 5 to 7 pm.    First Class: September 8, 1999    Prerequisites: Scientific Computing. This courses covers basic numerical analysis and computational methods, including finite differences, error expansions, conditioning, and basic Monte Carlo. Corequisites: Mathematics of Finance II, and Partial Differential Equations in Finance.

Course description : Computational techniques for solving mathematical problems arising in finance. Numerical solution of parabolic partial differential equations, basic schemes, general theory, relation to binomial and trinomial trees, boundary conditions for American options, computation of sensitivities, application to one factor and multi factor models.

Note on downloading:    There is lots of stuff to download here. Anyone may download and print a personal copy. Please do not use them for any other purpose without telling me.    Each document will be posted in three formats: the original LaTeX source, the Postscript file, and a translation of the postscript file into PDF format. Postscript is a language created by Adobe for high end printers. If you have a Postscript printer, you can simply print the Postscript format file. This is the best method. Software for viewing and printing Postscript files on non Postscript printers, mostly under the name &quot;ghostscript&quot; is free for the downloading . LaTeX is a typesetting system used by most mathematicians and physicists. It too is shareware . The LaTeX files are the source files for the documents. The Acrobat reader, which allows you to view and print PDF format files, is an Adobe product and can be downloaded  free.         Lectures:    Week 1: Dynamic programming, basic probability and Markov chains, forward and backward inductive computation of probabilities, expected values, and optimal decisions under uncertainty. The notes, in LaTeX  format, Postscript format, or PDF  format, as of September 5. I will try to make the HTML a little better looking soon.    Week 2: Discussion of diffusion equations and their relation to diffusions. Qualitative properties of solutions of diffusion equations. Duality and the relation between the forward and backward Kolmogorov equations. Introduction to finite difference methods for diffusion equations. The notes, in   LaTeX  format, Postscript format, or   PDF format, as of September 24. It has come to my attention that the pdf files do not work for everyone. Since they work for me, it is hard for me to diagnose the problem, but I'm working on it. Try this PDF file instead. I thank Dan Powers for a long list of corrections to the earlier version.
