See microfilm reel with title: L'art litt&eacute;raire.   This little magazine, founded and edited in Portugal by Eugenio de Castro and Manuel da Silva Gayo, contains French contributions by Verlaine, Kahn, Merrill, Saint-Pol-Roux, and Gourmont. It testifies to the rapid dispersion of French Symbolist themes and forms.       La Basosche Location: microfilm, under title Basosche   Brussels, Vol. 1-2 (No. 1-16), Nov. 1884 - Apr 1886. See microfilm reel with title: L'art litt&eacute;raire.   Contains poetry by Fontainas, Merrill, Mikha&euml;l, and Quillard, as well as the first of Ren&eacute; Ghil's manifestoes. This was the first Belgian magazine to establish links with the French Symbolists.       Le Boulevard; Journal Litt&eacute;raire Illustr&eacute; Location: microfilm, under title Boulevard   Paris, num&eacute;ro sp&eacute;cimen, Dec. 1, 1861; Vol. 1-2, No. 24, Jan. 5, 1862 - June 14, 1863. This is, strictly speaking, a pre-Symbolist periodical. It is included in the present list because of its publication of Baudelaire, Leconte de Lisle, and other important precursors of the Symbolist movement. Its pages contain numberous brilliant caricatures and other graphics by Daumier, B&eacute;nassit, Bouquet, Pastelot, Regamey, etc. Never popular with the government, its existence was eventually terminated by the official censors.     Le Centaure Location: microfilm, under title Boulevard   Paris, Vol. 1-2, 1896 Founded and edited by Henri Albert in collaboration with Pierre Lou&yuml;s and others. This brief but elegant periodical contains important poems and critical essays by R&eacute;gnier, Gide, Val&eacute;ry, Herold, and Tinan. It also contains some outstanding graphics by Besnard, Rops, L&eacute;andre, Blanche, and others.     Le Chat Noir (4 reels) Location: microfilm, under title Chat Noir   Paris, Vol. 1-14 (No. 1-688), 1882-1895 Published weekly out of Rodolphe Salis' Artists' Cafe. It contains poetry and other items by Verlaine, Rollinat, Morice, Samain, Dubus, Bloy, Cros, and many others. Whimsical, satiric, and thoroughly fin-de-siecle illustrations also appear in its pages.     Chim&egrave;re; Revue Ind&eacute;pendente d'Insolence Litt&eacute;raire Location: microfilm, under title Chim&egrave;re   Paris, Vol. 1-2 (No. 1-16), Aug. 1891 - June 1893. Published by Paul Redonnel out of Montpellier. This little magazine has the added interest of containing the poetry of writers from the south of France as well as many contributions by Parisian poets.     La Conque; Anthologie des Plus Jeunes Po&egrave;tes. Location: microfilm, under title Chim&egrave;re   Paris, No. 1-11, 1891 - 1892 This magazine is particularly noteworthy for the early poems of Lou&yuml;s, Gide, and, especially, Val&eacute;ry. It also contains contributions by R&eacute;gnier, L&eacute;on Blum, and the \"d&eacute;cadent\" Swinburne.     Le Coq Rouge, Revue Litt&eacute;raire Location: microfilm, under title Chim&egrave;re   Brussels, Vol. 1-3, No. 1, May 1895 - June 1897 Includes contributions from Vi&eacute;l&eacute;-Griffin, Gourmont, Gide, Gh&eacute;on, Kahn, and Jammes, as well as from Belgian authors. It was originally founded as a protest against La Jenue Belgique , which, in its opinion, had already become reactionary.     Ecrits pour l'Art Litt&eacute;raire et Philosophique Location: microfilm, under title Chim&egrave;re   Paris, Vol. 1, 1905 Founded and edited by Jean Rog&egrave;re, this little magazine consciously adopted the same name as Ghil's 1887-92 journal. Ghil himself contributed to this latter day Ecrits , along with Pelletier, Nau, Dantinne, Fayolle, and Randau. The journal is also distinguished for its publication of translations of Russian Symbolists such as Bal'mont.     Les Entretiens Politiques et Litt&eacute;raires (2 reels) Location: microfilm, under title Entretiens Politiques et Litt&eacute;raires   Paris, No. 1-57, Mar. 1, 1890 - Dec. 25, 1893 Founded by Henri de R&eacute;gnier, Paul Adam, Georges Vanor, Bernard Lazare, and F. Vi&eacute;l&eacute;-Griffin. It also includes contributions by Quillard, Gide, Mallarm&eacute;, Saint-Pol-Roux. Lecomte, and Malo. During its brief life, it served as the crossroads for a wide variety of French literary and political currents, though the Symbolist influence was strongest.     L'Ermitage (10 reels) Location: microfilm, under title Ermitage   Paris, Vol. 1-35, Apr. 1890-1906 Along with La Plume , Mercure de France , and La Revue Blanche , this was one of the four main organs of the Symbolist movement. Like its peers it devoted space to historical, philosophical, and sociological topics as well as poetry, literary essays and reviews, and theatrical and fine arts articles. Founded by Henri Mazel, it was later edited by Stuart Merrill, Louis le Cardonnel, and Hughes Rebell. Some other contributors include Tailhade, Vi&eacute;l&eacute;-Griffin, Maurras, R&eacute;gnier, and Rambosson.     Les Ibis Location: microfilm, under title Ibis   Paris. No. 1-4, 1894 One of the brief but bright ephemera that were springing up all over the Symbolist movement. This one was founded by Degron and Klingsor, and it contains poetry by Vi&eacute;l&eacute;-Griffin, Rett&eacute;, G&eacute;rardy, R&eacute;gnier, Dierx, Signoret, and others.     La Jeune Revue Litt&eacute;raire Location: microfilm, under title Jeune Revue Litt&eacute;raire   Brussels, Vol 1, 1880 This was the immediate predecessor of La Jeune Belgique and includes contributions by Hymans, Gros, Gr&eacute;sil, Berlier, and Albert Orth.     La Jeune Belgique, Revue d'Art et de Critique (5 reels) Location: microfilm, under title Jeune Belgique   Brussels, Vol. 1-17, 1881 - Dec 25, 1897. Superseded La Jeune Revue Litt&eacute;raire . This magazine functioned as both a positive and a negative force in Symbolism. It was founded by Max Waller, and after 1889, when Verhaeren became associated with it, the French Symbolists began appearing regularly in its pages. But subsequent to 1894 it began conducting as anti-free verse campaign, thus inspiring the counter-attacks in Le Coq Rouge .     La Jeune France Location: microfilm, under title Jeune France   Paris, Vol 1-7, May 1, 1878 - Dec 1884. This periodicals subsequently merged into La Revue Ind&eacute;pendante but it had a very distinguished life of its own. It was founded by Albert Allenet and included on editorial board Jules Claretie and Alphones Daudet. Among its other contributors were Barr&egrave;s, Dierx, Rollinat, Junes Romain, and Anatole France.     Mercure de France (160 reels + 2 index reels) Location: microfilm, under title Mercure de France   Paris, Vol. 1-354, 1890 - 1965 Founded by Alfred Vallette to succeed La Pl&eacute;iade , Mercure de France is far and away the most important periodical of the Symbolist movement. It outlasted Symbolism as well as a myriad other subsequent literary, artistic, political, etc., currents. During its seventy-five year existence Mercure was one of the single most important French intellectual and artistic journals. Its entire run is re-published here. The indexes for each year's issues of the Mercure have been consolidated in a single film sequence as well as being filmed in their original place.     Le Parnasse Contemporain; Recueil de Vers Nouveaux Location: microfilm, under title Parnasse Contemporain   Paris, s&eacute;rie 1-3, 1866 - 1876 Though this journal formally preceded the Symbolist movement, its pages were an outlet for early Mallarm&eacute; as well as for pre- and proto-Symbolist poets such as Baudelaire, Dierx, H&eacute;r&eacute;dia, and Leconte de Lisle.     La Pl&eacute;iade Location: microfilm, under title Parnasse Contemporain   Paris, Vol. 1 (No. 1-7), Mar. 1886 - Nov. 1886; 1-2, 1889 - 1890 Founded by Rodolphe Darzens, La Pl&eacute;iade had among its contributors Ephraim Mikhael, Saint-Pol-Roux, P. Quillard, Ren&eacute; Ghil, Maeterlinck, van Lerberghe, and others. The later series included work by Brinn Gaubast, Tailhade, Rachilde, Barr&egrave;s, Aurier, Dubus, and Dumur. It was La Pl&eacute;iade that was the immediate predecessor of Mercure de France .     La Plume (9 reels) Location: microfilm, under title Plume   Paris, Vol 1-25, Apr. 15, 1889 - July 1913. One of the most important journals of the period, probably second in importance to Mercure de France . It was founded by Deschamps and included contributions from all the various literary currents afoot: Symbolism, Decadentism, Occultism, Regionalism, etc. It contains many special issues on such figures as Mor&eacute;as, Baudelaire, Verlaine, and such schools as the F&eacute;libres, the D&eacute;cadents, and the Occultists. Also included are many graphics and plates.     Le Reveil; Recueil Mensuel de Litt&eacute;rature et d'Art (2 reels) Location: microfilm, under title Reveil   Bruxelles, Vol. 1-6, 1891 - 96 This journal became important for French literary movements beginning in 1892. It contains contributions by Souchon, Vi&eacute;l&eacute;-Griffin, Klingsor, R&eacute;gnier, and Herold.     La Revue Blanche (8 reels) Location: microfilm, under title Revue Blanche   Paris, Vol. 1-30, Oct. 1891 - Apr. 14, 1903 Founded by Alexandre Natanson, this magazine was, along with L'Ermitage , Mercure de France , and La Plume , one of the most important journals of the nineties. Like them it was devoted to much more than Symbolism or even literature. It was a fully general review of all the arts and related intellectual currents. Mallarm&eacute;, Vi&eacute;l&eacute;-Griffin, Gourmont, Kahn, Blum, Bernard, Mauclair, and Dujardin are among its contributors. For a time Debussy wrote its musical reviews. Like La Plume it contains many interesting graphics, some being lithographs by Toulouse-Lautrec and others.     Revue d'Aujourd'hui Location: microfilm, under title Revue d'Aujourd'hui   Paris, Vol. 1-2, (No. 1-15), Jan. - Sept. 1890 Tola Dorian edited this journal in collaboration with Darzens. Two of the high points of its brief existence were Mallarm&eacute;'s essay \"Villiers de l'Isle Adam,\" and Villiers de l'Isle Adam's own piece. \"Amour Sublime.\"     Revue Ind&eacute;pendante de Litt&eacute;rature et d'Art (8 reels) Location: microfilm, under title Revue Ind&eacute;pendante de Litt&eacute;rature et d'Art   Paris, Vol. 1-2, May 1884 - Apr. 1885; Series 2 Vol. 1, May 1885; Series 3 Vol. 1-26 (No. 1-797), Nov 1886 - Sept. 1895. Founded by F&eacute;n&eacute;on, this magazine was one of the critical outlets of Mallarm&eacute;'s group, though it contains items by other Symbolists and non-Symbolists. Some of its contributors are Villiers de l'Isle-Adam, Barr&egrave;s, Bourges, P&eacute;ladan, Vignier, Ghil, Laforgue, Mor&eacute;as, and Wyzewa.     La Revue Naturiste Location: microfilm, under title Revue Naturiste   Paris, Vol. 1-2, 1897 - 1898 As its title indicates this journal was an organ for Naturism. Among its contributors were Boub&eacute;lier, Montfort, Le Blond, Viollis, and Fleury.     La Revue Wagn&eacute;rienne Location: microfilm, under title Revue naturiste   Paris, Vol. 1-3, 1885 - 1888 This magazine testifies throughout its pages to the enormous influence of Wagner in the arts other than music during the second half of the nineteenth century. The Symbolists were especially interested in Wagner's attempt to synthesize music and poetic drama and they contributed eagerly to the pages of the Revue . Included are poems and articles by Mallarm&eacute;, Ghil, Merrill, Vignier, Dujardin, Verlaine, and Teodor de Wyzewa.     Le Scapin Location: microfilm, under title Revue naturiste   Paris, Vol. 1-2, Dec. 1, 1885 - Aug. 16, 1886; Series 2, Nos. 1-9, Sept. 1, 1886 - Dec 31, 1886 This was one of Alfred Vallette's early outlets. It also includes poems and essays by Mallarm&eacute;, Verlaine, Tailhade, Rachilde, Renard, Samain, Dubus, Lorrain, Le Cardonnel, and Ghil. From its contributors, it might be regarded as the grandfather of Mercure de France with La Pl&eacute;iade being the father.     La Soci&eacute;t&eacute; Nouvelle; Revue Internationale. Sociologie, Arts, Sciences, Lettres Location: microfilm, under title Soci&eacute;t&eacute; Nouvelle   Brussels, etc., Vol. 1-53, No. 1, 1884 - July/Sept. 1914 Founded and first edited by Fernand Brouez, this journal was one of the major fixtures in Belgian literary and cultural circles. It crossed paths with Symbolism particularly during the years 1892 - 1895, when contributions by Gustave Kahn, R&eacute;gnier, Saint-Pol-Roux, and Vi&eacute;l&eacute;-Griffin frequently marked its pages. Like Mercure de France , its scope was much broader than literature alone, as its sub-title testifies. Its pages included some of the early French translations of Nietzsche.     Les Taches d'Encre Location: microfilm, under title Taches d'Encre   Paris, Nos. 1-4, Nov. 5, 1884 - Feb. 1885 This was Maurice Barr&egrave;s's own private journal. It is most important for its essay on Baudelaire in which the emerging Symbolist poetry was discussed under the rubric of \"d&eacute;cadent.\"     La Vogue (2 reels) Location: microfilm, under title Vogue   Paris, Vol. 1-3, 1886 - 1887; Jan. 1899 - May 1901 This magazine was first published by Leo d'Orfer and Gustave Kahn. It is especially important for its publication of Rimbaud. Also included are items by Laforgue, Mallarm&eacute;, Kahn, Vignier, Verlaine, Ghil, and, from the later period, Klingsor, Merrill, Pilon, Fleury, Verhaeren, Jammes, and Gasquet.

Departmental emphasis is on literature, language, culture, civilization, medieval and renaissance studies, literary translation from French to English (including poetics and translation theory from antiquity to the present), and francophone studies (with a focus on the Caribbean, Africa, and North Africa). Related fields of study include linguistics, art history, cinema studies, performance studies, and comparative literature. Departmental interdisciplinary interests include: history of ideas, women&rsquo;s studies/feminist theory, post-colonial studies, cultural studies, rhetorical studies, ethno-poetics, comparative poetics, avant-garde movements, historiography of theater, performance studies, myths and collective beliefs, political philosophy and ethics, media studies, religious studies.   The collection also supports the interdisciplinary courses and research of the Institute of French Studies, a multi-disciplinary center for the study of nineteenth- and twentieth-century France emphasizing French culture, history, politics, economics, and society. Other related programs include Africana Studies; Comparative Literature; Dramatic Literature; Medieval and Renaissance Studies; and the Foreign Language Education program at the School of Education.       Scope       Language   The collection consists principally of literary texts in French, and criticism, literary history and theory in both French and English. Works of major authors are also collected in English translation. Collecting in other Western European languages is highly selective.       Geographical Areas   Coverage emphasizes the literature of France, with minor emphasis on that of Canada and Belgium. An attempt is made to collect a representative body of literature from the French-speaking countries of the Maghreb, especially Algeria, and sub-Saharan Africa. Collecting of literature from the Caribbean is selective. See the related collection development policy for Latin-American and Caribbean studies.       Chronological Periods   Coverage of French literature is from the medieval period to the present with current emphasis on all centuries.         Types of Materials       Included   Monographs, monographic series, serials, newspapers, collections and festschrifts, proceedings, facsimiles, reprints, microforms, audio-visual, and electronic media. Exhibition catalogs and dissertations are acquired very selectively.       Excluded   Dissertations when requested only for individual research, manuscripts, textbooks, ephemera, maps.         Background of the Collection   The collection's strengths lie in French medieval literature and in 19th- and 20th-century French literature; among specific movements, French symbolism and surrealism (19th- and 20th-century respectively) should be noted.   The collection is weak in literature in French from the Maghreb and sub-Saharan Africa, although a representative collection is being developed, with special collecting interest in Algerian belle lettres. When possible, cooperative projects are pursued, especially with Columbia University Libraries and New York Public Libraries through the MaRLI agreement, to collect materials in areas of mutual interest. .   Important gaps exist in those support collections that are of importance to interdisciplinary research particularly in the medieval, 16th, 17th, and 18th centuries: among others, medieval and renaissance science, the renaissance humanistic endeavor, primary works in Latin, primary works in religion.   Preservation of materials is quite problematic as many basic works are in fragile condition and have brittle paper, while, on the other hand, a large number of French imprints are currently available only in paperback editions (reference works included). An effort is made to identify brittle materials to film them when no existing paper replacement copy is available   Continuing efforts will focus on: developing a strong collection in major editions of primary texts and criticism in all areas, from the Middle Ages to the present; filling gaps in major primary and secondary sources; strengthening collections that allow for an interdisciplinary approach; and systematically identifying and replacing missing or worn volumes of standard works. Acquisition of new as well as replacement volumes in important series, such as, La Biblioth&eacute;que de la Pl&eacute;iade, should be emphasized.         Other Resources     The Fales Library Special Collections include seven manuscript versions of Celine's \"Entretiens avec le Professeur Y\" as well as manuscript pages corresponding to pp. 72-129 of the 1957 Gallimard edition of Celine's works.   The Avery Fisher Center for Music and Media houses the Samuel Beckett Audio visual Archives, the largest tape and video collection of his work in the world. Included among the holdings are Beckett's Waiting for Godot, Shades, and Silence to Silence. In many cases, the collection includes the French, German, and English versions of a single work.
