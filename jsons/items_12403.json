We know that specialized technical skills and knowledge of history, culture, Hebrew language, and religious practice are all essential. But our emphasis and theory come from the deeply held belief that the Jewish community requires, above all else, dedicated, entrepreneurial, and well-trained professional leadership.                   Academic Degrees     NYU offers a unique set of programs that attracts students from all walks of life and backgrounds. A microcosm of the global Jewish community, students learn and work together in a nondenomenational, pluralistic, inclusive environment. In addition, students are encouraged to take advantage of the rich academic, cultural, and professional Jewish resources on campus and in and around New York City.

A microcosm of the global Jewish community, students learn and work together in a nondenomenational, pluralistic, inclusive environment.
