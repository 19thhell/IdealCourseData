Description       This course considers the production, management, and disposal of garbage as a dynamic cultural phenomenon that can lend insight into a broad array of questions at the nexus of environment and development. Most broadly, unpacking waste\u2019s deep political and cultural dimensions provides for critical reflection on urbanism, social relations of difference, global economic processes, and people\u2019s relationships to nature. After exploring theories of waste and value, the course examines a broad selection of historic and contemporary geographies of waste from New York to Bangladesh for insight into specific debates and phenomena inscribed within these larger themes. Specific themes will include: the role of discourses and practices of waste in patterns of racial injustice and segregation in the colonial period to the contemporary era; concepts of pollution governing debates on sustainability and the urban environment; formal and informal labors of garbage management and questions of stigma and rights to the city; global waste circulations and capitalist globalization; the transformation of value and meaning involved in diverse processes of recycling; waste-based social movements and rebellion through disorder; the art of rubbish. Authors may include: Mary Douglas, Robin Nagle, Sarah Moore, Gay Hawkins, and Katherine Boo.
