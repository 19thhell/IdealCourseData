His most recent publication, Golokwati 2000 , is the latest in a sequence of visionary autobiographical/poetic meditations in which Brathwaite deploys his innovative \"Sycorax video style\" of typo/graphic presentation to illuminate the shaping paths and sources of his poetic voice. With Golokwati 2000 - which draws its title from an Akan Twi word connoting a resting place on a journey - Brathwaite assembles an anthology of his poems while weaving these poems into tales, memories, and revelations of how they came to be. The result is a powerful insight into the spiritual and intellectual development of a major poet of our times.

The Body-Building Series Friday, February 1 - Friday, March 1, 2002    Opening Reception and Booksigning for The Black Female Body: A Photographic History , With Authors Carla Williams and Deborah Willis This series focuses on the female body, contextualized and situated in the present, pointing to how work is manifested physically in the black female body, shorn of covering, developed and amplified in muscles and tendons, shoulders and calves. The depiction of physical work and its impact on the development of the body has often been relegated to men and thus, the world of physical work is constructed as one that is gender specific. This series attempts to address that notion. The black female body, if viewed under the lens of actual work, deconstructs and re-configures the image of women; literal strength, not figurative, and emotionally-specific moments. This work also looks at the perception of beauty.    Challenging the Color Line:Confronting Issues of Race and Class in the Era of Global Capitalism Friday, February 22 &amp; Saturday, February 23, 2002 On the occasion of W.E.B.

With events from September through December, Black Aesthetics 2001 addresses the full range of artistic expression and inquiry, including musical performances, panels for visual and performance artists to present and discuss their work, and a special focus series on life and culture in Mali. All programs are free to the public, and seating is on a first-come, first-served basis. The program is divided into two series: \u2022 Black Aesthetics 2001 Discussion Series \u2022 Between Tradition and Modernity: Mali in Perspective The aesthetic impulse is as old as humanity itself, and Africa, as the birthplace of humanity, has had its own part in shaping the human reality of aesthetics. Through the trans-Atlantic slave trade, African aesthetics were exported into the Western Hemisphere and into the world as a whole. Over one hundred years after the abolition of slavery in the Americas, and over forty years since the advent of contemporary African independence, African aesthetics are alive, well, and continually developing and evolving. Trail-blazing experimental techniques and processes were developed by the cultural activities of liberation movements, whether in exile or at home. The flowering of cultures of resistance and affirmation in the international Diaspora had a revolutionary influence on global expressive culture. In countries like Nigeria, Angola, Jamaica, Senegal, Cuba, Trinidad, Ghana, Burkina Faso, Mali, Brazil, and the United States, new concepts in literature, music, cinema, sculpture, and painting developed. From 1960 onwards, these concepts progressed to the degree where they are now a touchstone and reservoir for world culture.

Kelley     MALI IN PERSPECTIVE SCHEDULE OF EVENTS The Photography of Malick Sidib\u00e9 To the youth in Bamako, Malick Sidib\u00e9 was the James Brown of photography: the godfather whose themes described the total energy of the time. His photographs enable us to revisit the youth culture of the 1960s as it flowered in Bamako, showing exactly how the young people in Bamako had embraced rock and roll as a liberation movement, adopted the consumer habits of an international youth culture, and developed a rebellious attitude towards all forms of established authority. To say that Bamako\u2019s youth is on the same page as the youth in London and Paris in the 1960s and 1970s was also to acknowledge Malick Sidib\u00e9\u2019s role in shaping and expanding that culture. Inasmuch as today there is a desire to go back to the music and film of the 1960s and 1970s in order to give a meaning to that culture, we can also go back to his photographs to gain access to the style, vibrancy, and ethos of those times in Africa. Sidib\u00e9\u2019s photographs will be on display in the Institute through the semester. An Evening with Malick Sidib\u00e9 October 1st, 6:30pm Africana Studies Program 269 Mercer, Room 601 From the Mouth of the Crocodile: Fall, 2001 Artist-in-Residence, Habib Koit\u00e9 Habib Koit\u00e9 comes from a noble line of Khassonk\u00e9 griots, and his music draws upon the rich traditions of Mali as well as contemporary styles from other world cultures. He studied music for four years at the National Institute of Arts (NIA) in Bamako, through which he had the opportunity to work and play with a line-up of notable Malian musicians including Oumou Sangare and Toumani Diabat\u00e9. In 1988, Koit\u00e9 formed his own band, Bamada, which toured extensively throughout Mali. Winning first prize at the Perpignan Voxpole Festival in 1991 afforded him the chance to record the hugely successful single \u201cCigarette A Bana,\u201d which scored a major hit throughout West Africa. Following the release of his next single \u201cNanale,\u201d Koit\u00e9 was awarded the prestigious Discovery of 1993: Media-Adami Award by Radio France International (RFl). His album \u201cMuso Ko\u201d went straight to the top of the European World Music Charts, and was followed by the hugely successful \u201cMa-Ya,\u201d which spent an unprecedented 3 months at the top of the World Music Charts Europe. Koit\u00e9\u2019s newest album, \u201cBaro\u201d has just been released in the US by Putumayo records, and features Mali\u2019s king of the balafon, K\u00e9l\u00e9tigui Diabat\u00e9.

Winner of the Cannes Film Festival\u2019s Jury Prize in 1987, Ciss\u00e9\u2019s critically acclaimed films have helped to define contemporary African film as one of the most dynamic and visually stunning traditions in the world. A leading spokesperson for African cinema as an expression of cultural autonomy, Ciss\u00e9 began his film career as a projectionist after Mali gained its independence in 1960. In 1963 he received the first of several scholarships to study cinema in the Soviet Union at the State Institute of Cinema (VGIK), and after returning home in 1969, he made newsreels and documentaries for the Mali State Information Service. He released his first work of fiction in 1972, and 1987, he directed, wrote, and produced Yeelen, the mythic story of a power struggle between two magicians, hailed as \u201cthe best African film ever made.\u201d Yeelen November 9th, 6:30 pm Iris and B.
