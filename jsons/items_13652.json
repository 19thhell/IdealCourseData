The core courses in Applied Linguistics in the fall term emphasize three main research areas within the historical, political, and cultural context of the Spanish-speaking world: applied linguistic theories, second language teaching and acquisition, and translation studies. The other dimension of the core curriculum is the Research Skills Workshop (2 points) in the fall and the M.A. Thesis Seminar (2 points) in the spring. These courses are intended to provide all students with the necessary guidance to conceive, design, and complete post-graduate level research project on a topic of individual interest. The structure of the M.A. at NYU Madrid for the 2013-2014 academic year will be as follows: FALL 2014 Literary and Cultural Studies track:  Required Course I: A Cultural History of Spain (4 points, comprised of 3 modules each taught by a specialist) The multicultural Middle Ages Early modern bodies Modernization and the city  Required Course II: A Cultural History of Latin America (4 points, comprised of 3 modules each taught by a specialist) Transculturation and colonialism The Nation and its discontents Postmodernity, mass culture, and the media Applied Linguistics track:  Required Course I: Applied Linguistics: A Survey of Issues in the Study of Language, Language Learning, and Translation  (4 points, comprised of 3 modules each taught by a specialist) Pragmatic, social, and psychological aspects of the study of language Language learning: how its systems are cognitively internalized and taught Translation studies   Required Course II: History, Geography, and Politics of the Spanish Language (4 points) History of Spanish: From Latin to Castilian as a national and global language Geography of Spanish: Analysis of the varieties of Spanish today in Spain, Latin America, and the US Politics of Spanish: Debates and politics in relation to language diversity in Spain, Spanish America, and the US Additionally, all students take:  2 electives (4 points each)  Required Course III: Research Skills Workshop (2 points, separate sessions for each track are offered in alternate weeks) Students whose Language Placement score suggests that they would benefit from it are required to take the additional, non-credit bearing course to improve their Spanish. SPRING 2015 All students take:  3 electives (4 points each) (up to 2 may be taken at the Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de Madrid)  Required Course IV: M.A. Thesis Seminar (2 points, both tracks meet once every two weeks)  Required Component V: M.A. Thesis (0 points, graded P/F) M.A. CURRICULUM &amp; ELECTIVES Throughout the year, NYU Madrid offers courses in literary and cultural Studies, history and art history, linguistics, language acquisition and instruction, and translation studies. Along with two mandatory courses, the Research Skills Workshop (fall) and M.A. Thesis Seminar (spring), students choose from a range of 4-point electives. Students are encouraged to take an elective in the track other than the one they are studying. In the spring semester, approved students also have the opportunity to experience Spanish university life by taking 1-2 courses at the Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de Madrid, one of Spain\u2019s top universities. Working under an individual faculty advisor, all students complete an M.A. Thesis, a substantial work of independent research in their chosen area of study. All courses are taught by recognized scholars and experts in their fields, faculty members at NYU Madrid or a visiting professor from New York. Classes are typically small, taught as seminars with 5 to 10 students. Required courses will have all students in the same track, or 10-15 students in total. REQUIRED CURRICULUM IN LITERARY AND CULTURAL STUDIES \u201cA Cultural History of Spain\u201d and \u201cA Cultural History of Latin America\u201d, of 4 points each, consist of three thematically organized modules each, plus introductory and concluding sessions. They are designed to allow students to explore a wide range of cultural materials, including literature, visual culture, urban space, and historical and political texts. Both courses will emphasize issues of cultural identity, encouraging students to make connections between past debates and those of today. The approach is multidisciplinary, ranging across literature, performance studies, cultural studies, visual culture, and history. The objective of the course is to ensure that all students develop a high level of cultural literacy about the Spanish-speaking world. The third component of the mandatory curriculum is the \u201cResearch Skills Workshop\u201d. Taught in the Fall semester, this 2-point seminar introduces students to research skills relevant to their field of study. The course follows a workshop format, led by specialists, and encourages students to develop critical skills by engaging in peer review, and to explore for themselves Madrid\u2019s wealth of research resources. The fourth mandatory element is the \u201cM.A. Thesis Seminar\u201d. Taught in the spring semester, this seminar builds on the \u201cResearch Skills Workshop\u201d by allowing students to work together, under expert guidance, to develop their M.A. Project Proposal and start drafting the chapters of their thesis. The M.A. Thesis is the 5th and final required component of the curriculum, graded Pass/Fail by the faculty advisor. In this way, the mandatory curriculum accounts for 12 of the 32 points needed to complete the MA.  REQUIRED CURRICULUM IN APPLIED LINGUISTICS \u201cApplied Linguistics: A Survey of Issues in the Study of Language, Language Learning, and Translation\u201d, of 4 points, consists of three thematically organized modules each taught by a specialist in the field: 1) social and psychological aspects of the study of language, 2) foreign language teaching and acquisition, and 3) translation studies. The second requirement, \u201cHistory, Geography, and Politics of the Spanish Language\u201d, of 4 points, provides students with an overview of case studies on the Spanish language and its history (from Latin to Castilian as a national and global language), geography (analysis of the varieties of Spanish today in Spain, Latin America, and the US), and politics (debates and policies in relation to linguistic diversity in Spain, Spanish America, and the US). These core courses are designed to allow students to explore different linguistic areas as the basis for continued coursework in all three fields, as well as in a selection of related electives (pragmatics, phonetics, morphosyntax and lexicon, sociolinguistics and dialectology, pedagogy, translation, etc.). The third component of the mandatory curriculum is the \u201cResearch Skills Workshop\u201d. Taught in the Fall semester, this 2-point seminar introduces students to research skills relevant to their field of study. The course follows a workshop format, led by specialists, and encourages students to develop critical skills by engaging in peer review, and to explore for themselves Madrid\u2019s wealth of research resources. The fourth mandatory element is the \u201cM.A. Thesis Seminar\u201d. Taught in the spring semester, this seminar builds on the \u201cResearch Skills Workshop\u201d by allowing students to work together, under expert guidance, to develop their M.A. Project Proposal and start drafting the chapters of their thesis. The M.A. Thesis is the 5th and final required component of the curriculum, graded Pass/Fail by the faculty advisor. In this way, the mandatory curriculum accounts for 12 of the 32 points needed to complete the MA.  ELECTIVES With guidance from the M.A. Coordinator, students choose another five courses, which they must complete over the two semesters in order to meet the M.A. requirements. Students have the choice of taking either one 4-credit elective in the Fall and four in the Spring; or two 4-credit electives in the Fall and three in the Spring. (From Fall 2013, students will take two 4-credit electives in the Fall and three in the Spring.) Students are encouraged to take an elective in the other concentration in the spring term, which aims to foster interdisciplinary exchanges as students develop their M.A. projects.

As the program is conducted exclusively in Spanish, students are required to have excellent written and spoken Spanish skills and the ability to express themselves critically in the language. In order to ensure that our students will be successful completing all coursework in Spanish, we may, after the Skype or telephone admissions interview, recommend that a candidate take a course to improve their Spanish language skills before the MA program begins. On arrival in Madrid, students may be asked to take a Spanish Language test to identify language needs. The Writing Center at NYU Madrid is available to help students with identified language needs.  ACADEMIC CALENDAR The program begins in late August with a required orientation session, which introduces incoming students to resources offered in Madrid and on campus. Coursework is taken in two consecutive semesters, Fall and Spring, and culminates with the completion of the MA Thesis in mid July. Students are required to be physically present in Madrid in order to work closely with their faculty mentors until completion of the MA Thesis and all requirements.
