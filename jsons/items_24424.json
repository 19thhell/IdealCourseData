For more detailed information, please visit the website of NYU Steinhardt Study Abroad Summer 2014:    http://steinhardt.nyu.edu/global/programs/summer    2014 Special Workshops    Workshops for 2014 are TBD. 2013 workshops are shown below.    Kod&aacute;ly Curriculum: Developing Ideas and Applications Sarah St. Onge, Instructor Monday through Friday, July 8&ndash;12, 2013, 5:00&ndash;7:30 p.m. daily. Tuition: $250.00    This workshop is geared for Kod&aacute;ly-trained teachers who have been working in the field for a few years and would like to hone their lesson planning and curriculum development skills. Sarah will demonstrate and deconstruct a number of lesson plan models according to the needs of the participants. These models may include a methodology-based approach, a materials-first approach, a thematic approach, lessons geared for listening or instrumental activities, and/or for Special Education settings. Participants will have the opportunity to critique videotaped lessons and develop new lessons based on these ideas. Lessons will be constructed for a wide range of children's ages and skill levels. In addition, Sarah would like to provide support for teachers who are interested in working through a thorny issue in their practice or curriculum planning. Based on individual areas of interest and focus, teachers will try their hand at developing a new lesson plan technique, curriculum idea, or mode of practice, and present it on the final day of the program.     Solfege Seminar: Renewing the Ear David J. Xiques, Instructor Monday through Friday, July 8&ndash;12 July 2013, 12:30&ndash;2:00 p.m. daily. Tuition: $150.00    This workshop is directed toward Kod&aacute;ly graduates of the NYU Kod&aacute;ly Summer Institute or other training programs. Students will continue working with harmony approached through linear reading, arpeggiated chords and progressions sung in solfege, form and analysis, and structured listening. This seminar will be designed around one particular historical era or stylistic boundary.    Special Workshops Package    Both workshops may be taken together with Chorus, 2:00&ndash;3:00 p.m. Participants are invited to return to Chorus the final week and sing in the Kod&aacute;ly Concert, Friday, July 19, 2013, 7:00 p.m. The two workshops with Chorus are offered at the special tuition rate of $350.                      INTRODUCTION AND SUBJECT AREAS    KOD&Aacute;LY AND MUSIC EDUCATION    KOD&Aacute;LY LEVELS    SPECIAL WEEKEND AND EVENING ACTIVITIES    MASTERS DEGREE AND KOD&Aacute;LY AT NEW YORK UNIVERSITY    KOD&Aacute;LY FACULTY    APPLICATION INFO                   Introduction and Subject Areas    INTRODUCTION AND SUBJECT AREAS    New York University remains the only campus in metropolitan New York offering Kod&aacute;ly certification on a noncredit and graduate credit basis. Students who satisfactorily complete the course work in this program, which is spread over three summers, are eligible to receive certification endorsed by the Organization of American Kod&aacute;ly Educators for Kod&aacute;ly Levels 1, 2, and 3. Daily course work meets from 8:30 a.m. to 4:45 p.m. and is divided into the following seven subject areas:    Voice Pedagogy (daily, 30 minutes) offers students a thorough warm-up of the voice&mdash;the main musical medium in Kod&aacute;ly-based work. Students learn the physiology of the voice and techniques of posture, breath management, phonation, resonant tone production, diction, and expression. Students also explore activities to use in the classroom appropriate for young voices toward the goal of singing with confidence.    Solfege (daily, 75 minutes) develops a teacher's ability to use the tools of the Kod&aacute;ly concept&mdash;movable tonic solfege and rhythm syllables. These tools are used with the development of skills of conducting, inner hearing, dictation, improvisation, and part work. Solfege is divided into three levels.    Kod&aacute;ly Methodology (daily, 75 minutes) introduces the teacher to the philosophy and practice of a Kod&aacute;ly-based curriculum. Supportive traditional song (folk-song) literature, including singing games and dances, is explored toward helping students derive music comparatives (timbre/tone color/tone quality, dynamics, tempo, duration, pitch, texture), beat, rhythm, meter, pitch patterns, simultaneity, and form&mdash;music literacy. Listening experiences are included in this study. The transition to composed music is made. Students explore curriculum development by writing starting points, song lists, yearly flow charts, daily lesson plans, and activity plans (strategies). Kod&aacute;ly Methodology is divided into three levels.    Chorus (daily, 60 minutes) gives the student experience in choral performance. All choral repertory, much of it a cappella , is rehearsed for a performance at the end of the course.    Traditional (Folk) Materials and Research (daily, 60 minutes) offers the student experience in the areas of traditional (folk) song colleting and analysis and the relating of these skills to the ethnomusicological understanding of music as culture. Students from all three levels of the program meet together to focus on certain topics. Summer 2013 focuses on Culture Studies and World Musics in the Classroom 1: Africa, China, India, Indonesia, Ireland.    Choral Conducting (M, W, F, 75 minutes) offers the teacher the development and practice of choral conducting techniques, discovery of choral repertory, score strategies, and rehearsal planning. Students practice posture, beat patterns, and signals for expressive singing (dynamics and articulation). Cueing entrances and cut-offs in polyphonic music are studied. Choral Conducting is divided into three levels.    Recorder Pedagogy and Ensembles (TU, TH, 75 minutes, elective) introduces the teacher to the chest of recorders&mdash;an extension of the Kod&aacute;ly concept to instruments. Teachers become proficient in recorder technique, learn teaching practices, and explore ensemble music for performance.    KOD&Aacute;LY and Music Education    Following his folk-song collecting with B&eacute;la Bart&oacute;k in Hungary in the early 1900s, Zolt&aacute;n Kod&aacute;ly had a vision&mdash;a monumental idea that music, like language, could be taught artistically using the authentic traditional (folk) materials of any given culture. Gathering talented, creative teachers around him, Kod&aacute;ly developed a philosophy:    Music is the core of the curriculum. The ancient Greeks believed that music was at the center of all learning, because music was a natural synthesis of thinking, feeling, and moving.    The body&mdash;singing voice, body idiophones, and movement&mdash;is the best medium for making music. The body and the voice are custom made for every individual. Song and movement are united in traditional (folk) games and dances. Singing with confidence is a main goal.    Traditional (folk) musics leading to other musics are the best materials for becoming literate in Western music. Everyone has a mother tongue&mdash;the language spoken at home. The traditional (folk) music of that language should be the song source from which the facts and concepts of music literacy are drawn. In a complex culture, such as that in the United States, any music of a culture group or subculture group should be considered. In Kod&aacute;ly practice the repertory of materials should take four directions:       Preservation of authentic traditional (folk) songs of the native culture(s).    Exploration of musics of other cultures.    Bridging traditional (folk) songs with all styles of composed music.    Exploration of both historical and living traditions.       Music literacy is like language literacy. Everyone has the ability to hear, speak, read, and write a language. Therefore, everyone has the ability to hear, sing, read, and write music. Music literacy is something that everyone can and should enjoy. Music literacy is the first step of analysis toward the goal of musical understanding.    Quality music is the best material for teaching. Kod&aacute;ly believed that only the best music by the greatest composers and traditional (folk) music most representative of the culture are good enough for children.    Experiencing music&mdash;hearing, developing skills, preparing to derive concepts&mdash;cannot begin too early. Kod&aacute;ly said music training should begin \"nine months before the birth of the mother.\"    The Kod&aacute;ly philosophy has been adapted worldwide. Emphasis on the continuing upgrade of the teacher's own musicianship continues to be a strong feature of this movement. It is a living philosophy constantly being reshaped by research in how children learn music in cultural settings. Kod&aacute;ly's vision complements the emerging focus on world musics by today's music educators.    Levels    Level 1, Level 2, Level 3: Each Level takes one summer to complete&mdash;three summers for all three Levels. Each student receives a Letter of Course Work Completion for the successful completion of each Level. Successful completion of all three Levels (three summers , hopefully consecutive) earns a Kod&aacute;ly document from New York University.    KOD&Aacute;LY Study and New York City    New York City offers an exciting field to observe living traditional (folk) music and culture. Kod&aacute;ly students are invited to attend evening and weekend activities that explore various cultural scenes. Past fieldtrips have included visits to an Irish pub to listen to a seisi&uacute;n and to Brighton Beach to sample the Russian American experience&mdash;activities that situate traditional (folk) studies among living New Yorkers of the twenty-first century.    Special Weekend and Evening Activities       Two evening workshops in making materials for the Kod&aacute;ly-based classroom.    Lunchtime video reviews of Kod&aacute;ly-based lessons.    Picnic in Washington Square Park.    An evening at South Street Seaport to participate in sea chanties.    An afternoon in Chinatown to have dim sum.    An evening at O&rsquo;Neill&rsquo;s Pub to enjoy an Irish seisi&uacute;n.    Dinner on the Boardwalk at Brighton Beach to sample the Russian American experience followed by fun at Coney Island.    Closing Concert and Banquet.       Masters Study and KOD&Aacute;LY at New York University    Students matriculated in the department&rsquo;s in-service master&rsquo;s degree program in Teaching Music may take a three-course sequence as part of their program of study:       MPAME-GE.2146 : Music for Children: Kod&aacute;ly Level 1    MPAME-GE.2147 : Music for Children: Kod&aacute;ly Level 2    MPAME-GE.2148 : Music for Children: Kod&aacute;ly Level 3       For more information on master&rsquo;s degree programs please contact Dr. John Gilbert, Director of Music Education, Department of Music and Performing Arts Professions, New York University, telephone: (212) 998-5424, email: john.gilbert@nyu.edu .
