Drawing on eight Pater texts in a rich and lyrical essay, Kaiser\u2019s informative references to art, classics, history, philosophy, philology, poetry, physiology, gastronomy, and Eucharistic imagery produce an exceptionally fine close reading and provocative argument.&quot; Deborah Lutz's article, &quot;The Dead Still Among Us: Victorian Secular Relics and the Materiality of Death,&quot; ( Victorian Literature and Culture 39.1) has won the Best Article of 2011 prize from the Nineteenth-Century Studies Association.
