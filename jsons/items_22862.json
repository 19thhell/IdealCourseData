Description       Beyond Picture Perfect explores the many choices available to today\u2019s image makers. New technology combined with traditional photographic techniques will be addressed, enabling the students to realize their distinctive image-making vocabulary. Weekly discussions include understanding hardware mechanics, choosing a personal color palette, and recognizing \u201cyour\u201d unique composition key. We will debate the many analog and digital tools available to photographers vital to their artistic expression. These concepts will be supported by weekly assignments and class critiques culminating in a final project portfolio. Students with interest in analog or digital formats will be encouraged to develop an understanding of their medium and form an original visual strategy. Museum/ gallery visits and field trips for on-location photographing will inspire students to create their own way of seeing.

Brand measurement and management have gone through a drastic change with the advent of new media. We discussed best practices in measuring brand equity, and heard from brand professionals developing meaningful impact for their brands. We connected to explore a wide range of timely and relevant subjects including:   Measuring customer-based brand equity in the digital age;  Implementing and measuring mobile branding strategies;  New thinking on brand valuation methods;  The behavioral effects of branding in a social world;  Social intelligence and measuring brand sentiment;  Brands and religion. The day began with a welcome keynote from Brian Solis of The Altimeter Group, and author of &quot;What's The Future of Business? Changing the Way Businesses Create Experiences.&quot; We were also joined by representatives from Brand Finance; Interbrand; Vivaldi Partners; Nielsen; L2 Think Tank; Brand Keys; The Art of Branding; AT&amp;T; IBM; YouGov; Prophet; Landor Associates; NYU Stern School of Business; R.H. Smith School of Business at the University of Maryland; Goizueta Business School at Emory University; The Wharton School at The University of Pennsylvania; The University of Cologne; and more. The venue was held at NYU Stern School of Business in the heart of Greenwich Village.

Description       Beyond Picture Perfect explores the many choices available to today\u2019s image makers. New technology combined with traditional photographic techniques will be addressed, enabling the students to realize their distinctive image-making vocabulary. Weekly discussions include understanding hardware mechanics, choosing a personal color palette, and recognizing \u201cyour\u201d unique composition key. We will debate the many analog and digital tools available to photographers vital to their artistic expression. These concepts will be supported by weekly assignments and class critiques culminating in a final project portfolio. Students with interest in analog or digital formats will be encouraged to develop an understanding of their medium and form an original visual strategy. Museum/ gallery visits and field trips for on-location photographing will inspire students to create their own way of seeing. Readings may include selections from: Robert Adams,\u00a0 Why People Photograph \u00a0; London and Upton,\u00a0 Photography \u00a0.

Driven by the question, what does it mean to be happy in a digital world? , Akbari considers what the digital world seemingly offers (connection, identification, the chance to fashion multiple idealized selves or take part in armchair activism), while presenting the complications inherent in each of these digital acts.
