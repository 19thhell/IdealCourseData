Baroque:   The  Sovereign and the Law in German Tragedy (Gryphius to Kleist) Christiane Frey &amp; Guest Lecturer Slavoj Zizek  What is the relationship between sovereignty and the law? Is the law  sovereign? Or does it owe its legitimacy to the sovereignty that institutes it?  In the early modern era, these issues are subject to new scrutiny and  negotiation on at least three levels: politics or political theology (as it is  depicted in drama); poetics and the law of genre (as it is realized in the  writing of drama); and \u201cphilosophy of nature,\u201d in which the notion of modern  science emerges from a new concept of the laws of nature. The course explores  the relationship of law to sovereignty in all three of these domains with an  emphasis on the first. We will ask what drama has to say about the nature of  law and how drama\u2019s relationship to the law of genre lends it a unique status  in the discourse on law and sovereignty. Plays from Andreas Gryphius\u2019s baroque  tragedy Leo Armenius to Kleist\u2019s Prinz Friedrich von Homburg ;  source texts from the history of science; literary and political theory  from Aristotle to Benjamin, Derrida, and Roberto Esposito. Discussion in  English; reading knowledge of German required.   GERM-GA1650 T 3:30 - 6:10; This course meets from 9/2 through 9/30. Visual  Culture: Series, Repetition, Seriality. Where literature meets quality t.v.  Elisabeth Bronfen  Matthew Weiner\u2019s Mad Men not only  uses the literature of the 1960s as one of its frames of reference but also  picks up on the claim to moral imagination for which the Victorian novel is  famous. While much has been made of the analogy between the serialization of  fiction in periodicals and the t.v. series format, this block seminar will  explore the thematic and rhetorical implications of repetition and seriality on  which such a comparison is also predicated. How does seriality appear in both  19th century fiction and early 21st century quality t.v. as a thematic concern?  How do the plethora of individual portraits produced by a serialized text also  form a network of relations that offer up a coherent whole? What rhetorical  strategies does each text deploy so as to call forth both intellectual and  affective empathy? What imaginary community is thus produced? We will use  Freud\u2019s psychoanalytic discussion of repetition along with Deleuze\u2019s comment on  this as our theoretical frame for a crossmapping that brings Eliot\u2019s Middlemarch and Keller\u2019s Leute von Seldwyla into conversation  with the first two seasons of Mad Men .  Since all three texts are long, please begin with the reading/viewing well in  advance.  GERM-GA1115 W 3:30 \u2013 6:10  Origins  of Critical Thought I: \u201cTrag\u00f6die im Sittlichen\u201d (Kant \u2013 Schiller \u2013 Hegel)  Eckart Goebel  This seminar, conducted in German, discusses key texts on ethics from  around 1800. We begin with Kant\u2019s Grundlegung zur Metaphysik der Sitten,  and his Anthropologie in pragmatischer Hinsicht. We will then read  two of Schiller\u2019s essays (\u00dcber Anmut und W\u00fcrde and \u00dcber das Erhabene),  reflecting on Kant\u2019s thought. The remaining sessions will be used to  reconstruct Hegel\u2019s concept of a \u201cTrag\u00f6die im Sittlichen\u201d as it has been  developed in his early anti-Kantian essay \u00dcber die wissenschaftlichen  Behandlungsarten des Naturrechts. A more refined understanding of the \u201cTrag\u00f6die  im Sittlichen\u201d requires a careful reading of the reflections on tragedy Hegel  unfolds in his Ph\u00e4nomenologie des Geistes and in his Vorlesungen \u00fcber  die \u00c4sthetik. In order to prepare this seminar, a reading of the tragedies  Hegel is referring to, is highly recommended: Aeschylus\u2019 Eumenides,  Sophocles\u2019 Antigone, Shakespeare\u2019s Hamlet, Schiller\u2018s Wallenstein , and Goethe\u2019s Faust I. Origins of Critical Thought II, dealing with post-Kantian  'Philosophical Anthropology' (Plessner, Gehlen, Heidegger, Adorno, Freud,  Blumenberg) will take place in Spring 2015.       GERM-GA1512 W 6:20 \u2013 8:20 Kafka  Friedrich Ulfers  The course will deal with Kafka\u2019s work largely in the light of the author\u2019s  preoccupation with language, particularly with the way this preoccupation  affected his writing, indeed provided the topic of it. The point of departure  will be the experience of \u201clanguage crisis\u201d among intellectuals and writers in  turn of the century Austria, which led to the radical criticism of conceptual  or referential language\u2013 already foreshadowed by Nietzsche \u2013 of Fritz Mauthner  and Ludwig Wittgenstein, among others. The course will then show Kafka\u2019s  response to this crisis: his insight that conceptual/referential language and  oppositional/binary involves an abstraction of the \u201ctruth\u201d or the \u201creal,\u201d which  is only apprehensible in a space of radical undecidability between opposites,  demanding a language of irreducible allusiveness, a language that is constitutive  of Kafka\u2019s texts.  GERM-GA2610 R 1:30 - 4:20  Special  Topics in Theory - Unpacking Derrida\u2019s Library: The Secret to the Archive  Avital Ronell  Marking the tenth anniversary of Derrida\u2019s death, this course revisits  Derrida\u2019s library in order to suggest that his texts are more valuable today  than ever before. His library may even be a space for reading and writing  that\u2014dominated by texts that no longer correspond only to the \u201cbook\u201d form, and  by a corpus that exceeds the library that would contain it\u2014touches on the  entirety of the world. Open 24 hours a day, every day of the year, it forces  us, in Derrida\u2019s words, \u201cinto a delirium of reading\u201d that reads us as much as  it teaches us to read\u2014actively, historically, politically, and ethically. The  course will provide an opportunity to remember several of his lessons\u2014about  philosophy, literature, history, politics, religion, economics, ideology, law,  rights, nationalism, racism, colonialism, the media, university institutions,  capitalism, rogue states, the war on terror, justice, responsibility, language,  friendship, love, life, death, and, mourning\u2014all of which are more urgent and  necessary than ever before. It should never be said\u2014as so many have, and will  no doubt continue to say\u2014that his work did not engage history and politics,  that his work retreated from what remains most important to us. From the  beginning he proceeded in the conviction that his philosophical activity did  not require a political or ethical practice because it already was, from the  start, an ethico- political practice. This course takes place at Princeton  University. Students should enroll through the Inter-University Doctoral  Consortium.  GERM-GA3000 TBD Independent Research  GERM-GA3100-001  ENGL-GA3629-001 (Course originating in English  Department)  W 6:20 \u2013 8:20; 244 Greene Street, Room 306     Politics in  Deconstruction  Geoffrey Bennington   Taking its lead from some of Derrida\u2019s later work,  this course will set off again from Aristotle\u2019s famous characterization of man  as a zoon politikon, and follow the threads of sovereignty and democracy  through some of the great texts of political philosophy in the Western  tradition. We shall attempt to understand why both of these notions pose such  problems for that tradition, and give rise to all manner of complications and  paradoxes, which turn out to be definitive of the conceptual space of the  political as such. We shall wonder why almost all traditional political  philosophers are enamored of sovereignty, while almost none has anything very  good to say about democracy. We shall consider the possibility of a non-trivial  affinity between the political, the rhetorical, the literary, and animality in  their constant tendency to exceed conceptual grasp, and also compare our  deconstructive approach to these political questions with some other  contemporary theories. Classic authors to be discussed will include Plato, Aristotle,  Machiavelli, Bodin, Hobbes, Spinoza, Rousseau, Kant, Hegel and Schmitt; more  recent theorists to be considered alongside Derrida may include Agamben,  Badiou, Foucault, Hardt and Negri, Lyotard, Mouffe and Ranci\u00e8re.  GERM-GA1221-001 MEDI-GA 2100-003 (Course originating in MARC) T, R 11:00-12:15pm   Dawn  Songs in Middle High German Literature  Jessica Quinlan   Ow\u00ea, nu ist  ez tac! A scenario describing the pain experienced by  lovers who must part at daybreak seems to have been the subject of lyrical  reflection the world over from well before the time of Christ. In the European  Middle Ages, the dawn song ( Tagelied )  enjoyed particular popularity in the German tradition. It depicts scenes of awakening,  lamentation and farewell, couched as narrative action with dialogue. Between  the 12th and 15th centuries, this pattern is repeated,  redrawn and almost endlessly varied; the subject of the dawn song is recreated,  inverted, parodied and removed to a spiritual level. The primary texts will be  read in their original language; in addition to the discussion of the place of  the dawn song in medieval German literature, therefore, this course seeks to  offer participants the opportunity to develop and enhance reading skills in  Middle High German.       SPRING 2014   GERM-GA1219  - The Information  Society: Planetarity (Taught in German)  - Hans-Christian  von Herrmann  \"I  propose the planet to overwrite the globe.\" This statement can be found in  Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak's 2003 book \"Death of a Discipline\", which  brings up the concept of \"planetarity\" as a description of a  post-global, post-national and post-colonial world, interconnected and  differentiated by electronic information systems. But \"planetarity\"  has a history that is older than what is called the information age today and  that leads back to Weimar Germany. So the seminar will follow up the traces of  \"planetarity\" in Walter Benjamin's \"Einbahnstra\u00dfe\" (1928)  and Ernst J\u00fcnger's \"Der Arbeiter\" (1932) afterwards moving on to the  writings of Martin Heidegger, Kostas Axelos and Wilfrid Desan. By doing so the  seminar's objective is to discuss \"planetarity\" as a theoretical  approach emerging from the crisis of modernity and envisioning a post-modern  culture totally shaped by technology.       GERM-GA3610  (COLIT-GA2155; POET-GA2002) - Topics  in Early Modern Written Culture: Literary Matter - The Lucretian Tradition  on European Modernity - Jacques  Lezra   GERM-GA3100  (COLIT-GA2300) - Studies in Prose  Genres: J.M. Coetzee &amp; Metafiction - Mark Sanders       When  J.M. Coetzee received the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2003, he stunned the  Swedish Academy in Stockholm by presenting not the customary lecture, but a  story. In this tale, entitled \u201cHe and His Man,\u201d Robinson Crusoe sends reports  to his \u201cman,\u201d whom Coetzee\u2019s audience recognizes as being Daniel Defoe, since  the reports appear to come from books authored by Defoe. The relationship of  character and author is turned inside out, in an exciting metafictional  performance that also places in question the conventional boundaries of the  lecture. The Swedish audience should not have been stunned, however, for some  of J.M. Coetzee\u2019s most recent novels, Summertime, Slow Man, and Elizabeth  Costello have, in different ways, foregrounded the mechanics of fiction-making  typically concealed by the realist novel. Concentrating on these works, as well  as Coetzee\u2019s early novels, in which metafiction is the dominant mode for  interrogating colonial literary genres, and drawing comparisons with the  fiction of Italo Calvino, Alain Robbe-Grillet, and Zo\u00eb Wicomb, while at the  same time availing ourselves of relevant narrative theory (Mieke Bal, Roland  Barthes) and critical commentary (Attwell, Attridge, Spivak, Wicomb), the  seminar will explore the aesthetic, ethical and political implications of a  writer putting the inner workings of his or her craft on open display. The  seminar will culminate with a roundtable on Coetzee\u2019s enigmatic new novel, The  Childhood of Jesus.  GERM-GA2703 - Poetics &amp; Theory Seminar:  Autofiction: Writing the Self (Taught in German) - Emine Sevgi \u00d6zdamar  &amp; Alys George       Autobiographical  writing has evolved into a highly controversial issue in contemporary literary  theory. Every constituent of the term has become problematic: the \u201cauto\u201d of a  sovereign ego and an undivided persona; the \u201cbios\u201d relating to a culturally  encoded life; the \u201cgraphein\u201d (\u03b3\u03c1\u03b1\u03c6\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd), which registers problems of  mediality. Serge Doubrovsky coined the term \u201cautofiction\u201d in the late  1970s in an attempt to address these vicissitudes of autobiography as a genre.  How  can we distinguish between autobiography and fiction? Can works of literature  be reliable archives of individual and collective memory? Can they be authentic  expressions of our lives at all? We will consider writing that invites and  engages these questions. In addition to Emine Sevgi \u00d6zdamar\u2019s work,  we will read texts by Else Lasker-Sch\u00fcler, Charlotte Salomon, Roland Barthes,  Thomas Bernhard, Herta M\u00fcller, and Thomas Glavinic.       GERM-GA2912  (COLIT-GA2912) -  Literature  &amp; Philosophy: POETS TAKE PHILOSOPHY:  H\u00f6lderlin~Heidegger~Celan~Derrida  - Avital Ronell  The  course will dwell on the poetry of H\u00f6lderlin and Celan with an eye to the  critical works of Heidegger, Adorno, Benjamin, Derrida, Lacoue-Labarthe. There  will be two separate workshops led by Kevin McLaughlin (Brown Univ.) and Werner  Hamacher (Frankfurt) in addition to possible visits by Ulrich Baer and  Richard Sieburth. Expect intense and staggeringly beautiful work to come out of  this.       GERM-GA3000 - Independent Research    FALL  2013     GERM-GA1110  -Theory of Art: Aby Warburg - Christopher  Wood        Aby  Warburg (1866-1929) was an art historian who worked outside the academic  establishment, building a prodigious private library and research center that  mapped a new field of study: the persistence of the ancient pagan world  into modernity, conceived as an ongoing psychic event. Exposed to what he  experienced as a relentless barrage of expressive images of passion\u2014\u201cpathos  formulas\u201d\u2014mediating archaic trauma, Warburg sought but could not find relief in  the promise of aesthetic sublimation. The seminar will pose one central  question which bears on the larger problems of communication (between subjects,  between past and present) under the conditions of modernity: is Warburg\u2019s  pathos formula best understood as an image, a symbol, a symptom, a metaphor, a  talisman, an avatar, a memory, or a packet of psychic energy?  His  person, his library (which was transported from Hamburg to London in 1933 and  survives intact), and his gnomic writings serve as a crossroads where many  paths of thought meet, throughout the twentieth century and into our  own. The seminar will relocate Warburg among the thinkers who  shaped him, including Darwin, Nietzsche, Burckhardt, and Usener; relate him to  the art history of his day as practiced by Schlosser, Riegl, W\u00f6lfflin,  Schmarsow, and Panofsky; coordinate his thought with the biological sciences,  early anthropology, the study of archaic ritual and religion, the spheres of  modern ornament, design, and dance, the emergence of the technological media  including cinema, and the Husserlian \u201ccrisis of the sciences\u201d; and finally  consider his reception by Cassirer, Benjamin, Gombrich, Ginzburg, Agamben, and  Didi-Huberman. Reading of knowledge of German required.        GERM-GA1700  - Romanticism: Drives of Romanticism, 1900/1800 - Elisabeth Bronfen &amp; Leif  Weatherby  (1)  To participate in the celebration of the Wagner year, the first part of the  seminar will look at unconventional traces of both his libretti and scores in  Classic Hollywood. At issue, as we look at Tristan and Isolde, Tannh\u00e4user and  Holl\u00e4nder, is both the obsession with the psychological struggle between law  and desire as well as the redemption death is claimed to afford. What also  drives this crossmapping, however, is the wager that in the 20th century cinema  appropriates but also signficiantly refigures Wagner's Gesamtkunstwerk  project  (2)  From here, the course will go back to the future, focusing on German  Romanticism and its re-readings in philosophy of technology in the 20th and  21st centuries. Here we will read Hoffmann with Kittler, H\u00f6lderlin with  Heidegger, Novalis with Blumenberg, and others. The complementary  wager of the second part of the course is that the pretense of  Romantic art--post-revolutionary, \"post\"-Enlightenment--has a great  deal to do with the end of the so-called \"techne-physis analogy.\" If  \"technology\" was freed from its metaphysical moorings in the long  18th century, then how does it anticipate later Romantic aesthetics, and what  might it have to say about our contemporary situation?  GERM-GA1842  - Nietzsche\u2019s Impact on 20th Century Thought - Friedrich Ulfers  The  objective of the seminar is to show how Nietzsche revolutionized Western  philosophy by transforming its dualistic-metaphysical worldview into a holistic  one that corresponds to the reality of the world as one interrelated,  processual whole. It will also show how this transformation influenced  significantly what is known as \u201cContinental Philosophy,\u201d which includes such  figures as Heidegger, Derrida, and Deleuze.  Particular  attention will be paid to the meaning of Nietzsche\u2019s pronouncement that \u201cGod is  dead\u201d; his declaration that the world is \u201cWill to Power \u201d and an \u201caesthetic  phenomenon\u201d; and his idea of \u201cEternal Recurrence.\u201d Also discussed will be the  role language plays in Nietzsche\u2019s view on epistemology and ontology, his  revaluation of morality, and his influence on the arts.       GERM-GA2610 - Special Topics in Theory: What\u2019s  Happening? EVENT in Philosophy, Literature, Psychoanalysis - Avital Ronell  A  sequel to last year\u2019s seminar on Derrida, et. al. and the Event, we will  explore motifs such as love and catastrophe in exemplary literary and  philosophical texts. Students are urged to have read thoroughly at  least one book by the instructor in preparation for outstanding discussions.       GERM-GA3000 - Independent Research - Avital  Ronell   SPRING  2013  GERM-GA1116  - Origins of Critical Thought II:Renaissance and Modernity  (Seminar and Texts in German) - Eckart Goebel  This  seminar examines modern texts dealing with the legacy of the European  Renaissance. We will read works by Walter Pater, Jacob Burckhardt, Ernst  Kantorowicz, Erwin Panofsky, and Hans Blumenberg.Participation in this class  does not require previous attendance of the fall 2012 seminar on Renaissance  &amp; Reformation. In preparation, it might be useful, however, to study some  of the texts, with which the authors mentioned above are dealing, such as  Shakespeare\u2019s King Richard the Second .  GERM-GA1219  - The Information Society: By Chance \u2013 Literature and Mathematics - Hans-Christian von Herrmann       In  E.A. Poe's 1844 short story \"The purloined letter\" private  investigator Auguste Dupin is able to close the case because he is gifted with  a certain talent which is in fact an amalgam of a poetic and a mathematical  attitude towards the world. The seminar's ambition is to decipher this  mysterious mindset by consulting Jacques Lacan's famous reading of Poe's text  including its detour in the fields of information theory and cybernetics. In a  second step the seminar will pass on to other literary texts by Heinrich von  Kleist, Jorge Luis Borges and Hans Magnus Enzensberger in order to follow up  the traces of the modern interplay of literature and mathematics.  GERM-GA1698  - Photography and the World: Theories of Photography from the Medium\u2019s  Inception to the Present -   Ulrich Baer        We  live in an illustrated world, and photographs often determine political,  personal, and even the most private of decisions. Who is guilty and who is  exonerated; who gets elected and who loses the vote; who and what we favor or  despise, will get to know, desire, remember or forget depends on how someone or  something has been presented in a photograph. Today more images are produced  daily than in the entire history of photography from 1839 until the mass  production of digital cameras. There is great danger in this development and  immense potential to free ourselves from existing constraints, too. The skills  required to interpret photographs is related to our capacity of gauging the  role of images in our imagination. It behooves us to know how to turn the  current plethora of pictures into tools with which to shape the world we share  with others.  This  interdisciplinary seminar explores how photographic images create meaning, and  how thinkers have responded to photography \u2013 as a phenomenon to be reckoned  with lest it overwhelms our critical faculties. How do we make sense of the  ways in which photographs shape our experience of being in the world \u2013 and how  do we shape our own lives amidst this flood of images? What does the world  mean, in a photograph, and how do we distinguish this meaning from the world  outside of photography? What is the relation between meaning, photography, and  a worldview? Is it possible to experience someone\u2019s else\u2019s world through  photographs? What is the relation between worlds and worldviews, and what role  do images play in this relationship?       We  will read theoretical and other texts on visuality and photography (Baudelaire,  Kracauer, Panofsky, Benjamin, Barthes, Sontag, Batchen, Derrida, Flusser,  Cadava, Ranci\u00e8re, Enwezor, and others), and look at a wide range of photographs  from the inception of the medium to the present to test theories of photography  against the medium\u2019s uncanny and unrivaled power to evoke the real.  GERM-GA2703 - Poetics and Theory Seminar: Short  Fiction ( Seminar and Texts in German) - Katja Lange-M\u00fcller &amp;  Alys George  This  comparative seminar traces the \u201cmigration\u201d of short fiction between Germany and  America. It also focuses on how literary markets and the economy of production  have shaped the economy of form. From its beginnings in the European novella (Boccaccio)  and the German literary Kalendergeschichte (Hebel, Kleist), short fiction made  its way to America and was transformed with the flourishing of the short story  in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The conventions of the American  short story then took hold in Germany, where they have influenced postwar  literature to the present. We look, finally, at flash fiction/microfiction and  toward the future of short(est) fiction. Our focus is on close textual  analysis, and authors will be paired, e.g.: Twain and Hebel; Poe and Kafka;  Hemingway and Rothmann; Melville and Kleist; McCullers and Hermann; Carver and  Schulze. We also consider classification debates in theoretical essays by  Schlegel, James, O\u2019Connor, Lange-M\u00fcller, and Oates.  After  the spring recess acclaimed writer and Bachmann-Preis-winner Katja Lange-M\u00fcller  will co-teach the seminar and will discuss role of short fiction in the German  and American literary traditions, as well as her own work in the form. Non-NYU  students who wish to audit the second portion of the course only are welcome.    FALL  2012  GERM-GA.1004  - Image and Text: Psychic Visuality \u2013 E.T.A. Hoffmann and Hitchcock - Elizabeth Bronfen  Hitchcock,  who was on the set in Babelsberg Studios (Berlin) in 1924 when Murnau filmed The  Last Man , brought the demonic screen expressionist film had perfected in  Weimar Germany to Hollywood in 1940, and with it a legacy of the German  romantic Nachtst\u00fcck . This block seminar will cross map three films from  his mature period \u2013 Vertigo , Rear Window and Psycho \u2013 onto  novellas by E.T.A. Hoffmann, in an attempt to reconstruct this line of  association. At issue is the manner in which both the Gothic novella and the  Hollywood thriller engage a visualization of psychic disorders. A second point  of connection is that both artists are great technicians who offer  self-reflexive commentaries on their respective medium. Finally, as masters of  aesthetic artifice, both pit intense emotions against textual play, with  Hoffmann's romantic irony reflected and refracted in Hitchcock's dark humor.   GERM-GA.1115  - Origins of German Critical Thought I: Renaissance &amp; Reformation I - Eckart Goebel    This  course offers an introduction to key texts from the 15th and 16th  centuries. Since each of the complex works we read provides so many insights  that one could organize an entire class around any one of them, the goal is  merely to make first contact with the world of Renaissance and Reformation. The  research interest I pursue with this class is the \u2018history of the soul\u2019 in  early modernity as well as the history of melancholia. The reading load is  admittedly high, and it might be even useful to have, in addition, a closer  look at some seminal works from Greek and Roman antiquity over the summer, such  as Plato\u2019s Symposium , Aristoteles\u2019 De Anima , Cicero\u2019s De  Officiis , his Tusculanae Disputationes , and St. Augustine\u2019s Confessiones .  We will read all texts in English translations.  I  intend to continue this class in spring with a seminar on the reception of  Renaissance &amp; Reformation in modernity from Goethe, Burckhardt, and  Nietzsche to Cassirer, Panofsky, and Kantorowicz.

We will explore political works,  psychoanalysis, music, and film. Expect sparks.  GERM-  GA.3000 - Independent Research        GERM-GA.1512  - Kafka - Friedrich Ulfers  The  course will deal with Kafka\u2019s work largely in the light of the author\u2019s  preoccupation with language, particularly with the way this preoccupation  affected his writing, indeed provided the topic of it.       The  point of departure will be the experience of \u201clanguage crisis\u201d among  intellectuals and writers in turn of the century Austria, which led to the  radical criticism of conceptual or referential language\u2013 already foreshadowed  by Nietzsche \u2013 of Fritz Mauthner and Ludwig Wittgenstein, among others.  The  course will then show Kafka\u2019s response to this crisis: his insight that  conceptual/referential language and oppositional/binary involves an abstraction  of the \u201ctruth\u201d or the \u201creal,\u201d which is only apprehensible in a space of radical  undecidability between opposites, demanding a language of irreducible  allusiveness, a language that is constitutive of Kafka\u2019s texts.       In  the context of this undecidability and allusivesness, which Kafka attributes to  his \u201cdreamlike inner life\u201d that he claims informs his writing, his becoming  \u201cliterature,\u201d Freud\u2019s The Interpretation of Dreams will be used as a  reference. In this work Freud asserts that many psychological \u201cprocesses which  are described as irrational are not in fact falsification of normal  processes\u2014intellectual errors\u2014but are modes of activity of the psychical  apparatus that have been freed from an inhibition\u201d (Freud 644), and that in  dream thinking, \u201cEach train of thought is almost invariably accompanied by its  contradictory counterpart, linked with it by antithetical association\u201d (Freud  346). It will be shown that Kafka\u2019s texts are suffused with this kind of  thinking, a thinking that allows opposites to coexist as a both/and that never  achieves resolution. As Freud puts it: \u201cBoth of the alternatives [of a logical  opposition] are usually inserted in the text of the dream as though they were  equally valid\u201d (Freud 351).  Another  context in which Kafka\u2019s writing will be read in this seminar is that of  contemporary Continental Philosophy, especially the texts of Deleuze and  Derrida that have interpreted Kafka\u2019s writing in terms of the alterity of a  \u201cminor literature\u201d and the putting in question of judgment and the law,  respectively.       The  seminar will then deal with Kafka\u2019s insight into the inherent violence involved  in any conceptual understanding, in relation to which literature, that is,  poetic or radically metaphorical language functions as a countermeasure in that  it has the capacity of \u201cun-judging\u201d the real, leaving us with texts that  constitute an embrace of infinite relationality and the concomitant  undecidability.  Finally,  we will look at Kafka\u2019s writing in terms of the possibility of embodying an  inherent ethical aspect insofar as it constitutes freedom from truth as  the tyranny of univocity and teleology towards the truth of an  a-topical, endlessly de-territorializing and metamorphosing world. As such,  this truth is always already other in relation with itself, and thus ethical in  its irreducible self-less-ness, its inherent openness to, and interrelatedness  with, the other. It would be the ethical structure of the \u201cgiven\u201d - not the  anthropomorphically instrumentalized world - in which its interpenetrating  parts exist \u201cpoetically,\u201d as metamorphic units that constitute an \u201cethics of  alterity,\u201d that is, an irreducible responsiveness and responsibility to the  other as other.   SPRING 2012  GERM-GA.1698 \u2013 Photography and the  World - Ulrich Baer          GERM-GA.1720 \u2013 Echoes of Antiquity:  Translatio Romae - Barbara Vinken  Marx remarked in his 18 brumaire of  Napol\u00e9on Bonaparte , History comes always back twice: first as tragedy, than  as farce. Roughly up to the beginning of the 20th century Europe and the United  States told and thought their History in terms of antique History that was a  basso continuo to all political conflicts and imperial enterprises. Our focus  will not be on Greek, but on Roman History. In the United States, as well as in  France, Germany and Italy, political realities were spelled out in Roman terms.  If most people agreed that History is nothing but a repetion of Roman History,  it is very much a question if this is a blessing or a curse. And what Roman  History comes back? Is the Roman Republic restored, are the civil wars coming  back, or are people to live in an Empire sine fine? It is in literary texts  that these questions are most subtly asked and answered. The most interesting  and influential texts like Schiller, Kleist, Leopardi, Hugo, Baudelaire,  Flaubert, and James will be submitted to a close reading in order to disclose  their hidden Roman intertexts.       GERM-GA.2703 \u2013 Poetics and Theory  Seminar: Literature &amp; Film (Taught in English) - Daniel Kehlmann and Eckart Goebel  The seminar investigates the  transformations literary texts undergo when they are turned into feature films.  The seminar also addresses the consequences the invention of film had for  writing: Is the potential of \u2018filmability\u2019 always inscribed in literature, and  if so, what exactly does \u2018filmability\u2019 mean?       The trajectory of this class leads us  from classics such as Schloendorff\u2019s acclaimed adaptation of Musil\u2019s early  novel The Confusions of Young Toerless to the new movie based on Oscar  Wilde\u2019s notorious novel The Picture of Dorian Gray of 2009. After the  spring recess acclaimed author Daniel Kehlmann will co-teach the seminar, and  will discuss with us not only No Country for Old Men and Radetzky March   but also his own novels Fame and Measuring the World ,  currently produced as films. Daniel Kehlmann will discuss his film scripts with  us, which will provide us with new insights into the relation of film and  literature.  Students from outside NYU, who prefer  to audit the second part of this seminar only, are welcome to do so.          GERM-GA.1513 \u2013 Bertolt Brecht - Robert Cohen  Brecht's oeuvre can be read as a  radical critique of philosophical, theoretical, political, economic, and  aesthetic discourses from Aristotle to Marx, Luk\u00e1cs, and Benjamin. It is a work  forever in progress, a collection of unstable and endlessly revised texts  exploring the human condition in a time of class struggle, violence, and war.       The Seminar is conceived as a general  introduction to Brecht's work. Topics include the experience of the modern  metropolis; the disintegration of social and sexual relations; the destruction  of identity and the construction of a 'collective individuality;' Brecht's  Marxism and his contribution to a new dialectics; Brecht and the Weimar  avant-garde.  Discussions based on close readings of  poetry, plays, prose, and theoretical writings will focus on the way meaning is  produced through Brecht's performative and gestural (\"Gestus\") use of  language; as well as through his use of modernist literary techniques such as  montage, fragmentation, and distanciation/alienation (\"Verfremdung\").       GERM-GA.3000  \u2013 Independent Research    FALL 2011  GERM-GA.1410 - Goethe: Eros and  Thanatos: Goethe\u2019s Psychology - Eckart  Goebel  Aus schwer erfindlichen Gr\u00fcnden gilt  Goethe zuweilen als \u201anaiv\u2018.       Das Seminar studiert, in Abwandlung  eines Titels von Max Kommerell \u00fcber - Schiller, \u201aGoethe als Psychologe\u2018.  Gelesen werden bekannte Texte des Dichters im Hinblick auf das in ihnen  \u00fcberreich ausgebreitete Wissen um die Seele des Menschen.  For not really convincing reasons  Goethe is regarded here and there as being \u2018naive.\u2018 In reaction to this cliche  this seminar studies, \u2018Goethe as psychologist.\u2018 We will re-read famous texts in  order to learn about Goethe\u2019s abysmal knowledge concerning the human soul, and  its vissicitudes.       GERM-GA.1650: Visual Culture:  Configurations of the Night   - Elisabeth Bronfen  Night is a double of the day, a comment  on diurnal activities, a counter site to the ordinary. It prompts a thinking  closer to imagination than reason. While philosophy's theoria is based  on the promise of bringing illumination, and as such is of and for   the day, literature and visual arts engage a nocturnal side of knowledge. This  course will cross map theory's tropic use of night onto aesthetic enactments of  the night as a stage and state of mind. Looking at the way both sustain the  antagonism between days' reason and night's magical thinking we will read  Mozart's Magic Flute with Foucault's \"piece of night each carries  within,\"; Shakespeare's Midsummer Night's Dream with Freud's  \"navel of the dream\"; Schnitzler's \"Dream Novella\" with  Hegel's \"night of the world\"; Scorsese's Taxi Driver with  Blanchot's \"autre nuit\".       GERM-GA.2610 - Special Topics in Theory:  The Debilitated Subject - Avital  Ronell and Slavoj Zizek  GERM-GA. 1842 - Nietzsche\u2019s Impact on  20th Century Thought - Friedrich  Ulfers       Objective of the seminar: The objective  of the seminar is to show how Nietzsche revolutionized Western philosophy by transforming  its dualistic-metaphysical worldview into a holistic one that corresponds to  the reality of the world as one interrelated whole. It will also show how this  transformation influenced significantly what is known as \"Continental  Philosophy,\" which includes such figures as Heidegger, Derrida, and  Deleuze.  Particular attention will be paid to  the meaning of Nietzsche\u2019s pronouncement that \"God is dead,\" his  declaration that the world is \"Will to Power\" and an \"aesthetic  phenomenon,\" and his idea of \"Eternal Recurrence.\" Also  discussed will be the role language plays in Nietzsche\u2019s view on epistemology  and ontology, his revaluation of morality and his influence on the arts.       GERM-GA.3000 \u2013 Independent Research  SPRING 2011  G51.1655: Archive, Image,  Text - Ulrich Baer, Shelley  Rice   G51.1116: Origins of  Critical Thought II: Heidegger and Adorno - Eckart  Goebel  The course, conducted in German, offers  a slow line-by-line reading of Martin Heidegger\u2019s book on Sein und Zeit from  1926. Halfway through the semester, we will start a close reading of Th. W.  Adorno\u2019s Negative Dialektik from 1966, focusing mainly on Adorno\u2019s  Heidegger-critique. The course is intended to provide students with strong  theoretical interests, a detailed knowledge of two seminal texts of 20th  century thought. Finally, we might also consult Max Horkheimer\u2019s Eclipse of  Reason , however, that will be determined at a later date.  G51.2703: Poetics &amp;  Theory Seminar: Writing Animals -  Marcel Beyer  This seminar examines \"writing  animals\" in a dual sense: both animals that write and the writing on  animals. At stake is the animal as a figure of imagination, of the work of  imagination in the creative process.        G51.1945: Post-World War II  Mordernism: Max Frisch and Peter Weiss - Robert Cohen  Max Frisch and Peter Weiss were key  figures in the reconstitution of (West-) German post-World War II litera\u00adture,  though \u2013 or maybe because \u2013 neither was German. Their works are both  paradigmatic of, and different from, the literature of their German  contemporaries (Andersch, B\u00f6ll, Koeppen, Walser) that emerged out of the  collapse of Germany. From vantage points located at the periphery of German  culture (Switzerland in the case of Frisch, Sweden for Peter Weiss) the two  authors functioned as seismographs reacting to post-war reality. Their use of  innovative and avant-gardist forms in drama and prose reflects the problematic  recovering of the recent past and decoding of a complex present.       After prose works exploring the  immediate post-war trauma and reconstituting the (literary) subject, both  Frisch and Weiss turned to drama with works focusing on anti-Semitism and  Auschwitz. These plays will be read against theoretical writings by Sartre and  Adorno.  Frisch and Weiss's evolution from  modernist to late-modernist/post-modernist writing will be traced through their  late works which dissolve narrative certainty and signal a new kind of text  with unstable meanings and uncertain chronologies. In order to situate these  works in the aesthetic and literary context of the postwar period, two sessions  will be devoted to theories of modernism, the avant-garde, and postmodernism.  Beyond \u2013 and before \u2013 all the topical  issues these works evoke, however, they need to be understood as literature. Discussions  will be based on close readings of the texts, on their narrative and dramatic  structures, and on the way meaning is produced in literary texts.  G51.3000: Independent Research  FALL 2010  G51.1111 \u2013 EXEMPLARY TEXTS: Traces of  Modernity (Benjamin, Bloch, Kracauer, Adorno) - Paul Fleming  This course investigates four seminal  texts written on and about the margins of modernity: Kracauer\u2019s Mass Ornament,  Bloch\u2019s Traces, Benjamin\u2019s One-Way Street, and Adorno\u2019s Minima Moralia. At  stake in each of these works is a protocol of reading that takes the seemingly  insignificant \u2013 surface structures, minor details, popular sayings, fragmented  memories \u2013 as the entrance to the deeper structures that define modern society  and thought.       G51.2610 - Special Topics in  Theory: How to read -   Avital Ronell  Beginning with Heidegger's important  text, _What is Called Thinking?_ the class will explore exemplary texts that  turn against themselves as they face down ruling cognitive regimens. If you  have understood the first sentence of this course description, you do not need  to take the class. Otherwise, be prepared to train rhetorically, and with  critical finesse, in order to confront some genuinely demanding textual events  of the canon. Students can expect to get close to major axioms and theoretical  concerns of selected texts by Barbara Johnson, Paul de Man and Derrida while  also confronting technological installations, paranoid utterance, political  reactivity, historical registers of anxiety and traumatic forgetting. Nearly  every work under consideration engages literature in essential ways, so  theoryheads must be prepared to read and submit to poetic language.       Smart undergraduates are also welcome,  but should obtain permission from the professor.  G51.1550 \u2013 German Poetry: German  Symbolism - Eckart  Goebel       This graduate seminar will follow the  contours of an art at the limits of (traditional) art by means of closely  reading George, Hofmannsthal, and Rilke. The poetry of German symbolism \u2013 and  this is the hypothesis to be discussed in class \u2013 is understood less as last  feverish shivers of Romanticism but rather as modern literature on the  threshold. German symbolism \u2013 the art of crisis emerging from the crisis of art  \u2013 points towards the Avant-garde movements of the 20th century on the one hand,  and towards charismatic leadership as the modern myth on the other.  The reading of lyrical poetry and  lyrical drama will be prepared by a careful study of the black bible of  aestheticism and pessimism: Arthur Schopenhauer\u2019s The World as Will and  Representation. Schopenhauer\u2019s influence on European writers from Flaubert to  Kafka, Beckett, and Bernhard can hardly be overrated. Reading his book, ending  with the word \u201cnichts,\u201d may also serve as an introduction to the concept of  \u201cnihilism,\u201d haunting an art on the verge of silence.       G51.1600 \u2013 Theory Clashes: The  Persistence of the Theologico \u2013 Political   - Avital Ronell, Slavoj Zizek, and Fran\u00e7ois Noudelman  The question of political theology has  become an increasingly important concern for students of literary and political  theory, religious studies, and philosophy. Starting off the course, Professor  Ronell will be hosting and engaging world renowned philosophers Slavoj Zizek  and Fran\u00e7ois Noudelmann on crucial aspects of political theology ranging from  the works of Jean-Luc Nancy on the deconstruction of Christianity to Derrida on  religion (Ronell) and the concept of the absent Third in Sartre, Ranci\u00e8re, and  Negri (Noudelmann).  G51.2250 - Post 1945 Germany: Polemics,  Provocation, Pop - Elke  Siegel  G51.1512 \u2013 Kafka - Friedrich Ulfers  The course will deal with Kafka\u2019s work  largely in the light of the author\u2019s preoccupation with language particularly  with the way this preoccupation affected his writing, indeed provided the theme  of it. The point of departure will be the experience of \u201clanguage crisis\u201d among  intellectuals and writers in turn of the century Austria, which led to the  radical language criticism \u2013 already foreshadowed by Nietzsche \u2013 of Fritz  Mauthner and Ludwig Wittgenstein among others. An interpretation of Kafka\u2019s  work aims to show not only the influences of this thinking on his writing, but  also how Kafka radicalized it so as to make it \u201cKafkaesque.\u201d Another aspect of  the course will be to examine Kafka as anticipating a line of writing and  thinking that could be described as deconstructive. In this context,  undecidability, the breakdown of referential language and irreducible  allusiveness will be shown as constitutive of Kafka\u2019s texts. This will  also be the context to discuss the problematization of the real, of judgment,  of justice, and the law that suffuses Kafka\u2019s writing.  SPRING 2010  G51.3399: Comparative Poetics:  Lyric Poetry - Prof. Ulrich Baer  This course is taught in English and  originates in the Comparative Literature Department.  A seminar that examines different  approaches to lyric poetry as a genre, a sensibility, a mood (Stimmung).  Particular emphasis will be placed on the modern lyric from formalist,  historicist, rhetorical/deconstructive, hermeneutic, cultural-sociological  (materialist), literary historical, philosophical perspectives. We will examine  how lyric poetry teaches us about these approaches and the relationship between  them, and to what extent poems contains their own ars poetica (\u201cthe art of  poetry\u201d)\u2013 or how reading poetry can teach us how to read in general. We will focus on a selection of poems  by the following authors: Sappho, Pindar, Du Fu, Li Po; William Wordsworth,  Percy Bysshe Shelley, John Keats, Robert Browning; Emily Dickinson, Walt  Whitman, Wallace Stevens, Elizabeth Bishop, Anne Carson; Friedrich H\u00f6lderlin,  Rainer Maria Rilke; Charles Baudelaire, St\u00e9phane Mallarm\u00e9, Paul Celan; Yehuda  Amichai, Octavio Paz.  The seminar will instruct students in  basic and advanced skills of interpreting lyric poetry, and in recognizing the  differences between periods, forms, and poets. It is also intended as a  reflection on the field of comparative literature by reading comparatively a  range of poets from distinct backgrounds and traditions. We will also compare existing  methodologies in the interpretation of literary works.  G51.1863: Psychoanlysis &amp;  Philosophy: Genealogies of Psychoanalysis -   Prof. Larry Rickels      Psychoanalysis, as institution of  higher yearning, is open to the address of the Superhuman, the Psycho, and the  Android. The following movies will be referred to  during class discussions: Batman Forever, Batman Returns, Dr. No, From  Russia with Love, Octopussy, Psycho, Halloween, Nightmare on Elm Street, Blade  Runner, Total Recall, and Minority Report .    G51.2912: Literature &amp;  Philosophy: Decadence -  Prof. Eckart Goebel       In his diaries young Robert Musil  portrays himself as \u201cMonsieur le vivisecteur,\u201d and thus provides this graduate  course on \u201cd\u00e9cadence\u201d with a certain perspective on a European movement. We  will read some famous texts from the 19th century from Pater to Wilde focusing  on their insights into the less boring aspects of the conditio humana, psychological,  physiological, sexual, and artistic subtleties: \u201cBeing natural is simply a  pose, and the most irritating pose I know\u201d (Wilde). The second part of the  class will discuss seminal works from the 20th century which were, for example  by Georg Luk\u00e1cs, banned as documents of \u201cbourgeois decadence,\u201d such as the  works of Kafka, and even Beckett. \u201cI think he is a little deranged,\u201d the  narrator says about Bartleby who prefers not to function in Downtown Manhattan.  The seminar intends to discuss the critical potential of those who are a little  deranged, dysfunctional, d\u00e9goutant, or decadent.  G51.1513: Brecht - Prof. Robert Cohen  Dialogical and intertextual to the  core, Brecht's oeuvre can be seen as an open-ended critical conversation with  philosophical, theoretical, political, economic, and aesthetic discourses from  Aristotle to Marx, Luk\u00e1cs, and Benjamin, as well as with readers and  theatergoers, with collaborators, colleagues and lovers. The result of these  conversations is a work in progress, a collection of unstable and endlessly revised  texts exploring the human experience in a time of class struggle, violence, and  war.  The course is conceived as a general  introduction to Brecht's work. Topics include the experience of the modern  metropolis; the disintegration of social and sexual relations; the destruction  of identity and the construction of a 'collective individuality;' Brecht's  Marxism and his contribution to a new dialectics; Brecht's formal innovations  in drama and poetry, and his theater theories.  Before any of the controversies which  Brecht's work evokes, it needs to be understood as literature. Discussions in  class will be based on close readings of the texts \u2013 poetry, plays, and  theoretical writings \u2013 and on the way meaning is produced through Brecht's  performative use of language (\" Gestus \"), as well as through  his use of modern\u00ad\u00adist literary techniques such as montage, frag\u00admen\u00adtation,  repetition, and distanciation/alienation (\"Verfremdung\").  FALL 2009  G51.1716 - Autobiographical Writing:  The Day in Writing (Diaries)   - Prof. Elke Siegel Das Tagebuch \u2013 in seiner modernen  Erscheinung seit dem 18. Jahrhundert als \u2018pers\u00f6nliches Tagebuch\u2019 \u2013 bereitet der  Literaturwissenschaft Schwierigkeiten, die ins Herz ihrer g\u00e4ngigen  Begrifflichkeiten \u2013 etwa Autorschaft und Gattung \u2013 treffen. Wie \u2013 dies eine  Fragen im Zentrum der Arbeit in diesem Seminar \u2013 ist ein solches  fragmentarisches Schreiben zu lesen, begreift man das Tagebuch nicht vorrangig  als Steinbruch f\u00fcr Informationen zu Biographie und Werkgeschichte oder als  historisches Dokument? Die Spannung von Ich und Welt, Alltag und Geschichte,  Subjektivit\u00e4t und Objektivit\u00e4t, \u00d6ffentlichkeit und Privatheit, Fiktion und  Dokumentarismus \u00f6ffnet und verhandelt jedes einzelne Tagebuch neu. Damit  widersteht dieses Schreiben am Rande der Form verallgemeinernden Bestimmungen.  Im Seminar werden wir uns mit ausgew\u00e4hlten Tageb\u00fcchern der deutschsprachigen  Literatur vom 18. bis zum 20. Jahrhundert besch\u00e4ftigen und dabei auch  beobachten, wie TagebuchautorInnen sich auf die Tageb\u00fccher anderer beziehen und  damit literarische Traditionslinien er\u00f6ffnen und/oder verweigern. Wir werden \u2013  in G\u00e4nze oder Ausz\u00fcgen \u2013 die Tageb\u00fccher u.a. folgender Autoren und Autorinnen  lesen: Lavater, Goethe, Hebbel, Grillparzer, Kafka, Doderer, J\u00fcnger, Frisch,  Frank, Wolf, Goetz, Gr\u00fcnbein, dies vor dem Hintergrund theoretischer  Interventionen von, z.B., Barthes, Genette und Blanchot. Besondere  Aufmerksamkeit wird dabei dem Problem des Autobiographischen (Philippe Lejeune)  gelten, sowie der Frage nach dem Verh\u00e4ltnis von Alltag und Schreiben.  Welche Rolle \u2013 dies eine der m\u00f6glichen  weiteren Fragen, die im Seminar zur Diskussion stehen werden \u2013 kommt dem  Tagebuch in der Geschichte des Subjekts zu? Welche Bedeutung erh\u00e4lt dabei der  Akt der Relekt\u00fcre des eigenen Tagebuchs? Registriert das Tagebuch den Tag oder  versucht es, ein Leben, einen Lebensplan zu projizieren? Und wie ist es um die  Literarizit\u00e4t des Tagebuchs bestellt? Handelt es sich bei dem im Datum  verankerten Schreiben gar um eine sch\u00fctzende Geste vor den Gefahren des  Schreibens und der Zeit, die das Subjekt zu zerschlagen drohen?    G51.2700 - TPCS: Representations of  Death - Prof.  Elisabeth Bronfen  The act of dying is something one can  expect or something one can witness. Yet it defies all unmediated articulation.  Representations of death, in turn, can be horrifying, fascinating or morally  elevating. In all cases, however, death has been translated into an image or a  story, and as such contained. The mortality we experience is not our own; the  medium we engage with is not the materiality of the mortal body but the  mediality of aesthetic signs. Death is the limit of representation but also one  of its most seminal sources of inspiration. The seminar will engage this  complex interface between death and represenation by looking at fictions  (Goethe's Elective Affinities, Poe's Tales and Sketches), Hitchcock's late  trilogy (Rear Window, Vertigo, Psycho), Freud's speculations on death, as well  as recycling of death photography (Andy Warhol, Jeff Wall).       G51.1112 - Problems in Critical Theory:  Metaphors, Examples, Anecdotes   - Prof. Paul Fleming  The course will explore the role of  para-theoretical (e.g., poetic, rhetorical, and narrative) elements within  philosophy and critical theory. In particular, it will examine the status of  the literary-rhetorical elements as at once illuminating and obscuring thought,  whereby the didactic function of metaphors, examples, and anecdotes lies in  compelling the reader to continually return to and hermeneutically re-examine  the material. The central focus will be on metaphors, examples, and anecdotes  in Western thought from Plato and the Bible to Classical rhetoric (Horace and  Quinitilian) to contemporary theory (DeMan, Derrida, Benjamin, and Blumenberg).  G51.2912 - Literature &amp; Philosophy:  Hegel, Freud, &amp; Literature   - Prof. Avital Ronell &amp; Prof. Slavoj Zizek  G51.1824 - Nietzsche's Impact on 20th  Century Thought - Prof.  Friedrich Ulfers  The objective of the seminar is to show  how Nietzsche revolutionized Western philosophy by transforming its dualistic-metaphysical  worldview into a holistic one that corresponds to the reality of the world as  one interrelated, processual whole. It will also show how this transformation  influenced significantly what is known as \u201cContinental Philosophy,\u201d which  includes such figures as Heidegger, Derrida, and Deleuze. Particular attention  will be paid to the meaning of Nietzsche\u2019s pronouncement that \u201cGod is dead\u201d;  his declaration that the world is \u201cWill to Power \u201d and an \u201caesthetic  phenomenon\u201d; and his idea of \u201cEternal Recurrence.\u201d Also discussed will be the  role language plays in Nietzsche\u2019s view on epistemology and ontology, his  revaluation of morality, and his influence on the arts.  G51.3000 - Independent Research   SPRING 2009   G51.2912 \u2013 Literature &amp; Philosophy:  Theories of Time - Prof. Paul North  In this class we will read texts that  consciously try to regain time as a concept, category, or intuition after the  European enlightenment. Following a singular development, starting from a  theorization of the transcendental subject of experience by means of time in  Kant, we will move toward the pointed dismantling of this configuration in  Heidegger, interestingly enough, also by means of time. Bookending the  course\u2014but not merely that\u2014the first and last volumes of Proust\u2019s In Search of  Lost Time will help explain the urgency that seems to characterize the gesture  toward time in what has been called \u201cmodernity.\u201d  G51.1720 \u2013 Echoes of Antiquity: Germany  and the Gre eks - Prof. John  Hamilton  This seminar investigates the rise and  development of German Philhellenism from Winckelmann to Heidegger. Topics  include antiquarianism and national identity; originality, genius, and  tradition; pedagogy and revolution; the formation of the lyrical subject;  representations of the classical body; Dionysus and theories of tragedy;  philology, classical scholarship, and institutional history .  G51.1919 \u2013 Literature of the Weimer  Period: Philosophical Anthropology   - Prof. Eckart Goebel       The course provides a careful close  reading of key texts on philosophical anthropology. We will start with Kant\u2019s  highly influential Anthropologie in pragmatischer Hinsicht, followed by a  reconstruction of Nietzsche\u2019s theory of civilization developed in his  Morgenr\u00f6te, focusing mainly on book 1. The second part of the seminar is meant  to discuss Arnold Gehlen\u2019s notorious book on Der Mensch (including an analysis  of the famous radio debate between Gehlen, and Adorno, provided in copy), as  well as a discussion of Martin Heidegger\u2019s critique of philosophical anthropology,  formulated in his book on Kant und das Problem der Metaphysik (including, as an  appendix, the seminal debate between Cassirer and Heidegger in Davos). The  seminar will provide background information on further reading, such as Helmuth  Plessner, Max Scheler, and Michel Foucault. Books: Immanuel Kant, Schriften zur  Anthropologie, Werkausgabe Bd. XII (Suhrkamp Taschenbuch) Friedrich Nietzsche,  Morgenr\u00f6the, Kritische Studienausgabe (dtv-Taschenbuch) Arnold Gehlen, Der  Mensch, Aula paperback Ausgabe Helmuth Plessner, Die Stufen des Organischen und  der Mensch, de Gruyter paperback  G51.1994 \u2013 Realism: Problems in 19th  Century Prose - Prof. Paul Fleming         This seminar is a systematic  introduction to the problems of representation in 19th-century prose, particularly  with respect to notions of the everyday, the ordinary, and the average. The  course explores to what extent language can produce a \u2018reality effect,\u2019 and  whether the quotidian, by means of such detailed description, necessarily leaps  into the realm of the exemplary. Authors include Tieck, Grillparzer, Keller,  Stifter, and Fontane.  G29.2640 - Romanticism &amp; Revolution - Prof. Richard Sieburth       The course will explore various  literary and philosophical reactions to the French Revolution during the late 18th  and early 19th centuries in Germany, England, and France.  FALL 2008  Goethe: The Art of Dilettantism - Paul Fleming  This seminar examines Goethe\u2019s  literature and thought through the prism of dilettantism, the art of doing  things in a non-professional manner. Dilettantism for Goethe is a modern  phenomenon, concomitant with the rise of the bourgeois subject, and is thus  inextricable from questions surrounding art, education, and knowledge since the  18th century. In addition to Goethe\u2019s poetry, prose, and drama, we will also  examine his aesthetic, scientific, and autobiographical writings. A further  focal point will be the reception of Goethe and the question of tradition.   Object Relations: Melanie Klein - Laurence Rickels (Visiting Professor)  The seminar will focus on the work of  Melanie Klein, its point of departure in Karl Abraham\u2019s reflections on  melancholia and its running commentary on (and continuity with) Freud\u2019s \u201csecond  system.\u201d The delegation of Klein\u2019s thought proceeds via a series of controversies:  Klein\u2019s followers were largely guided and contextualized via the contest with  the \u201cAnna Freudians\u201d in London in the 1940s, while Klein\u2019s reception today (in  the humanities) is inflected by the ambivalent revalorization of her work  within French Freud.  War, Text, Image - Elisabeth Bronfen (Distinguished  Global Professor of German)       War: Literally a state of open, armed,  often prolonged, conflict carried on between nations, states, or parties.  Figuratively a condition of active antagonism or contention. War is not only a  concrete condition but also a trope for all the other antagonisms that  structure our sense of who we are, what our relation is to the world, and how  others relate to us. Point of departure for this seminar is the question why  the political situation of embattlement has served so resiliently as theme,  scene, topos and Denkfigur in our cultural imagination. The seminar will  involve four domains of inquiry: 1. Shakespeare's Henry V and its  cinematic afterlife; 2. Kleist's Penthesilea and the battle of the  sexes; 3. Cinematic enactments of battlescenes; and 4. Cultural theoretical  issues involved in the representation of war.   SPRING 2008  Interdisciplinary approaches to  Literature: German Music and Letters   - Prof. John Hamilton  This seminar examines the history of  music and music theory in specific relation to German literature, philosophy,  and criticism. Particular focus is given to the employment of music as a  privileged metaphor in literary projects as well as music\u2019s distance from and appropriation  of verbal and linguistic structures. Session topics include: theories of the  harmony of the spheres; synaesthesia, Romanticism and Universalpoesie ;  Wagner, tragedy and the Gesamtkunstwerk ; absolute music and the  tone-poem; secularization and the rise of chromatization; the semiotics of  music; and music and psychoanalysis. Historical and cultural contexts will be  presented as a number of predominant theoretical questions are developed,  including but not limited to the following: the presumed immediacy or  singularity of musical expression versus the mediation or abstraction of verbal  language; the relation of tonal language and text; the reciprocal,  philosophical critique of music and poetry; the \u201cliteralization\u201d of music;  patriotism, nationalism, and racism. The course ends with a close reading of  Thomas Mann\u2019s Doktor Faustus , a novel that is profoundly critical  of, while being thoroughly informed by, the tradition outlined here.          Archive, Image, Text - Prof. Ulrich Baer  This interdisciplinary seminar explores  the role of the archive as the actual and conceptual origin or grounding  context of much, if not all, research in the arts and humanities. Virtually all  intellectual inquiry into artistic and humanistic expression \u2013 whether we are  considering artworks, literary texts or scholarly productions \u2013 ultimate makes  reference to one authoritative version of the object under discussion. This  version is most frequently housed in some kind of actual or virtual archive  from where the work is canonized, and effectively put into circulation.  The archive is supposed to guarantee  authenticity while permitting revisions and rethinking of the humanistic  heritage. The archive is thus at once the solid reference point and grounding  origin of scholarly work, and the site where prevailing views are most  effectively challenged or overthrown. This class will examine two particular  aspects of this process: the notion of the archive as an actual physical  location that houses actual objects and artifacts beyond an artist\u2019s lifespan,  and the metaphor of the archive as the receptacle of past knowledge and a  work\u2019s inalienable history. Different types of archives and issues will be  addressed, since we will include literary works, art objects, political  documents, racial and national repositories as well as technological storage  \u201cspaces\u201d in our discussions. Guest speakers, experts on various types of  research materials, will supplement lectures by the two professors, who  specialize in the history and theory of modern texts and images respectively.  Updating classical concepts of the archive, we will try to examine how new  technologies are rapidly changing both the nature and the power of information,  and thus its repositories.  Anna Seghers, Christa Wolf &amp; Theory  of Narration - Prof. Robert Cohen  The works of Seghers and Wolf have  acquired iconic status. They appear overdetermined by their authors' identities  as women, as communists, as Jewish (Seghers) or Protestant (Wolf), as Nazi  victims (Seghers) or perpetrators (Wolf's childhood), and as key figures of  Weimar modern\u00adism (Seghers) and of the literature of the GDR. Analyses and  interpretations will proceed from close readings of the texts, with emphasis on  the theoretical problems of modernist narration and on the way meaning is constructed  in 20th century fiction (novels, novel\u00adlas, historical and autobio\u00adgraphical  fiction). Several sessions will be devoted to theories of narration from K\u00e4the  Hamburger, Franz Stanzel, and G\u00e9rard Genette, to Philippe Lejeune's theory of  autobiography. The sessions on Seghers will focus on the avant-gardist  narrative techniques of works such as Aufstand der Fischer von St. Barbara   and \"Der Ausflug der toten M\u00e4dchen.\"  Readings of other works \u2013 Transit ,  \"Die sch\u00f6nsten Sagen vom R\u00e4uber Woynok,\" Die Reisebegegnung\" \u2013  will investigate Seghers' repeated recourse to cross over narration (a woman  narrating as a man), and her use of mythology, fairy tales and the  fantastic as ways of disrupting traditional notions of realism. Discussions of  Wolf's work will focus on the late modernist agenda of transforming the  writer's own life into the subject of fiction ( Nachdenken \u00fcber Christa T. ,   St\u00f6rfall ); and on the construction of the female subject, and its  constantly threatened destruction in patriarchal society, from Nachdenken  \u00fcber Christa T. through its staging in historical ( Kein Ort. Nirgends )  and mythological costumes ( Kassandra ).        Exemplary Texts: Poetry &amp;  Experience - Prof. Avital  Ronell  In the Presence of Noise: Theories and  Media - Prof.  Hans-Christian von Herrman n At the end of the 1970s when the era of  the personal computer was dawning a new kind of media theories started to break  up with the sociological analysis of mass media communication by analyzing  modernity\u2019s technological unconscious. As the seminar will show these concepts  emerged from the confluence of three main sources: French poststructuralist  theory, Canadian media history and American information theory. The reading  list will include texts by Vil\u00e9m Flusser, Friedrich Kittler, Paul Virilio, R\u00e9gis  Debray, Niklas Luhmann, and others.  FALL 2007  Psychoanalysis and Philosophy: Love\u2019s  Body revisited. The Religion of Psychoanalysis - Professor Eckart Goebel        This graduate course is intended to  reread the relation between religion and psychoanalysis. The first part is  devoted to key figures of religious thought, such as St. Augustine, Pascal, and  Luther who were at the same time path breaking as analysts of the human psyche.  We will read Erikson\u2019s book on Luther since Erikson had the provocative thesis  that Luther actually invented what Freud then was forced to study 400 years  later. Before the seminar turns to Freud\u2019s writings on religion and monotheism  we will read a key book for the development of psychoanalysis, especially the  concepts of the Nirvana principle or the Death Drive: Schopenhauer\u2019s seminal  work on The World as Will and Representation . This first part is  followed by close readings of several Freudian writings. The overall goal of  this seminar is to equip students of literary studies with the background  information needed for a better understanding of modern literature and advanced  literary theory.  Literature and Philosophy: More  Trauma - Professor Avital  Ronell  Visual Culture - Taught by Prof. Elizabeth Bronfen  SPRING 2007  Origins of Critical thought II - Professor Paul Fleming  In this continuation of Origins of  Critical Thought, we follow two trajectories of critical thinking in Germany  since Hegel. The first is the hermeneutic-interpretative tradition  beginning with Schleiermacher, proceeding through Dilthey, Nietzsche, and  Freud, and ending with Gadamer\u2019s epochal work Truth and Method. The  second trajectory addresses the differences and disputes of the two most  influential critical directions in the 20th century: Heidegger  and the Frankfurt School. Finally, we will look at critical thought today  in Germany and its two most influential representatives: Kittler and Luhmann.  Whenever possible, we will try to create a dialogue \u2013 at times friendly, at  times antagonistic \u2013 between two thinkers for each session.   Postwar Modernism: Max Frisch &amp;  Peter Weiss, - Professor Robert  Cohen       Though neither Max Frisch nor Peter  Weiss was German, they were key figures in the reconstitution of (West-) German  post-war litera\u00adture. Their works are both paradigmatic of, and different from,  the literature of their German contemporaries (Andersch, B\u00f6ll, K\u00f6ppen, Walser)  which emerged out of the collapse of Germany. From vantage points located at  the periphery of German culture (Switzerland in the case of Frisch, Sweden for  Peter Weiss) the two authors functioned like seismographs reacting to post-war  reality. Their use of innovative and avant-gardism forms in drama and prose  reflects the problematic of recovering the recent past and decoding a complex  present. After prose works exploring the immediate post-war trauma and  reconstituting the (literary) subject both Frisch and Weiss turned to drama and  produced works which focus on anti-Semitism and Auschwitz. These plays will be  read against canonized texts by Sartre and Adorno. Frisch and Weiss's evolution  from modernist into post-modernist writing will be traced through their later  works which decenter and dissolve narrative certainty and signal a new kind of  text with unstable and multiple meanings and uncertain chronologies. In order  to situate these works in the aesthetic and literary context of the postwar  period, two sessions will be devoted to theories of modernism, the avant-garde,  and postmodernism. Beyond \u2013 and before \u2013 all the topical issues these works  evoke, however, they need to be understood as literature. Discussions in class  will be based on close readings, on the narrative and dramatic structures of  these texts, and generally on the way meaning is produced in literary texts.  FALL 2006   Theories of History - Professor Werner Hamacher  In Theories of History we are  going to discuss some of the classical texts from the history of thinking about  history \u2013 in particular Kant\u00b4s \"Idea for a Universal History\" and  \"An Old Question Raised Again: Is the Human Race Constantly  Progressing?\", Hegel\u00b4s lecture course on \"Philosophy of  History\", the relevant paragraphs from Heidegger\u00b4s \"Being and  Time\" and Benjamin\u00b4s notes on the structure of history and cognition.          Fascism &amp; Sexuality - Professor Christopher Clark  This seminar will explore the  relationships between fascism (primarily, but not exclusively in its German  form) and sexuality. Primary topics of analysis in this course are the central  importance of sexuality to fascism not only in historical practice but in  theory, as well as the (dubiously) privileged status of sexuality in theories  of fascism continuing through today. We will begin with the Nazi era, noting  what constituted acceptable and forbidden expressions of gender and sexuality,  in theory and in everyday life. We will proceed through the postwar era to the  present, examining the ways in which artists, theorists, and historians have  continually portrayed and analyzed fascism in sexual terms, paying particular  attention to the recurring figure of \u201cthe gay Nazi.\u201d We will also address such  phenomena as gays and lesbians in the Holocaust (and debates over their  memorialization), the intrinsic homophobia of much antifascist critique, the  1970s \u201cNaziploitation film,\u201d and contemporary queer skinheads, with an eye  toward which of these are historically specific and which still determine the  terms and framing of discourse on fascism today. Readings/viewings include  Mann, Hitler, Genet, Sontag, Mosse, Theweleit, Fassbinder, Visconti, Cavani,  Pasolini, LaBruce, and others. No expertise in spoken or written German is  required for participation in the course. However, graduate students from the  Department of German, as well as students from other departments who are  concentrating in part on German literature, will be expected to read a number  of the primary texts in the original German.       Der Mann ohne Eigenschaften - Professor Eckart Goebel  Torture and Authority - Professor Avital Ronell  Led by an overriding concern with the  concept of legitimacy , the course offers a wide ranging  theoretical exploration of modalities of torture and the underpinnings of  authority. Some topoi, ranging from the chain gang to the culture of bondage  and national political behaviors, include penal styles, the disappearance and  returns of torture as spectacle, the punishment-body, the right to punish, the  punitive ceremony as an exercise of terror, forces of revenge, the final exam,  and so forth. We will take recourse to key psychoanalytic, philosophical and  literary texts that have established a lexicon of torture, gauging specific  effects of authority, whether betrayed, corrupt, book-bound, or legitimate. The  course will consider the status of minoritized, disenfranchized figures, those  subjected to legal as well as institutional persecution. One starting point  will be Adorno's thoughts on the \"authoritarian personality,\" which  gets profiled close by, in conjunction with Blanchot's pages in The Infinite  Conversation , \"The Indestructible.\"  SPRING 2006        Photography &amp; the World - Professor Ulrich Baer  An investigation into the ways  photography has been conceptualized since its inception until its recent  transformation brought about by the advent of digital imaging. Particular  attention will be paid to the notion of the \u2018world\u2019 as it informs most  theoretical attempts to grasp photography; the way in which the rise of  photography is indissociably linked to the emergence of psychoanalysis and  phenomenology; theories of perception; issues of veracity, mimesis, and  aesthetics; and the relation between photography and its historical moment.          Kafka   - Professor Friedrich Ulfers  The course will deal with Kafka\u2019s work  largely in the light of the author\u2019s preoccupation with language particularly  with the way this preoccupation affected his writing, indeed provided the theme  of it. The point of departure will be the experience of \u201clanguage crisis\u201d among  intellectuals and writers in turn of the century Austria, which led to the  radical language criticism \u2013 already foreshadowed by Nietzsche \u2013 of Fritz Mauthner  and Ludwig Wittgenstein among others. An interpretation of Kafka\u2019s work aims to  show not only the influences of this thinking on his writing, but also how  Kafka radicalized it so as to make it \u201cKafkaesque.\u201d Another aspect of the  course will be to examine Kafka as anticipating a line of writing and thinking  that could be described as deconstructive. In this context,  undecidability, the breakdown of referential language, and irreducible  allusiveness will be shown as constitutive of Kafka\u2019s texts. This will  also be the context to discuss the problematization of the real, of judgment,  of justice, and the law that suffuses Kafka\u2019s writing.       Literature &amp; Depression: The  Sickness to Death - Professor Eckart  Goebel  The seminar starts with an  investigation of seminal theoretical texts on mourning and melancholia (Freud,  Klein, Spielrein). It continues with close readings of canonical text of the  philosophical and literary tradition from Kierkegaard to T. S. Eliot, and  Heidegger. The course discusses the history of depression between mediation  (language, art), meditation (religion), and medication (Prozac) and tries to  reconstruct the role of art and poetry within this flexible scaffolding.          Brecht - Professor Robert Cohen  Dialogical and intertextual in the  extreme, Brecht's oeuvre can be seen as an endless critical conversation with  readers and theatergoers, with collaborators, colleagues and lovers, as well as  with philosophical, theoretical, political, economic, and aesthetic theories  from Aristotle to Marx, Lukacs, and Benjamin. The result of these conversations  is a work in progress, a collection of unstable and endlessly revised texts  exploring the human experience in a time of class struggle, violence, and war.  Within this framework the course is conceived as a general introduction to  Brecht's work. Some of the topics the course will focus on are: the experience  of the modern metropolis; the destruction of identity and the construction of a  'collective individuality;' the disintegration of social and sexual relations;  Brecht's Marxism and his contribution to a new dialectics; Brecht's formal  innovations in drama and poetry, and his theater theories. Beyond all the  controversial issues which Brecht's oeuvre (and life) evoke, it needs to be  understood as literature. Discussions in class will be based on close readings  of the texts - poetry, plays, and theoretical works - and on the way  meaning is produced through Brecht's performative use of language (\" Gestus \"),  as well as through his use of modern\u00ad\u00adist literary techniques such as montage,  frag\u00admen\u00adtation and repetition, and \"Verfremdung.\"                                                                                                        Back to Top"}]},

Baroque:   The  Sovereign and the Law in German Tragedy (Gryphius to Kleist) Christiane Frey &amp; Guest Lecturer Slavoj Zizek  What is the relationship between sovereignty and the law? Is the law  sovereign? Or does it owe its legitimacy to the sovereignty that institutes it?  In the early modern era, these issues are subject to new scrutiny and  negotiation on at least three levels: politics or political theology (as it is  depicted in drama); poetics and the law of genre (as it is realized in the  writing of drama); and \u201cphilosophy of nature,\u201d in which the notion of modern  science emerges from a new concept of the laws of nature. The course explores  the relationship of law to sovereignty in all three of these domains with an  emphasis on the first. We will ask what drama has to say about the nature of  law and how drama\u2019s relationship to the law of genre lends it a unique status  in the discourse on law and sovereignty. Plays from Andreas Gryphius\u2019s baroque  tragedy Leo Armenius to Kleist\u2019s Prinz Friedrich von Homburg ;  source texts from the history of science; literary and political theory  from Aristotle to Benjamin, Derrida, and Roberto Esposito. Discussion in  English; reading knowledge of German required.   GERM-GA1650 T 3:30 - 6:10; This course meets from 9/2 through 9/30. Visual  Culture: Series, Repetition, Seriality. Where literature meets quality t.v.  Elisabeth Bronfen  Matthew Weiner\u2019s Mad Men not only  uses the literature of the 1960s as one of its frames of reference but also  picks up on the claim to moral imagination for which the Victorian novel is  famous. While much has been made of the analogy between the serialization of  fiction in periodicals and the t.v. series format, this block seminar will  explore the thematic and rhetorical implications of repetition and seriality on  which such a comparison is also predicated. How does seriality appear in both  19th century fiction and early 21st century quality t.v. as a thematic concern?  How do the plethora of individual portraits produced by a serialized text also  form a network of relations that offer up a coherent whole? What rhetorical  strategies does each text deploy so as to call forth both intellectual and  affective empathy? What imaginary community is thus produced? We will use  Freud\u2019s psychoanalytic discussion of repetition along with Deleuze\u2019s comment on  this as our theoretical frame for a crossmapping that brings Eliot\u2019s Middlemarch and Keller\u2019s Leute von Seldwyla into conversation  with the first two seasons of Mad Men .  Since all three texts are long, please begin with the reading/viewing well in  advance.  GERM-GA1115 W 3:30 \u2013 6:10  Origins  of Critical Thought I: \u201cTrag\u00f6die im Sittlichen\u201d (Kant \u2013 Schiller \u2013 Hegel)  Eckart Goebel  This seminar, conducted in German, discusses key texts on ethics from  around 1800. We begin with Kant\u2019s Grundlegung zur Metaphysik der Sitten,  and his Anthropologie in pragmatischer Hinsicht. We will then read  two of Schiller\u2019s essays (\u00dcber Anmut und W\u00fcrde and \u00dcber das Erhabene),  reflecting on Kant\u2019s thought. The remaining sessions will be used to  reconstruct Hegel\u2019s concept of a \u201cTrag\u00f6die im Sittlichen\u201d as it has been  developed in his early anti-Kantian essay \u00dcber die wissenschaftlichen  Behandlungsarten des Naturrechts. A more refined understanding of the \u201cTrag\u00f6die  im Sittlichen\u201d requires a careful reading of the reflections on tragedy Hegel  unfolds in his Ph\u00e4nomenologie des Geistes and in his Vorlesungen \u00fcber  die \u00c4sthetik. In order to prepare this seminar, a reading of the tragedies  Hegel is referring to, is highly recommended: Aeschylus\u2019 Eumenides,  Sophocles\u2019 Antigone, Shakespeare\u2019s Hamlet, Schiller\u2018s Wallenstein , and Goethe\u2019s Faust I. Origins of Critical Thought II, dealing with post-Kantian  'Philosophical Anthropology' (Plessner, Gehlen, Heidegger, Adorno, Freud,  Blumenberg) will take place in Spring 2015.       GERM-GA1512 W 6:20 \u2013 8:20 Kafka  Friedrich Ulfers  The course will deal with Kafka\u2019s work largely in the light of the author\u2019s  preoccupation with language, particularly with the way this preoccupation  affected his writing, indeed provided the topic of it. The point of departure  will be the experience of \u201clanguage crisis\u201d among intellectuals and writers in  turn of the century Austria, which led to the radical criticism of conceptual  or referential language\u2013 already foreshadowed by Nietzsche \u2013 of Fritz Mauthner  and Ludwig Wittgenstein, among others. The course will then show Kafka\u2019s  response to this crisis: his insight that conceptual/referential language and  oppositional/binary involves an abstraction of the \u201ctruth\u201d or the \u201creal,\u201d which  is only apprehensible in a space of radical undecidability between opposites,  demanding a language of irreducible allusiveness, a language that is constitutive  of Kafka\u2019s texts.  GERM-GA2610 R 1:30 - 4:20  Special  Topics in Theory - Unpacking Derrida\u2019s Library: The Secret to the Archive  Avital Ronell  Marking the tenth anniversary of Derrida\u2019s death, this course revisits  Derrida\u2019s library in order to suggest that his texts are more valuable today  than ever before. His library may even be a space for reading and writing  that\u2014dominated by texts that no longer correspond only to the \u201cbook\u201d form, and  by a corpus that exceeds the library that would contain it\u2014touches on the  entirety of the world. Open 24 hours a day, every day of the year, it forces  us, in Derrida\u2019s words, \u201cinto a delirium of reading\u201d that reads us as much as  it teaches us to read\u2014actively, historically, politically, and ethically. The  course will provide an opportunity to remember several of his lessons\u2014about  philosophy, literature, history, politics, religion, economics, ideology, law,  rights, nationalism, racism, colonialism, the media, university institutions,  capitalism, rogue states, the war on terror, justice, responsibility, language,  friendship, love, life, death, and, mourning\u2014all of which are more urgent and  necessary than ever before. It should never be said\u2014as so many have, and will  no doubt continue to say\u2014that his work did not engage history and politics,  that his work retreated from what remains most important to us. From the  beginning he proceeded in the conviction that his philosophical activity did  not require a political or ethical practice because it already was, from the  start, an ethico- political practice. This course takes place at Princeton  University. Students should enroll through the Inter-University Doctoral  Consortium.  GERM-GA3000 TBD Independent Research  GERM-GA3100-001  ENGL-GA3629-001 (Course originating in English  Department)  W 6:20 \u2013 8:20; 244 Greene Street, Room 306     Politics in  Deconstruction  Geoffrey Bennington   Taking its lead from some of Derrida\u2019s later work,  this course will set off again from Aristotle\u2019s famous characterization of man  as a zoon politikon, and follow the threads of sovereignty and democracy  through some of the great texts of political philosophy in the Western  tradition. We shall attempt to understand why both of these notions pose such  problems for that tradition, and give rise to all manner of complications and  paradoxes, which turn out to be definitive of the conceptual space of the  political as such. We shall wonder why almost all traditional political  philosophers are enamored of sovereignty, while almost none has anything very  good to say about democracy. We shall consider the possibility of a non-trivial  affinity between the political, the rhetorical, the literary, and animality in  their constant tendency to exceed conceptual grasp, and also compare our  deconstructive approach to these political questions with some other  contemporary theories. Classic authors to be discussed will include Plato, Aristotle,  Machiavelli, Bodin, Hobbes, Spinoza, Rousseau, Kant, Hegel and Schmitt; more  recent theorists to be considered alongside Derrida may include Agamben,  Badiou, Foucault, Hardt and Negri, Lyotard, Mouffe and Ranci\u00e8re.  GERM-GA1221-001 MEDI-GA 2100-003 (Course originating in MARC) T, R 11:00-12:15pm   Dawn  Songs in Middle High German Literature  Jessica Quinlan   Ow\u00ea, nu ist  ez tac! A scenario describing the pain experienced by  lovers who must part at daybreak seems to have been the subject of lyrical  reflection the world over from well before the time of Christ. In the European  Middle Ages, the dawn song ( Tagelied )  enjoyed particular popularity in the German tradition. It depicts scenes of awakening,  lamentation and farewell, couched as narrative action with dialogue. Between  the 12th and 15th centuries, this pattern is repeated,  redrawn and almost endlessly varied; the subject of the dawn song is recreated,  inverted, parodied and removed to a spiritual level. The primary texts will be  read in their original language; in addition to the discussion of the place of  the dawn song in medieval German literature, therefore, this course seeks to  offer participants the opportunity to develop and enhance reading skills in  Middle High German.       SPRING 2014   GERM-GA1219  - The Information  Society: Planetarity (Taught in German)  - Hans-Christian  von Herrmann  \"I  propose the planet to overwrite the globe.\" This statement can be found in  Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak's 2003 book \"Death of a Discipline\", which  brings up the concept of \"planetarity\" as a description of a  post-global, post-national and post-colonial world, interconnected and  differentiated by electronic information systems. But \"planetarity\"  has a history that is older than what is called the information age today and  that leads back to Weimar Germany. So the seminar will follow up the traces of  \"planetarity\" in Walter Benjamin's \"Einbahnstra\u00dfe\" (1928)  and Ernst J\u00fcnger's \"Der Arbeiter\" (1932) afterwards moving on to the  writings of Martin Heidegger, Kostas Axelos and Wilfrid Desan. By doing so the  seminar's objective is to discuss \"planetarity\" as a theoretical  approach emerging from the crisis of modernity and envisioning a post-modern  culture totally shaped by technology.       GERM-GA3610  (COLIT-GA2155; POET-GA2002) - Topics  in Early Modern Written Culture: Literary Matter - The Lucretian Tradition  on European Modernity - Jacques  Lezra   GERM-GA3100  (COLIT-GA2300) - Studies in Prose  Genres: J.M. Coetzee &amp; Metafiction - Mark Sanders       When  J.M. Coetzee received the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2003, he stunned the  Swedish Academy in Stockholm by presenting not the customary lecture, but a  story. In this tale, entitled \u201cHe and His Man,\u201d Robinson Crusoe sends reports  to his \u201cman,\u201d whom Coetzee\u2019s audience recognizes as being Daniel Defoe, since  the reports appear to come from books authored by Defoe. The relationship of  character and author is turned inside out, in an exciting metafictional  performance that also places in question the conventional boundaries of the  lecture. The Swedish audience should not have been stunned, however, for some  of J.M. Coetzee\u2019s most recent novels, Summertime, Slow Man, and Elizabeth  Costello have, in different ways, foregrounded the mechanics of fiction-making  typically concealed by the realist novel. Concentrating on these works, as well  as Coetzee\u2019s early novels, in which metafiction is the dominant mode for  interrogating colonial literary genres, and drawing comparisons with the  fiction of Italo Calvino, Alain Robbe-Grillet, and Zo\u00eb Wicomb, while at the  same time availing ourselves of relevant narrative theory (Mieke Bal, Roland  Barthes) and critical commentary (Attwell, Attridge, Spivak, Wicomb), the  seminar will explore the aesthetic, ethical and political implications of a  writer putting the inner workings of his or her craft on open display. The  seminar will culminate with a roundtable on Coetzee\u2019s enigmatic new novel, The  Childhood of Jesus.  GERM-GA2703 - Poetics &amp; Theory Seminar:  Autofiction: Writing the Self (Taught in German) - Emine Sevgi \u00d6zdamar  &amp; Alys George       Autobiographical  writing has evolved into a highly controversial issue in contemporary literary  theory. Every constituent of the term has become problematic: the \u201cauto\u201d of a  sovereign ego and an undivided persona; the \u201cbios\u201d relating to a culturally  encoded life; the \u201cgraphein\u201d (\u03b3\u03c1\u03b1\u03c6\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd), which registers problems of  mediality. Serge Doubrovsky coined the term \u201cautofiction\u201d in the late  1970s in an attempt to address these vicissitudes of autobiography as a genre.  How  can we distinguish between autobiography and fiction? Can works of literature  be reliable archives of individual and collective memory? Can they be authentic  expressions of our lives at all? We will consider writing that invites and  engages these questions. In addition to Emine Sevgi \u00d6zdamar\u2019s work,  we will read texts by Else Lasker-Sch\u00fcler, Charlotte Salomon, Roland Barthes,  Thomas Bernhard, Herta M\u00fcller, and Thomas Glavinic.       GERM-GA2912  (COLIT-GA2912) -  Literature  &amp; Philosophy: POETS TAKE PHILOSOPHY:  H\u00f6lderlin~Heidegger~Celan~Derrida  - Avital Ronell  The  course will dwell on the poetry of H\u00f6lderlin and Celan with an eye to the  critical works of Heidegger, Adorno, Benjamin, Derrida, Lacoue-Labarthe. There  will be two separate workshops led by Kevin McLaughlin (Brown Univ.) and Werner  Hamacher (Frankfurt) in addition to possible visits by Ulrich Baer and  Richard Sieburth. Expect intense and staggeringly beautiful work to come out of  this.       GERM-GA3000 - Independent Research    FALL  2013     GERM-GA1110  -Theory of Art: Aby Warburg - Christopher  Wood        Aby  Warburg (1866-1929) was an art historian who worked outside the academic  establishment, building a prodigious private library and research center that  mapped a new field of study: the persistence of the ancient pagan world  into modernity, conceived as an ongoing psychic event. Exposed to what he  experienced as a relentless barrage of expressive images of passion\u2014\u201cpathos  formulas\u201d\u2014mediating archaic trauma, Warburg sought but could not find relief in  the promise of aesthetic sublimation. The seminar will pose one central  question which bears on the larger problems of communication (between subjects,  between past and present) under the conditions of modernity: is Warburg\u2019s  pathos formula best understood as an image, a symbol, a symptom, a metaphor, a  talisman, an avatar, a memory, or a packet of psychic energy?  His  person, his library (which was transported from Hamburg to London in 1933 and  survives intact), and his gnomic writings serve as a crossroads where many  paths of thought meet, throughout the twentieth century and into our  own. The seminar will relocate Warburg among the thinkers who  shaped him, including Darwin, Nietzsche, Burckhardt, and Usener; relate him to  the art history of his day as practiced by Schlosser, Riegl, W\u00f6lfflin,  Schmarsow, and Panofsky; coordinate his thought with the biological sciences,  early anthropology, the study of archaic ritual and religion, the spheres of  modern ornament, design, and dance, the emergence of the technological media  including cinema, and the Husserlian \u201ccrisis of the sciences\u201d; and finally  consider his reception by Cassirer, Benjamin, Gombrich, Ginzburg, Agamben, and  Didi-Huberman. Reading of knowledge of German required.        GERM-GA1700  - Romanticism: Drives of Romanticism, 1900/1800 - Elisabeth Bronfen &amp; Leif  Weatherby  (1)  To participate in the celebration of the Wagner year, the first part of the  seminar will look at unconventional traces of both his libretti and scores in  Classic Hollywood. At issue, as we look at Tristan and Isolde, Tannh\u00e4user and  Holl\u00e4nder, is both the obsession with the psychological struggle between law  and desire as well as the redemption death is claimed to afford. What also  drives this crossmapping, however, is the wager that in the 20th century cinema  appropriates but also signficiantly refigures Wagner's Gesamtkunstwerk  project  (2)  From here, the course will go back to the future, focusing on German  Romanticism and its re-readings in philosophy of technology in the 20th and  21st centuries. Here we will read Hoffmann with Kittler, H\u00f6lderlin with  Heidegger, Novalis with Blumenberg, and others. The complementary  wager of the second part of the course is that the pretense of  Romantic art--post-revolutionary, \"post\"-Enlightenment--has a great  deal to do with the end of the so-called \"techne-physis analogy.\" If  \"technology\" was freed from its metaphysical moorings in the long  18th century, then how does it anticipate later Romantic aesthetics, and what  might it have to say about our contemporary situation?  GERM-GA1842  - Nietzsche\u2019s Impact on 20th Century Thought - Friedrich Ulfers  The  objective of the seminar is to show how Nietzsche revolutionized Western  philosophy by transforming its dualistic-metaphysical worldview into a holistic  one that corresponds to the reality of the world as one interrelated,  processual whole. It will also show how this transformation influenced  significantly what is known as \u201cContinental Philosophy,\u201d which includes such  figures as Heidegger, Derrida, and Deleuze.  Particular  attention will be paid to the meaning of Nietzsche\u2019s pronouncement that \u201cGod is  dead\u201d; his declaration that the world is \u201cWill to Power \u201d and an \u201caesthetic  phenomenon\u201d; and his idea of \u201cEternal Recurrence.\u201d Also discussed will be the  role language plays in Nietzsche\u2019s view on epistemology and ontology, his  revaluation of morality, and his influence on the arts.       GERM-GA2610 - Special Topics in Theory: What\u2019s  Happening? EVENT in Philosophy, Literature, Psychoanalysis - Avital Ronell  A  sequel to last year\u2019s seminar on Derrida, et. al. and the Event, we will  explore motifs such as love and catastrophe in exemplary literary and  philosophical texts. Students are urged to have read thoroughly at  least one book by the instructor in preparation for outstanding discussions.       GERM-GA3000 - Independent Research - Avital  Ronell   SPRING  2013  GERM-GA1116  - Origins of Critical Thought II:Renaissance and Modernity  (Seminar and Texts in German) - Eckart Goebel  This  seminar examines modern texts dealing with the legacy of the European  Renaissance. We will read works by Walter Pater, Jacob Burckhardt, Ernst  Kantorowicz, Erwin Panofsky, and Hans Blumenberg.Participation in this class  does not require previous attendance of the fall 2012 seminar on Renaissance  &amp; Reformation. In preparation, it might be useful, however, to study some  of the texts, with which the authors mentioned above are dealing, such as  Shakespeare\u2019s King Richard the Second .  GERM-GA1219  - The Information Society: By Chance \u2013 Literature and Mathematics - Hans-Christian von Herrmann       In  E.A. Poe's 1844 short story \"The purloined letter\" private  investigator Auguste Dupin is able to close the case because he is gifted with  a certain talent which is in fact an amalgam of a poetic and a mathematical  attitude towards the world. The seminar's ambition is to decipher this  mysterious mindset by consulting Jacques Lacan's famous reading of Poe's text  including its detour in the fields of information theory and cybernetics. In a  second step the seminar will pass on to other literary texts by Heinrich von  Kleist, Jorge Luis Borges and Hans Magnus Enzensberger in order to follow up  the traces of the modern interplay of literature and mathematics.  GERM-GA1698  - Photography and the World: Theories of Photography from the Medium\u2019s  Inception to the Present -   Ulrich Baer        We  live in an illustrated world, and photographs often determine political,  personal, and even the most private of decisions. Who is guilty and who is  exonerated; who gets elected and who loses the vote; who and what we favor or  despise, will get to know, desire, remember or forget depends on how someone or  something has been presented in a photograph. Today more images are produced  daily than in the entire history of photography from 1839 until the mass  production of digital cameras. There is great danger in this development and  immense potential to free ourselves from existing constraints, too. The skills  required to interpret photographs is related to our capacity of gauging the  role of images in our imagination. It behooves us to know how to turn the  current plethora of pictures into tools with which to shape the world we share  with others.  This  interdisciplinary seminar explores how photographic images create meaning, and  how thinkers have responded to photography \u2013 as a phenomenon to be reckoned  with lest it overwhelms our critical faculties. How do we make sense of the  ways in which photographs shape our experience of being in the world \u2013 and how  do we shape our own lives amidst this flood of images? What does the world  mean, in a photograph, and how do we distinguish this meaning from the world  outside of photography? What is the relation between meaning, photography, and  a worldview? Is it possible to experience someone\u2019s else\u2019s world through  photographs? What is the relation between worlds and worldviews, and what role  do images play in this relationship?       We  will read theoretical and other texts on visuality and photography (Baudelaire,  Kracauer, Panofsky, Benjamin, Barthes, Sontag, Batchen, Derrida, Flusser,  Cadava, Ranci\u00e8re, Enwezor, and others), and look at a wide range of photographs  from the inception of the medium to the present to test theories of photography  against the medium\u2019s uncanny and unrivaled power to evoke the real.  GERM-GA2703 - Poetics and Theory Seminar: Short  Fiction ( Seminar and Texts in German) - Katja Lange-M\u00fcller &amp;  Alys George  This  comparative seminar traces the \u201cmigration\u201d of short fiction between Germany and  America. It also focuses on how literary markets and the economy of production  have shaped the economy of form. From its beginnings in the European novella (Boccaccio)  and the German literary Kalendergeschichte (Hebel, Kleist), short fiction made  its way to America and was transformed with the flourishing of the short story  in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The conventions of the American  short story then took hold in Germany, where they have influenced postwar  literature to the present. We look, finally, at flash fiction/microfiction and  toward the future of short(est) fiction. Our focus is on close textual  analysis, and authors will be paired, e.g.: Twain and Hebel; Poe and Kafka;  Hemingway and Rothmann; Melville and Kleist; McCullers and Hermann; Carver and  Schulze. We also consider classification debates in theoretical essays by  Schlegel, James, O\u2019Connor, Lange-M\u00fcller, and Oates.  After  the spring recess acclaimed writer and Bachmann-Preis-winner Katja Lange-M\u00fcller  will co-teach the seminar and will discuss role of short fiction in the German  and American literary traditions, as well as her own work in the form. Non-NYU  students who wish to audit the second portion of the course only are welcome.    FALL  2012  GERM-GA.1004  - Image and Text: Psychic Visuality \u2013 E.T.A. Hoffmann and Hitchcock - Elizabeth Bronfen  Hitchcock,  who was on the set in Babelsberg Studios (Berlin) in 1924 when Murnau filmed The  Last Man , brought the demonic screen expressionist film had perfected in  Weimar Germany to Hollywood in 1940, and with it a legacy of the German  romantic Nachtst\u00fcck . This block seminar will cross map three films from  his mature period \u2013 Vertigo , Rear Window and Psycho \u2013 onto  novellas by E.T.A. Hoffmann, in an attempt to reconstruct this line of  association. At issue is the manner in which both the Gothic novella and the  Hollywood thriller engage a visualization of psychic disorders. A second point  of connection is that both artists are great technicians who offer  self-reflexive commentaries on their respective medium. Finally, as masters of  aesthetic artifice, both pit intense emotions against textual play, with  Hoffmann's romantic irony reflected and refracted in Hitchcock's dark humor.   GERM-GA.1115  - Origins of German Critical Thought I: Renaissance &amp; Reformation I - Eckart Goebel    This  course offers an introduction to key texts from the 15th and 16th  centuries. Since each of the complex works we read provides so many insights  that one could organize an entire class around any one of them, the goal is  merely to make first contact with the world of Renaissance and Reformation. The  research interest I pursue with this class is the \u2018history of the soul\u2019 in  early modernity as well as the history of melancholia. The reading load is  admittedly high, and it might be even useful to have, in addition, a closer  look at some seminal works from Greek and Roman antiquity over the summer, such  as Plato\u2019s Symposium , Aristoteles\u2019 De Anima , Cicero\u2019s De  Officiis , his Tusculanae Disputationes , and St. Augustine\u2019s Confessiones .  We will read all texts in English translations.  I  intend to continue this class in spring with a seminar on the reception of  Renaissance &amp; Reformation in modernity from Goethe, Burckhardt, and  Nietzsche to Cassirer, Panofsky, and Kantorowicz.

We will explore political works,  psychoanalysis, music, and film. Expect sparks.  GERM-  GA.3000 - Independent Research        GERM-GA.1512  - Kafka - Friedrich Ulfers  The  course will deal with Kafka\u2019s work largely in the light of the author\u2019s  preoccupation with language, particularly with the way this preoccupation  affected his writing, indeed provided the topic of it.       The  point of departure will be the experience of \u201clanguage crisis\u201d among  intellectuals and writers in turn of the century Austria, which led to the  radical criticism of conceptual or referential language\u2013 already foreshadowed  by Nietzsche \u2013 of Fritz Mauthner and Ludwig Wittgenstein, among others.  The  course will then show Kafka\u2019s response to this crisis: his insight that  conceptual/referential language and oppositional/binary involves an abstraction  of the \u201ctruth\u201d or the \u201creal,\u201d which is only apprehensible in a space of radical  undecidability between opposites, demanding a language of irreducible  allusiveness, a language that is constitutive of Kafka\u2019s texts.       In  the context of this undecidability and allusivesness, which Kafka attributes to  his \u201cdreamlike inner life\u201d that he claims informs his writing, his becoming  \u201cliterature,\u201d Freud\u2019s The Interpretation of Dreams will be used as a  reference. In this work Freud asserts that many psychological \u201cprocesses which  are described as irrational are not in fact falsification of normal  processes\u2014intellectual errors\u2014but are modes of activity of the psychical  apparatus that have been freed from an inhibition\u201d (Freud 644), and that in  dream thinking, \u201cEach train of thought is almost invariably accompanied by its  contradictory counterpart, linked with it by antithetical association\u201d (Freud  346). It will be shown that Kafka\u2019s texts are suffused with this kind of  thinking, a thinking that allows opposites to coexist as a both/and that never  achieves resolution. As Freud puts it: \u201cBoth of the alternatives [of a logical  opposition] are usually inserted in the text of the dream as though they were  equally valid\u201d (Freud 351).  Another  context in which Kafka\u2019s writing will be read in this seminar is that of  contemporary Continental Philosophy, especially the texts of Deleuze and  Derrida that have interpreted Kafka\u2019s writing in terms of the alterity of a  \u201cminor literature\u201d and the putting in question of judgment and the law,  respectively.       The  seminar will then deal with Kafka\u2019s insight into the inherent violence involved  in any conceptual understanding, in relation to which literature, that is,  poetic or radically metaphorical language functions as a countermeasure in that  it has the capacity of \u201cun-judging\u201d the real, leaving us with texts that  constitute an embrace of infinite relationality and the concomitant  undecidability.  Finally,  we will look at Kafka\u2019s writing in terms of the possibility of embodying an  inherent ethical aspect insofar as it constitutes freedom from truth as  the tyranny of univocity and teleology towards the truth of an  a-topical, endlessly de-territorializing and metamorphosing world. As such,  this truth is always already other in relation with itself, and thus ethical in  its irreducible self-less-ness, its inherent openness to, and interrelatedness  with, the other. It would be the ethical structure of the \u201cgiven\u201d - not the  anthropomorphically instrumentalized world - in which its interpenetrating  parts exist \u201cpoetically,\u201d as metamorphic units that constitute an \u201cethics of  alterity,\u201d that is, an irreducible responsiveness and responsibility to the  other as other.   SPRING 2012  GERM-GA.1698 \u2013 Photography and the  World - Ulrich Baer          GERM-GA.1720 \u2013 Echoes of Antiquity:  Translatio Romae - Barbara Vinken  Marx remarked in his 18 brumaire of  Napol\u00e9on Bonaparte , History comes always back twice: first as tragedy, than  as farce. Roughly up to the beginning of the 20th century Europe and the United  States told and thought their History in terms of antique History that was a  basso continuo to all political conflicts and imperial enterprises. Our focus  will not be on Greek, but on Roman History. In the United States, as well as in  France, Germany and Italy, political realities were spelled out in Roman terms.  If most people agreed that History is nothing but a repetion of Roman History,  it is very much a question if this is a blessing or a curse. And what Roman  History comes back? Is the Roman Republic restored, are the civil wars coming  back, or are people to live in an Empire sine fine? It is in literary texts  that these questions are most subtly asked and answered. The most interesting  and influential texts like Schiller, Kleist, Leopardi, Hugo, Baudelaire,  Flaubert, and James will be submitted to a close reading in order to disclose  their hidden Roman intertexts.       GERM-GA.2703 \u2013 Poetics and Theory  Seminar: Literature &amp; Film (Taught in English) - Daniel Kehlmann and Eckart Goebel  The seminar investigates the  transformations literary texts undergo when they are turned into feature films.  The seminar also addresses the consequences the invention of film had for  writing: Is the potential of \u2018filmability\u2019 always inscribed in literature, and  if so, what exactly does \u2018filmability\u2019 mean?       The trajectory of this class leads us  from classics such as Schloendorff\u2019s acclaimed adaptation of Musil\u2019s early  novel The Confusions of Young Toerless to the new movie based on Oscar  Wilde\u2019s notorious novel The Picture of Dorian Gray of 2009. After the  spring recess acclaimed author Daniel Kehlmann will co-teach the seminar, and  will discuss with us not only No Country for Old Men and Radetzky March   but also his own novels Fame and Measuring the World ,  currently produced as films. Daniel Kehlmann will discuss his film scripts with  us, which will provide us with new insights into the relation of film and  literature.  Students from outside NYU, who prefer  to audit the second part of this seminar only, are welcome to do so.          GERM-GA.1513 \u2013 Bertolt Brecht - Robert Cohen  Brecht's oeuvre can be read as a  radical critique of philosophical, theoretical, political, economic, and  aesthetic discourses from Aristotle to Marx, Luk\u00e1cs, and Benjamin. It is a work  forever in progress, a collection of unstable and endlessly revised texts  exploring the human condition in a time of class struggle, violence, and war.       The Seminar is conceived as a general  introduction to Brecht's work. Topics include the experience of the modern  metropolis; the disintegration of social and sexual relations; the destruction  of identity and the construction of a 'collective individuality;' Brecht's  Marxism and his contribution to a new dialectics; Brecht and the Weimar  avant-garde.  Discussions based on close readings of  poetry, plays, prose, and theoretical writings will focus on the way meaning is  produced through Brecht's performative and gestural (\"Gestus\") use of  language; as well as through his use of modernist literary techniques such as  montage, fragmentation, and distanciation/alienation (\"Verfremdung\").       GERM-GA.3000  \u2013 Independent Research    FALL 2011  GERM-GA.1410 - Goethe: Eros and  Thanatos: Goethe\u2019s Psychology - Eckart  Goebel  Aus schwer erfindlichen Gr\u00fcnden gilt  Goethe zuweilen als \u201anaiv\u2018.       Das Seminar studiert, in Abwandlung  eines Titels von Max Kommerell \u00fcber - Schiller, \u201aGoethe als Psychologe\u2018.  Gelesen werden bekannte Texte des Dichters im Hinblick auf das in ihnen  \u00fcberreich ausgebreitete Wissen um die Seele des Menschen.  For not really convincing reasons  Goethe is regarded here and there as being \u2018naive.\u2018 In reaction to this cliche  this seminar studies, \u2018Goethe as psychologist.\u2018 We will re-read famous texts in  order to learn about Goethe\u2019s abysmal knowledge concerning the human soul, and  its vissicitudes.       GERM-GA.1650: Visual Culture:  Configurations of the Night   - Elisabeth Bronfen  Night is a double of the day, a comment  on diurnal activities, a counter site to the ordinary. It prompts a thinking  closer to imagination than reason. While philosophy's theoria is based  on the promise of bringing illumination, and as such is of and for   the day, literature and visual arts engage a nocturnal side of knowledge. This  course will cross map theory's tropic use of night onto aesthetic enactments of  the night as a stage and state of mind. Looking at the way both sustain the  antagonism between days' reason and night's magical thinking we will read  Mozart's Magic Flute with Foucault's \"piece of night each carries  within,\"; Shakespeare's Midsummer Night's Dream with Freud's  \"navel of the dream\"; Schnitzler's \"Dream Novella\" with  Hegel's \"night of the world\"; Scorsese's Taxi Driver with  Blanchot's \"autre nuit\".       GERM-GA.2610 - Special Topics in Theory:  The Debilitated Subject - Avital  Ronell and Slavoj Zizek  GERM-GA. 1842 - Nietzsche\u2019s Impact on  20th Century Thought - Friedrich  Ulfers       Objective of the seminar: The objective  of the seminar is to show how Nietzsche revolutionized Western philosophy by transforming  its dualistic-metaphysical worldview into a holistic one that corresponds to  the reality of the world as one interrelated whole. It will also show how this  transformation influenced significantly what is known as \"Continental  Philosophy,\" which includes such figures as Heidegger, Derrida, and  Deleuze.  Particular attention will be paid to  the meaning of Nietzsche\u2019s pronouncement that \"God is dead,\" his  declaration that the world is \"Will to Power\" and an \"aesthetic  phenomenon,\" and his idea of \"Eternal Recurrence.\" Also  discussed will be the role language plays in Nietzsche\u2019s view on epistemology  and ontology, his revaluation of morality and his influence on the arts.       GERM-GA.3000 \u2013 Independent Research  SPRING 2011  G51.1655: Archive, Image,  Text - Ulrich Baer, Shelley  Rice   G51.1116: Origins of  Critical Thought II: Heidegger and Adorno - Eckart  Goebel  The course, conducted in German, offers  a slow line-by-line reading of Martin Heidegger\u2019s book on Sein und Zeit from  1926. Halfway through the semester, we will start a close reading of Th. W.  Adorno\u2019s Negative Dialektik from 1966, focusing mainly on Adorno\u2019s  Heidegger-critique. The course is intended to provide students with strong  theoretical interests, a detailed knowledge of two seminal texts of 20th  century thought. Finally, we might also consult Max Horkheimer\u2019s Eclipse of  Reason , however, that will be determined at a later date.  G51.2703: Poetics &amp;  Theory Seminar: Writing Animals -  Marcel Beyer  This seminar examines \"writing  animals\" in a dual sense: both animals that write and the writing on  animals. At stake is the animal as a figure of imagination, of the work of  imagination in the creative process.        G51.1945: Post-World War II  Mordernism: Max Frisch and Peter Weiss - Robert Cohen  Max Frisch and Peter Weiss were key  figures in the reconstitution of (West-) German post-World War II litera\u00adture,  though \u2013 or maybe because \u2013 neither was German. Their works are both  paradigmatic of, and different from, the literature of their German  contemporaries (Andersch, B\u00f6ll, Koeppen, Walser) that emerged out of the  collapse of Germany. From vantage points located at the periphery of German  culture (Switzerland in the case of Frisch, Sweden for Peter Weiss) the two  authors functioned as seismographs reacting to post-war reality. Their use of  innovative and avant-gardist forms in drama and prose reflects the problematic  recovering of the recent past and decoding of a complex present.       After prose works exploring the  immediate post-war trauma and reconstituting the (literary) subject, both  Frisch and Weiss turned to drama with works focusing on anti-Semitism and  Auschwitz. These plays will be read against theoretical writings by Sartre and  Adorno.  Frisch and Weiss's evolution from  modernist to late-modernist/post-modernist writing will be traced through their  late works which dissolve narrative certainty and signal a new kind of text  with unstable meanings and uncertain chronologies. In order to situate these  works in the aesthetic and literary context of the postwar period, two sessions  will be devoted to theories of modernism, the avant-garde, and postmodernism.  Beyond \u2013 and before \u2013 all the topical  issues these works evoke, however, they need to be understood as literature. Discussions  will be based on close readings of the texts, on their narrative and dramatic  structures, and on the way meaning is produced in literary texts.  G51.3000: Independent Research  FALL 2010  G51.1111 \u2013 EXEMPLARY TEXTS: Traces of  Modernity (Benjamin, Bloch, Kracauer, Adorno) - Paul Fleming  This course investigates four seminal  texts written on and about the margins of modernity: Kracauer\u2019s Mass Ornament,  Bloch\u2019s Traces, Benjamin\u2019s One-Way Street, and Adorno\u2019s Minima Moralia. At  stake in each of these works is a protocol of reading that takes the seemingly  insignificant \u2013 surface structures, minor details, popular sayings, fragmented  memories \u2013 as the entrance to the deeper structures that define modern society  and thought.       G51.2610 - Special Topics in  Theory: How to read -   Avital Ronell  Beginning with Heidegger's important  text, _What is Called Thinking?_ the class will explore exemplary texts that  turn against themselves as they face down ruling cognitive regimens. If you  have understood the first sentence of this course description, you do not need  to take the class. Otherwise, be prepared to train rhetorically, and with  critical finesse, in order to confront some genuinely demanding textual events  of the canon. Students can expect to get close to major axioms and theoretical  concerns of selected texts by Barbara Johnson, Paul de Man and Derrida while  also confronting technological installations, paranoid utterance, political  reactivity, historical registers of anxiety and traumatic forgetting. Nearly  every work under consideration engages literature in essential ways, so  theoryheads must be prepared to read and submit to poetic language.       Smart undergraduates are also welcome,  but should obtain permission from the professor.  G51.1550 \u2013 German Poetry: German  Symbolism - Eckart  Goebel       This graduate seminar will follow the  contours of an art at the limits of (traditional) art by means of closely  reading George, Hofmannsthal, and Rilke. The poetry of German symbolism \u2013 and  this is the hypothesis to be discussed in class \u2013 is understood less as last  feverish shivers of Romanticism but rather as modern literature on the  threshold. German symbolism \u2013 the art of crisis emerging from the crisis of art  \u2013 points towards the Avant-garde movements of the 20th century on the one hand,  and towards charismatic leadership as the modern myth on the other.  The reading of lyrical poetry and  lyrical drama will be prepared by a careful study of the black bible of  aestheticism and pessimism: Arthur Schopenhauer\u2019s The World as Will and  Representation. Schopenhauer\u2019s influence on European writers from Flaubert to  Kafka, Beckett, and Bernhard can hardly be overrated. Reading his book, ending  with the word \u201cnichts,\u201d may also serve as an introduction to the concept of  \u201cnihilism,\u201d haunting an art on the verge of silence.       G51.1600 \u2013 Theory Clashes: The  Persistence of the Theologico \u2013 Political   - Avital Ronell, Slavoj Zizek, and Fran\u00e7ois Noudelman  The question of political theology has  become an increasingly important concern for students of literary and political  theory, religious studies, and philosophy. Starting off the course, Professor  Ronell will be hosting and engaging world renowned philosophers Slavoj Zizek  and Fran\u00e7ois Noudelmann on crucial aspects of political theology ranging from  the works of Jean-Luc Nancy on the deconstruction of Christianity to Derrida on  religion (Ronell) and the concept of the absent Third in Sartre, Ranci\u00e8re, and  Negri (Noudelmann).  G51.2250 - Post 1945 Germany: Polemics,  Provocation, Pop - Elke  Siegel  G51.1512 \u2013 Kafka - Friedrich Ulfers  The course will deal with Kafka\u2019s work  largely in the light of the author\u2019s preoccupation with language particularly  with the way this preoccupation affected his writing, indeed provided the theme  of it. The point of departure will be the experience of \u201clanguage crisis\u201d among  intellectuals and writers in turn of the century Austria, which led to the  radical language criticism \u2013 already foreshadowed by Nietzsche \u2013 of Fritz  Mauthner and Ludwig Wittgenstein among others. An interpretation of Kafka\u2019s  work aims to show not only the influences of this thinking on his writing, but  also how Kafka radicalized it so as to make it \u201cKafkaesque.\u201d Another aspect of  the course will be to examine Kafka as anticipating a line of writing and  thinking that could be described as deconstructive. In this context,  undecidability, the breakdown of referential language and irreducible  allusiveness will be shown as constitutive of Kafka\u2019s texts. This will  also be the context to discuss the problematization of the real, of judgment,  of justice, and the law that suffuses Kafka\u2019s writing.  SPRING 2010  G51.3399: Comparative Poetics:  Lyric Poetry - Prof. Ulrich Baer  This course is taught in English and  originates in the Comparative Literature Department.  A seminar that examines different  approaches to lyric poetry as a genre, a sensibility, a mood (Stimmung).  Particular emphasis will be placed on the modern lyric from formalist,  historicist, rhetorical/deconstructive, hermeneutic, cultural-sociological  (materialist), literary historical, philosophical perspectives. We will examine  how lyric poetry teaches us about these approaches and the relationship between  them, and to what extent poems contains their own ars poetica (\u201cthe art of  poetry\u201d)\u2013 or how reading poetry can teach us how to read in general. We will focus on a selection of poems  by the following authors: Sappho, Pindar, Du Fu, Li Po; William Wordsworth,  Percy Bysshe Shelley, John Keats, Robert Browning; Emily Dickinson, Walt  Whitman, Wallace Stevens, Elizabeth Bishop, Anne Carson; Friedrich H\u00f6lderlin,  Rainer Maria Rilke; Charles Baudelaire, St\u00e9phane Mallarm\u00e9, Paul Celan; Yehuda  Amichai, Octavio Paz.  The seminar will instruct students in  basic and advanced skills of interpreting lyric poetry, and in recognizing the  differences between periods, forms, and poets. It is also intended as a  reflection on the field of comparative literature by reading comparatively a  range of poets from distinct backgrounds and traditions. We will also compare existing  methodologies in the interpretation of literary works.  G51.1863: Psychoanlysis &amp;  Philosophy: Genealogies of Psychoanalysis -   Prof. Larry Rickels      Psychoanalysis, as institution of  higher yearning, is open to the address of the Superhuman, the Psycho, and the  Android. The following movies will be referred to  during class discussions: Batman Forever, Batman Returns, Dr. No, From  Russia with Love, Octopussy, Psycho, Halloween, Nightmare on Elm Street, Blade  Runner, Total Recall, and Minority Report .    G51.2912: Literature &amp;  Philosophy: Decadence -  Prof. Eckart Goebel       In his diaries young Robert Musil  portrays himself as \u201cMonsieur le vivisecteur,\u201d and thus provides this graduate  course on \u201cd\u00e9cadence\u201d with a certain perspective on a European movement. We  will read some famous texts from the 19th century from Pater to Wilde focusing  on their insights into the less boring aspects of the conditio humana, psychological,  physiological, sexual, and artistic subtleties: \u201cBeing natural is simply a  pose, and the most irritating pose I know\u201d (Wilde). The second part of the  class will discuss seminal works from the 20th century which were, for example  by Georg Luk\u00e1cs, banned as documents of \u201cbourgeois decadence,\u201d such as the  works of Kafka, and even Beckett. \u201cI think he is a little deranged,\u201d the  narrator says about Bartleby who prefers not to function in Downtown Manhattan.  The seminar intends to discuss the critical potential of those who are a little  deranged, dysfunctional, d\u00e9goutant, or decadent.  G51.1513: Brecht - Prof. Robert Cohen  Dialogical and intertextual to the  core, Brecht's oeuvre can be seen as an open-ended critical conversation with  philosophical, theoretical, political, economic, and aesthetic discourses from  Aristotle to Marx, Luk\u00e1cs, and Benjamin, as well as with readers and  theatergoers, with collaborators, colleagues and lovers. The result of these  conversations is a work in progress, a collection of unstable and endlessly revised  texts exploring the human experience in a time of class struggle, violence, and  war.  The course is conceived as a general  introduction to Brecht's work. Topics include the experience of the modern  metropolis; the disintegration of social and sexual relations; the destruction  of identity and the construction of a 'collective individuality;' Brecht's  Marxism and his contribution to a new dialectics; Brecht's formal innovations  in drama and poetry, and his theater theories.  Before any of the controversies which  Brecht's work evokes, it needs to be understood as literature. Discussions in  class will be based on close readings of the texts \u2013 poetry, plays, and  theoretical writings \u2013 and on the way meaning is produced through Brecht's  performative use of language (\" Gestus \"), as well as through  his use of modern\u00ad\u00adist literary techniques such as montage, frag\u00admen\u00adtation,  repetition, and distanciation/alienation (\"Verfremdung\").  FALL 2009  G51.1716 - Autobiographical Writing:  The Day in Writing (Diaries)   - Prof. Elke Siegel Das Tagebuch \u2013 in seiner modernen  Erscheinung seit dem 18. Jahrhundert als \u2018pers\u00f6nliches Tagebuch\u2019 \u2013 bereitet der  Literaturwissenschaft Schwierigkeiten, die ins Herz ihrer g\u00e4ngigen  Begrifflichkeiten \u2013 etwa Autorschaft und Gattung \u2013 treffen. Wie \u2013 dies eine  Fragen im Zentrum der Arbeit in diesem Seminar \u2013 ist ein solches  fragmentarisches Schreiben zu lesen, begreift man das Tagebuch nicht vorrangig  als Steinbruch f\u00fcr Informationen zu Biographie und Werkgeschichte oder als  historisches Dokument? Die Spannung von Ich und Welt, Alltag und Geschichte,  Subjektivit\u00e4t und Objektivit\u00e4t, \u00d6ffentlichkeit und Privatheit, Fiktion und  Dokumentarismus \u00f6ffnet und verhandelt jedes einzelne Tagebuch neu. Damit  widersteht dieses Schreiben am Rande der Form verallgemeinernden Bestimmungen.  Im Seminar werden wir uns mit ausgew\u00e4hlten Tageb\u00fcchern der deutschsprachigen  Literatur vom 18. bis zum 20. Jahrhundert besch\u00e4ftigen und dabei auch  beobachten, wie TagebuchautorInnen sich auf die Tageb\u00fccher anderer beziehen und  damit literarische Traditionslinien er\u00f6ffnen und/oder verweigern. Wir werden \u2013  in G\u00e4nze oder Ausz\u00fcgen \u2013 die Tageb\u00fccher u.a. folgender Autoren und Autorinnen  lesen: Lavater, Goethe, Hebbel, Grillparzer, Kafka, Doderer, J\u00fcnger, Frisch,  Frank, Wolf, Goetz, Gr\u00fcnbein, dies vor dem Hintergrund theoretischer  Interventionen von, z.B., Barthes, Genette und Blanchot. Besondere  Aufmerksamkeit wird dabei dem Problem des Autobiographischen (Philippe Lejeune)  gelten, sowie der Frage nach dem Verh\u00e4ltnis von Alltag und Schreiben.  Welche Rolle \u2013 dies eine der m\u00f6glichen  weiteren Fragen, die im Seminar zur Diskussion stehen werden \u2013 kommt dem  Tagebuch in der Geschichte des Subjekts zu? Welche Bedeutung erh\u00e4lt dabei der  Akt der Relekt\u00fcre des eigenen Tagebuchs? Registriert das Tagebuch den Tag oder  versucht es, ein Leben, einen Lebensplan zu projizieren? Und wie ist es um die  Literarizit\u00e4t des Tagebuchs bestellt? Handelt es sich bei dem im Datum  verankerten Schreiben gar um eine sch\u00fctzende Geste vor den Gefahren des  Schreibens und der Zeit, die das Subjekt zu zerschlagen drohen?    G51.2700 - TPCS: Representations of  Death - Prof.  Elisabeth Bronfen  The act of dying is something one can  expect or something one can witness. Yet it defies all unmediated articulation.  Representations of death, in turn, can be horrifying, fascinating or morally  elevating. In all cases, however, death has been translated into an image or a  story, and as such contained. The mortality we experience is not our own; the  medium we engage with is not the materiality of the mortal body but the  mediality of aesthetic signs. Death is the limit of representation but also one  of its most seminal sources of inspiration. The seminar will engage this  complex interface between death and represenation by looking at fictions  (Goethe's Elective Affinities, Poe's Tales and Sketches), Hitchcock's late  trilogy (Rear Window, Vertigo, Psycho), Freud's speculations on death, as well  as recycling of death photography (Andy Warhol, Jeff Wall).       G51.1112 - Problems in Critical Theory:  Metaphors, Examples, Anecdotes   - Prof. Paul Fleming  The course will explore the role of  para-theoretical (e.g., poetic, rhetorical, and narrative) elements within  philosophy and critical theory. In particular, it will examine the status of  the literary-rhetorical elements as at once illuminating and obscuring thought,  whereby the didactic function of metaphors, examples, and anecdotes lies in  compelling the reader to continually return to and hermeneutically re-examine  the material. The central focus will be on metaphors, examples, and anecdotes  in Western thought from Plato and the Bible to Classical rhetoric (Horace and  Quinitilian) to contemporary theory (DeMan, Derrida, Benjamin, and Blumenberg).  G51.2912 - Literature &amp; Philosophy:  Hegel, Freud, &amp; Literature   - Prof. Avital Ronell &amp; Prof. Slavoj Zizek  G51.1824 - Nietzsche's Impact on 20th  Century Thought - Prof.  Friedrich Ulfers  The objective of the seminar is to show  how Nietzsche revolutionized Western philosophy by transforming its dualistic-metaphysical  worldview into a holistic one that corresponds to the reality of the world as  one interrelated, processual whole. It will also show how this transformation  influenced significantly what is known as \u201cContinental Philosophy,\u201d which  includes such figures as Heidegger, Derrida, and Deleuze. Particular attention  will be paid to the meaning of Nietzsche\u2019s pronouncement that \u201cGod is dead\u201d;  his declaration that the world is \u201cWill to Power \u201d and an \u201caesthetic  phenomenon\u201d; and his idea of \u201cEternal Recurrence.\u201d Also discussed will be the  role language plays in Nietzsche\u2019s view on epistemology and ontology, his  revaluation of morality, and his influence on the arts.  G51.3000 - Independent Research   SPRING 2009   G51.2912 \u2013 Literature &amp; Philosophy:  Theories of Time - Prof. Paul North  In this class we will read texts that  consciously try to regain time as a concept, category, or intuition after the  European enlightenment. Following a singular development, starting from a  theorization of the transcendental subject of experience by means of time in  Kant, we will move toward the pointed dismantling of this configuration in  Heidegger, interestingly enough, also by means of time. Bookending the  course\u2014but not merely that\u2014the first and last volumes of Proust\u2019s In Search of  Lost Time will help explain the urgency that seems to characterize the gesture  toward time in what has been called \u201cmodernity.\u201d  G51.1720 \u2013 Echoes of Antiquity: Germany  and the Gre eks - Prof. John  Hamilton  This seminar investigates the rise and  development of German Philhellenism from Winckelmann to Heidegger. Topics  include antiquarianism and national identity; originality, genius, and  tradition; pedagogy and revolution; the formation of the lyrical subject;  representations of the classical body; Dionysus and theories of tragedy;  philology, classical scholarship, and institutional history .  G51.1919 \u2013 Literature of the Weimer  Period: Philosophical Anthropology   - Prof. Eckart Goebel       The course provides a careful close  reading of key texts on philosophical anthropology. We will start with Kant\u2019s  highly influential Anthropologie in pragmatischer Hinsicht, followed by a  reconstruction of Nietzsche\u2019s theory of civilization developed in his  Morgenr\u00f6te, focusing mainly on book 1. The second part of the seminar is meant  to discuss Arnold Gehlen\u2019s notorious book on Der Mensch (including an analysis  of the famous radio debate between Gehlen, and Adorno, provided in copy), as  well as a discussion of Martin Heidegger\u2019s critique of philosophical anthropology,  formulated in his book on Kant und das Problem der Metaphysik (including, as an  appendix, the seminal debate between Cassirer and Heidegger in Davos). The  seminar will provide background information on further reading, such as Helmuth  Plessner, Max Scheler, and Michel Foucault. Books: Immanuel Kant, Schriften zur  Anthropologie, Werkausgabe Bd. XII (Suhrkamp Taschenbuch) Friedrich Nietzsche,  Morgenr\u00f6the, Kritische Studienausgabe (dtv-Taschenbuch) Arnold Gehlen, Der  Mensch, Aula paperback Ausgabe Helmuth Plessner, Die Stufen des Organischen und  der Mensch, de Gruyter paperback  G51.1994 \u2013 Realism: Problems in 19th  Century Prose - Prof. Paul Fleming         This seminar is a systematic  introduction to the problems of representation in 19th-century prose, particularly  with respect to notions of the everyday, the ordinary, and the average. The  course explores to what extent language can produce a \u2018reality effect,\u2019 and  whether the quotidian, by means of such detailed description, necessarily leaps  into the realm of the exemplary. Authors include Tieck, Grillparzer, Keller,  Stifter, and Fontane.  G29.2640 - Romanticism &amp; Revolution - Prof. Richard Sieburth       The course will explore various  literary and philosophical reactions to the French Revolution during the late 18th  and early 19th centuries in Germany, England, and France.  FALL 2008  Goethe: The Art of Dilettantism - Paul Fleming  This seminar examines Goethe\u2019s  literature and thought through the prism of dilettantism, the art of doing  things in a non-professional manner. Dilettantism for Goethe is a modern  phenomenon, concomitant with the rise of the bourgeois subject, and is thus  inextricable from questions surrounding art, education, and knowledge since the  18th century. In addition to Goethe\u2019s poetry, prose, and drama, we will also  examine his aesthetic, scientific, and autobiographical writings. A further  focal point will be the reception of Goethe and the question of tradition.   Object Relations: Melanie Klein - Laurence Rickels (Visiting Professor)  The seminar will focus on the work of  Melanie Klein, its point of departure in Karl Abraham\u2019s reflections on  melancholia and its running commentary on (and continuity with) Freud\u2019s \u201csecond  system.\u201d The delegation of Klein\u2019s thought proceeds via a series of controversies:  Klein\u2019s followers were largely guided and contextualized via the contest with  the \u201cAnna Freudians\u201d in London in the 1940s, while Klein\u2019s reception today (in  the humanities) is inflected by the ambivalent revalorization of her work  within French Freud.  War, Text, Image - Elisabeth Bronfen (Distinguished  Global Professor of German)       War: Literally a state of open, armed,  often prolonged, conflict carried on between nations, states, or parties.  Figuratively a condition of active antagonism or contention. War is not only a  concrete condition but also a trope for all the other antagonisms that  structure our sense of who we are, what our relation is to the world, and how  others relate to us. Point of departure for this seminar is the question why  the political situation of embattlement has served so resiliently as theme,  scene, topos and Denkfigur in our cultural imagination. The seminar will  involve four domains of inquiry: 1. Shakespeare's Henry V and its  cinematic afterlife; 2. Kleist's Penthesilea and the battle of the  sexes; 3. Cinematic enactments of battlescenes; and 4. Cultural theoretical  issues involved in the representation of war.   SPRING 2008  Interdisciplinary approaches to  Literature: German Music and Letters   - Prof. John Hamilton  This seminar examines the history of  music and music theory in specific relation to German literature, philosophy,  and criticism. Particular focus is given to the employment of music as a  privileged metaphor in literary projects as well as music\u2019s distance from and appropriation  of verbal and linguistic structures. Session topics include: theories of the  harmony of the spheres; synaesthesia, Romanticism and Universalpoesie ;  Wagner, tragedy and the Gesamtkunstwerk ; absolute music and the  tone-poem; secularization and the rise of chromatization; the semiotics of  music; and music and psychoanalysis. Historical and cultural contexts will be  presented as a number of predominant theoretical questions are developed,  including but not limited to the following: the presumed immediacy or  singularity of musical expression versus the mediation or abstraction of verbal  language; the relation of tonal language and text; the reciprocal,  philosophical critique of music and poetry; the \u201cliteralization\u201d of music;  patriotism, nationalism, and racism. The course ends with a close reading of  Thomas Mann\u2019s Doktor Faustus , a novel that is profoundly critical  of, while being thoroughly informed by, the tradition outlined here.          Archive, Image, Text - Prof. Ulrich Baer  This interdisciplinary seminar explores  the role of the archive as the actual and conceptual origin or grounding  context of much, if not all, research in the arts and humanities. Virtually all  intellectual inquiry into artistic and humanistic expression \u2013 whether we are  considering artworks, literary texts or scholarly productions \u2013 ultimate makes  reference to one authoritative version of the object under discussion. This  version is most frequently housed in some kind of actual or virtual archive  from where the work is canonized, and effectively put into circulation.  The archive is supposed to guarantee  authenticity while permitting revisions and rethinking of the humanistic  heritage. The archive is thus at once the solid reference point and grounding  origin of scholarly work, and the site where prevailing views are most  effectively challenged or overthrown. This class will examine two particular  aspects of this process: the notion of the archive as an actual physical  location that houses actual objects and artifacts beyond an artist\u2019s lifespan,  and the metaphor of the archive as the receptacle of past knowledge and a  work\u2019s inalienable history. Different types of archives and issues will be  addressed, since we will include literary works, art objects, political  documents, racial and national repositories as well as technological storage  \u201cspaces\u201d in our discussions. Guest speakers, experts on various types of  research materials, will supplement lectures by the two professors, who  specialize in the history and theory of modern texts and images respectively.  Updating classical concepts of the archive, we will try to examine how new  technologies are rapidly changing both the nature and the power of information,  and thus its repositories.  Anna Seghers, Christa Wolf &amp; Theory  of Narration - Prof. Robert Cohen  The works of Seghers and Wolf have  acquired iconic status. They appear overdetermined by their authors' identities  as women, as communists, as Jewish (Seghers) or Protestant (Wolf), as Nazi  victims (Seghers) or perpetrators (Wolf's childhood), and as key figures of  Weimar modern\u00adism (Seghers) and of the literature of the GDR. Analyses and  interpretations will proceed from close readings of the texts, with emphasis on  the theoretical problems of modernist narration and on the way meaning is constructed  in 20th century fiction (novels, novel\u00adlas, historical and autobio\u00adgraphical  fiction). Several sessions will be devoted to theories of narration from K\u00e4the  Hamburger, Franz Stanzel, and G\u00e9rard Genette, to Philippe Lejeune's theory of  autobiography. The sessions on Seghers will focus on the avant-gardist  narrative techniques of works such as Aufstand der Fischer von St. Barbara   and \"Der Ausflug der toten M\u00e4dchen.\"  Readings of other works \u2013 Transit ,  \"Die sch\u00f6nsten Sagen vom R\u00e4uber Woynok,\" Die Reisebegegnung\" \u2013  will investigate Seghers' repeated recourse to cross over narration (a woman  narrating as a man), and her use of mythology, fairy tales and the  fantastic as ways of disrupting traditional notions of realism. Discussions of  Wolf's work will focus on the late modernist agenda of transforming the  writer's own life into the subject of fiction ( Nachdenken \u00fcber Christa T. ,   St\u00f6rfall ); and on the construction of the female subject, and its  constantly threatened destruction in patriarchal society, from Nachdenken  \u00fcber Christa T. through its staging in historical ( Kein Ort. Nirgends )  and mythological costumes ( Kassandra ).        Exemplary Texts: Poetry &amp;  Experience - Prof. Avital  Ronell  In the Presence of Noise: Theories and  Media - Prof.  Hans-Christian von Herrman n At the end of the 1970s when the era of  the personal computer was dawning a new kind of media theories started to break  up with the sociological analysis of mass media communication by analyzing  modernity\u2019s technological unconscious. As the seminar will show these concepts  emerged from the confluence of three main sources: French poststructuralist  theory, Canadian media history and American information theory. The reading  list will include texts by Vil\u00e9m Flusser, Friedrich Kittler, Paul Virilio, R\u00e9gis  Debray, Niklas Luhmann, and others.  FALL 2007  Psychoanalysis and Philosophy: Love\u2019s  Body revisited. The Religion of Psychoanalysis - Professor Eckart Goebel        This graduate course is intended to  reread the relation between religion and psychoanalysis. The first part is  devoted to key figures of religious thought, such as St. Augustine, Pascal, and  Luther who were at the same time path breaking as analysts of the human psyche.  We will read Erikson\u2019s book on Luther since Erikson had the provocative thesis  that Luther actually invented what Freud then was forced to study 400 years  later. Before the seminar turns to Freud\u2019s writings on religion and monotheism  we will read a key book for the development of psychoanalysis, especially the  concepts of the Nirvana principle or the Death Drive: Schopenhauer\u2019s seminal  work on The World as Will and Representation . This first part is  followed by close readings of several Freudian writings. The overall goal of  this seminar is to equip students of literary studies with the background  information needed for a better understanding of modern literature and advanced  literary theory.  Literature and Philosophy: More  Trauma - Professor Avital  Ronell  Visual Culture - Taught by Prof. Elizabeth Bronfen  SPRING 2007  Origins of Critical thought II - Professor Paul Fleming  In this continuation of Origins of  Critical Thought, we follow two trajectories of critical thinking in Germany  since Hegel. The first is the hermeneutic-interpretative tradition  beginning with Schleiermacher, proceeding through Dilthey, Nietzsche, and  Freud, and ending with Gadamer\u2019s epochal work Truth and Method. The  second trajectory addresses the differences and disputes of the two most  influential critical directions in the 20th century: Heidegger  and the Frankfurt School. Finally, we will look at critical thought today  in Germany and its two most influential representatives: Kittler and Luhmann.  Whenever possible, we will try to create a dialogue \u2013 at times friendly, at  times antagonistic \u2013 between two thinkers for each session.   Postwar Modernism: Max Frisch &amp;  Peter Weiss, - Professor Robert  Cohen       Though neither Max Frisch nor Peter  Weiss was German, they were key figures in the reconstitution of (West-) German  post-war litera\u00adture. Their works are both paradigmatic of, and different from,  the literature of their German contemporaries (Andersch, B\u00f6ll, K\u00f6ppen, Walser)  which emerged out of the collapse of Germany. From vantage points located at  the periphery of German culture (Switzerland in the case of Frisch, Sweden for  Peter Weiss) the two authors functioned like seismographs reacting to post-war  reality. Their use of innovative and avant-gardism forms in drama and prose  reflects the problematic of recovering the recent past and decoding a complex  present. After prose works exploring the immediate post-war trauma and  reconstituting the (literary) subject both Frisch and Weiss turned to drama and  produced works which focus on anti-Semitism and Auschwitz. These plays will be  read against canonized texts by Sartre and Adorno. Frisch and Weiss's evolution  from modernist into post-modernist writing will be traced through their later  works which decenter and dissolve narrative certainty and signal a new kind of  text with unstable and multiple meanings and uncertain chronologies. In order  to situate these works in the aesthetic and literary context of the postwar  period, two sessions will be devoted to theories of modernism, the avant-garde,  and postmodernism. Beyond \u2013 and before \u2013 all the topical issues these works  evoke, however, they need to be understood as literature. Discussions in class  will be based on close readings, on the narrative and dramatic structures of  these texts, and generally on the way meaning is produced in literary texts.  FALL 2006   Theories of History - Professor Werner Hamacher  In Theories of History we are  going to discuss some of the classical texts from the history of thinking about  history \u2013 in particular Kant\u00b4s \"Idea for a Universal History\" and  \"An Old Question Raised Again: Is the Human Race Constantly  Progressing?\", Hegel\u00b4s lecture course on \"Philosophy of  History\", the relevant paragraphs from Heidegger\u00b4s \"Being and  Time\" and Benjamin\u00b4s notes on the structure of history and cognition.          Fascism &amp; Sexuality - Professor Christopher Clark  This seminar will explore the  relationships between fascism (primarily, but not exclusively in its German  form) and sexuality. Primary topics of analysis in this course are the central  importance of sexuality to fascism not only in historical practice but in  theory, as well as the (dubiously) privileged status of sexuality in theories  of fascism continuing through today. We will begin with the Nazi era, noting  what constituted acceptable and forbidden expressions of gender and sexuality,  in theory and in everyday life. We will proceed through the postwar era to the  present, examining the ways in which artists, theorists, and historians have  continually portrayed and analyzed fascism in sexual terms, paying particular  attention to the recurring figure of \u201cthe gay Nazi.\u201d We will also address such  phenomena as gays and lesbians in the Holocaust (and debates over their  memorialization), the intrinsic homophobia of much antifascist critique, the  1970s \u201cNaziploitation film,\u201d and contemporary queer skinheads, with an eye  toward which of these are historically specific and which still determine the  terms and framing of discourse on fascism today. Readings/viewings include  Mann, Hitler, Genet, Sontag, Mosse, Theweleit, Fassbinder, Visconti, Cavani,  Pasolini, LaBruce, and others. No expertise in spoken or written German is  required for participation in the course. However, graduate students from the  Department of German, as well as students from other departments who are  concentrating in part on German literature, will be expected to read a number  of the primary texts in the original German.       Der Mann ohne Eigenschaften - Professor Eckart Goebel  Torture and Authority - Professor Avital Ronell  Led by an overriding concern with the  concept of legitimacy , the course offers a wide ranging  theoretical exploration of modalities of torture and the underpinnings of  authority. Some topoi, ranging from the chain gang to the culture of bondage  and national political behaviors, include penal styles, the disappearance and  returns of torture as spectacle, the punishment-body, the right to punish, the  punitive ceremony as an exercise of terror, forces of revenge, the final exam,  and so forth. We will take recourse to key psychoanalytic, philosophical and  literary texts that have established a lexicon of torture, gauging specific  effects of authority, whether betrayed, corrupt, book-bound, or legitimate. The  course will consider the status of minoritized, disenfranchized figures, those  subjected to legal as well as institutional persecution. One starting point  will be Adorno's thoughts on the \"authoritarian personality,\" which  gets profiled close by, in conjunction with Blanchot's pages in The Infinite  Conversation , \"The Indestructible.\"  SPRING 2006        Photography &amp; the World - Professor Ulrich Baer  An investigation into the ways  photography has been conceptualized since its inception until its recent  transformation brought about by the advent of digital imaging. Particular  attention will be paid to the notion of the \u2018world\u2019 as it informs most  theoretical attempts to grasp photography; the way in which the rise of  photography is indissociably linked to the emergence of psychoanalysis and  phenomenology; theories of perception; issues of veracity, mimesis, and  aesthetics; and the relation between photography and its historical moment.          Kafka   - Professor Friedrich Ulfers  The course will deal with Kafka\u2019s work  largely in the light of the author\u2019s preoccupation with language particularly  with the way this preoccupation affected his writing, indeed provided the theme  of it. The point of departure will be the experience of \u201clanguage crisis\u201d among  intellectuals and writers in turn of the century Austria, which led to the  radical language criticism \u2013 already foreshadowed by Nietzsche \u2013 of Fritz Mauthner  and Ludwig Wittgenstein among others. An interpretation of Kafka\u2019s work aims to  show not only the influences of this thinking on his writing, but also how  Kafka radicalized it so as to make it \u201cKafkaesque.\u201d Another aspect of the  course will be to examine Kafka as anticipating a line of writing and thinking  that could be described as deconstructive. In this context,  undecidability, the breakdown of referential language, and irreducible  allusiveness will be shown as constitutive of Kafka\u2019s texts. This will  also be the context to discuss the problematization of the real, of judgment,  of justice, and the law that suffuses Kafka\u2019s writing.       Literature &amp; Depression: The  Sickness to Death - Professor Eckart  Goebel  The seminar starts with an  investigation of seminal theoretical texts on mourning and melancholia (Freud,  Klein, Spielrein). It continues with close readings of canonical text of the  philosophical and literary tradition from Kierkegaard to T. S. Eliot, and  Heidegger. The course discusses the history of depression between mediation  (language, art), meditation (religion), and medication (Prozac) and tries to  reconstruct the role of art and poetry within this flexible scaffolding.          Brecht - Professor Robert Cohen  Dialogical and intertextual in the  extreme, Brecht's oeuvre can be seen as an endless critical conversation with  readers and theatergoers, with collaborators, colleagues and lovers, as well as  with philosophical, theoretical, political, economic, and aesthetic theories  from Aristotle to Marx, Lukacs, and Benjamin. The result of these conversations  is a work in progress, a collection of unstable and endlessly revised texts  exploring the human experience in a time of class struggle, violence, and war.  Within this framework the course is conceived as a general introduction to  Brecht's work. Some of the topics the course will focus on are: the experience  of the modern metropolis; the destruction of identity and the construction of a  'collective individuality;' the disintegration of social and sexual relations;  Brecht's Marxism and his contribution to a new dialectics; Brecht's formal  innovations in drama and poetry, and his theater theories. Beyond all the  controversial issues which Brecht's oeuvre (and life) evoke, it needs to be  understood as literature. Discussions in class will be based on close readings  of the texts - poetry, plays, and theoretical works - and on the way  meaning is produced through Brecht's performative use of language (\" Gestus \"),  as well as through his use of modern\u00ad\u00adist literary techniques such as montage,  frag\u00admen\u00adtation and repetition, and \"Verfremdung.\"                                                                                                        Back to Top"}, {"content": "Undergraduate Research Fund, College of Arts and Science | NYU                                                                                                          Navigation                            College of Arts and Science                                                                                                             About Arts and Science | Departments and Programs | The Faculty                    About the College | Programs | Students | Admissions | Alumni                                                      Home &gt;

Baroque:   The  Sovereign and the Law in German Tragedy (Gryphius to Kleist) Christiane Frey &amp; Guest Lecturer Slavoj Zizek  What is the relationship between sovereignty and the law? Is the law  sovereign? Or does it owe its legitimacy to the sovereignty that institutes it?  In the early modern era, these issues are subject to new scrutiny and  negotiation on at least three levels: politics or political theology (as it is  depicted in drama); poetics and the law of genre (as it is realized in the  writing of drama); and \u201cphilosophy of nature,\u201d in which the notion of modern  science emerges from a new concept of the laws of nature. The course explores  the relationship of law to sovereignty in all three of these domains with an  emphasis on the first. We will ask what drama has to say about the nature of  law and how drama\u2019s relationship to the law of genre lends it a unique status  in the discourse on law and sovereignty. Plays from Andreas Gryphius\u2019s baroque  tragedy Leo Armenius to Kleist\u2019s Prinz Friedrich von Homburg ;  source texts from the history of science; literary and political theory  from Aristotle to Benjamin, Derrida, and Roberto Esposito. Discussion in  English; reading knowledge of German required.   GERM-GA1650 T 3:30 - 6:10; This course meets from 9/2 through 9/30. Visual  Culture: Series, Repetition, Seriality. Where literature meets quality t.v.  Elisabeth Bronfen  Matthew Weiner\u2019s Mad Men not only  uses the literature of the 1960s as one of its frames of reference but also  picks up on the claim to moral imagination for which the Victorian novel is  famous. While much has been made of the analogy between the serialization of  fiction in periodicals and the t.v. series format, this block seminar will  explore the thematic and rhetorical implications of repetition and seriality on  which such a comparison is also predicated. How does seriality appear in both  19th century fiction and early 21st century quality t.v. as a thematic concern?  How do the plethora of individual portraits produced by a serialized text also  form a network of relations that offer up a coherent whole? What rhetorical  strategies does each text deploy so as to call forth both intellectual and  affective empathy? What imaginary community is thus produced? We will use  Freud\u2019s psychoanalytic discussion of repetition along with Deleuze\u2019s comment on  this as our theoretical frame for a crossmapping that brings Eliot\u2019s Middlemarch and Keller\u2019s Leute von Seldwyla into conversation  with the first two seasons of Mad Men .  Since all three texts are long, please begin with the reading/viewing well in  advance.  GERM-GA1115 W 3:30 \u2013 6:10  Origins  of Critical Thought I: \u201cTrag\u00f6die im Sittlichen\u201d (Kant \u2013 Schiller \u2013 Hegel)  Eckart Goebel  This seminar, conducted in German, discusses key texts on ethics from  around 1800. We begin with Kant\u2019s Grundlegung zur Metaphysik der Sitten,  and his Anthropologie in pragmatischer Hinsicht. We will then read  two of Schiller\u2019s essays (\u00dcber Anmut und W\u00fcrde and \u00dcber das Erhabene),  reflecting on Kant\u2019s thought. The remaining sessions will be used to  reconstruct Hegel\u2019s concept of a \u201cTrag\u00f6die im Sittlichen\u201d as it has been  developed in his early anti-Kantian essay \u00dcber die wissenschaftlichen  Behandlungsarten des Naturrechts. A more refined understanding of the \u201cTrag\u00f6die  im Sittlichen\u201d requires a careful reading of the reflections on tragedy Hegel  unfolds in his Ph\u00e4nomenologie des Geistes and in his Vorlesungen \u00fcber  die \u00c4sthetik. In order to prepare this seminar, a reading of the tragedies  Hegel is referring to, is highly recommended: Aeschylus\u2019 Eumenides,  Sophocles\u2019 Antigone, Shakespeare\u2019s Hamlet, Schiller\u2018s Wallenstein , and Goethe\u2019s Faust I. Origins of Critical Thought II, dealing with post-Kantian  'Philosophical Anthropology' (Plessner, Gehlen, Heidegger, Adorno, Freud,  Blumenberg) will take place in Spring 2015.       GERM-GA1512 W 6:20 \u2013 8:20 Kafka  Friedrich Ulfers  The course will deal with Kafka\u2019s work largely in the light of the author\u2019s  preoccupation with language, particularly with the way this preoccupation  affected his writing, indeed provided the topic of it. The point of departure  will be the experience of \u201clanguage crisis\u201d among intellectuals and writers in  turn of the century Austria, which led to the radical criticism of conceptual  or referential language\u2013 already foreshadowed by Nietzsche \u2013 of Fritz Mauthner  and Ludwig Wittgenstein, among others. The course will then show Kafka\u2019s  response to this crisis: his insight that conceptual/referential language and  oppositional/binary involves an abstraction of the \u201ctruth\u201d or the \u201creal,\u201d which  is only apprehensible in a space of radical undecidability between opposites,  demanding a language of irreducible allusiveness, a language that is constitutive  of Kafka\u2019s texts.  GERM-GA2610 R 1:30 - 4:20  Special  Topics in Theory - Unpacking Derrida\u2019s Library: The Secret to the Archive  Avital Ronell  Marking the tenth anniversary of Derrida\u2019s death, this course revisits  Derrida\u2019s library in order to suggest that his texts are more valuable today  than ever before. His library may even be a space for reading and writing  that\u2014dominated by texts that no longer correspond only to the \u201cbook\u201d form, and  by a corpus that exceeds the library that would contain it\u2014touches on the  entirety of the world. Open 24 hours a day, every day of the year, it forces  us, in Derrida\u2019s words, \u201cinto a delirium of reading\u201d that reads us as much as  it teaches us to read\u2014actively, historically, politically, and ethically. The  course will provide an opportunity to remember several of his lessons\u2014about  philosophy, literature, history, politics, religion, economics, ideology, law,  rights, nationalism, racism, colonialism, the media, university institutions,  capitalism, rogue states, the war on terror, justice, responsibility, language,  friendship, love, life, death, and, mourning\u2014all of which are more urgent and  necessary than ever before. It should never be said\u2014as so many have, and will  no doubt continue to say\u2014that his work did not engage history and politics,  that his work retreated from what remains most important to us. From the  beginning he proceeded in the conviction that his philosophical activity did  not require a political or ethical practice because it already was, from the  start, an ethico- political practice. This course takes place at Princeton  University. Students should enroll through the Inter-University Doctoral  Consortium.  GERM-GA3000 TBD Independent Research  GERM-GA3100-001  ENGL-GA3629-001 (Course originating in English  Department)  W 6:20 \u2013 8:20; 244 Greene Street, Room 306     Politics in  Deconstruction  Geoffrey Bennington   Taking its lead from some of Derrida\u2019s later work,  this course will set off again from Aristotle\u2019s famous characterization of man  as a zoon politikon, and follow the threads of sovereignty and democracy  through some of the great texts of political philosophy in the Western  tradition. We shall attempt to understand why both of these notions pose such  problems for that tradition, and give rise to all manner of complications and  paradoxes, which turn out to be definitive of the conceptual space of the  political as such. We shall wonder why almost all traditional political  philosophers are enamored of sovereignty, while almost none has anything very  good to say about democracy. We shall consider the possibility of a non-trivial  affinity between the political, the rhetorical, the literary, and animality in  their constant tendency to exceed conceptual grasp, and also compare our  deconstructive approach to these political questions with some other  contemporary theories. Classic authors to be discussed will include Plato, Aristotle,  Machiavelli, Bodin, Hobbes, Spinoza, Rousseau, Kant, Hegel and Schmitt; more  recent theorists to be considered alongside Derrida may include Agamben,  Badiou, Foucault, Hardt and Negri, Lyotard, Mouffe and Ranci\u00e8re.  GERM-GA1221-001 MEDI-GA 2100-003 (Course originating in MARC) T, R 11:00-12:15pm   Dawn  Songs in Middle High German Literature  Jessica Quinlan   Ow\u00ea, nu ist  ez tac! A scenario describing the pain experienced by  lovers who must part at daybreak seems to have been the subject of lyrical  reflection the world over from well before the time of Christ. In the European  Middle Ages, the dawn song ( Tagelied )  enjoyed particular popularity in the German tradition. It depicts scenes of awakening,  lamentation and farewell, couched as narrative action with dialogue. Between  the 12th and 15th centuries, this pattern is repeated,  redrawn and almost endlessly varied; the subject of the dawn song is recreated,  inverted, parodied and removed to a spiritual level. The primary texts will be  read in their original language; in addition to the discussion of the place of  the dawn song in medieval German literature, therefore, this course seeks to  offer participants the opportunity to develop and enhance reading skills in  Middle High German.       SPRING 2014   GERM-GA1219  - The Information  Society: Planetarity (Taught in German)  - Hans-Christian  von Herrmann  \"I  propose the planet to overwrite the globe.\" This statement can be found in  Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak's 2003 book \"Death of a Discipline\", which  brings up the concept of \"planetarity\" as a description of a  post-global, post-national and post-colonial world, interconnected and  differentiated by electronic information systems. But \"planetarity\"  has a history that is older than what is called the information age today and  that leads back to Weimar Germany. So the seminar will follow up the traces of  \"planetarity\" in Walter Benjamin's \"Einbahnstra\u00dfe\" (1928)  and Ernst J\u00fcnger's \"Der Arbeiter\" (1932) afterwards moving on to the  writings of Martin Heidegger, Kostas Axelos and Wilfrid Desan. By doing so the  seminar's objective is to discuss \"planetarity\" as a theoretical  approach emerging from the crisis of modernity and envisioning a post-modern  culture totally shaped by technology.       GERM-GA3610  (COLIT-GA2155; POET-GA2002) - Topics  in Early Modern Written Culture: Literary Matter - The Lucretian Tradition  on European Modernity - Jacques  Lezra   GERM-GA3100  (COLIT-GA2300) - Studies in Prose  Genres: J.M. Coetzee &amp; Metafiction - Mark Sanders       When  J.M. Coetzee received the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2003, he stunned the  Swedish Academy in Stockholm by presenting not the customary lecture, but a  story. In this tale, entitled \u201cHe and His Man,\u201d Robinson Crusoe sends reports  to his \u201cman,\u201d whom Coetzee\u2019s audience recognizes as being Daniel Defoe, since  the reports appear to come from books authored by Defoe. The relationship of  character and author is turned inside out, in an exciting metafictional  performance that also places in question the conventional boundaries of the  lecture. The Swedish audience should not have been stunned, however, for some  of J.M. Coetzee\u2019s most recent novels, Summertime, Slow Man, and Elizabeth  Costello have, in different ways, foregrounded the mechanics of fiction-making  typically concealed by the realist novel. Concentrating on these works, as well  as Coetzee\u2019s early novels, in which metafiction is the dominant mode for  interrogating colonial literary genres, and drawing comparisons with the  fiction of Italo Calvino, Alain Robbe-Grillet, and Zo\u00eb Wicomb, while at the  same time availing ourselves of relevant narrative theory (Mieke Bal, Roland  Barthes) and critical commentary (Attwell, Attridge, Spivak, Wicomb), the  seminar will explore the aesthetic, ethical and political implications of a  writer putting the inner workings of his or her craft on open display. The  seminar will culminate with a roundtable on Coetzee\u2019s enigmatic new novel, The  Childhood of Jesus.  GERM-GA2703 - Poetics &amp; Theory Seminar:  Autofiction: Writing the Self (Taught in German) - Emine Sevgi \u00d6zdamar  &amp; Alys George       Autobiographical  writing has evolved into a highly controversial issue in contemporary literary  theory. Every constituent of the term has become problematic: the \u201cauto\u201d of a  sovereign ego and an undivided persona; the \u201cbios\u201d relating to a culturally  encoded life; the \u201cgraphein\u201d (\u03b3\u03c1\u03b1\u03c6\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd), which registers problems of  mediality. Serge Doubrovsky coined the term \u201cautofiction\u201d in the late  1970s in an attempt to address these vicissitudes of autobiography as a genre.  How  can we distinguish between autobiography and fiction? Can works of literature  be reliable archives of individual and collective memory? Can they be authentic  expressions of our lives at all? We will consider writing that invites and  engages these questions. In addition to Emine Sevgi \u00d6zdamar\u2019s work,  we will read texts by Else Lasker-Sch\u00fcler, Charlotte Salomon, Roland Barthes,  Thomas Bernhard, Herta M\u00fcller, and Thomas Glavinic.       GERM-GA2912  (COLIT-GA2912) -  Literature  &amp; Philosophy: POETS TAKE PHILOSOPHY:  H\u00f6lderlin~Heidegger~Celan~Derrida  - Avital Ronell  The  course will dwell on the poetry of H\u00f6lderlin and Celan with an eye to the  critical works of Heidegger, Adorno, Benjamin, Derrida, Lacoue-Labarthe. There  will be two separate workshops led by Kevin McLaughlin (Brown Univ.) and Werner  Hamacher (Frankfurt) in addition to possible visits by Ulrich Baer and  Richard Sieburth. Expect intense and staggeringly beautiful work to come out of  this.       GERM-GA3000 - Independent Research    FALL  2013     GERM-GA1110  -Theory of Art: Aby Warburg - Christopher  Wood        Aby  Warburg (1866-1929) was an art historian who worked outside the academic  establishment, building a prodigious private library and research center that  mapped a new field of study: the persistence of the ancient pagan world  into modernity, conceived as an ongoing psychic event. Exposed to what he  experienced as a relentless barrage of expressive images of passion\u2014\u201cpathos  formulas\u201d\u2014mediating archaic trauma, Warburg sought but could not find relief in  the promise of aesthetic sublimation. The seminar will pose one central  question which bears on the larger problems of communication (between subjects,  between past and present) under the conditions of modernity: is Warburg\u2019s  pathos formula best understood as an image, a symbol, a symptom, a metaphor, a  talisman, an avatar, a memory, or a packet of psychic energy?  His  person, his library (which was transported from Hamburg to London in 1933 and  survives intact), and his gnomic writings serve as a crossroads where many  paths of thought meet, throughout the twentieth century and into our  own. The seminar will relocate Warburg among the thinkers who  shaped him, including Darwin, Nietzsche, Burckhardt, and Usener; relate him to  the art history of his day as practiced by Schlosser, Riegl, W\u00f6lfflin,  Schmarsow, and Panofsky; coordinate his thought with the biological sciences,  early anthropology, the study of archaic ritual and religion, the spheres of  modern ornament, design, and dance, the emergence of the technological media  including cinema, and the Husserlian \u201ccrisis of the sciences\u201d; and finally  consider his reception by Cassirer, Benjamin, Gombrich, Ginzburg, Agamben, and  Didi-Huberman. Reading of knowledge of German required.        GERM-GA1700  - Romanticism: Drives of Romanticism, 1900/1800 - Elisabeth Bronfen &amp; Leif  Weatherby  (1)  To participate in the celebration of the Wagner year, the first part of the  seminar will look at unconventional traces of both his libretti and scores in  Classic Hollywood. At issue, as we look at Tristan and Isolde, Tannh\u00e4user and  Holl\u00e4nder, is both the obsession with the psychological struggle between law  and desire as well as the redemption death is claimed to afford. What also  drives this crossmapping, however, is the wager that in the 20th century cinema  appropriates but also signficiantly refigures Wagner's Gesamtkunstwerk  project  (2)  From here, the course will go back to the future, focusing on German  Romanticism and its re-readings in philosophy of technology in the 20th and  21st centuries. Here we will read Hoffmann with Kittler, H\u00f6lderlin with  Heidegger, Novalis with Blumenberg, and others. The complementary  wager of the second part of the course is that the pretense of  Romantic art--post-revolutionary, \"post\"-Enlightenment--has a great  deal to do with the end of the so-called \"techne-physis analogy.\" If  \"technology\" was freed from its metaphysical moorings in the long  18th century, then how does it anticipate later Romantic aesthetics, and what  might it have to say about our contemporary situation?  GERM-GA1842  - Nietzsche\u2019s Impact on 20th Century Thought - Friedrich Ulfers  The  objective of the seminar is to show how Nietzsche revolutionized Western  philosophy by transforming its dualistic-metaphysical worldview into a holistic  one that corresponds to the reality of the world as one interrelated,  processual whole. It will also show how this transformation influenced  significantly what is known as \u201cContinental Philosophy,\u201d which includes such  figures as Heidegger, Derrida, and Deleuze.  Particular  attention will be paid to the meaning of Nietzsche\u2019s pronouncement that \u201cGod is  dead\u201d; his declaration that the world is \u201cWill to Power \u201d and an \u201caesthetic  phenomenon\u201d; and his idea of \u201cEternal Recurrence.\u201d Also discussed will be the  role language plays in Nietzsche\u2019s view on epistemology and ontology, his  revaluation of morality, and his influence on the arts.       GERM-GA2610 - Special Topics in Theory: What\u2019s  Happening? EVENT in Philosophy, Literature, Psychoanalysis - Avital Ronell  A  sequel to last year\u2019s seminar on Derrida, et. al. and the Event, we will  explore motifs such as love and catastrophe in exemplary literary and  philosophical texts. Students are urged to have read thoroughly at  least one book by the instructor in preparation for outstanding discussions.       GERM-GA3000 - Independent Research - Avital  Ronell   SPRING  2013  GERM-GA1116  - Origins of Critical Thought II:Renaissance and Modernity  (Seminar and Texts in German) - Eckart Goebel  This  seminar examines modern texts dealing with the legacy of the European  Renaissance. We will read works by Walter Pater, Jacob Burckhardt, Ernst  Kantorowicz, Erwin Panofsky, and Hans Blumenberg.Participation in this class  does not require previous attendance of the fall 2012 seminar on Renaissance  &amp; Reformation. In preparation, it might be useful, however, to study some  of the texts, with which the authors mentioned above are dealing, such as  Shakespeare\u2019s King Richard the Second .  GERM-GA1219  - The Information Society: By Chance \u2013 Literature and Mathematics - Hans-Christian von Herrmann       In  E.A. Poe's 1844 short story \"The purloined letter\" private  investigator Auguste Dupin is able to close the case because he is gifted with  a certain talent which is in fact an amalgam of a poetic and a mathematical  attitude towards the world. The seminar's ambition is to decipher this  mysterious mindset by consulting Jacques Lacan's famous reading of Poe's text  including its detour in the fields of information theory and cybernetics. In a  second step the seminar will pass on to other literary texts by Heinrich von  Kleist, Jorge Luis Borges and Hans Magnus Enzensberger in order to follow up  the traces of the modern interplay of literature and mathematics.  GERM-GA1698  - Photography and the World: Theories of Photography from the Medium\u2019s  Inception to the Present -   Ulrich Baer        We  live in an illustrated world, and photographs often determine political,  personal, and even the most private of decisions. Who is guilty and who is  exonerated; who gets elected and who loses the vote; who and what we favor or  despise, will get to know, desire, remember or forget depends on how someone or  something has been presented in a photograph. Today more images are produced  daily than in the entire history of photography from 1839 until the mass  production of digital cameras. There is great danger in this development and  immense potential to free ourselves from existing constraints, too. The skills  required to interpret photographs is related to our capacity of gauging the  role of images in our imagination. It behooves us to know how to turn the  current plethora of pictures into tools with which to shape the world we share  with others.  This  interdisciplinary seminar explores how photographic images create meaning, and  how thinkers have responded to photography \u2013 as a phenomenon to be reckoned  with lest it overwhelms our critical faculties. How do we make sense of the  ways in which photographs shape our experience of being in the world \u2013 and how  do we shape our own lives amidst this flood of images? What does the world  mean, in a photograph, and how do we distinguish this meaning from the world  outside of photography? What is the relation between meaning, photography, and  a worldview? Is it possible to experience someone\u2019s else\u2019s world through  photographs? What is the relation between worlds and worldviews, and what role  do images play in this relationship?       We  will read theoretical and other texts on visuality and photography (Baudelaire,  Kracauer, Panofsky, Benjamin, Barthes, Sontag, Batchen, Derrida, Flusser,  Cadava, Ranci\u00e8re, Enwezor, and others), and look at a wide range of photographs  from the inception of the medium to the present to test theories of photography  against the medium\u2019s uncanny and unrivaled power to evoke the real.  GERM-GA2703 - Poetics and Theory Seminar: Short  Fiction ( Seminar and Texts in German) - Katja Lange-M\u00fcller &amp;  Alys George  This  comparative seminar traces the \u201cmigration\u201d of short fiction between Germany and  America. It also focuses on how literary markets and the economy of production  have shaped the economy of form. From its beginnings in the European novella (Boccaccio)  and the German literary Kalendergeschichte (Hebel, Kleist), short fiction made  its way to America and was transformed with the flourishing of the short story  in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The conventions of the American  short story then took hold in Germany, where they have influenced postwar  literature to the present. We look, finally, at flash fiction/microfiction and  toward the future of short(est) fiction. Our focus is on close textual  analysis, and authors will be paired, e.g.: Twain and Hebel; Poe and Kafka;  Hemingway and Rothmann; Melville and Kleist; McCullers and Hermann; Carver and  Schulze. We also consider classification debates in theoretical essays by  Schlegel, James, O\u2019Connor, Lange-M\u00fcller, and Oates.  After  the spring recess acclaimed writer and Bachmann-Preis-winner Katja Lange-M\u00fcller  will co-teach the seminar and will discuss role of short fiction in the German  and American literary traditions, as well as her own work in the form. Non-NYU  students who wish to audit the second portion of the course only are welcome.    FALL  2012  GERM-GA.1004  - Image and Text: Psychic Visuality \u2013 E.T.A. Hoffmann and Hitchcock - Elizabeth Bronfen  Hitchcock,  who was on the set in Babelsberg Studios (Berlin) in 1924 when Murnau filmed The  Last Man , brought the demonic screen expressionist film had perfected in  Weimar Germany to Hollywood in 1940, and with it a legacy of the German  romantic Nachtst\u00fcck . This block seminar will cross map three films from  his mature period \u2013 Vertigo , Rear Window and Psycho \u2013 onto  novellas by E.T.A. Hoffmann, in an attempt to reconstruct this line of  association. At issue is the manner in which both the Gothic novella and the  Hollywood thriller engage a visualization of psychic disorders. A second point  of connection is that both artists are great technicians who offer  self-reflexive commentaries on their respective medium. Finally, as masters of  aesthetic artifice, both pit intense emotions against textual play, with  Hoffmann's romantic irony reflected and refracted in Hitchcock's dark humor.   GERM-GA.1115  - Origins of German Critical Thought I: Renaissance &amp; Reformation I - Eckart Goebel    This  course offers an introduction to key texts from the 15th and 16th  centuries. Since each of the complex works we read provides so many insights  that one could organize an entire class around any one of them, the goal is  merely to make first contact with the world of Renaissance and Reformation. The  research interest I pursue with this class is the \u2018history of the soul\u2019 in  early modernity as well as the history of melancholia. The reading load is  admittedly high, and it might be even useful to have, in addition, a closer  look at some seminal works from Greek and Roman antiquity over the summer, such  as Plato\u2019s Symposium , Aristoteles\u2019 De Anima , Cicero\u2019s De  Officiis , his Tusculanae Disputationes , and St. Augustine\u2019s Confessiones .  We will read all texts in English translations.  I  intend to continue this class in spring with a seminar on the reception of  Renaissance &amp; Reformation in modernity from Goethe, Burckhardt, and  Nietzsche to Cassirer, Panofsky, and Kantorowicz.

We will explore political works,  psychoanalysis, music, and film. Expect sparks.  GERM-  GA.3000 - Independent Research        GERM-GA.1512  - Kafka - Friedrich Ulfers  The  course will deal with Kafka\u2019s work largely in the light of the author\u2019s  preoccupation with language, particularly with the way this preoccupation  affected his writing, indeed provided the topic of it.       The  point of departure will be the experience of \u201clanguage crisis\u201d among  intellectuals and writers in turn of the century Austria, which led to the  radical criticism of conceptual or referential language\u2013 already foreshadowed  by Nietzsche \u2013 of Fritz Mauthner and Ludwig Wittgenstein, among others.  The  course will then show Kafka\u2019s response to this crisis: his insight that  conceptual/referential language and oppositional/binary involves an abstraction  of the \u201ctruth\u201d or the \u201creal,\u201d which is only apprehensible in a space of radical  undecidability between opposites, demanding a language of irreducible  allusiveness, a language that is constitutive of Kafka\u2019s texts.       In  the context of this undecidability and allusivesness, which Kafka attributes to  his \u201cdreamlike inner life\u201d that he claims informs his writing, his becoming  \u201cliterature,\u201d Freud\u2019s The Interpretation of Dreams will be used as a  reference. In this work Freud asserts that many psychological \u201cprocesses which  are described as irrational are not in fact falsification of normal  processes\u2014intellectual errors\u2014but are modes of activity of the psychical  apparatus that have been freed from an inhibition\u201d (Freud 644), and that in  dream thinking, \u201cEach train of thought is almost invariably accompanied by its  contradictory counterpart, linked with it by antithetical association\u201d (Freud  346). It will be shown that Kafka\u2019s texts are suffused with this kind of  thinking, a thinking that allows opposites to coexist as a both/and that never  achieves resolution. As Freud puts it: \u201cBoth of the alternatives [of a logical  opposition] are usually inserted in the text of the dream as though they were  equally valid\u201d (Freud 351).  Another  context in which Kafka\u2019s writing will be read in this seminar is that of  contemporary Continental Philosophy, especially the texts of Deleuze and  Derrida that have interpreted Kafka\u2019s writing in terms of the alterity of a  \u201cminor literature\u201d and the putting in question of judgment and the law,  respectively.       The  seminar will then deal with Kafka\u2019s insight into the inherent violence involved  in any conceptual understanding, in relation to which literature, that is,  poetic or radically metaphorical language functions as a countermeasure in that  it has the capacity of \u201cun-judging\u201d the real, leaving us with texts that  constitute an embrace of infinite relationality and the concomitant  undecidability.  Finally,  we will look at Kafka\u2019s writing in terms of the possibility of embodying an  inherent ethical aspect insofar as it constitutes freedom from truth as  the tyranny of univocity and teleology towards the truth of an  a-topical, endlessly de-territorializing and metamorphosing world. As such,  this truth is always already other in relation with itself, and thus ethical in  its irreducible self-less-ness, its inherent openness to, and interrelatedness  with, the other. It would be the ethical structure of the \u201cgiven\u201d - not the  anthropomorphically instrumentalized world - in which its interpenetrating  parts exist \u201cpoetically,\u201d as metamorphic units that constitute an \u201cethics of  alterity,\u201d that is, an irreducible responsiveness and responsibility to the  other as other.   SPRING 2012  GERM-GA.1698 \u2013 Photography and the  World - Ulrich Baer          GERM-GA.1720 \u2013 Echoes of Antiquity:  Translatio Romae - Barbara Vinken  Marx remarked in his 18 brumaire of  Napol\u00e9on Bonaparte , History comes always back twice: first as tragedy, than  as farce. Roughly up to the beginning of the 20th century Europe and the United  States told and thought their History in terms of antique History that was a  basso continuo to all political conflicts and imperial enterprises. Our focus  will not be on Greek, but on Roman History. In the United States, as well as in  France, Germany and Italy, political realities were spelled out in Roman terms.  If most people agreed that History is nothing but a repetion of Roman History,  it is very much a question if this is a blessing or a curse. And what Roman  History comes back? Is the Roman Republic restored, are the civil wars coming  back, or are people to live in an Empire sine fine? It is in literary texts  that these questions are most subtly asked and answered. The most interesting  and influential texts like Schiller, Kleist, Leopardi, Hugo, Baudelaire,  Flaubert, and James will be submitted to a close reading in order to disclose  their hidden Roman intertexts.       GERM-GA.2703 \u2013 Poetics and Theory  Seminar: Literature &amp; Film (Taught in English) - Daniel Kehlmann and Eckart Goebel  The seminar investigates the  transformations literary texts undergo when they are turned into feature films.  The seminar also addresses the consequences the invention of film had for  writing: Is the potential of \u2018filmability\u2019 always inscribed in literature, and  if so, what exactly does \u2018filmability\u2019 mean?       The trajectory of this class leads us  from classics such as Schloendorff\u2019s acclaimed adaptation of Musil\u2019s early  novel The Confusions of Young Toerless to the new movie based on Oscar  Wilde\u2019s notorious novel The Picture of Dorian Gray of 2009. After the  spring recess acclaimed author Daniel Kehlmann will co-teach the seminar, and  will discuss with us not only No Country for Old Men and Radetzky March   but also his own novels Fame and Measuring the World ,  currently produced as films. Daniel Kehlmann will discuss his film scripts with  us, which will provide us with new insights into the relation of film and  literature.  Students from outside NYU, who prefer  to audit the second part of this seminar only, are welcome to do so.          GERM-GA.1513 \u2013 Bertolt Brecht - Robert Cohen  Brecht's oeuvre can be read as a  radical critique of philosophical, theoretical, political, economic, and  aesthetic discourses from Aristotle to Marx, Luk\u00e1cs, and Benjamin. It is a work  forever in progress, a collection of unstable and endlessly revised texts  exploring the human condition in a time of class struggle, violence, and war.       The Seminar is conceived as a general  introduction to Brecht's work. Topics include the experience of the modern  metropolis; the disintegration of social and sexual relations; the destruction  of identity and the construction of a 'collective individuality;' Brecht's  Marxism and his contribution to a new dialectics; Brecht and the Weimar  avant-garde.  Discussions based on close readings of  poetry, plays, prose, and theoretical writings will focus on the way meaning is  produced through Brecht's performative and gestural (\"Gestus\") use of  language; as well as through his use of modernist literary techniques such as  montage, fragmentation, and distanciation/alienation (\"Verfremdung\").       GERM-GA.3000  \u2013 Independent Research    FALL 2011  GERM-GA.1410 - Goethe: Eros and  Thanatos: Goethe\u2019s Psychology - Eckart  Goebel  Aus schwer erfindlichen Gr\u00fcnden gilt  Goethe zuweilen als \u201anaiv\u2018.       Das Seminar studiert, in Abwandlung  eines Titels von Max Kommerell \u00fcber - Schiller, \u201aGoethe als Psychologe\u2018.  Gelesen werden bekannte Texte des Dichters im Hinblick auf das in ihnen  \u00fcberreich ausgebreitete Wissen um die Seele des Menschen.  For not really convincing reasons  Goethe is regarded here and there as being \u2018naive.\u2018 In reaction to this cliche  this seminar studies, \u2018Goethe as psychologist.\u2018 We will re-read famous texts in  order to learn about Goethe\u2019s abysmal knowledge concerning the human soul, and  its vissicitudes.       GERM-GA.1650: Visual Culture:  Configurations of the Night   - Elisabeth Bronfen  Night is a double of the day, a comment  on diurnal activities, a counter site to the ordinary. It prompts a thinking  closer to imagination than reason. While philosophy's theoria is based  on the promise of bringing illumination, and as such is of and for   the day, literature and visual arts engage a nocturnal side of knowledge. This  course will cross map theory's tropic use of night onto aesthetic enactments of  the night as a stage and state of mind. Looking at the way both sustain the  antagonism between days' reason and night's magical thinking we will read  Mozart's Magic Flute with Foucault's \"piece of night each carries  within,\"; Shakespeare's Midsummer Night's Dream with Freud's  \"navel of the dream\"; Schnitzler's \"Dream Novella\" with  Hegel's \"night of the world\"; Scorsese's Taxi Driver with  Blanchot's \"autre nuit\".       GERM-GA.2610 - Special Topics in Theory:  The Debilitated Subject - Avital  Ronell and Slavoj Zizek  GERM-GA. 1842 - Nietzsche\u2019s Impact on  20th Century Thought - Friedrich  Ulfers       Objective of the seminar: The objective  of the seminar is to show how Nietzsche revolutionized Western philosophy by transforming  its dualistic-metaphysical worldview into a holistic one that corresponds to  the reality of the world as one interrelated whole. It will also show how this  transformation influenced significantly what is known as \"Continental  Philosophy,\" which includes such figures as Heidegger, Derrida, and  Deleuze.  Particular attention will be paid to  the meaning of Nietzsche\u2019s pronouncement that \"God is dead,\" his  declaration that the world is \"Will to Power\" and an \"aesthetic  phenomenon,\" and his idea of \"Eternal Recurrence.\" Also  discussed will be the role language plays in Nietzsche\u2019s view on epistemology  and ontology, his revaluation of morality and his influence on the arts.       GERM-GA.3000 \u2013 Independent Research  SPRING 2011  G51.1655: Archive, Image,  Text - Ulrich Baer, Shelley  Rice   G51.1116: Origins of  Critical Thought II: Heidegger and Adorno - Eckart  Goebel  The course, conducted in German, offers  a slow line-by-line reading of Martin Heidegger\u2019s book on Sein und Zeit from  1926. Halfway through the semester, we will start a close reading of Th. W.  Adorno\u2019s Negative Dialektik from 1966, focusing mainly on Adorno\u2019s  Heidegger-critique. The course is intended to provide students with strong  theoretical interests, a detailed knowledge of two seminal texts of 20th  century thought. Finally, we might also consult Max Horkheimer\u2019s Eclipse of  Reason , however, that will be determined at a later date.  G51.2703: Poetics &amp;  Theory Seminar: Writing Animals -  Marcel Beyer  This seminar examines \"writing  animals\" in a dual sense: both animals that write and the writing on  animals. At stake is the animal as a figure of imagination, of the work of  imagination in the creative process.        G51.1945: Post-World War II  Mordernism: Max Frisch and Peter Weiss - Robert Cohen  Max Frisch and Peter Weiss were key  figures in the reconstitution of (West-) German post-World War II litera\u00adture,  though \u2013 or maybe because \u2013 neither was German. Their works are both  paradigmatic of, and different from, the literature of their German  contemporaries (Andersch, B\u00f6ll, Koeppen, Walser) that emerged out of the  collapse of Germany. From vantage points located at the periphery of German  culture (Switzerland in the case of Frisch, Sweden for Peter Weiss) the two  authors functioned as seismographs reacting to post-war reality. Their use of  innovative and avant-gardist forms in drama and prose reflects the problematic  recovering of the recent past and decoding of a complex present.       After prose works exploring the  immediate post-war trauma and reconstituting the (literary) subject, both  Frisch and Weiss turned to drama with works focusing on anti-Semitism and  Auschwitz. These plays will be read against theoretical writings by Sartre and  Adorno.  Frisch and Weiss's evolution from  modernist to late-modernist/post-modernist writing will be traced through their  late works which dissolve narrative certainty and signal a new kind of text  with unstable meanings and uncertain chronologies. In order to situate these  works in the aesthetic and literary context of the postwar period, two sessions  will be devoted to theories of modernism, the avant-garde, and postmodernism.  Beyond \u2013 and before \u2013 all the topical  issues these works evoke, however, they need to be understood as literature. Discussions  will be based on close readings of the texts, on their narrative and dramatic  structures, and on the way meaning is produced in literary texts.  G51.3000: Independent Research  FALL 2010  G51.1111 \u2013 EXEMPLARY TEXTS: Traces of  Modernity (Benjamin, Bloch, Kracauer, Adorno) - Paul Fleming  This course investigates four seminal  texts written on and about the margins of modernity: Kracauer\u2019s Mass Ornament,  Bloch\u2019s Traces, Benjamin\u2019s One-Way Street, and Adorno\u2019s Minima Moralia. At  stake in each of these works is a protocol of reading that takes the seemingly  insignificant \u2013 surface structures, minor details, popular sayings, fragmented  memories \u2013 as the entrance to the deeper structures that define modern society  and thought.       G51.2610 - Special Topics in  Theory: How to read -   Avital Ronell  Beginning with Heidegger's important  text, _What is Called Thinking?_ the class will explore exemplary texts that  turn against themselves as they face down ruling cognitive regimens. If you  have understood the first sentence of this course description, you do not need  to take the class. Otherwise, be prepared to train rhetorically, and with  critical finesse, in order to confront some genuinely demanding textual events  of the canon. Students can expect to get close to major axioms and theoretical  concerns of selected texts by Barbara Johnson, Paul de Man and Derrida while  also confronting technological installations, paranoid utterance, political  reactivity, historical registers of anxiety and traumatic forgetting. Nearly  every work under consideration engages literature in essential ways, so  theoryheads must be prepared to read and submit to poetic language.       Smart undergraduates are also welcome,  but should obtain permission from the professor.  G51.1550 \u2013 German Poetry: German  Symbolism - Eckart  Goebel       This graduate seminar will follow the  contours of an art at the limits of (traditional) art by means of closely  reading George, Hofmannsthal, and Rilke. The poetry of German symbolism \u2013 and  this is the hypothesis to be discussed in class \u2013 is understood less as last  feverish shivers of Romanticism but rather as modern literature on the  threshold. German symbolism \u2013 the art of crisis emerging from the crisis of art  \u2013 points towards the Avant-garde movements of the 20th century on the one hand,  and towards charismatic leadership as the modern myth on the other.  The reading of lyrical poetry and  lyrical drama will be prepared by a careful study of the black bible of  aestheticism and pessimism: Arthur Schopenhauer\u2019s The World as Will and  Representation. Schopenhauer\u2019s influence on European writers from Flaubert to  Kafka, Beckett, and Bernhard can hardly be overrated. Reading his book, ending  with the word \u201cnichts,\u201d may also serve as an introduction to the concept of  \u201cnihilism,\u201d haunting an art on the verge of silence.       G51.1600 \u2013 Theory Clashes: The  Persistence of the Theologico \u2013 Political   - Avital Ronell, Slavoj Zizek, and Fran\u00e7ois Noudelman  The question of political theology has  become an increasingly important concern for students of literary and political  theory, religious studies, and philosophy. Starting off the course, Professor  Ronell will be hosting and engaging world renowned philosophers Slavoj Zizek  and Fran\u00e7ois Noudelmann on crucial aspects of political theology ranging from  the works of Jean-Luc Nancy on the deconstruction of Christianity to Derrida on  religion (Ronell) and the concept of the absent Third in Sartre, Ranci\u00e8re, and  Negri (Noudelmann).  G51.2250 - Post 1945 Germany: Polemics,  Provocation, Pop - Elke  Siegel  G51.1512 \u2013 Kafka - Friedrich Ulfers  The course will deal with Kafka\u2019s work  largely in the light of the author\u2019s preoccupation with language particularly  with the way this preoccupation affected his writing, indeed provided the theme  of it. The point of departure will be the experience of \u201clanguage crisis\u201d among  intellectuals and writers in turn of the century Austria, which led to the  radical language criticism \u2013 already foreshadowed by Nietzsche \u2013 of Fritz  Mauthner and Ludwig Wittgenstein among others. An interpretation of Kafka\u2019s  work aims to show not only the influences of this thinking on his writing, but  also how Kafka radicalized it so as to make it \u201cKafkaesque.\u201d Another aspect of  the course will be to examine Kafka as anticipating a line of writing and  thinking that could be described as deconstructive. In this context,  undecidability, the breakdown of referential language and irreducible  allusiveness will be shown as constitutive of Kafka\u2019s texts. This will  also be the context to discuss the problematization of the real, of judgment,  of justice, and the law that suffuses Kafka\u2019s writing.  SPRING 2010  G51.3399: Comparative Poetics:  Lyric Poetry - Prof. Ulrich Baer  This course is taught in English and  originates in the Comparative Literature Department.  A seminar that examines different  approaches to lyric poetry as a genre, a sensibility, a mood (Stimmung).  Particular emphasis will be placed on the modern lyric from formalist,  historicist, rhetorical/deconstructive, hermeneutic, cultural-sociological  (materialist), literary historical, philosophical perspectives. We will examine  how lyric poetry teaches us about these approaches and the relationship between  them, and to what extent poems contains their own ars poetica (\u201cthe art of  poetry\u201d)\u2013 or how reading poetry can teach us how to read in general. We will focus on a selection of poems  by the following authors: Sappho, Pindar, Du Fu, Li Po; William Wordsworth,  Percy Bysshe Shelley, John Keats, Robert Browning; Emily Dickinson, Walt  Whitman, Wallace Stevens, Elizabeth Bishop, Anne Carson; Friedrich H\u00f6lderlin,  Rainer Maria Rilke; Charles Baudelaire, St\u00e9phane Mallarm\u00e9, Paul Celan; Yehuda  Amichai, Octavio Paz.  The seminar will instruct students in  basic and advanced skills of interpreting lyric poetry, and in recognizing the  differences between periods, forms, and poets. It is also intended as a  reflection on the field of comparative literature by reading comparatively a  range of poets from distinct backgrounds and traditions. We will also compare existing  methodologies in the interpretation of literary works.  G51.1863: Psychoanlysis &amp;  Philosophy: Genealogies of Psychoanalysis -   Prof. Larry Rickels      Psychoanalysis, as institution of  higher yearning, is open to the address of the Superhuman, the Psycho, and the  Android. The following movies will be referred to  during class discussions: Batman Forever, Batman Returns, Dr. No, From  Russia with Love, Octopussy, Psycho, Halloween, Nightmare on Elm Street, Blade  Runner, Total Recall, and Minority Report .    G51.2912: Literature &amp;  Philosophy: Decadence -  Prof. Eckart Goebel       In his diaries young Robert Musil  portrays himself as \u201cMonsieur le vivisecteur,\u201d and thus provides this graduate  course on \u201cd\u00e9cadence\u201d with a certain perspective on a European movement. We  will read some famous texts from the 19th century from Pater to Wilde focusing  on their insights into the less boring aspects of the conditio humana, psychological,  physiological, sexual, and artistic subtleties: \u201cBeing natural is simply a  pose, and the most irritating pose I know\u201d (Wilde). The second part of the  class will discuss seminal works from the 20th century which were, for example  by Georg Luk\u00e1cs, banned as documents of \u201cbourgeois decadence,\u201d such as the  works of Kafka, and even Beckett. \u201cI think he is a little deranged,\u201d the  narrator says about Bartleby who prefers not to function in Downtown Manhattan.  The seminar intends to discuss the critical potential of those who are a little  deranged, dysfunctional, d\u00e9goutant, or decadent.  G51.1513: Brecht - Prof. Robert Cohen  Dialogical and intertextual to the  core, Brecht's oeuvre can be seen as an open-ended critical conversation with  philosophical, theoretical, political, economic, and aesthetic discourses from  Aristotle to Marx, Luk\u00e1cs, and Benjamin, as well as with readers and  theatergoers, with collaborators, colleagues and lovers. The result of these  conversations is a work in progress, a collection of unstable and endlessly revised  texts exploring the human experience in a time of class struggle, violence, and  war.  The course is conceived as a general  introduction to Brecht's work. Topics include the experience of the modern  metropolis; the disintegration of social and sexual relations; the destruction  of identity and the construction of a 'collective individuality;' Brecht's  Marxism and his contribution to a new dialectics; Brecht's formal innovations  in drama and poetry, and his theater theories.  Before any of the controversies which  Brecht's work evokes, it needs to be understood as literature. Discussions in  class will be based on close readings of the texts \u2013 poetry, plays, and  theoretical writings \u2013 and on the way meaning is produced through Brecht's  performative use of language (\" Gestus \"), as well as through  his use of modern\u00ad\u00adist literary techniques such as montage, frag\u00admen\u00adtation,  repetition, and distanciation/alienation (\"Verfremdung\").  FALL 2009  G51.1716 - Autobiographical Writing:  The Day in Writing (Diaries)   - Prof. Elke Siegel Das Tagebuch \u2013 in seiner modernen  Erscheinung seit dem 18. Jahrhundert als \u2018pers\u00f6nliches Tagebuch\u2019 \u2013 bereitet der  Literaturwissenschaft Schwierigkeiten, die ins Herz ihrer g\u00e4ngigen  Begrifflichkeiten \u2013 etwa Autorschaft und Gattung \u2013 treffen. Wie \u2013 dies eine  Fragen im Zentrum der Arbeit in diesem Seminar \u2013 ist ein solches  fragmentarisches Schreiben zu lesen, begreift man das Tagebuch nicht vorrangig  als Steinbruch f\u00fcr Informationen zu Biographie und Werkgeschichte oder als  historisches Dokument? Die Spannung von Ich und Welt, Alltag und Geschichte,  Subjektivit\u00e4t und Objektivit\u00e4t, \u00d6ffentlichkeit und Privatheit, Fiktion und  Dokumentarismus \u00f6ffnet und verhandelt jedes einzelne Tagebuch neu. Damit  widersteht dieses Schreiben am Rande der Form verallgemeinernden Bestimmungen.  Im Seminar werden wir uns mit ausgew\u00e4hlten Tageb\u00fcchern der deutschsprachigen  Literatur vom 18. bis zum 20. Jahrhundert besch\u00e4ftigen und dabei auch  beobachten, wie TagebuchautorInnen sich auf die Tageb\u00fccher anderer beziehen und  damit literarische Traditionslinien er\u00f6ffnen und/oder verweigern. Wir werden \u2013  in G\u00e4nze oder Ausz\u00fcgen \u2013 die Tageb\u00fccher u.a. folgender Autoren und Autorinnen  lesen: Lavater, Goethe, Hebbel, Grillparzer, Kafka, Doderer, J\u00fcnger, Frisch,  Frank, Wolf, Goetz, Gr\u00fcnbein, dies vor dem Hintergrund theoretischer  Interventionen von, z.B., Barthes, Genette und Blanchot. Besondere  Aufmerksamkeit wird dabei dem Problem des Autobiographischen (Philippe Lejeune)  gelten, sowie der Frage nach dem Verh\u00e4ltnis von Alltag und Schreiben.  Welche Rolle \u2013 dies eine der m\u00f6glichen  weiteren Fragen, die im Seminar zur Diskussion stehen werden \u2013 kommt dem  Tagebuch in der Geschichte des Subjekts zu? Welche Bedeutung erh\u00e4lt dabei der  Akt der Relekt\u00fcre des eigenen Tagebuchs? Registriert das Tagebuch den Tag oder  versucht es, ein Leben, einen Lebensplan zu projizieren? Und wie ist es um die  Literarizit\u00e4t des Tagebuchs bestellt? Handelt es sich bei dem im Datum  verankerten Schreiben gar um eine sch\u00fctzende Geste vor den Gefahren des  Schreibens und der Zeit, die das Subjekt zu zerschlagen drohen?    G51.2700 - TPCS: Representations of  Death - Prof.  Elisabeth Bronfen  The act of dying is something one can  expect or something one can witness. Yet it defies all unmediated articulation.  Representations of death, in turn, can be horrifying, fascinating or morally  elevating. In all cases, however, death has been translated into an image or a  story, and as such contained. The mortality we experience is not our own; the  medium we engage with is not the materiality of the mortal body but the  mediality of aesthetic signs. Death is the limit of representation but also one  of its most seminal sources of inspiration. The seminar will engage this  complex interface between death and represenation by looking at fictions  (Goethe's Elective Affinities, Poe's Tales and Sketches), Hitchcock's late  trilogy (Rear Window, Vertigo, Psycho), Freud's speculations on death, as well  as recycling of death photography (Andy Warhol, Jeff Wall).       G51.1112 - Problems in Critical Theory:  Metaphors, Examples, Anecdotes   - Prof. Paul Fleming  The course will explore the role of  para-theoretical (e.g., poetic, rhetorical, and narrative) elements within  philosophy and critical theory. In particular, it will examine the status of  the literary-rhetorical elements as at once illuminating and obscuring thought,  whereby the didactic function of metaphors, examples, and anecdotes lies in  compelling the reader to continually return to and hermeneutically re-examine  the material. The central focus will be on metaphors, examples, and anecdotes  in Western thought from Plato and the Bible to Classical rhetoric (Horace and  Quinitilian) to contemporary theory (DeMan, Derrida, Benjamin, and Blumenberg).  G51.2912 - Literature &amp; Philosophy:  Hegel, Freud, &amp; Literature   - Prof. Avital Ronell &amp; Prof. Slavoj Zizek  G51.1824 - Nietzsche's Impact on 20th  Century Thought - Prof.  Friedrich Ulfers  The objective of the seminar is to show  how Nietzsche revolutionized Western philosophy by transforming its dualistic-metaphysical  worldview into a holistic one that corresponds to the reality of the world as  one interrelated, processual whole. It will also show how this transformation  influenced significantly what is known as \u201cContinental Philosophy,\u201d which  includes such figures as Heidegger, Derrida, and Deleuze. Particular attention  will be paid to the meaning of Nietzsche\u2019s pronouncement that \u201cGod is dead\u201d;  his declaration that the world is \u201cWill to Power \u201d and an \u201caesthetic  phenomenon\u201d; and his idea of \u201cEternal Recurrence.\u201d Also discussed will be the  role language plays in Nietzsche\u2019s view on epistemology and ontology, his  revaluation of morality, and his influence on the arts.  G51.3000 - Independent Research   SPRING 2009   G51.2912 \u2013 Literature &amp; Philosophy:  Theories of Time - Prof. Paul North  In this class we will read texts that  consciously try to regain time as a concept, category, or intuition after the  European enlightenment. Following a singular development, starting from a  theorization of the transcendental subject of experience by means of time in  Kant, we will move toward the pointed dismantling of this configuration in  Heidegger, interestingly enough, also by means of time. Bookending the  course\u2014but not merely that\u2014the first and last volumes of Proust\u2019s In Search of  Lost Time will help explain the urgency that seems to characterize the gesture  toward time in what has been called \u201cmodernity.\u201d  G51.1720 \u2013 Echoes of Antiquity: Germany  and the Gre eks - Prof. John  Hamilton  This seminar investigates the rise and  development of German Philhellenism from Winckelmann to Heidegger. Topics  include antiquarianism and national identity; originality, genius, and  tradition; pedagogy and revolution; the formation of the lyrical subject;  representations of the classical body; Dionysus and theories of tragedy;  philology, classical scholarship, and institutional history .  G51.1919 \u2013 Literature of the Weimer  Period: Philosophical Anthropology   - Prof. Eckart Goebel       The course provides a careful close  reading of key texts on philosophical anthropology. We will start with Kant\u2019s  highly influential Anthropologie in pragmatischer Hinsicht, followed by a  reconstruction of Nietzsche\u2019s theory of civilization developed in his  Morgenr\u00f6te, focusing mainly on book 1. The second part of the seminar is meant  to discuss Arnold Gehlen\u2019s notorious book on Der Mensch (including an analysis  of the famous radio debate between Gehlen, and Adorno, provided in copy), as  well as a discussion of Martin Heidegger\u2019s critique of philosophical anthropology,  formulated in his book on Kant und das Problem der Metaphysik (including, as an  appendix, the seminal debate between Cassirer and Heidegger in Davos). The  seminar will provide background information on further reading, such as Helmuth  Plessner, Max Scheler, and Michel Foucault. Books: Immanuel Kant, Schriften zur  Anthropologie, Werkausgabe Bd. XII (Suhrkamp Taschenbuch) Friedrich Nietzsche,  Morgenr\u00f6the, Kritische Studienausgabe (dtv-Taschenbuch) Arnold Gehlen, Der  Mensch, Aula paperback Ausgabe Helmuth Plessner, Die Stufen des Organischen und  der Mensch, de Gruyter paperback  G51.1994 \u2013 Realism: Problems in 19th  Century Prose - Prof. Paul Fleming         This seminar is a systematic  introduction to the problems of representation in 19th-century prose, particularly  with respect to notions of the everyday, the ordinary, and the average. The  course explores to what extent language can produce a \u2018reality effect,\u2019 and  whether the quotidian, by means of such detailed description, necessarily leaps  into the realm of the exemplary. Authors include Tieck, Grillparzer, Keller,  Stifter, and Fontane.  G29.2640 - Romanticism &amp; Revolution - Prof. Richard Sieburth       The course will explore various  literary and philosophical reactions to the French Revolution during the late 18th  and early 19th centuries in Germany, England, and France.  FALL 2008  Goethe: The Art of Dilettantism - Paul Fleming  This seminar examines Goethe\u2019s  literature and thought through the prism of dilettantism, the art of doing  things in a non-professional manner. Dilettantism for Goethe is a modern  phenomenon, concomitant with the rise of the bourgeois subject, and is thus  inextricable from questions surrounding art, education, and knowledge since the  18th century. In addition to Goethe\u2019s poetry, prose, and drama, we will also  examine his aesthetic, scientific, and autobiographical writings. A further  focal point will be the reception of Goethe and the question of tradition.   Object Relations: Melanie Klein - Laurence Rickels (Visiting Professor)  The seminar will focus on the work of  Melanie Klein, its point of departure in Karl Abraham\u2019s reflections on  melancholia and its running commentary on (and continuity with) Freud\u2019s \u201csecond  system.\u201d The delegation of Klein\u2019s thought proceeds via a series of controversies:  Klein\u2019s followers were largely guided and contextualized via the contest with  the \u201cAnna Freudians\u201d in London in the 1940s, while Klein\u2019s reception today (in  the humanities) is inflected by the ambivalent revalorization of her work  within French Freud.  War, Text, Image - Elisabeth Bronfen (Distinguished  Global Professor of German)       War: Literally a state of open, armed,  often prolonged, conflict carried on between nations, states, or parties.  Figuratively a condition of active antagonism or contention. War is not only a  concrete condition but also a trope for all the other antagonisms that  structure our sense of who we are, what our relation is to the world, and how  others relate to us. Point of departure for this seminar is the question why  the political situation of embattlement has served so resiliently as theme,  scene, topos and Denkfigur in our cultural imagination. The seminar will  involve four domains of inquiry: 1. Shakespeare's Henry V and its  cinematic afterlife; 2. Kleist's Penthesilea and the battle of the  sexes; 3. Cinematic enactments of battlescenes; and 4. Cultural theoretical  issues involved in the representation of war.   SPRING 2008  Interdisciplinary approaches to  Literature: German Music and Letters   - Prof. John Hamilton  This seminar examines the history of  music and music theory in specific relation to German literature, philosophy,  and criticism. Particular focus is given to the employment of music as a  privileged metaphor in literary projects as well as music\u2019s distance from and appropriation  of verbal and linguistic structures. Session topics include: theories of the  harmony of the spheres; synaesthesia, Romanticism and Universalpoesie ;  Wagner, tragedy and the Gesamtkunstwerk ; absolute music and the  tone-poem; secularization and the rise of chromatization; the semiotics of  music; and music and psychoanalysis. Historical and cultural contexts will be  presented as a number of predominant theoretical questions are developed,  including but not limited to the following: the presumed immediacy or  singularity of musical expression versus the mediation or abstraction of verbal  language; the relation of tonal language and text; the reciprocal,  philosophical critique of music and poetry; the \u201cliteralization\u201d of music;  patriotism, nationalism, and racism. The course ends with a close reading of  Thomas Mann\u2019s Doktor Faustus , a novel that is profoundly critical  of, while being thoroughly informed by, the tradition outlined here.          Archive, Image, Text - Prof. Ulrich Baer  This interdisciplinary seminar explores  the role of the archive as the actual and conceptual origin or grounding  context of much, if not all, research in the arts and humanities. Virtually all  intellectual inquiry into artistic and humanistic expression \u2013 whether we are  considering artworks, literary texts or scholarly productions \u2013 ultimate makes  reference to one authoritative version of the object under discussion. This  version is most frequently housed in some kind of actual or virtual archive  from where the work is canonized, and effectively put into circulation.  The archive is supposed to guarantee  authenticity while permitting revisions and rethinking of the humanistic  heritage. The archive is thus at once the solid reference point and grounding  origin of scholarly work, and the site where prevailing views are most  effectively challenged or overthrown. This class will examine two particular  aspects of this process: the notion of the archive as an actual physical  location that houses actual objects and artifacts beyond an artist\u2019s lifespan,  and the metaphor of the archive as the receptacle of past knowledge and a  work\u2019s inalienable history. Different types of archives and issues will be  addressed, since we will include literary works, art objects, political  documents, racial and national repositories as well as technological storage  \u201cspaces\u201d in our discussions. Guest speakers, experts on various types of  research materials, will supplement lectures by the two professors, who  specialize in the history and theory of modern texts and images respectively.  Updating classical concepts of the archive, we will try to examine how new  technologies are rapidly changing both the nature and the power of information,  and thus its repositories.  Anna Seghers, Christa Wolf &amp; Theory  of Narration - Prof. Robert Cohen  The works of Seghers and Wolf have  acquired iconic status. They appear overdetermined by their authors' identities  as women, as communists, as Jewish (Seghers) or Protestant (Wolf), as Nazi  victims (Seghers) or perpetrators (Wolf's childhood), and as key figures of  Weimar modern\u00adism (Seghers) and of the literature of the GDR. Analyses and  interpretations will proceed from close readings of the texts, with emphasis on  the theoretical problems of modernist narration and on the way meaning is constructed  in 20th century fiction (novels, novel\u00adlas, historical and autobio\u00adgraphical  fiction). Several sessions will be devoted to theories of narration from K\u00e4the  Hamburger, Franz Stanzel, and G\u00e9rard Genette, to Philippe Lejeune's theory of  autobiography. The sessions on Seghers will focus on the avant-gardist  narrative techniques of works such as Aufstand der Fischer von St. Barbara   and \"Der Ausflug der toten M\u00e4dchen.\"  Readings of other works \u2013 Transit ,  \"Die sch\u00f6nsten Sagen vom R\u00e4uber Woynok,\" Die Reisebegegnung\" \u2013  will investigate Seghers' repeated recourse to cross over narration (a woman  narrating as a man), and her use of mythology, fairy tales and the  fantastic as ways of disrupting traditional notions of realism. Discussions of  Wolf's work will focus on the late modernist agenda of transforming the  writer's own life into the subject of fiction ( Nachdenken \u00fcber Christa T. ,   St\u00f6rfall ); and on the construction of the female subject, and its  constantly threatened destruction in patriarchal society, from Nachdenken  \u00fcber Christa T. through its staging in historical ( Kein Ort. Nirgends )  and mythological costumes ( Kassandra ).        Exemplary Texts: Poetry &amp;  Experience - Prof. Avital  Ronell  In the Presence of Noise: Theories and  Media - Prof.  Hans-Christian von Herrman n At the end of the 1970s when the era of  the personal computer was dawning a new kind of media theories started to break  up with the sociological analysis of mass media communication by analyzing  modernity\u2019s technological unconscious. As the seminar will show these concepts  emerged from the confluence of three main sources: French poststructuralist  theory, Canadian media history and American information theory. The reading  list will include texts by Vil\u00e9m Flusser, Friedrich Kittler, Paul Virilio, R\u00e9gis  Debray, Niklas Luhmann, and others.  FALL 2007  Psychoanalysis and Philosophy: Love\u2019s  Body revisited. The Religion of Psychoanalysis - Professor Eckart Goebel        This graduate course is intended to  reread the relation between religion and psychoanalysis. The first part is  devoted to key figures of religious thought, such as St. Augustine, Pascal, and  Luther who were at the same time path breaking as analysts of the human psyche.  We will read Erikson\u2019s book on Luther since Erikson had the provocative thesis  that Luther actually invented what Freud then was forced to study 400 years  later. Before the seminar turns to Freud\u2019s writings on religion and monotheism  we will read a key book for the development of psychoanalysis, especially the  concepts of the Nirvana principle or the Death Drive: Schopenhauer\u2019s seminal  work on The World as Will and Representation . This first part is  followed by close readings of several Freudian writings. The overall goal of  this seminar is to equip students of literary studies with the background  information needed for a better understanding of modern literature and advanced  literary theory.  Literature and Philosophy: More  Trauma - Professor Avital  Ronell  Visual Culture - Taught by Prof. Elizabeth Bronfen  SPRING 2007  Origins of Critical thought II - Professor Paul Fleming  In this continuation of Origins of  Critical Thought, we follow two trajectories of critical thinking in Germany  since Hegel. The first is the hermeneutic-interpretative tradition  beginning with Schleiermacher, proceeding through Dilthey, Nietzsche, and  Freud, and ending with Gadamer\u2019s epochal work Truth and Method. The  second trajectory addresses the differences and disputes of the two most  influential critical directions in the 20th century: Heidegger  and the Frankfurt School. Finally, we will look at critical thought today  in Germany and its two most influential representatives: Kittler and Luhmann.  Whenever possible, we will try to create a dialogue \u2013 at times friendly, at  times antagonistic \u2013 between two thinkers for each session.   Postwar Modernism: Max Frisch &amp;  Peter Weiss, - Professor Robert  Cohen       Though neither Max Frisch nor Peter  Weiss was German, they were key figures in the reconstitution of (West-) German  post-war litera\u00adture. Their works are both paradigmatic of, and different from,  the literature of their German contemporaries (Andersch, B\u00f6ll, K\u00f6ppen, Walser)  which emerged out of the collapse of Germany. From vantage points located at  the periphery of German culture (Switzerland in the case of Frisch, Sweden for  Peter Weiss) the two authors functioned like seismographs reacting to post-war  reality. Their use of innovative and avant-gardism forms in drama and prose  reflects the problematic of recovering the recent past and decoding a complex  present. After prose works exploring the immediate post-war trauma and  reconstituting the (literary) subject both Frisch and Weiss turned to drama and  produced works which focus on anti-Semitism and Auschwitz. These plays will be  read against canonized texts by Sartre and Adorno. Frisch and Weiss's evolution  from modernist into post-modernist writing will be traced through their later  works which decenter and dissolve narrative certainty and signal a new kind of  text with unstable and multiple meanings and uncertain chronologies. In order  to situate these works in the aesthetic and literary context of the postwar  period, two sessions will be devoted to theories of modernism, the avant-garde,  and postmodernism. Beyond \u2013 and before \u2013 all the topical issues these works  evoke, however, they need to be understood as literature. Discussions in class  will be based on close readings, on the narrative and dramatic structures of  these texts, and generally on the way meaning is produced in literary texts.  FALL 2006   Theories of History - Professor Werner Hamacher  In Theories of History we are  going to discuss some of the classical texts from the history of thinking about  history \u2013 in particular Kant\u00b4s \"Idea for a Universal History\" and  \"An Old Question Raised Again: Is the Human Race Constantly  Progressing?\", Hegel\u00b4s lecture course on \"Philosophy of  History\", the relevant paragraphs from Heidegger\u00b4s \"Being and  Time\" and Benjamin\u00b4s notes on the structure of history and cognition.          Fascism &amp; Sexuality - Professor Christopher Clark  This seminar will explore the  relationships between fascism (primarily, but not exclusively in its German  form) and sexuality. Primary topics of analysis in this course are the central  importance of sexuality to fascism not only in historical practice but in  theory, as well as the (dubiously) privileged status of sexuality in theories  of fascism continuing through today. We will begin with the Nazi era, noting  what constituted acceptable and forbidden expressions of gender and sexuality,  in theory and in everyday life. We will proceed through the postwar era to the  present, examining the ways in which artists, theorists, and historians have  continually portrayed and analyzed fascism in sexual terms, paying particular  attention to the recurring figure of \u201cthe gay Nazi.\u201d We will also address such  phenomena as gays and lesbians in the Holocaust (and debates over their  memorialization), the intrinsic homophobia of much antifascist critique, the  1970s \u201cNaziploitation film,\u201d and contemporary queer skinheads, with an eye  toward which of these are historically specific and which still determine the  terms and framing of discourse on fascism today. Readings/viewings include  Mann, Hitler, Genet, Sontag, Mosse, Theweleit, Fassbinder, Visconti, Cavani,  Pasolini, LaBruce, and others. No expertise in spoken or written German is  required for participation in the course. However, graduate students from the  Department of German, as well as students from other departments who are  concentrating in part on German literature, will be expected to read a number  of the primary texts in the original German.       Der Mann ohne Eigenschaften - Professor Eckart Goebel  Torture and Authority - Professor Avital Ronell  Led by an overriding concern with the  concept of legitimacy , the course offers a wide ranging  theoretical exploration of modalities of torture and the underpinnings of  authority. Some topoi, ranging from the chain gang to the culture of bondage  and national political behaviors, include penal styles, the disappearance and  returns of torture as spectacle, the punishment-body, the right to punish, the  punitive ceremony as an exercise of terror, forces of revenge, the final exam,  and so forth. We will take recourse to key psychoanalytic, philosophical and  literary texts that have established a lexicon of torture, gauging specific  effects of authority, whether betrayed, corrupt, book-bound, or legitimate. The  course will consider the status of minoritized, disenfranchized figures, those  subjected to legal as well as institutional persecution. One starting point  will be Adorno's thoughts on the \"authoritarian personality,\" which  gets profiled close by, in conjunction with Blanchot's pages in The Infinite  Conversation , \"The Indestructible.\"  SPRING 2006        Photography &amp; the World - Professor Ulrich Baer  An investigation into the ways  photography has been conceptualized since its inception until its recent  transformation brought about by the advent of digital imaging. Particular  attention will be paid to the notion of the \u2018world\u2019 as it informs most  theoretical attempts to grasp photography; the way in which the rise of  photography is indissociably linked to the emergence of psychoanalysis and  phenomenology; theories of perception; issues of veracity, mimesis, and  aesthetics; and the relation between photography and its historical moment.          Kafka   - Professor Friedrich Ulfers  The course will deal with Kafka\u2019s work  largely in the light of the author\u2019s preoccupation with language particularly  with the way this preoccupation affected his writing, indeed provided the theme  of it. The point of departure will be the experience of \u201clanguage crisis\u201d among  intellectuals and writers in turn of the century Austria, which led to the  radical language criticism \u2013 already foreshadowed by Nietzsche \u2013 of Fritz Mauthner  and Ludwig Wittgenstein among others. An interpretation of Kafka\u2019s work aims to  show not only the influences of this thinking on his writing, but also how  Kafka radicalized it so as to make it \u201cKafkaesque.\u201d Another aspect of the  course will be to examine Kafka as anticipating a line of writing and thinking  that could be described as deconstructive. In this context,  undecidability, the breakdown of referential language, and irreducible  allusiveness will be shown as constitutive of Kafka\u2019s texts. This will  also be the context to discuss the problematization of the real, of judgment,  of justice, and the law that suffuses Kafka\u2019s writing.       Literature &amp; Depression: The  Sickness to Death - Professor Eckart  Goebel  The seminar starts with an  investigation of seminal theoretical texts on mourning and melancholia (Freud,  Klein, Spielrein). It continues with close readings of canonical text of the  philosophical and literary tradition from Kierkegaard to T. S. Eliot, and  Heidegger. The course discusses the history of depression between mediation  (language, art), meditation (religion), and medication (Prozac) and tries to  reconstruct the role of art and poetry within this flexible scaffolding.          Brecht - Professor Robert Cohen  Dialogical and intertextual in the  extreme, Brecht's oeuvre can be seen as an endless critical conversation with  readers and theatergoers, with collaborators, colleagues and lovers, as well as  with philosophical, theoretical, political, economic, and aesthetic theories  from Aristotle to Marx, Lukacs, and Benjamin. The result of these conversations  is a work in progress, a collection of unstable and endlessly revised texts  exploring the human experience in a time of class struggle, violence, and war.  Within this framework the course is conceived as a general introduction to  Brecht's work. Some of the topics the course will focus on are: the experience  of the modern metropolis; the destruction of identity and the construction of a  'collective individuality;' the disintegration of social and sexual relations;  Brecht's Marxism and his contribution to a new dialectics; Brecht's formal  innovations in drama and poetry, and his theater theories. Beyond all the  controversial issues which Brecht's oeuvre (and life) evoke, it needs to be  understood as literature.

A-E | F-K | L-Q | R-Z                     Akhtar, Asif   Asif Akhtar holds an MA in Politics from the New School for Social Research and a BA in International Studies and Economics from Ohio Wesleyan University. Having grown up in Lahore, Pakistan, Asif&rsquo;s research interests have come to converge on questions of how recently emerging industries and formats of 24-hour televised news in Pakistan are rapidly collapsing and reshaping spatial-temporal patterns &ndash; affecting the ways in which everyday practices and discourses of politics take place in the context of war and insurgency. Asif is keen on exploring dynamics of visibility, visual culture and representations of violence through ethnographic work, focusing particularly on how circuits of mediated cultural flows feed-back into political events &ndash; such as suicide blasts and terrorist attacks &ndash; influencing collective memory through nationwide broadcasts. After working on Wall St. and witnessing the mortgage crisis firsthand as a risk analyst from 2006-2008, Asif moved back to conduct research in Pakistan while gaining experience working as a journalist. Covering politics, culture and terrorism in Lahore, he has written for publications like the Guardian and Foreign Policy in addition to several prominent Pakistani print and online publications. Presently he is an active part of the Naked Punch editorial collective, publishing engaged reviews of art, thought and politics from the Third World. Asif also writes fiction and has published short stories and monographs.

Heuson, Jennifer   Jen Heuson is a scholar, traveler, and media artist currently pursuing her PhD in the Department of Media, Culture, and Communication at NYU. Her work critically engages the mediated production, consumption, and circulation of knowledge, culture, memory, sentiment, and identity during travel, both real and imagined. Specifically, she is interested in exploring links between experience, sensation, sentiment, and liveness or everydayness, on one hand, and mediated histories, epistemologies, and politics, on the other. Jen's work engages these questions through traditional academic forms (conference, journal, thesis) and through various multimedia inquiries (sound ethnography, film documentary, tourist performance). Her award-winning films have screened internationally at venues as diverse as FLEX Fest, Big Muddy, Black Maria, and the Margaret Mead Film &amp; Video Festival. Her dissertation investigates tourist soundscapes in the Black Hills of South Dakota, exploring the acoustic aspects of historical, cultural, and national pedagogy and performance.

Kneese, Tamara   Tamara&rsquo;s work examines what happens to your digital assets after you die and why this matters. Digital estate planning websites allow social networking site users to concretize and control otherwise ephemeral forms of personhood, passing image management rights on to kin members. Unpaid labor on the part of Facebook users, for example, produces a profit for the company, but also does something for the users great enough to make countless hours of free labor worth it, to the point where individuals wish to archive and preserve their digital remains even after they die. How are we to define value in a post-Fordist economy, and what do affective investments on the part of immaterial laborers produce? Before completing her MA in social sciences at the University of Chicago and moving to Brooklyn, Tamara earned a BA in anthropology from a cornfield in Ohio (aka Kenyon College). Tamara&rsquo;s broader interests include affective labor, networks, digital archives, technology and the occult, social media, and vintage clothes.           Koslov, Elizabeth   Liz Koslov is a PhD candidate in the Department of Media, Culture, and Communication at New York University. Her dissertation explores what mediates people&rsquo;s understandings of climate change and their ability to adapt to its effects. More specifically, it is an ethnography of &ldquo;managed retreat&rdquo; on Staten Island after Hurricane Sandy that analyzes the social and political dynamics of urban coastal retreat, and the role of media such as flood maps and local news in collective climate change adaptation. Liz has spoken about this research in the New Yorker and on WNYC&rsquo;s Brian Lehrer Show . At NYU, she is also a research assistant at the Institute for Public Knowledge and a member of the Superstorm Research Lab . Before beginning her PhD, Liz received an MSc in Culture and Society from the Department of Sociology at the London School of Economics and a BA in Communication and Spanish and Latin American Literature from the George Washington University. koslov@nyu.edu / lizkoslov.com / @LizKoslov .          Kulkarni, Kavita   Kavita holds a BA in Sociology from Emory University and an MA in Interdisciplinary Studies from NYU under the advisement of Stephen Duncombe. Her MA thesis considered the role of spectacular culture within grassroots progressive movements in the US through ethnographic work with graphic designers, communicators, and messaging professionals operating within economic and social justice campaigns. Prior to pursuing her doctoral degree, Kavita worked as a community organizer on various economic justice issues in Atlanta and spent four years as a digital media strategist and planner for IBM through the ad firm Neo@Ogilvy. Her current work as a PhD candidate broadly considers how cultural activity in urban public spaces is regulated as neighborhoods are revalorized and gentrified, and looks specifically at an open-air dance music festival that has taken place in central Brooklyn&rsquo;s Fort Greene Park for the past 12 years.                     LaRiviere, Jason   Jason hails from Western Massachusetts. He holds a BA in philosophy from the University of Southern California and an MA in film studies from Columbia University.

Agamben and Stiegler); video games; and hip hop.          Li, Xiaochang   Xiaochang holds B.A. in Comparative Literature from NYU, where she acquired an uncharisteristically thorough acquaintance with the work of Marcel Proust while moonlighting in the Computer Science department. She received her S.M. In Comparative Media Studies at MIT, with research focused on the circulation of East Asian television drama online and how participatory digital practices and the increased visibility of audience-driven transnational media flows complicate existing models of diaporic audienceship, publics, and cultural negotiation in an increasingly global media landscape. While at MIT, she was a core researcher at the Convergence Culture Consortium, a research group working to foster collaboration and knowledge-exchange between academia and the media industries. She remains a consulting researcher with the Consortium and is Fellow with Futures of Entertainment , a network of researchers and practicioners across academia, media, technology, and advertising. Prior to joining MCC, she worked at a Digital Brand Strategist at Weber Shandwick , the world&rsquo;s largest PR agency, where she worked on digital and global communications strategy with clients such as PepsiCo and Samsung. Her current interests broadly include location-based and context-aware technologies, public space and history, metadata, and the critical geographies of virtual space. She has a well developed sense of programmer envy, and spends an unlikely amount of time thinking about how to apply agile development and rapid prototyping to academic research. She blogs at Canarytrap.net and can be found on twitter @Xiaochang          Lin, Lana   BA in Communications, University of Iowa; MFA in Film, Bard College. Lana's recent work emerges from the interrelation between current events and residues of the past, highlighting the contingency of memory and the haunting of daily life by the specter of socio-political inequities. Media criticism, feminism, psychoanalysis, and race and gender studies inform her investigation into the ethics of representation. Her films have shown at the Museum of Modern Art and the Whitney Museum, among other venues. She has contributed to publications including Cabinet, Rethinking Marxism, and Considering Forgiveness, published by the Vera List Center for Art and Politics. A recipient of awards from the Fulbright Foundation, Civitella Ranieri Foundation, and Jerome Foundation, among others, she has taught at the Massachusetts College of Art, City College of New York, and is currently faculty in the MFA in Visual Arts program at Vermont College of Fine Arts.           Lockett, Will   Will works on digital games, but only sort of. His current project is to understand the relation between game design practice (generously conceived), skill acquisition processes, and the politics of skill in the context of post-industrial capitalism. He approaches these issues through a set of objects skirting the boundaries of what counts as a digital game&mdash;such as music and image production apps for mobile devices, one-off responsive environments built in research-creation labs, and indie games that renew and reinvent the tradition of 3D simulation handed down to us since the Quake engine. The philosophies and histories that work to comprise these objects include phenomenology and process philosophy, theories of post-industrial capitalism, art&rsquo;s histories of perception, the history of cognitive science and systems theory, and a hodgepodge of methods useful for the fine-grained description of technical objects. While completing his MA in Art History through McGill&rsquo;s department of Art History and Communication Studies, Will worked on Husserlian phenomenology of time consciousness, Conterstrike 1.6 , and The Night Journey under the supervision of Christine Ross. His BA is in Comp Lit and Philosophy: University of Western Ontario, London, ON.           Melton, Paul   Paul's research interests focus on culture and consumption &ndash; the ways in which culture is consumed, the ways in which consumption becomes culture, and, particularly, the technologies that mediate cultural production and consumption. Before pursuing his PhD, Paul spent 10 years working in communications across five countries and several industries, including information technology, telecommunications, and international development. Paul holds undergraduate degrees in mathematics (thesis \" Applications of Moving Mesh Methods to 2D Orthogonal Grid Generation\") and Spanish literature (theses \"Vispera del gozo: Hacia una lectura posmoderna / posfeminista de la vanguardia espa&ntilde;ola,\" and \"Amores de segunda mano: Disidencia sexual/textual en los cuentos de Enrique Serna\"), with honors in both.          Mendelsohn, Ben   Ben&rsquo;s research deals with infrastructure networks, landscape and mediation. His recent work looks at underwater dredging and sediment management technologies in relation to the so-called Anthropocene. In addition to scholarly writing, he also produces short video documentaries. He earned his MA in Media Studies at The New School and his bachelors in English Literature from Ohio University's Honors Tutorial College.          Merid, Beza   Beza is a doctoral candidate broadly interested in the ways in which individuals and institutions act on suffering bodies.
