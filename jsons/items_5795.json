Frequently Asked Questions                                           Where can I study?                               NYU offers undergraduate academic opportunities in many of the world's most fascinating cities--Abu Dhabi, Accra, Berlin, Buenos Aires, Florence, London, Madrid, Paris, Prague, Shanghai, Sydney, Tel Aviv, and Washington, DC. Current NYU undergraduates and students at other accredited colleges are eligible to enroll for a semester or academic year. NYU students are also eligible to apply for the International Exchange Program. Other international opportunities are offered by individual schools of the University during the semester, Summer Sessions, or January Term.                                                                When am I eligible to study away from my degree campus?                               A small group of NYU freshmen are selected to begin their NYU degree outside the United States. Other students are eligible to study abroad once they have reached sophomore status, and through their last semester senior year. Students must complete one year on a college campus enrolled full-time to be considered a sophomore.                                                                   Do I need to know a foreign language to enroll?                               Each NYU location offers courses instructed in English as well as in the local language. Students with no language background will choose a beginner level language course, while advanced students will choose one or more courses instructed in the local language.                                                              If I am not a US citizen, may I study at one of the NYU locations?                               International students who are enrolled in US-accredited colleges and universities are eligible to study with NYU as a short-term visting student. Students must currently be enrolled in order to be eligible.                                                                Are graduate students eligible to study away?                               The Global Academic Centers offer undergraduate courses only except in the case of full degree programs offered in Florence, London, Madrid, and Paris. There are numerous international opportunities for graduate students offered through schools and departments. Check with your academic department to see which programs are available                                                              May I study at one of the NYU locations if I am not an NYU student?                               NYU welcomes applications from all students attending US-accredited colleges and universities. You are encouraged to talk with an adviser at your home university to ensure you will receive credit for classes taken at NYU. NYU is accredited by the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools.                                       Questions?

Specialized programs are available in Africana studies, art and architecture, business, mathematics, British literature and writing, pre-health, and psychology. Courses in math, biology, chemistry, and physics accommodate students whose schedules might not otherwise allow for a semester of global study. Additionally, NYU is the only institution in London to offer science courses approved by the American Medical College Application Service (AMCAS) for medical school admittance. NYU London encourages students to enroll in for-credit internships with key institutions in fields including marketing, finance, media, law, politics, health, and theatre.     Students who spend a semester at NYU London live and learn in the heart of Bloomsbury, a neighborhood that is home to the British Museum, the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, and the West End (London\u2019s famous theatre district). Each semester, NYU London staff plans day trips to places such as the historic cities of Bath, Cambridge, and Oxford. In addition to exploring London\u2019s myriad cultural sites, students often participate in short-term or semester-long community service projects.
