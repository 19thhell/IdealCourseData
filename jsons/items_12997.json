The material here contains the data we used in our book.  Additionally, we have all the batch files we used to generate the results. We  present these materials for several reasons. First, we are all believer in  replication. The materials here allow anyone to replicate our results. This is  particularly important since many of our results are presented in abbreviated  form, rather than full regression output. Second, in the book we discuss and  allude to many results that, for brevity, we do not present. Many of these  analyses are contained here. Third, we believe the selectorate model is a power  tool for explaining politics. While in the book we attempt to present results  illustrative of the model\u2019s implications, our analyses are far from  comprehensive. In addition to the variables discussed in the book, the data  contained here has numerous additional variables. For example we have numerous  alternative measures of GDP. We hope the availability of this data will  encourage scholars to pursue what we believe to be a fruitful research  agenda. Finally, we recognize that many  scholars are best convinced when they \u2018see it for themselves\u2019. We think such  skepticism is healthy. We have no doubt that scholars analyzing our results for  themselves will we see the robustness of our results and recognize that we have  not selectively picked only those results that directly support our arguments  and ignored other.          Important Note      To the best of our  knowledge, the data we provide are either in the public domain (i.e. readily  available on the internet or in printed form) or we have been granted the right  to distribute the data (for instance, the WBDI). If you believe any of the data  we provide does not fit within either of the first two categories then please  contact us.      Structure of the Material      In  compiling our data, we have utilized numerous existing works. We thank the  scholars responsible for these studies for making their data available to us  and others. Where appropriate we have included the original codebooks. We have  four basic sections: our datasets, the code used to generate our results in  batch files (and the coded used to compile the data), the output files for our  results, and codebooks. All our materials are in STATA 7, the program we used  throughout. This statistical package is available through www.stata.com .  Several programs exist that convert data between various formats, for  example StatTransfer ( www.stattransfer.com ),  although these will not convert the code that replicates our analyses. Many  files are zipped to save space.        Datasets      We have two basic datasets. In the first ( bdm2s2_nation_year_data.dta ), our unit of observation is nation-year. I.e. we have US 1950, 1951, 1952 and Canada 1950, 1951 etc. In the second (bdm2s2_leader_year_data.dta), the unit of observation is leader-year. Thus the same nation year might appear twice. For instance in the US 2001, both William J. Clinton and George W. Bush are coded as President.        As far as possible we indicate the origins of the variables,  with variable labels. We also compile extracts from the appropriate codebooks  for those interested in the details of the coding. The appendix to this  document contains a list of variables. The following abbreviations indicate  data sources: Banks refers to Arthur S. Banks Cross National Time Series Data  Archive 2001 . Polity 4  refers to the latest release of the Polity project .

COW refers to the Correlates of War data project .   Datavine refers to a variety of dataset compiled on the web at  http://paradocs.pols.columbia.edu/datavine/MainPage.jsp. Although we do not  make use of these data they provide alternative coding for many of our  variables, hence we include them in the data to allow robustness testing.        1) Data      Nation Year Main Data: bdm2s2_nation_year_data.dta      Leader Data: leader_data.zip      Constituent Data (Individual data used to compile our data):   constituent_data.zip          Batch files Results Codebooks The Logic of Political Survival .
