The Performance Studies Department is in the midst of it all, a few steps from the Public Theatre, a short subway ride from the burgeoning arts scenes of Brooklyn and Queens, right up against Washington Square Park with its always already multiple performative scenes. Once, I asked John Cage to define theatre for me. He replied: \"Look and listen.\" Being where we are, Performance Studies NYU is at the epicenter of what Cage was talking about.
