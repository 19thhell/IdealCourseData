Running through the course are three central concerns: 1) exploring claims about the &quot;new-ness&quot; of globalization from historical perspectives, 2) examining how a variety of social and cultural worlds mediate globalization and 3) analyzing a contested politics of globalization in which the opportunities for social mobility and transformation are pitted against renewed intensifications of exploitation and vulnerability along long-standing vectors of difference and inequality. While &quot;globalization&quot; is often touted as a &quot;flattening&quot; of the world, this course moves beyond such clich\u00e9s to understand the intersection between large-scale transformations in political economy and culture in and through multiple cultural worlds situated unevenly on the world's map.
