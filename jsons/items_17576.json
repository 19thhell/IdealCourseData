The Organic Electronics Lab maintains its interest in the solution and solid properties for electroactive macromolecules. The novel applications include solar cells and health diagnostics.   Visit website     Power and Power Electronics Engineering   Visit website     Shahrjerdi Nanoelectronics Research Lab   The focus of our research is in the areas of flexible electronics and solid-state nanoelectronics. Our aim is to create innovative devices to enable new functionalities and/or enhance performance. We study and engineer the optical and electrical properties of electronic materials such as semiconductor nanowires, compound semiconductors, graphene and other emerging 2D materials, often at extreme physical limits.   Visit website     Systems and Control Group (SCG)   The mission of the systems and control group is to model and design intelligent and autonomous systems. Initially developed in the context of electric circuits, recent applications have focused on complex, dynamic and networked systems, such as unmanned vehicles and power system networks. The field of systems and control provides essential enabling and supporting technologies for different applications in electrical engineering ranging from defense and manufacturing to telecommunications and bioengineering. NYU School of engineering has a long history of research in the area. Members of the group seek control tools and solutions for increasingly complex systems such as cyber-physical systems, neural systems, swarms of robots, or economic markets.   Visit website        Video Lab   Research activities in the Video Lab deal with how to encode and distribute video among a large number of users with diverse network access links, computing power, and energy resources. Another focus area is in biomedical image processing and distribution. The lab collaborates extensively with other faculty members and graduate students in wireless communication and networking at the School of Engineering, and with medical schools in the surrounding area.
