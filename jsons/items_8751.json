Motion is a perceptual attribute: the visual system infers motion from the changing pattern of light in the retinal image. Often the inference is correct. Sometimes it is not. In class I showed you a number of demonstrations in which motion is misperceived. Below is one example of a visual illusion of motion that I made. It is a tribute to Duchamp's cubist painting titled &quot;Nude Descending a Staircase&quot; in which the changing pattern of light gives the illustion of motion even though she never gets anywhere (you made need to double-click on the image below or reload the page for the animation to play).                                             Another example is the motion aftereffect. Stare at the center of the following animation for about a minute, as it expands continuously (you may need to reload the page to get it moving again after it stops), then fix your gaze on colorful texture pattern next it it.                        After viewing continuous motion in the same direction for a long  time, if you look at a stationary object, it appears to move in the  direction opposite to the one you were viewing. This is sometimes  called the \"waterfall illusion\" - if you look at a waterfall for a  while, then look at a tree next to  it, the tree appears to  move upward. The demonstration above shows that this adaptation is  local in the retina (to the right of where you were looking, you were  adapting to rightward motion, to the left you adapted to leftward, and  so on). We take this as evidence for the existence of neurons that are  sensitive to motion and selective for the direction of motion, which  adapt to the stimulus (analogous to color adaptation after-effects).      Below is yet another example of a motion illusion.           Role of motion perception: Motion perception serves lots of  helpful functions.         Simply detecting that something is moving, draws your attention  to  it.       Segmentation of foreground from background.      Compute the 3D shape of an object.      Compute the distance to various objects in the scene and estimate the direction in which you are heading within the scene. For example, hold up two fingers (one on each hand) at different distances, and move your head slowly from side to side while fixating an object on a far wall. Things that are further away slide across the retina more slowly. When there is strong motion on your retina, especially in peripheral regions, you can misattribute that motion and perceive yourself as moving (called &quot;vection&quot;). Movies (especially with large screens as in an IMAX theater) can give this illusion that you are moving.      Recognition actions, such as movements of a human (in the \"point  light displays\" shown in class of people walking, dancing, etc.,  displayed as the motion of a small number of dots attached to the  joints of the person).                    The image above is unrecognizable. But when set into motion, it is easy to interpret. Download and play the animation (4 Mb mpeg movie).

Optical Flow: The diagram below is a representation of the physical motion in an image while an observer moves through the environmet.                      Each arrow represents the speed and direction of motion for each  little patch of the visual field. Near points move fast (long arrows),  far points move slowly (short arrows). In this example, the arrows  point away from a  single point called the focus of expansion that corresponds to where the observer is heading. The first step in motion perception is for the visual system to estimate optical flow from the changing pattern of light in the retinal image. Then, the 3D motions of observer and objects can be inferred from the optical flow. The optic flow then provides information about the observer's heading and the relative distance to each surface in the world. J. J. Gibson hypothesized that there's sufficient information in the visual stimulus to specify a unique, unambiguous interpretation of 3D motion and depth. Recently, mathematicians have proven that this hypothesis is basically correct. There is a caveat, however: distance and speed are ambiguous (i.e., they trade off). That is, a small, close object when you are moving slowly creates the identical retinal images over time as a large, distant object when you are moving quickly. That's why you need a speedometer in your car. You are lousy at making absolute speed and distance judgements. But, you are very good at relative speed/direction and relative distance.           Object motion: Two different kinds of events can cause visual motion. When an observer moves through an otherwise stationary environment, the entire retinal image changes over time as discussed above. Or an object can move while the observer is stationary so that a small region of the retinal image changes over time. Often, of course, both of these things happen at once, but it is helpful to consider the two separately. Motion provides information about shape even in the complete absence of other shape cues (you made need to double-click on the image below or reload the page for the animation to play).                                             Here's another example.                                             Biological motion: Motion can provides information to allow the recognition human movements. This is true even for cases in which there is very limited information provided at only a few select points (you made need to double-click on the images below or reload the page for the animations to play).                                                                                                                           Visual Motion in the Brain      Functional specialization hypothesis: There are specific brain area(s) that are involved in visual motion perception.          Evidence for this includes a patient known as LM who, following a  stroke, had great difficulty  perceiving certain types of motion. Color vision and acuity remained  normal, and there was no difficulty recognizing faces or objects, no  difficulty with  stereo. But LM cannot see coffee  flowing into a cup: appears frozen like a glacier, does not perceive  the  fluid rising, and often lets the coffee spill or overflows. LM feels  uncomfortable in a crowded  room  or on a street. \"People were suddenly here or there, but I have not  seen  them moving... When I'm looking at the car first it seems far away, but  then  when I want to cross the road suddenly the car is very near\". LM's  lesion  extends  over a substantial region of visual cortex, so one can not localize  sharply  the  regions relevant to LM's motion deficit. This makes it particularly  surprising  that loss of motion perception can be so cleanly dissociated from other  visual  abilities.           Area MT is one of the most studied regions of the cortex of the brain, probably second only to V1. Current opinion is that the optical flow field is computed and represented by neurons in area MT.            Neurons in MT are selective for motion direction.      Neural responses in MT are correlated with the perception of motion.      Damage to MT or temporary inactivation causes deficits in visual motion perception. Electrical stimulation in MT causes changes in visual motion perception.      Computational theory quantitatively explains both the responses of MT neurons and the perception of visual motion.      Well-defined pathway of brain areas (cascade of neural computations) underlying motion specialization in MT.          MT neurons receive inputs from direction-selective neurons in V1. MT neurons are velocity selective, each responds best to a preferred velocity (speed and direction) within its receptive field, pretty much independent of stimulus pattern. By contrast, a direction-elective V1 neuron confounds motion with pattern. A typical V1 neuron responds to a particular orientation (edge or bar) moving in a particular direction. The response of the V1 neuron also increases with contrast. A typical MT neuron, on the other hand, responds to almost any pattern with almost any contrast, as long as it moves with the right velocity.            MT physiology movie (6.7 Mb QuickTime movie)           In class we viewed a video that demonstrates direction-selectivity of MT neurons. You can download this movie (clicking above). The video shows visual stimuli while recording from an MT neuron. The electrode was connected to an amplifier, and output to a loudspeaker. The audio track allows you to hear the loudspeaker - each click corresponds to an action potential. This example MT neuron responds strongly to down-left motion, not at all to up-right motion, and with intermediate firing rates to intermediate directions.           Human cortical area MT can be readily identified with fMRI (you made need to double-click on the image below or reload the page for the animations to play).                                             Top right panel above: Flickering checkerboard stimulus alternating with a blank uniform gray field. Bottom right: Axial (horizontal) slice through the of the brain with functional activity superimposed in color. Flickering checkerboards &quot;light up&quot;, evoking strong activity, in the primary visual cortex (V1) at the very back of the brain. Top left: Moving versus stationary dots stimuli. Bottom left: Moving dots again &quot;light up&quot; V1, but also evoke strong activity in area MT, a lateral area of the occipital lobe (just behind your ears) involved in visual motion perception.           There also appears to be a columnar architecture in MT for stimulus  motion; neurons with  similar motion  preferences lie nearby one another, with an orderly progression from  one motion  direction  to the next as you move through MT, analogous to orientation columns in  V1.      MT and motion perception: The experiments described above show that the activity of MT neurons is correlated with motion perception. Bill Newsome (Stanford Neurobiologist) and colleagues took this an important step further to demonstrate a causal relationship between neural activity in MT and motion percpetion. They used electrical microstimulation to change the responses of a small number of MT neurons and showed that this affected the perception of motion.           First, they trained monkeys to perform a difficult motion discrimination task. The monkeys viewed moving dots and decided which way they went, e.g., either up or down. In the stimulus, only a subset of the dots moved in the indicated direction; the others moved randomly. The percentage of dots moving in the given direction was varied (in the graph, a negative percentage means the dots were moved in the opposite direction).           Then they characterized how MT neurons responded during this task. For a neuron's preferred direction of motion (upward in this case) the neuron responds more as coherence is increased.           Next they inserted stimulating electrodes into a particular column of MT neurons (in this case neurons preferring downward motion) and injected pulses of current while the monkeys performed the motion discrimination task. On half the trials, the motion was upward. On the other half, the motion was downward. On some trials the motion was high coherence and on others it was low coherence. All of these stimulus conditions were randomly interleaved. Critically, on half the trials (also randomly interleaved), small pulses of current were injected which caused the neurons near the electrode tip to fire more action potentials (on top of those that were evoked by the motion stimulus by itself).           When the electrode was in a column selective for downward motion, electrical stimulation biased the monkey to report &quot;down&quot; more often. This is a very cool result: stimulating MT neurons directly influences behavior, presumably because it influences the monkeys' conscious percepts.      The blue curve in the graph indicates what the monkey perceived with no electrical stimulation. The graph plots the proportion of trials on which the monkey indicated the dots were moving in the preferred (downward) direction, as a function of the percentage of moving dots. On this graph, 20% coherence means that 20% of the dots really did move downward whereas the other 80% moved randomly whereas -20% means that 20% of the dots moved in the opposite (upward) direction. When there are a lot of downward dots (20%), the monkey always reports seeing them as moving downward. When there are a lot of upward dots (-20%), the monkey never reports seeing them as moving downward.      The yellow curve shows the effect of electrical stimulation. On these trials, the monkey has a stronger tendency to report downward motion (the yellow curve is above the blue curve).           Coritcal area MST is right next to MT. MST neurons have very large receptive fields, respond selectively to complex optical flow fields: expansion, contraction, rotation. It is believed that MST is involved in 3D motion perception, inferring 3D motion of objects/observer from optical flow.          Neurons in area STS respond selectively to biological motion, like the point-light walkers (above).     Eye Movements and Motion Perception   When an observer is moving, the visual system uses the changing retinal  image  to  infer the observer's trajectory and 3D structure. When an observer is  stationary, but the object is moving, the visual system infers the  motion and  structure of the object.  How does the visual system keep track of what's moving? Are you moving  or  is it the scene that you're looking at that is moving? Sometimes your  visual  system gets it wrong (sitting in a train at the station when the  neighboring train pulls away, an example of vection) but most of  the  time your visual system gets it right.       Answer: Visual images are combined with other information to inform you about the motion of your eyes, head, and body. The vestibular system provides information about the motion of your head and body. A copy of the eye movement command from the eye movement centers in the brain stem provides information about eye movements. Vision is combined with vestibular and eye movement signals in Area MST.           Push gently on the side of your eye and the world appears to jiggle  around.  Helmholtz did this experiment and came up with a theory of how  eye  movement information is combined with change in the retinal image to  yield  the motion  percept. Generally speaking, the brain is divided into motor areas and  sensory  areas. The corrolary discharge is a copy of the motor signal that is  transmitted  to a comparator - a hypothetical structure that receives both the  corrolary  discharge and the sensory movement signal (maybe in MST). If the visual  motion  signal is the same as the eye movement command, then you don't \"see\"  motion.  If the visual motion signal is different from the eye movement command,  then  you do see motion.      Copyright &copy; 2006, Department of Psychology, New York University David Heeger"}]},

Sometimes your  visual  system gets it wrong (sitting in a train at the station when the  neighboring train pulls away, an example of vection) but most of  the  time your visual system gets it right.       Answer: Visual images are combined with other information to inform you about the motion of your eyes, head, and body. The vestibular system provides information about the motion of your head and body. A copy of the eye movement command from the eye movement centers in the brain stem provides information about eye movements. Vision is combined with vestibular and eye movement signals in Area MST.           Push gently on the side of your eye and the world appears to jiggle  around.  Helmholtz did this experiment and came up with a theory of how  eye  movement information is combined with change in the retinal image to  yield  the motion  percept. Generally speaking, the brain is divided into motor areas and  sensory  areas. The corrolary discharge is a copy of the motor signal that is  transmitted  to a comparator - a hypothetical structure that receives both the  corrolary  discharge and the sensory movement signal (maybe in MST). If the visual  motion  signal is the same as the eye movement command, then you don't \"see\"  motion.  If the visual motion signal is different from the eye movement command,  then  you do see motion.

Questions of originals vs. surrogates will be raised, and the wide variety of variant forms will be covered. The course also addresses tensions between conservation and access. Students will learn principles of collection assessment, and how to write a preservation plan. They will also learn about dealing with laboratories, writing contracts, etc. On a more pragmatic level, they will learn about optimal storage conditions and handling.

The answers to legal questions are not always apparent and can be complex, particularly where different types of media are encompassed in one production. When the law remains unclear, a risk assessment, often fraught with ethical considerations, is required to determine whether a production can be reproduced, distributed or exhibited without infringing the rights of others. What are the various legal rights that may encumber moving image material? What are the complex layers of rights and who holds them?Does one have to clear before attempting to preserve or restore a work? How do these rights affect downstream exhibition and distribution of a preserved work? And finally, what steps can be taken in managing moving image collections so that decisions affecting copyrights can be taken consistently? This course will help students make intelligent decisions and develop appropriate policies for their institution.

Various historiographical methods and historical contexts are explored. A required course in NYU's existing MA Degree in Cinema Studies.     Professor Dan Streible, semester 3, 4 points   H72.1015         Film Form and Film Sense   A class outlining film form in a wide variety of film types, to help the student develop a vocabulary for writing about film, and an awareness of the length and breadth of the aesthetic study of film. The purpose of this course is to introduce students to central concepts in film form and style as well as film narrative. The course is structured to suggest a constantly expanding series of models for textual analysis of audio-visual works, with emphasis on the \"cinematic signifier.\" The course will also deal with issues of the interpretation of audio-visual works, with an emphasis on the centrality of textual analysis to such interpretation. Part one of the course will have a strong formal emphasis, introducing concepts such as shot structure, editing, mise-en-scene, camera movement, and sound in relation to their function in the structuring of film narrative. Part Two will formulate these concepts more thoroughly in terms of parameters of film narration (e.g. focalization and its implications for the representation of gender and race). Parts Three and Four will further expand the conceptualization of these issues by dealing with the relationship of film narrative to: (1) genre, understood in terms of its social and ideological implications; and (2) cultural history, understood in terms of the dialogical relations between cultural discourses and the specificity of film narrative. A required course in NYU's existing MA Degree in Cinema Studies.     Professor William Simon, semester 3, 4 points   H72.1010         Video Preservation   This class will give students direct experience with the process of re-formatting of video materials for preservation and access. Addressing in-house systems and work with vendors, the class will increase knowledge in areas of archival standards, prioritization and decision&#8211;making, source and destination formats, technical requirements and systems, preparation and workflow, documentation and metadata capture, quality assurance, and overall project management. Students will have hands&#8211;on experience with tape preparation and re&#8211;formatting using equipment in the MIAP Lab and will interact with experts from preservation companies and from other NYU departments.

Students will learn the details of how digital repositories work, and what elements need to be added to a repository in order to make it preservation compliant. Students will gain practical skills with identification and risk assessment for works as a whole, their component parts, and associated software and metadata. Initiatives by broadcasters, the Library of Congress and other national archives, digital libraries and others will be explored as examples of the architecture and attributes of digital repositories. Emphasis will be placed on how archivists may interact with these repositories as part of their preservation practice. Students will also develop an increased understanding of metadata and of rights management for digital materials.

It examines the goals of public programming , the constituencies such programs attempt to reach, and the cultural ramifications of presenting archival materials to audiences. Students will study how archives can encourage increasing quantities and different forms of access through their own publications, events, and productions, as well as through the role of new technologies (DVD, CD-ROM, the Internet). They will study how these methods of circulation provoke interest, study and appreciation of archive and museum moving image collections. The seminar will also treat such themes as: individual vs. collective access; film programming design, budget, documentation, and print control; legal issues; projection, and theater management; archival loans, the \"Archive Film\"; stock footage services; and film stills archive services. The course includes visits to a number of New York institutions that program moving images. These may include: the Film Department of the Museum of Modern Art; the Museum of the Moving Image; the Whitney Museum of American Art; the Guggenheim Museum; Anthology Film Archives; the American Museum of Natural History, Margaret Mead Festival; and the Film Society of Lincoln Center.     Dan Streible, semester 4, 4 points   H72.1806       Fall 2008   Spring 2010       Student Work         Handling Complex Media   This seminar will increase students' knowledge of primary issues and emerging strategies for the preservation of media works that go beyond single channels/screens. Students will gain practical skills with identification and risk assessment for works as a whole and their component parts, particularly in the areas of audio and visual media and digital, interactive media projects that are stored on fixed media, presented as installations, and existing in networks.   Examples of production modes/works to be studied are animations (individual works and motion graphics) web sites, games, interactive multimedia (i.e., educational/artist CDROMs), and technology-dependent art installations. Students will test principles and practices of traditional collection management with these works, such as appraisal, selection, care and handling, risk/condition assessment, \"triage\", description, and storage and will be actively involved in developing new strategies for their care and preservation. Case studies will be undertaken in collaboration with artists/producers, museums, libraries, and/or archives.

The course will teach students how to work with vendors, increase knowledge of archival standards, introduce problems of decision&#8211;making, technical requirements, preparation and workflow, and overall project management. The class will undertake and complete an actual film preservation project and follow the steps from start to finish.     Bill Brand, semester 4, 2 points   H72.3402       Spring 2006   Spring 2008       Student Work         Elective or Independent Study   All students are required to take an Elective or Independent Study in order to explore more fully a topic of choice. Additional Electives or Independent Studies will be subsitututed if students are waived out of other courses. The Elective may be a media course, a course in cultural institutions and practices, or a course in preservation. The media course might be taken either inside the Department of Cinema Studies, or in various other departments (such as History, French, Italian, and German, American Studies, Africana Studies, etc.). The elective also might be a course in Museum Studies, the History Department's Archiving Program, or the Institute of Fine Arts' Conservation Program.     semester 4, 4 points     MIAP Independent Study     For Fall   H72.2920, H72.2922, H72.2924   For Spring   H72.2921, H72.2923, H72.2925     Independent Study (Other)     For Fall   H72.2900, H72.2902, H72.2904   For Spring   H72.2901, H72.2903, H72.2905         Advanced Topics in Preservation Studies   Through small&#8211;group study, the seminar will address advanced and/or special topics, and will focus on successful completion of student thesis or portfolio projects. In addition, the class will address preparation for employment, publishing and professional engagement upon graduation.

These internships will provide hands&#8211;on experience with moving image material, as well as deep exposure to the various types of institutions that handle this material. Internships may be paid or unpaid. Students will meet as a group bi&#8211;weekly with an instructor to contextualize the internship experience. (At least one internship must be involved with daily management of moving image collection, and another must be involved with restoration.)   Internship Resources for Students   Internship Resources for Supervisors         Summer Internships   Students must undertake a 10-week intensive summer internship (minimum 35 hours/week) in a moving image repository. Though the student may specialize in one particular department/task within the institution, over the course of the summer they will be expected to obtain a broad knowledge of how the various departments of that institution work together. Work done during the internship experience may serve as the core research and preparation for the final thesis project. Students will be encouraged to engage in this internship outside the United States in order to view how repositories operate differently in different countries.     0 points         Thesis/Projects or Portfolio   Each student will be required to complete a capstone project in the form of either a thesis or a Portfolio. The student is expected to work with their Advisor beginning their second semester to make sure that their capstone project will reflect their learning experience in the program. The Portfolio must include a written essay synthesizing the wide variety of topics learned during the program, as well as good examples of projects that the student has completed. (The Portfolio may serve as an example of what the student might present a potential employer. The Portfolio must be turned in by the 10 th week of the student's final Spring semester, and at the end of that semester the student must orally present this Portfolio to a Committee of faculty and working professionals who will evaluate whether or not the student is ready to be granted the degree.

Well-defined pathway of brain areas (cascade of neural computations) underlying motion specialization in MT.                  Cortical area MST is functionally speicalized for optic flow      STS is specialized for recognizing biological motion      Corrolary discharge explains why eye movements do not evoke a perception of motion.          Motion is a perceptual attribute: the visual system infers motion from the changing pattern of light in the retinal image. Often the inference is correct. Sometimes it is not. In class I showed you a number of demonstrations in which motion is misperceived. Below is one example of a visual illusion of motion that I made. It is a tribute to Duchamp's cubist painting titled &quot;Nude Descending a Staircase&quot; in which the changing pattern of light gives the illustion of motion even though she never gets anywhere (you made need to double-click on the image below or reload the page for the animation to play).                                             Another example is the motion aftereffect. Stare at the center of the following animation for about a minute, as it expands continuously (you may need to reload the page to get it moving again after it stops), then fix your gaze on colorful texture pattern next it it.                        After viewing continuous motion in the same direction for a long  time, if you look at a stationary object, it appears to move in the  direction opposite to the one you were viewing. This is sometimes  called the \"waterfall illusion\" - if you look at a waterfall for a  while, then look at a tree next to  it, the tree appears to  move upward. The demonstration above shows that this adaptation is  local in the retina (to the right of where you were looking, you were  adapting to rightward motion, to the left you adapted to leftward, and  so on). We take this as evidence for the existence of neurons that are  sensitive to motion and selective for the direction of motion, which  adapt to the stimulus (analogous to color adaptation after-effects).      Below is yet another example of a motion illusion.           Role of motion perception: Motion perception serves lots of  helpful functions.         Simply detecting that something is moving, draws your attention  to  it.       Segmentation of foreground from background.      Compute the 3D shape of an object.      Compute the distance to various objects in the scene and estimate the direction in which you are heading within the scene. For example, hold up two fingers (one on each hand) at different distances, and move your head slowly from side to side while fixating an object on a far wall. Things that are further away slide across the retina more slowly. When there is strong motion on your retina, especially in peripheral regions, you can misattribute that motion and perceive yourself as moving (called &quot;vection&quot;). Movies (especially with large screens as in an IMAX theater) can give this illusion that you are moving.      Recognition actions, such as movements of a human (in the \"point  light displays\" shown in class of people walking, dancing, etc.,  displayed as the motion of a small number of dots attached to the  joints of the person).                    The image above is unrecognizable. But when set into motion, it is easy to interpret. Download and play the animation (4 Mb mpeg movie).           Download and play the movie (3.8 Mb QuickTime movie with sound).           Download and play the movie (1.9 Mb QuickTime movie with sound).      Optical Flow: The diagram below is a representation of the physical motion in an image while an observer moves through the environmet.                      Each arrow represents the speed and direction of motion for each  little patch of the visual field. Near points move fast (long arrows),  far points move slowly (short arrows). In this example, the arrows  point away from a  single point called the focus of expansion that corresponds to where the observer is heading. The first step in motion perception is for the visual system to estimate optical flow from the changing pattern of light in the retinal image. Then, the 3D motions of observer and objects can be inferred from the optical flow. The optic flow then provides information about the observer's heading and the relative distance to each surface in the world. J. J. Gibson hypothesized that there's sufficient information in the visual stimulus to specify a unique, unambiguous interpretation of 3D motion and depth. Recently, mathematicians have proven that this hypothesis is basically correct. There is a caveat, however: distance and speed are ambiguous (i.e., they trade off). That is, a small, close object when you are moving slowly creates the identical retinal images over time as a large, distant object when you are moving quickly. That's why you need a speedometer in your car. You are lousy at making absolute speed and distance judgements. But, you are very good at relative speed/direction and relative distance.           Object motion: Two different kinds of events can cause visual motion. When an observer moves through an otherwise stationary environment, the entire retinal image changes over time as discussed above. Or an object can move while the observer is stationary so that a small region of the retinal image changes over time. Often, of course, both of these things happen at once, but it is helpful to consider the two separately. Motion provides information about shape even in the complete absence of other shape cues (you made need to double-click on the image below or reload the page for the animation to play).                                             Here's another example.                                             Biological motion: Motion can provides information to allow the recognition human movements. This is true even for cases in which there is very limited information provided at only a few select points (you made need to double-click on the images below or reload the page for the animations to play).                                                                                                                           Visual Motion in the Brain      Functional specialization hypothesis: There are specific brain area(s) that are involved in visual motion perception.          Evidence for this includes a patient known as LM who, following a  stroke, had great difficulty  perceiving certain types of motion. Color vision and acuity remained  normal, and there was no difficulty recognizing faces or objects, no  difficulty with  stereo. But LM cannot see coffee  flowing into a cup: appears frozen like a glacier, does not perceive  the  fluid rising, and often lets the coffee spill or overflows. LM feels  uncomfortable in a crowded  room  or on a street. \"People were suddenly here or there, but I have not  seen  them moving... When I'm looking at the car first it seems far away, but  then  when I want to cross the road suddenly the car is very near\". LM's  lesion  extends  over a substantial region of visual cortex, so one can not localize  sharply  the  regions relevant to LM's motion deficit. This makes it particularly  surprising  that loss of motion perception can be so cleanly dissociated from other  visual  abilities.           Area MT is one of the most studied regions of the cortex of the brain, probably second only to V1. Current opinion is that the optical flow field is computed and represented by neurons in area MT.            Neurons in MT are selective for motion direction.      Neural responses in MT are correlated with the perception of motion.      Damage to MT or temporary inactivation causes deficits in visual motion perception. Electrical stimulation in MT causes changes in visual motion perception.      Computational theory quantitatively explains both the responses of MT neurons and the perception of visual motion.      Well-defined pathway of brain areas (cascade of neural computations) underlying motion specialization in MT.          MT neurons receive inputs from direction-selective neurons in V1. MT neurons are velocity selective, each responds best to a preferred velocity (speed and direction) within its receptive field, pretty much independent of stimulus pattern. By contrast, a direction-elective V1 neuron confounds motion with pattern. A typical V1 neuron responds to a particular orientation (edge or bar) moving in a particular direction. The response of the V1 neuron also increases with contrast. A typical MT neuron, on the other hand, responds to almost any pattern with almost any contrast, as long as it moves with the right velocity.            MT physiology movie (6.7 Mb QuickTime movie)           In class we viewed a video that demonstrates direction-selectivity of MT neurons. You can download this movie (clicking above). The video shows visual stimuli while recording from an MT neuron. The electrode was connected to an amplifier, and output to a loudspeaker. The audio track allows you to hear the loudspeaker - each click corresponds to an action potential. This example MT neuron responds strongly to down-left motion, not at all to up-right motion, and with intermediate firing rates to intermediate directions.           Human cortical area MT can be readily identified with fMRI (you made need to double-click on the image below or reload the page for the animations to play).                                             Top right panel above: Flickering checkerboard stimulus alternating with a blank uniform gray field. Bottom right: Axial (horizontal) slice through the of the brain with functional activity superimposed in color. Flickering checkerboards &quot;light up&quot;, evoking strong activity, in the primary visual cortex (V1) at the very back of the brain. Top left: Moving versus stationary dots stimuli. Bottom left: Moving dots again &quot;light up&quot; V1, but also evoke strong activity in area MT, a lateral area of the occipital lobe (just behind your ears) involved in visual motion perception.           There also appears to be a columnar architecture in MT for stimulus  motion; neurons with  similar motion  preferences lie nearby one another, with an orderly progression from  one motion  direction  to the next as you move through MT, analogous to orientation columns in  V1.      MT and motion perception: The experiments described above show that the activity of MT neurons is correlated with motion perception. Bill Newsome (Stanford Neurobiologist) and colleagues took this an important step further to demonstrate a causal relationship between neural activity in MT and motion percpetion. They used electrical microstimulation to change the responses of a small number of MT neurons and showed that this affected the perception of motion.           First, they trained monkeys to perform a difficult motion discrimination task. The monkeys viewed moving dots and decided which way they went, e.g., either up or down. In the stimulus, only a subset of the dots moved in the indicated direction; the others moved randomly. The percentage of dots moving in the given direction was varied (in the graph, a negative percentage means the dots were moved in the opposite direction).           Then they characterized how MT neurons responded during this task. For a neuron's preferred direction of motion (upward in this case) the neuron responds more as coherence is increased.           Next they inserted stimulating electrodes into a particular column of MT neurons (in this case neurons preferring downward motion) and injected pulses of current while the monkeys performed the motion discrimination task. On half the trials, the motion was upward. On the other half, the motion was downward. On some trials the motion was high coherence and on others it was low coherence. All of these stimulus conditions were randomly interleaved. Critically, on half the trials (also randomly interleaved), small pulses of current were injected which caused the neurons near the electrode tip to fire more action potentials (on top of those that were evoked by the motion stimulus by itself).           When the electrode was in a column selective for downward motion, electrical stimulation biased the monkey to report &quot;down&quot; more often. This is a very cool result: stimulating MT neurons directly influences behavior, presumably because it influences the monkeys' conscious percepts.      The blue curve in the graph indicates what the monkey perceived with no electrical stimulation. The graph plots the proportion of trials on which the monkey indicated the dots were moving in the preferred (downward) direction, as a function of the percentage of moving dots. On this graph, 20% coherence means that 20% of the dots really did move downward whereas the other 80% moved randomly whereas -20% means that 20% of the dots moved in the opposite (upward) direction. When there are a lot of downward dots (20%), the monkey always reports seeing them as moving downward. When there are a lot of upward dots (-20%), the monkey never reports seeing them as moving downward.      The yellow curve shows the effect of electrical stimulation. On these trials, the monkey has a stronger tendency to report downward motion (the yellow curve is above the blue curve).           Coritcal area MST is right next to MT. MST neurons have very large receptive fields, respond selectively to complex optical flow fields: expansion, contraction, rotation. It is believed that MST is involved in 3D motion perception, inferring 3D motion of objects/observer from optical flow.          Neurons in area STS respond selectively to biological motion, like the point-light walkers (above).     Eye Movements and Motion Perception   When an observer is moving, the visual system uses the changing retinal  image  to  infer the observer's trajectory and 3D structure. When an observer is  stationary, but the object is moving, the visual system infers the  motion and  structure of the object.  How does the visual system keep track of what's moving? Are you moving  or  is it the scene that you're looking at that is moving? Sometimes your  visual  system gets it wrong (sitting in a train at the station when the  neighboring train pulls away, an example of vection) but most of  the  time your visual system gets it right.       Answer: Visual images are combined with other information to inform you about the motion of your eyes, head, and body. The vestibular system provides information about the motion of your head and body. A copy of the eye movement command from the eye movement centers in the brain stem provides information about eye movements. Vision is combined with vestibular and eye movement signals in Area MST.           Push gently on the side of your eye and the world appears to jiggle  around.  Helmholtz did this experiment and came up with a theory of how  eye  movement information is combined with change in the retinal image to  yield  the motion  percept. Generally speaking, the brain is divided into motor areas and  sensory  areas. The corrolary discharge is a copy of the motor signal that is  transmitted  to a comparator - a hypothetical structure that receives both the  corrolary  discharge and the sensory movement signal (maybe in MST). If the visual  motion  signal is the same as the eye movement command, then you don't \"see\"  motion.  If the visual motion signal is different from the eye movement command,  then  you do see motion.

The answers to legal questions are not always apparent and can be complex, particularly where different types of media are encompassed in one production. When the law remains unclear, a risk assessment, often fraught with ethical considerations, is required to determine whether a production can be reproduced, distributed or exhibited without infringing the rights of others. What are the various legal rights that may encumber moving image material? What are the complex layers of rights and who holds them?Does one have to clear before attempting to preserve or restore a work? How do these rights affect downstream exhibition and distribution of a preserved work? And finally, what steps can be taken in managing moving image collections so that decisions affecting copyrights can be taken consistently? This course will help students make intelligent decisions and develop appropriate policies for their institution.

Various historiographical methods and historical contexts are explored. A required course in NYU's existing MA Degree in Cinema Studies.     Professor Dan Streible, semester 3, 4 points   H72.1015         Film Form and Film Sense   A class outlining film form in a wide variety of film types, to help the student develop a vocabulary for writing about film, and an awareness of the length and breadth of the aesthetic study of film. The purpose of this course is to introduce students to central concepts in film form and style as well as film narrative. The course is structured to suggest a constantly expanding series of models for textual analysis of audio-visual works, with emphasis on the \"cinematic signifier.\" The course will also deal with issues of the interpretation of audio-visual works, with an emphasis on the centrality of textual analysis to such interpretation. Part one of the course will have a strong formal emphasis, introducing concepts such as shot structure, editing, mise-en-scene, camera movement, and sound in relation to their function in the structuring of film narrative. Part Two will formulate these concepts more thoroughly in terms of parameters of film narration (e.g. focalization and its implications for the representation of gender and race). Parts Three and Four will further expand the conceptualization of these issues by dealing with the relationship of film narrative to: (1) genre, understood in terms of its social and ideological implications; and (2) cultural history, understood in terms of the dialogical relations between cultural discourses and the specificity of film narrative.

Students will learn the details of how digital repositories work, and what elements need to be added to a repository in order to make it preservation compliant. Students will gain practical skills with identification and risk assessment for works as a whole, their component parts, and associated software and metadata. Initiatives by broadcasters, the Library of Congress and other national archives, digital libraries and others will be explored as examples of the architecture and attributes of digital repositories. Emphasis will be placed on how archivists may interact with these repositories as part of their preservation practice. Students will also develop an increased understanding of metadata and of rights management for digital materials.

It examines the goals of public programming , the constituencies such programs attempt to reach, and the cultural ramifications of presenting archival materials to audiences. Students will study how archives can encourage increasing quantities and different forms of access through their own publications, events, and productions, as well as through the role of new technologies (DVD, CD-ROM, the Internet). They will study how these methods of circulation provoke interest, study and appreciation of archive and museum moving image collections. The seminar will also treat such themes as: individual vs. collective access; film programming design, budget, documentation, and print control; legal issues; projection, and theater management; archival loans, the \"Archive Film\"; stock footage services; and film stills archive services. The course includes visits to a number of New York institutions that program moving images. These may include: the Film Department of the Museum of Modern Art; the Museum of the Moving Image; the Whitney Museum of American Art; the Guggenheim Museum; Anthology Film Archives; the American Museum of Natural History, Margaret Mead Festival; and the Film Society of Lincoln Center.     Dan Streible, semester 4, 4 points   H72.1806       Fall 2008   Spring 2010       Student Work         Handling Complex Media   This seminar will increase students' knowledge of primary issues and emerging strategies for the preservation of media works that go beyond single channels/screens. Students will gain practical skills with identification and risk assessment for works as a whole and their component parts, particularly in the areas of audio and visual media and digital, interactive media projects that are stored on fixed media, presented as installations, and existing in networks.   Examples of production modes/works to be studied are animations (individual works and motion graphics) web sites, games, interactive multimedia (i.e., educational/artist CDROMs), and technology-dependent art installations. Students will test principles and practices of traditional collection management with these works, such as appraisal, selection, care and handling, risk/condition assessment, \"triage\", description, and storage and will be actively involved in developing new strategies for their care and preservation. Case studies will be undertaken in collaboration with artists/producers, museums, libraries, and/or archives.

These internships will provide hands&#8211;on experience with moving image material, as well as deep exposure to the various types of institutions that handle this material. Internships may be paid or unpaid. Students will meet as a group bi&#8211;weekly with an instructor to contextualize the internship experience. (At least one internship must be involved with daily management of moving image collection, and another must be involved with restoration.)   Internship Resources for Students   Internship Resources for Supervisors         Summer Internships   Students must undertake a 10-week intensive summer internship (minimum 35 hours/week) in a moving image repository. Though the student may specialize in one particular department/task within the institution, over the course of the summer they will be expected to obtain a broad knowledge of how the various departments of that institution work together. Work done during the internship experience may serve as the core research and preparation for the final thesis project. Students will be encouraged to engage in this internship outside the United States in order to view how repositories operate differently in different countries.     0 points         Thesis/Projects or Portfolio   Each student will be required to complete a capstone project in the form of either a thesis or a Portfolio. The student is expected to work with their Advisor beginning their second semester to make sure that their capstone project will reflect their learning experience in the program. The Portfolio must include a written essay synthesizing the wide variety of topics learned during the program, as well as good examples of projects that the student has completed. (The Portfolio may serve as an example of what the student might present a potential employer. The Portfolio must be turned in by the 10 th week of the student's final Spring semester, and at the end of that semester the student must orally present this Portfolio to a Committee of faculty and working professionals who will evaluate whether or not the student is ready to be granted the degree.

Taylor, Ian Spiro, Chris Bregler and Rob Fergus   To appear at CVPR 2011, Colorado Springs, USA June 21-23 (download pdf)    (supplementary material)                               Sample retrieval results. Each row is a query. We select a test  image (column 1) and find its 10 nearest neighbors using our method which we call Pose Sensitive Embedding (PSE). The blue text in each image indicates seed id (left) and distance (in embedded space) from the query (right).    Non-scientific abstract (for geeks and non-geeks)    Computer vision has hit the mainstream with applications such as cars that detect pedestrians, motion capture for animation, and applications that let you cash a cheque by snapping a picture from your mobile phone. A great example of computer vision in the consumer market is Microsoft's Kinect gaming system which can accurately detect the pose of one or more individuals allowing gameplay to be controlled using just the body. Such a system must be able to detect pose reliably under a wide variety of conditions - different players, unusual clothing, poor lighting, cluttered backgrounds, and other sources of variation. One way that we could perform pose estimation is keeping around a large database of examples of people in a variety of poses along with labels indicating the configuration of the body in 2D or 3D. When presented with a new example (without labels) we can compare it against the database to find the best match. We then can assign the labels of the best match to the new example. However, the matching (or similarity) problem is a very tough one - especially due to the large amount of input variability due to the factors described above. If we had many examples of people in similar pose but under differing conditions, we could use machine learning to construct an algorithm that matches based on the important information (e.g. pose) and ignores the distracting information (e.g lighting, clothing, background, etc.). But how do we collect such data?   In a somewhat unusual move for computer scientists, we turned to the Dutch progressive-electro band C-Mon and Kypski . Their music video/crowdsourcing project \"One Frame of Frame\" asks people on the web to replace one frame of the band's music video for the song \"More or Less\" with a capture from a webcam. A visitor to the band's website is shown a single frame of the video and asked to perform an imitation in front of the camera. The new contribution is spliced into the video which updates once an hour. This turns out to be the perfect data source for learning an algorithm to compute similarity based on pose. Armed with the band's data and a few machine learning tricks up our sleeves, we built a system that is highly effective at matching people in similar pose but under widely different settings.       Our data was collected from One Frame of Fame .      Scientific abstract (for geeks)     Supervised methods for learning an embedding aim to map  high-dimensional images to a space in which perceptually similar  observations have high measurable similarity. Most approaches rely on binary similarity, typically defined by class  membership where labels are expensive to obtain and/or difficult to  define. In this paper we propose crowd-sourcing similar images by  soliciting human imitations. We exploit temporal coherence in video  to generate additional pairwise graded similarities between the  user-contributed imitations. We introduce two methods for learning  nonlinear, invariant mappings that exploit graded similarities. We  learn a model that is highly effective at matching people in similar  pose. It exhibits remarkable invariance to identity, clothing,  background, lighting, shift and scale.       Schematic of our approach. We assume for each frame  of video, there exists an unobserved low-dimensional representation of pose,  Z . A seed image is generated by mapping from pose space to pixels,  X , through an unobserved interpretation function. Our method learns a nonlinear embedding,  f(X|&theta;) which approximates Z with a  low-dimensional vector. In the example above, users are asked to  imitate seed images taken from a music video ( http://oneframeoffame.com ).
