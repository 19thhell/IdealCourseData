Scripts, images, artifacts, diaries, videos of live performance, newpaper reviews, playbills, motion pictures and more all can be considered primary sources for the performing arts.     Think of a primary source as:       &quot;firsthand evidence&quot;; it is FROM the time, not ABOUT the time.    written by the participants or observers.    also an artifact of the time, or an actual image from the time itself.      Primary sources can be both published and unpublished. Published documents - books, newspapers, pamphlets, advertisements, government reports, laws, etc. Scholarly journal articles that report results of original research are also considered primary sources. As are unpublished documents - letters, diaries, financial records, etc. Oral and visual artifacts - objects produced by human craft, such as speeches, recordings, paintings, photographs, films, archaeological finds, etc. - are also consider primary.

Scripts, images, artifacts, diaries, videos of live performance, newpaper reviews, playbills, motion pictures and more all can be considered primary sources for the performing arts.     Think of a primary source as:       &quot;firsthand evidence&quot;; it is FROM the time, not ABOUT the time.    written by the participants or observers.    also an artifact of the time, or an actual image from the time itself.      Primary sources can be both published and unpublished. Published documents - books, newspapers, pamphlets, advertisements, government reports, laws, etc. Scholarly journal articles that report results of original research are also considered primary sources. As are unpublished documents - letters, diaries, financial records, etc. Oral and visual artifacts - objects produced by human craft, such as speeches, recordings, paintings, photographs, films, archaeological finds, etc. - are also consider primary. Here are just a few examples of materials that constitute primary sources...

The way you interpret or use a source determines whether it is a primary source or not.     2) Secondary Sources       Use primary data to solve research problems   Examples: scholarly books and articles   Secondary sources can be interpreted as primary sources when the artifactual characteristics of the item are of research value.     3) Tertiary Sources       Books or articles that synthesize and report on secondary sources for general readers   Examples: textbooks, encyclopedia articles, Wikipedia       Adapted from The Craft of Research by Wayne C. Booth, Gregory G. Colomb, Joseph M. Williams. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, c2008.                                              Using Primary, Secondary, and Tertiary Sources                 Solid research requires the use of all three types of sources. Primary sources will provide the raw data for your research, but you will also need encyclopedias, dictionaries, subject guides and other reference tools to gather background information on your topic and to identify the people, places, dates, organizations, and themes central to your topic.   Secondary sources such as books, scholarly journals, and newspaper articles synthesize current research and help put your subject in context. Secondary sources are also important for helping to position your own argument within the scholarly conversation on your topic.   Use library catalogs, databases, printed reference sources, the web, and the assistance of your subject librarian to identify, locate, and use primary, secondary, and tertiary sources.                                             Primary vs. Secondary Sources                 The categories of primary, secondary, and tertiary sources are not mutually exclusive.   The way one uses or interprets an item determines whether it is a primary or secondary source.   A book can be treated as an artifact, documents can consist of visual elements, and visual materials are often considered to be documents.   Think of primary sources as the raw data for your research and consider this example: Encyclopedias are usually considered to be classic reference sources. However, they are primary sources to someone studying encyclopedias.

Archives are typically housed in special collections departments of libraries. They are described in documents called finding aids which detail the scope and content of the collection, provide the date span and quantity of materials, and provide background information on the creator of the collection.   See the Using Archives &amp; Manuscripts Research Guide for detailed information on finding and using archival materials in your research.

Good scholarship requires careful reading and critical analysis of information.   Basic evaluation criteria for all sources include include the following questions, which were adapted from The Information-Literate Historian by Jenny L. Presnell (New York: Oxford University Press, 2007):   Author Authority Who created the item? What is his or her affiliation? What is his or her relationship to the information contained in the source?   Audience and Purpose Who is the intended audience? Why was the item created?   Accuracy and Completeness Is the evidence reliable? Are the important points covered? How does the source compare to other similar sources?   Footnotes and Documentation Are the author's sources clearly identified with complete citations to allow you to find the original source yourself?     Perspective and Bias How do the author's bias and perspective inform the arguments and evidence presented?           Comments (0)                                         Printed & Published Documents                 Primary source documents can be letters, diaries, newspapers, speeches, interviews, memoirs, minutes, fliers, manifestos, reports, pamphlets, handbills, government documents, or other types of texts. They can be in the original -- often hand-written form and housed in a library's special collections department -- or published in print or online.    Correspondence (handwritten, typed, or electronic, business or personal, published or unpublished) is direct communication between people and/or organizations. Handwritten and typed letters were a primary means of communication between people before email. Scholars examining the colonial history of the U.S., for example, have used published collections of letters by significant historical figures such as Thomas Jefferson as their primary sources. The letters of lesser known people, such as civil war soldiers, have been used by historians to understand how national events affect people in a personal way.    Diaries show the private opinions of people and also add insight into historical figures and events. Keep in mind that the diaries of leading figures such as US presidents or other public figures may have been written with an eye toward publication. The diaries of average people, neither famous nor powerful, are valuable for their insights into everyday life of ordinary people.    Ephemera , defined in the SAA Online Glossary as materials, \"created for a specific, limited purpose, and generally designed to be discarded after use,\" are useful sources for researchers. Printed ephemera includes leaflets, flyers, handbills, advertisements, pamphlets, ticket stubs, menus, receipts, and other items. Collections of printed ephemera will frequently be found in a library's special collections department alongside the archival collections. Consult the websites of the Tamiment and Fales Libraries at NYU for information on holdings.    Newspapers , often referred to as the first draft of history, can be used to examine how events were immediately translated to the public since they include a combination of interviews, images, and first hand reporting. Newspapers are available in their original print editions (and may be in poor condition), in microfilm, online in freely available websites (such as the Brooklyn Daily Eagle ) or in subscription databases.    Speeches are also important primary sources. Periodicals such as Vital Speeches of the Day , which is available in print and online through a subscription database, collect and publish speeches and show how national and international issues are articulated to the public. In the 19th century, and to a lesser extent today, newspapers would regularly publish the full text of speeches by prominent national leaders.    Interviews , frequently published in periodicals, newspapers, online, and in books, are highly useful for researchers. Interviewees share their opinions, recollections, and ideas. Diplomats and statesmen, for example, sometimes provide revealing insights into international affairs that go beyond routine newspaper accounts.    Government documents , including books, pamphlets, reports, statistics, surveys, serials, congressional debates and testimony, national laws and international treaties, and other documents published by local, state, and federal government agencies represent a rich source of information for researchers on virtually every subject. Government documents are available in print, on microfilm, and online. Consult the website of the U.S. Government Documents Library in Bobst for research guides and reference assistance.    Memoirs are another important primary source. Many people, especially those who are well known and/or are involved in national and international events, write their memoirs when they retire from the limelight, providing detailed background information on past events.    Alternative Press  publications, such as newspapers, newsletters, journals, bulletins, and house organs published by organizations, individuals, committees, and activists outside of the mainstream media, are valuable sources for studying cultural movements advocating for social and political change. Researchers will find early expressions of progressive ideas in the alternative press, some of which eventually succeed in changing the tide of public opinion, and others that did not. NYU Libraries holds significant collections of alternative press in the Tamiment and Fales Libraries. See Tamiment's Serials Research Guide for details on holdings.   Pamphlets  can be a great resource for discovering the ideas being promoted at a point in time to sway opinions. Often sporting dramatic graphics, vivid cover art, persuasive text, and an urgent message, pamphlets are worth seeking out. Though pamphlets were relatively cheap to produce and abundantly published, they can be difficult to find in libraries. The collections of NYU Libraries and consortium libraries, most notably the New-York Historical Society, have wonderfully rich collections of pamphlets. Look for cataloged pamphlets and subject collections of pamphlets in BobCat . To find pamphlets on labor history and progressive politics from NYU's Tamiment Library, consult the Pamphlets Research Guide for the collection.

Does it describe the topography of an area, the political divisions, climate zone, population demographics, etc.?   Consider the author/creator of the map. Ask who made it and why.   From what perspective is the map drawn?   What is at the center of the map?   Does the map contain extra text or illustrations? An illustrated border? Does it add to your understanding of the map?   Was the map part of a larger collection or volume?   What is missing from the map?        Sources: Mary Lynn Rampolla. A Pocket Guide to Writing in History , 6th ed.

Material culture consists of the physical objects, such as tools, domestic articles, or religious objects, which give evidence of the type of culture developed by a society or group. (Source: Oxford English Dictionary , OED Online, 2009)   To find books in BobCat , search on the term \"material culture\" in the Subject index. The search will turn up overview volumes about the field of material culture and volumes on the study of the material culture of particular people and places. Use the facets at the left of the screen to narrow search results and follow the subject links in promising titles to find additional materials on your topic.           Comments (0)                                         Objects & Artifacts                 Webster's dictionary defines an artifact as something created by humans, usually for a practical purpose, and especially as an object remaining from a particular period.   When you use artifacts as primary sources, you've added material culture to your research. Artifacts can be an important complement to text-based primary sources because they provide a concrete, tangible dimension to your evidence.   An artifact remains almost meaningless, however, when taken out of context. When working with artifacts, you should ask the same types of questions as you would ask when working with other types of primary sources, such as who created the object, did s/he have a particular viewpoint or objective, etc. In addition to telling you something about its creator, an artifact provides insight into the customs, preferences, styles, special occasions, work, and play, of the culture in which it was created.                                             Working With Artifacts                 Example: In the images below, you can trace the depiction of lovers in artifacts from different cultures and time periods.   Sample Questions: Can we draw conclusions about notions of intimacy, sexuality and gender roles from the artifacts? How representative are these artifacts of their cultures? What comparisons can you make between these cultures?   Formulating Answers: First, study the artifact by itself. Try to be as comprehensive as possible in describing what you see in front of you. Second, examine the studies other researchers have made of the artifact and you test their interpretations against the views you have formed. And finally, present your conclusions which might favor one scholar's interpretation over another's, or advance your own interpretation based on your study of additional primary sources.

As with other types of sources, it is not just the format of the item that determines whether it is a primary source, but how it is being used.   For example, a radio broadcast of a scientist's explanation of how solar energy works would be considered a secondary source if you are using the text of what is said as evidence for your research. If, however, you are analyzing different ways to explain solar energy or examining a radio network's science coverage, the broadcast itself would be a primary source.           Comments (0)                                         Interviews and Oral Histories                 Interviews and Oral Histories (first-person accounts of lives or events) make excellent primary sources. Not only are you listening to someone's personal recollections, opinions, or interpretations of events they were directly involved with, you are hearing it in their own voice. Listening to a person's voice brings you closer to what they are saying than you can get by reading a transcript. You'll hear accents and inflections and gain a better sense of someone's personality when you hear them speak than when you read what they said. Consider conducting your own interviews and using them in your research.   Listen to an example from Story Corps .                                             Broadcasts & Speeches                 Audio recordings, whether of music, speeches, radio broadcasts, interviews, testimony, or performances allow you close access to events, people, and movements throughout history. Recordings related to contemporary and historical events are available in libraries and online through such sources as the Internet Archive and the Library of Congress , to name just two.   Hearing evidence allows you to think about your topic in a new way.                                              Recorded Music                 You can study music just as you might examine and interpret a novel or painting as a primary source. Sonic art, soundscapes, and other uses of sound as artistic expression can aslo be considered to be primary sources.

Good scholarship requires careful reading and critical analysis of information.   Basic Evaluation Criteria for All Sources The following questions were adapted from The Information-Literate Historian by Jenny L.

Additional Evaluation Criteria for Visual Materials In addition to the basic questions above, ask the following questions, which were adapted from A Pocket Guide to Writing in History , 6th ed. by Mary Lynn Rampolla (New York: Bedford/St. Martin's, 2009).   Photographs Where was the image first displayed or published? Do the angles, lighting, or cropping suggest a particular bias?   Art Works Is it a single work or part of a larger movement? Where was it first displayed and what was the critical reception?   Cartoons In what type of publication was the cartoon published? When? What is the historical significance? What is its message?

Some visual resources are one-of-a-kind, while others are reproduced (like prints or illustrations in books and magazines).           Comments (0)                                         Original Art                 Paintings, drawings, watercolors, graphic art, prints, sculpture, and architectural drawings and plans fall under the heading of original art.   Museums, art galleries, and libraries are readily accessible repositories for art. If their holdings are not fully on display, catalogs are generally available.

Primary sources enable the researcher to get as close as possible to the truth of what actually happened during an historical event or time period. Primary source is a term used in a number of disciplines to describe source material that is closest to the person, information, period, or idea being studied. A primary source (also called original source ) is a document, recording, artifact, or other source of information that was created at the time under study, usually by a source with direct personal knowledge of the events being described. It serves as an original source of information about the topic. Similar definitions are used in library science , and other areas of scholarship. In journalism, a primary source can be a person with direct knowledge of a situation, or a document created by such a person. Primary sources are distinguished from secondary sources , which cite, comment on, or build upon primary sources, though the distinction is not a sharp one.

Good scholarship requires careful reading and critical analysis of information.   Basic evaluation criteria for all sources include include the following questions, which were adapted from The Information-Literate Historian by Jenny L. Presnell (New York: Oxford University Press, 2007):   Author Authority  Who created the item? What is his or her affiliation? What is his or her relationship to the information contained in the source?   Audience and Purpose Who is the intended audience? Why was the item created?   Accuracy and Completeness Is the evidence reliable? Are the important points covered? How does the source compare to other similar sources? What may have been left out?   Footnotes and Documentation Are the author's sources in secondary and reference literature clearly identified with complete citations to allow you to find the original source yourself?   Perspective and Bias How do the author's bias and perspective inform the arguments and evidence presented?     Image: \" Take Along a Book. \" (191-) 1 print (poster) : color ; 53 x 34 cm.

Accurately record the collection name, box number, folder number and document details when taking notes. If you are citing correspondence, record the author as well as the recipient, and the date of the letter, if known.   Format your citations as instructed in the finding aid for the collection.      If you wish to quote from unpublished materials in a special library collection, you must request permission from the repository as well as from the appropriate copyright holders. It is often wise to check with archivists before quoting to make sure there are no use restrictions.  Contact NYU Special Collections .
