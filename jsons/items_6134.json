Our Writing Supplement allows the Admissions Committee to learn more about your primary area of academic interest and about any other academic interests you could be considering at NYU. \u00a0Would you like to double major or participate in a cross-school minor? Are you undecided and looking to explore a number of areas of study? \u00a0Feel free to use the Writing Supplement to share your academic ambitions with the Committee.   The Writing Supplement also allows the Admissions Committee to learn more about any global campuses that interest you. \u00a0With campuses in New York, Abu Dhabi and Shanghai as well as 10 global academic centers on six continents, we are interested to hear how you might fully utilize our global network.   If I indicate an alternate campus of interest or an alternate area of academic interest, will the Admissions Committee assume that I am not as passionate about my primary campus or area of academic interest? \u00a0   At NYU, most of our students are taking an interdisciplinary approach to their studies. Having more than one area of academic interest is most welcome here at NYU and could indicate that you are open to exploring the many academic resources available to our students here. \u00a0We understand that you may have one area that you are incredibly interested in and a few you may be interested in exploring further. \u00a0Feel free to share your many interests in the Writing Supplement. \u00a0We will assume that your primary area of academic interest is the NYU school or program to which you applied and any other areas of academic interest you mention are ones you would like to explore during your time at NYU. \u00a0The same applies to your discussion of our three global campuses and 10 global academic centers.   What is the word limit for the Writing Supplement? \u00a0   In your Writing Supplement response, answer both questions using a minimum of 250 words and a maximum of 500 words. \u00a0While we understand that this might not seem like enough space in which to fully express your interest in one (two or all three!) of our global campuses and your primary and secondary areas of academic study and any other interests you might have, please do your best to respond to both prompts in the space provided.                         5 Comments                hello my name is Adji Rama i live in senegal, situated in west africa.

Our Writing Supplement allows the Admissions Committee to learn more about your primary area of academic interest and about any other academic interests you could be considering at NYU. \u00a0Would you like to double major or participate in a cross-school minor? Are you undecided and looking to explore a number of areas of study? \u00a0Feel free to use the Writing Supplement to share your academic ambitions with the Committee.   The Writing Supplement also allows the Admissions Committee to learn more about any global campuses that interest you. \u00a0With campuses in New York, Abu Dhabi and Shanghai as well as 10 global academic centers on six continents, we are interested to hear how you might fully utilize our global network.   If I indicate an alternate campus of interest or an alternate area of academic interest, will the Admissions Committee assume that I am not as passionate about my primary campus or area of academic interest? \u00a0   At NYU, most of our students are taking an interdisciplinary approach to their studies. Having more than one area of academic interest is most welcome here at NYU and could indicate that you are open to exploring the many academic resources available to our students here. \u00a0We understand that you may have one area that you are incredibly interested in and a few you may be interested in exploring further. \u00a0Feel free to share your many interests in the Writing Supplement. \u00a0We will assume that your primary area of academic interest is the NYU school or program to which you applied and any other areas of academic interest you mention are ones you would like to explore during your time at NYU. \u00a0The same applies to your discussion of our three global campuses and 10 global academic centers.   What is the word limit for the Writing Supplement? \u00a0   In your Writing Supplement response, answer both questions using a minimum of 250 words and a maximum of 500 words. \u00a0While we understand that this might not seem like enough space in which to fully express your interest in one (two or all three!) of our global campuses and your primary and secondary areas of academic study and any other interests you might have, please do your best to respond to both prompts in the space provided.                         5 Comments                hello my name is Adji Rama i live in senegal, situated in west africa.
