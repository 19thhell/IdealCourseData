On the heels of its first absolute majority victory in the Scottish Parliament, the Scottish National Party led the charge for a referendum on independence. After reaching an agreement with the British government, an up-or-down vote will be held in late 2014. In Qu\u00e9bec, the Parti qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois formed a minority government in late 2012, bringing independence back onto the agenda after nearly 10 years out of power. In Catalonia, over one million people marched in support of independence in September 2012. Though the moderate separatist government led by the Convergence and Union Party lost ground in recent elections, separatists still make up enough seats to be able to call a referendum on independence. The Spanish government has vowed to block any vote on the issue.   This program aimed to frame the debate on these independence movements and discuss their possible trajectories in 2013 and beyond. The event provided a forum to discuss and exchange on differing experiences with similar referendums and devolution in the past.

Andrew Hughes Hallett  George Mason University &amp; St. Andrews University                               Andrew Hughes Hallett is Professor of Economics and Public Policy in the School of Public Policy at George Mason University. From 2001 to 2006, he was Professor of Economics at Vanderbilt University (Nashville) and before then at the University of Strathclyde in Scotland. He is a graduate of the University of Warwick (UK) and London School of Economics, holds a Doctorate from Oxford University, and is a visiting Professor at the University of St Andrews (Scotland). He has been Visiting Professor in Economics at Princeton University (Fulbright Fellow 1992-4), Bundesbank Professor at the Free University of Berlin (2005), and has held visiting positions at the Universities of Warwick, Frankfurt, Rome, Paris X, Cardiff and at the Copenhagen Business School.   Concurrently he acts as a Research Fellow in the Centre for Economic Policy Research (London); a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh (Scotland's Academy of Sciences) and former chair of their Economics Committee; and as joint editor of the Scottish Journal of Political Economy.   Professor Hughes Hallett's research interests lie in the fields of international economic policy; policy coordination; fiscal policy; the political economy of monetary integration and institutional design; and the theory of economic policy. This includes applications of game theory; fiscal-monetary interactions; exchange rate regimes; optimal policy under uncertainty; risk sharing; policies in transition or developing economies; and the issue of structural reform. In the past he has also worked on commodity markets and problems of financial market stabilisation, numerical methods in economics, and on strategic trade policy. In these areas he has published many papers in leading academic journals; plus 8 books and 16 government or agency reports, and has acted as expert witness to select committees of the Houses of Parliament on several occasions.   Beyond the academic world, he has acted as consultant to the World Bank and the IMF at various times; also the Federal Reserve in Washington, the Institute for International Economics in Washington, and to the UN, UNESCO, OECD, the European Commission, the European Central Bank, and to various governments and a number of central banks in Europe. These assignments have ranged from evaluations of trade policy; fiscal and monetary stability; the scope for stabilising financial/commodity markets; to an assessment of the dollar and partner currencies; investment under uncertainty; and evaluating of the best exchange rates for joining the Euro for the European Commission. He was one of 14 academics selected to review the UK government's the case for joining the Euro; and one of 18 selected by the European Commission to review the progress and future challenges of the new European currency and economic system. Currently he sits on the Council of Economic advisors to the Scottish government, and as an expert advisor to the Kalman Commission of the UK government on economic governance.
