We teach both computer science and technology so that students can develop the skills they need to pursue their careers and interests. Our interdisciplinary approach allows for students from all backgrounds and fields to find our courses both fun and practical. We can accommodate all levels so no prior background is required. If you do have prior computer experience, we would welcome you into our advanced classes.    All College of Arts Science students are eligible to pursue any of these programs. Non-CAS students will need written authorization from their home school. Students with transfer credits are required to complete half of their minor requirements at the Computer Science department. A grade of C or better is necessary in all courses to fulfill the minor requirements.
