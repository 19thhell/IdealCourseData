The journal was created in 2006 and published its first edition on &quot;Development Issues&quot; the same year.

These include but are not limited to issues of international law, human rights, development, globalization, public health, international finance and trade, security, and the environment.

THRILL is unique in that it focuses on issues and topics that put the needs of the human being first- not the needs of the state, the shareholder, the donor or the recipient, an industry, or even the international community as a whole. As a growing concentration, it should follow suit that human rights and international law students have adequate representation in academia, student affairs, SCPS events and external networks. THRILL exists to help bridge this gap in three particular ways:     Host events and discussions that fit our academic and career interests and goals;     Hold student discussion groups to debate and discuss issues relevant to the field of     international law and human rights;     Advocate for events and initiatives related to human rights and international law within the MSGA program as a whole.         THRILL is open to any student interested in the topic areas.
