This year we will consider proposals from two faculty members with different areas of expertise within the same department. However, all things being equal, preference will be given to those proposals which bring together colleagues and, ideally, students from different department, disciplines, and schools. Existing courses may be used for the team-taught initiative, or new courses may be proposed, either to be cross-listed in different departments and/or schools.   http://www.humanitiesinitiative.org/faculty-graduate-student-fellowships/team-teaching-stipends/   Innovation Venture Fund   The NYU Innovation Venture Fund is a seed-stage venture capital fund created to invest in startups founded by NYU students, faculty and researchers, and/or those commercializing NYU-developed technologies and intellectual property. The Fund seeks inventions, discoveries, products or services that were developed in whole or in part at NYU and are ready for commercial product development, rather than those requiring further basic research. Though a complete business plan and team is not required for consideration, the technology underpinning the venture concept should have achieved the proof-of- concept or prototype stage and solve a measurable problem in a large and growing market. The founders should be the nucleus around which a strong, entrepreneurial team can form and execute a financially attractive business plan.

This year we will consider proposals from two faculty members with different areas of expertise within the same department. However, all things being equal, preference will be given to those proposals which bring together colleagues and, ideally, students from different department, disciplines, and schools. Existing courses may be used for the team-taught initiative, or new courses may be proposed, either to be cross-listed in different departments and/or schools.   http://www.humanitiesinitiative.org/faculty-graduate-student-fellowships/team-teaching-stipends/   Innovation Venture Fund   The NYU Innovation Venture Fund is a seed-stage venture capital fund created to invest in startups founded by NYU students, faculty and researchers, and/or those commercializing NYU-developed technologies and intellectual property. The Fund seeks inventions, discoveries, products or services that were developed in whole or in part at NYU and are ready for commercial product development, rather than those requiring further basic research. Though a complete business plan and team is not required for consideration, the technology underpinning the venture concept should have achieved the proof-of- concept or prototype stage and solve a measurable problem in a large and growing market. The founders should be the nucleus around which a strong, entrepreneurial team can form and execute a financially attractive business plan.

This year we will consider proposals from two faculty members with different areas of expertise within the same department. However, all things being equal, preference will be given to those proposals which bring together colleagues and, ideally, students from different department, disciplines, and schools. Existing courses may be used for the team-taught initiative, or new courses may be proposed, either to be cross-listed in different departments and/or schools.   http://www.humanitiesinitiative.org/faculty-graduate-student-fellowships/team-teaching-stipends/   Innovation Venture Fund   The NYU Innovation Venture Fund is a seed-stage venture capital fund created to invest in startups founded by NYU students, faculty and researchers, and/or those commercializing NYU-developed technologies and intellectual property. The Fund seeks inventions, discoveries, products or services that were developed in whole or in part at NYU and are ready for commercial product development, rather than those requiring further basic research. Though a complete business plan and team is not required for consideration, the technology underpinning the venture concept should have achieved the proof-of- concept or prototype stage and solve a measurable problem in a large and growing market. The founders should be the nucleus around which a strong, entrepreneurial team can form and execute a financially attractive business plan.

Human Subjects    We expect many proposals will include the participation of human subjects. Investigators should note that the New York University Committee on Activities Involving Human Subjects must review and approve all funded proposals. Investigators are strongly encouraged to apply for human subjects approval shortly after the application is submitted.

The Office of Research must receive a copy of the UCAIHS approval before we will release funds.    More Information about Human Subjects .    Review Procedures    The NYU Steinhardt Challenge Review Committee, composed of a cross-section of faculty, will consider and review all proposals.

We will notify all applicants of decisions and review comments by the end of May.    Awards    We will offer awards of one year&rsquo;s duration in time to start on September 1, 2015.

Summer Grant Development stipends will be dispersed in the form of hourly wages prior to August 31, 2015, pursuant to successful completion of group review meetings.
