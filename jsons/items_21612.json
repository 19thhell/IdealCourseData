Diabetes) or catastrophic (eg. Cancer), settled     or uncertain many patients      interpret the     news as bad. The patient wants to be given \"relevant\" facts compassionately.     What is \"relevant\" varies, so the physician needs to ask specific questions     to learn what the patient knows and wants to know, what the patient's     health beliefs are and what the patient is capable of understanding.      Delivering bad     news is difficult because:          We fear being      blamed      We fear strong      emotional reactions-ours and the patient's      Some lack practice      or training in giving news      We may have to      confront our own fear of death or illness      What is \"bad news\"      for the patient may not be for us andvice- versa      Keep in mind that      bad news is difficult to hear. If people have strong emotional reactions      it doesn't necessarily mean that you did not deliver the news sensitively;      and a strong, appropriate emotional response is healthy.          We can learn skills     to deliver bad news by following these steps:      1. Prepare          Attend to your      own emotions.      Deliver news face-to-face      whenever possible.      Have all the necessary      information at hand.      Ensure sufficient      time and privacy.      Explore with patient      possible outcomes prior to testing.      Have the patient      have a significant other present.      Tape the session      and give the tape to the patient.          2. Assess Readiness          Assess patient's      readiness to receive bad news. \"Would you like to talk about your test      results now?\"      Prepare patient      by forecasting news. \"I have some difficult news for you\".          3.  Check     the patient's response          Remember, what      we find most concerning may not be what's most distressing to the patient.      \"What are you thinking/feeling?\" \"What are your concerns?\"      Give time and      opportunity to respond. Expect strong emotional responses and attend      to them before proceeding with information giving. Watch for shock      and shut down. \"We have some decisions to make about how to proceed.      Are you able to discuss this now?\"      Address basic      information needs. Don't try to give too much information at once. Give      more details after patient gets out of shock.      Goal is to achieve      a shared understanding of the problem. \"Can you tell me what you understand      about your problem?\"          4. Follow-up plan               Minimize feelings      of aloneness and isolation. \"I'm available\" \"Is there anyone else you'd      like me to speak to?\" \"Would you like me to call the chaplain, social      worker, etc?\"      Schedule timely      follow-up visit and be sure patient knows how to contact you in between.               We can deliver     diagnosis meaningfully by:           ASKING the patient his/her understanding of what the problem is.     Or reflect what you've heard if patient has already stated this.      TELLING the patient, \"You have\" or \"The diagnosis is not     clear yet, but I'm concerned about\"      ASKING the patient about his/her knowledge, feelings, beliefs,     and expectations.      A Reminder:      Ask     About : Knowledge      Description : Ask about understanding of your news. Adjust quantity     and type of information.      Examples : What do you already know about X?\" \"What questions do     you have?\" \"What do you want to know more about?\"           Ask About :      Feelings, Emotions, Reactions      Description : Ask about inner state in response to news, or reflect     the feelings you see or hear (see PEARLS Statments below).      Examples : \"What's your reaction to this?\" \"How are you feeling     about this?\" \"You look worried.\"      Ask About :      Beliefs, Meanings      Description : Ask about beliefs about why he/she has the problem     and/or what it means.      Examples : \"Why do you think you have high blood pressure?\" \"What     does X mean to you?\" \"How will you cope with the uncertainty?\"      Ask About :      Expectations      Description : Ask about expectations of future outcomes.      Examples : \"What do you expect to happen in the future?\"      RELATIONSHIP BUILDING     TECHNIQUES-Responding to Emotions          1. Recognize patient's     emotions: Anger, sadness, shock, fear, anxiety, happiness, grief, uncertainty,     confusion, etc. These effect patient's well being and care outcomes.          2. Show you notice by responding actively with a PEARLS (below)     statement, rather than with more questions or information.      P=Partnership      Function : Joint problem solving.      Statements : \"Let's tackle this together.\"      E=Empathy      Function : Show understanding. Put feelings into words. Show compassion     about illness.      Statements : \"That sounds hard.\" \"You look upset\" \"You seem discouraged.\"     \"I'm sorry you are ill.\"      A=Apology      Function : Show concern for errors, hurts.      Statements : \"I'm sorry I (or others) hurt/offended/upset you.\"      R=Respect      Function : Value patient's choices, traits, behaviors, and special     qualities.      Statements : \"I appreciate and respect your (courage, decision,     action).\" \"You have worked hard on this.\"      L=Legitimation      Function : Let the patient know that his or her response is normal     and expected. Validate his or her feelings and choices.      Statements : \"Anyone would be(confused, sad, irritated) by this     situation.\" Or \"I can understand why you feel\"      S=Support      Function : Offer ongoing support (non-abandonment).      Statements : \"I'll stick with you as long as necessary.\" \"We'll     work together on this.\" \"I'll be there for you.\" Resist the powerful temptation     to pursue clinical details when responding to emotion.

Active shooter situations are unpredictable and evolve quickly. Typically, the immediate deployment of law enforcement is required to stop the situation. Because active shooter situations often are over within 10 to 15 minutes, sometimes before law enforcement arrives on the scene, individuals must be prepared mentally and physically to deal with an active shooter situation.   Take a moment now to review a video co-developed by the US Department of Homeland Security and the City of Houston on \u201cRun-Hide-Fight\u201d click here . Please be warned, it is quite chilling and graphic, and it shows you what you can do during such a situation.     So, in the event you hear gunfire remember: Run. Hide. Fight.   Run. Get out and get away, as quietly and quickly as possible.     Have an escape route and plan in mind.   Evacuate regardless of whether others agree to follow.   Leave your belongings behind.   Help others escape, if possible.   Call 911 when you are safe.     Hide. If you can\u2019t flee, find a place to hide where the active shooter is less likely to find you.     Lock or barricade the doors.   Turn off lights.   Remain quiet.   Stay out of the active shooter\u2019s view.   Silence your cell phone.   Hide behind large items (e.g., file cabinets, desks) that could provide ballistic protection.     Fight. If all else fails, and only as a last resort, attack the shooter with whatever makeshift weapons you can find (scissors, portable fire extinguishers, chairs, etc.) to disarm and disable. It is best, when possible, to work with others.   When law enforcement arrives:     Remain calm and follow officer\u2019s instructions.   Keep hands visible at all times.   Avoid making quick movements toward officers.   Do not stop to ask the officers for help or directions when evacuating. Just proceed in the direction from which they entered the premises.

Have all the necessary      information at hand.      Ensure sufficient      time and privacy.      Explore with patient      possible outcomes prior to testing.      Have the patient      have a significant other present.      Tape the session      and give the tape to the patient.          2. Assess Readiness          Assess patient's      readiness to receive bad news. \"Would you like to talk about your test      results now?\"      Prepare patient      by forecasting news. \"I have some difficult news for you\".          3.  Check     the patient's response          Remember, what      we find most concerning may not be what's most distressing to the patient.      \"What are you thinking/feeling?\" \"What are your concerns?\"      Give time and      opportunity to respond. Expect strong emotional responses and attend      to them before proceeding with information giving. Watch for shock      and shut down. \"We have some decisions to make about how to proceed.      Are you able to discuss this now?\"      Address basic      information needs. Don't try to give too much information at once. Give      more details after patient gets out of shock.      Goal is to achieve      a shared understanding of the problem. \"Can you tell me what you understand      about your problem?\"          4. Follow-up plan               Minimize feelings      of aloneness and isolation. \"I'm available\" \"Is there anyone else you'd      like me to speak to?\" \"Would you like me to call the chaplain, social      worker, etc?\"      Schedule timely      follow-up visit and be sure patient knows how to contact you in between.               We can deliver     diagnosis meaningfully by:           ASKING the patient his/her understanding of what the problem is.     Or reflect what you've heard if patient has already stated this.      TELLING the patient, \"You have\" or \"The diagnosis is not     clear yet, but I'm concerned about\"      ASKING the patient about his/her knowledge, feelings, beliefs,     and expectations.      A Reminder:      Ask     About : Knowledge      Description : Ask about understanding of your news. Adjust quantity     and type of information.      Examples : What do you already know about X?\" \"What questions do     you have?\" \"What do you want to know more about?\"           Ask About :      Feelings, Emotions, Reactions      Description : Ask about inner state in response to news, or reflect     the feelings you see or hear (see PEARLS Statments below).      Examples : \"What's your reaction to this?\" \"How are you feeling     about this?\" \"You look worried.\"      Ask About :      Beliefs, Meanings      Description : Ask about beliefs about why he/she has the problem     and/or what it means.      Examples : \"Why do you think you have high blood pressure?\" \"What     does X mean to you?\" \"How will you cope with the uncertainty?\"      Ask About :      Expectations      Description : Ask about expectations of future outcomes.      Examples : \"What do you expect to happen in the future?\"      RELATIONSHIP BUILDING     TECHNIQUES-Responding to Emotions          1. Recognize patient's     emotions: Anger, sadness, shock, fear, anxiety, happiness, grief, uncertainty,     confusion, etc. These effect patient's well being and care outcomes.          2. Show you notice by responding actively with a PEARLS (below)     statement, rather than with more questions or information.      P=Partnership      Function : Joint problem solving.      Statements : \"Let's tackle this together.\"      E=Empathy      Function : Show understanding. Put feelings into words. Show compassion     about illness.      Statements : \"That sounds hard.\" \"You look upset\" \"You seem discouraged.\"     \"I'm sorry you are ill.\"      A=Apology      Function : Show concern for errors, hurts.      Statements : \"I'm sorry I (or others) hurt/offended/upset you.\"      R=Respect      Function : Value patient's choices, traits, behaviors, and special     qualities.      Statements : \"I appreciate and respect your (courage, decision,     action).\" \"You have worked hard on this.\"      L=Legitimation      Function : Let the patient know that his or her response is normal     and expected. Validate his or her feelings and choices.      Statements : \"Anyone would be(confused, sad, irritated) by this     situation.\" Or \"I can understand why you feel\"      S=Support      Function : Offer ongoing support (non-abandonment).      Statements : \"I'll stick with you as long as necessary.\" \"We'll     work together on this.\" \"I'll be there for you.\" Resist the powerful temptation     to pursue clinical details when responding to emotion.

Active shooter situations are unpredictable and evolve quickly. Typically, the immediate deployment of law enforcement is required to stop the situation. Because active shooter situations often are over within 10 to 15 minutes, sometimes before law enforcement arrives on the scene, individuals must be prepared mentally and physically to deal with an active shooter situation.   Take a moment now to review a video co-developed by the US Department of Homeland Security and the City of Houston on \u201cRun-Hide-Fight\u201d click here . Please be warned, it is quite chilling and graphic, and it shows you what you can do during such a situation.     So, in the event you hear gunfire remember: Run. Hide. Fight.   Run. Get out and get away, as quietly and quickly as possible.     Have an escape route and plan in mind.   Evacuate regardless of whether others agree to follow.   Leave your belongings behind.   Help others escape, if possible.   Call 911 when you are safe.     Hide. If you can\u2019t flee, find a place to hide where the active shooter is less likely to find you.     Lock or barricade the doors.   Turn off lights.   Remain quiet.   Stay out of the active shooter\u2019s view.   Silence your cell phone.   Hide behind large items (e.g., file cabinets, desks) that could provide ballistic protection.     Fight. If all else fails, and only as a last resort, attack the shooter with whatever makeshift weapons you can find (scissors, portable fire extinguishers, chairs, etc.) to disarm and disable. It is best, when possible, to work with others.   When law enforcement arrives:     Remain calm and follow officer\u2019s instructions.   Keep hands visible at all times.   Avoid making quick movements toward officers.   Do not stop to ask the officers for help or directions when evacuating. Just proceed in the direction from which they entered the premises.
