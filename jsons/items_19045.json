To find out more, please click here .          2014 The Fourth Annual GSAS Threesis Academic Challenge took place April 12, 2014 in the Silver Center. A record number of students participated in the Qualifying Rounds vying for a spot in the Finals. Competitors presented their own research in engaging talks of three minutes or less to panels of judges comprised of faculty representing the three disciplines of the Graduate School of Arts and Science: the Humanities, the Social Sciences and Science. Faculty advanced two competitors from each of the six qualifying groups using a three\u2013part criteria: how well the competitor grasped their research, how accessible the language of the presenter was and how engaging the presenter made the three minutes. The resulting twelve finalists took the big stage in the Eisner &amp; Lubin auditorium the following day to compete for the top prizes and coveted titles. Finalists from across the GSAS disciplines engaged a full house and an esteemed finalist-judging panel composed of the Deans for the Humanities, Social Sciences and Science as they reached for the top titles. From talks ranging in topic from genome editing to marriage and politics in Elizabethan literature, the captivated audience and judges had their hands full selecting the winners. Dean Lauren Benton; Tamara Day, the President of the GSAS Master's College Alumni Association (MCAA); and the 2013 first place winner Alexsandra Mitchell presided over the awards ceremony.
