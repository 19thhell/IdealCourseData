Research Activities   The faculty, post-doctoral trainees, and graduate students in this program area are addressing critical issues in the environmental health sciences. In recent research, they have made advances in exposure assessment including improved characterization of fine particles and their spatial variation within urban areas and in the regional northeastern U.S. background aerosol. They have also developed technologies and procedures to characterize the temporal day-to-day variations in ambient aerosol composition over extended periods of time in order to correlate such changes with observed daily variations in health-related cardiopulmonary responses. In terms of the characterization of health effects of particulate matter air pollution in human populations, this research group has extended its capabilities beyond studies that rely on non-specific mass concentrations of PM10\u00a0and/or PM2.5\u00a0to associations between mortality and morbidity and specific source-related pollution constituents and components for both acute and cumulative health effects. They have applied these approaches to populations of particular concern, including asthmatic children in the South Bronx region of New York City (NYC) and to residents of Lower Manhattan and Brooklyn who were acutely exposed to dust and smoke following the collapse of the World Trade Center (WTC) buildings on September 11, 2001. This involved utilization of air samples that we collected at the former NYU Downtown Hospital (5 blocks east of the WTC) on a daily basis beginning on September 14, 2001. Recent studies have demonstrated that the concentrations of components of PM2.5\u00a0vary greatly within NYC, with much higher concentrations of nickel in Bronx, Manhattan and northern Queens than in Brooklyn, Staten Island and southern Queens due to the combustion of much more residual oil in the northern parts of NYC.   Other notable strengths of the Program faculty include respiratory tract dosimetry and the modeling and analysis of temporal and spatial variations of air pollution exposure and other environmental variables that can influence, or confound, associations between measures of ambient air pollution and population based data on mortality and morbidity.   In summary, the mission of this Research Program is to identify the exposure related factors that play significant roles in the causation and/or exacerbation of disease associated with population exposures to air pollutants in community and/or work place settings. It also provides a forum and focus for innovative and multidisciplinary research directed at resolving the complex issues affecting both the exposure and response sides of the risk assessment paradigm. The opportunities for broadening the background knowledge and perspectives of the Program members are significantly enhanced by having frequent joint meetings with the members of the Systemic Toxicology Program of the Department, where opportunities are available to discuss hypotheses addressable by controlled inhalation exposures to concentrated ambient aerosols and/or realistic artificial atmospheres of suspect pollutant chemicals and mixtures.   Specific program goals for the next five years are to:   Pursue studies that determine the role of the components of ambient air PM that may account for the ability of such relatively low particle mass concentrations to elicit significant impacts on mortality and morbidity in the general population.   In collaboration with the Systemic Toxicology Program, to identify the specific ambient air constituents that correlate most closely with both the transient and persistent cardiac effects by subchronic exposures to particular matter.   Extend ongoing studies in New York City in order to determine the extent of the role that ambient air pollution (and especially traffic-related air pollution) plays in the high prevalence of pediatric asthma and its exacerbation.   Core Leadership   Dr. George D. Thurston , the Program Director for Human Exposure and Health Effects, received an Sc.D.\u00a0in environmental health science from Harvard University's School of Public Health, and did further research on mortality associated with air pollution at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government before joining NYU in 1988. His research on air pollution and its health effects at NYU has focused on ozone and particulate matter through studies on panels of children in summer camps, in schools in the South Bronx, and adults with pre-existing chronic diseases, as well as on time-series analyses of hospital admissions and excess daily mortality, and on the influence of chronic exposures on longevity in numerous U.S. communities.

His research has focused on health effects of air pollution in New York City, as well as in cities across the nation and around the world. In New York City, this has included his Backpack Study of the effect of diesel air pollution on children with asthma in the South Bronx. His research and collaborations in cities around the globe has included a study of the effects of industrial air pollution among children in Cubatao, Brazil. He was also an author of the most recent World Health Organization (WHO) Global Burden of Disease (GBD) report, published in the Lancet in 2012, which provided global estimates of the life years lost due to outdoor fine particulate matter air pollution (PM2.5), which were based in large measure on Dr. Thurston?s ACS cohort studies of PM2.5 air pollution and mortality, and his leading-edge collaborative research in which global PM2.5 concentrations were estimated based on global satellite data. Dr. Thurston has also been a leader in advancing the intersection of science and public policy decision-making. He has been called upon to testify before the US Senate and the House of Representatives on dozens of occasions to explain the public policy implications of air pollution research, most recently in October 2011 regarding the proposed mercury emission regulations. In 1999, he spoke at the Community of Parties (COP5) Kyoto Protocol meeting held in Bonn, Germany regarding his research on the immediate human health co-benefits of climate change mitigation steps from associated cleaner air quality. In 2002, he was called upon to testify before the Senate on the human health effects associated with the Word Trade Center disaster, in which he took a leadership role in collecting air pollution samples independent of the government, and in directly sharing that information with the community through public forums led by him at NYU and in Lower Manhattan. He has also served as a member of the U.S. EPA Clean Air Science Advisory Council (CASAC) that advises the EPA Administrator on the setting of the U.S. air quality standards, and has served on a National Academy of Science advisory committee on the environmental aspects of Waste Incineration. As a result of these activities, he has been frequently interviewed by the networks and the press, most recently on CNN International regarding the increasing problem of air pollution in Beijing, China. He has provided consistent leadership in his scientific organizations, and his research has been honored for its excellence by the scientific community. In May 2003, he organized and hosted the U.S. EPA supported international meeting: Workshop on the Source Apportionment of PM Health Effects. In 2004, he co-hosted the International Society of Environmental Epidemiology annual meeting, held at the NYU Kimmel Center in Washington Square. In 2012, Dr. Thurston was awarded the prestigious Haagen Smit Prize by the scientific journal Atmospheric Environment.
