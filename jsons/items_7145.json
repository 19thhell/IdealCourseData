Description       In this course students learn to think about the reading and writing practices of contemporary visual culture. What does it mean to \u201cread\u201d an image? How are images used politically? Is what is \u201cun-seen\u201d as important as what is seen? Students tackle philosophical, ethical, and political questions, and are encouraged to pursue topics that interest them for assigned papers and projects. We will ground our discussions in relevant theory and will explore all manner of visual genres, including the graphic novel form, film, magazine ads, and photography. In examining the politics of visual images, this course places special emphasis on images in the context of war. Moreover, we will consider our own roles in contemporary visual culture\u2014we are consumers, participators, creators, and sometimes we even have no power over images\u2014and what this means to us when considered through, for example, an ethical or aesthetic or humanitarian lens. Critical literature by Susan Sontag, Susie Linfield, Scott McCloud, and Marita Sturken, among others, will inform our discussions and deepen student writing. Our syllabus also includes journalistic accounts and war photography, including work by Joe Sacco and James Nachtwey, as well as an investigative documentary film by Errol Morris. Students will write reaction papers, longer essays, and have the option of a visual project.\u00a0 \u00a0                   Course Type       Interdisciplinary Seminars (IDSEM-UG)                               top of page                                                                   NYU Gallatin Footer              Gallatin School of Individualized Study     1 Washington Place     New York, NY 10003     (212) 998-7370                   A&#8211;Z Index      Directions      Contact Us      Job Opportunities               News      Support Gallatin      Feedback                         Follow us on Facebook      Follow us on Twitter      Follow us on Youtube         Follow us Instagram                 Unless otherwise noted, all content copyright NYU Gallatin.
