The program provides prospective collection managers and archivists with an international, comprehensive education in the theories, methods, and practices of moving image archiving and preservation. The curriculum covers all aspects of moving image archiving, including: Film History/Historiography and Film Style; Conservation, Preservation, Storage, and Management; Legal Issues and Copyright; Laboratory Techniques; Moving Image Cataloging; Curatorial Work and Museum Studies; Programming; New Media and other Digital Technologies; and Access to Archival Holdings.    This program takes full advantage of the New York area. Students work with archives, museums, libraries, labs and arts organizations, and undertake projects with organizations such as The Kitchen, Franklin Furnace, and the Flaherty Seminar. They do internships and practica with New York City organizations during the school year and with repositories either in New York or elsewhere during the summer. Also, students have the opportunity to engage with NYU's Art Conservation program and paper-based Archives Program.    Although the program trains students to deal with all types of moving image material in all settings, it also pays attention to problems posed by works that have no institutional stewardship (orphan, independent, avant-garde, documentary, non-institutional websites, etc.). The program also deals with the ties between the practices of moving image archiving and the practices of scholarly research.    Students engage in a rigorous course of study, completing 64 units of coursework over a two year period. During their second year, they complete and defend either a final thesis project, or a portfolio synthesizing the work they've done throughout their degree program.
