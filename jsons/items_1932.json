This is, unfortunately, not the result of changing musical tastes or a growing acceptance of subversive subcultures on the part of the American audience, but rather, is due to a single factor loathed by most participants in (the wide and diverse variety of) insular punk communities, the increasing ubiquity of the music itself in television commercials.     While using popular music identified with the counter-culture in advertising is nothing new (the controversial use of the Beatles \"Revolution\" in Nike commercials is a notorious example), still the use of a genre as universally identified as being against the values and political identity of mainstream America is a new, and some would say, a disturbing trend. The use of songs by punk stalwarts such as the Buzzcocks, Iggy Pop and the Stooges, Black Flag and The Minutemen, bands who were closely associated with the DIY movement (literally \"Do It Yourself\"- a term applied to the creation of production and distribution networks within the community and outside the influence of major labels and distributors), as well as \"alternative\" bands such as The Cult and The Smiths, and even the use of club and dance identified music by Air, Dimitri from Paris and others, could be seen as simply the inevitable commodification of subcultures by the mainstream. But, perhaps there are more positive connotations to this phenomenon to examine. In this essay I will discuss the most recent co-opting of underground music and analyze the negative, and surprisingly positive, implications of \"punk rock\" advertisements.      Punk Rock and Style    In recent years, there has been a renewed academic interest in the cultural implications of punk rock as a social movement. Most authors take Dick Hebdige's seminal work Subculture: The Meaning of Style as their template for examinations of punk rock. According to Hebdige, musical-based subcultures in general, and punk in particular, are engaged in a constant struggle for identity with mainstream culture where meaning is constantly negotiated and renegotiated. Subcultures such as punk try and create an identity set in resistance to the dominant culture and the dominant culture in turn tries to reintegrate the aberrant subculture, or at least place it within the dominant framework of meanings. As Hebdige notes, British punk in particular adopted symbols and forms of musical expression from other outcast cultures (such as the reggae music of Rastifarians and the suspenders and boots of post-World War II working class culture) and synthesized it into something uniquely their own. At the same time this process is taking place, the dominant culture tries to make sense of subcultures though various means, including news reports and articles in the mainstream mass media that identify the new subculture within a historical context, and by taking aspects of the culture such as fashion and commodifing them. (An example of this was the \"safety-pin chic\" promoted by designers such as Betsy Johnson.) According to Hebdige, commodification is the inevitable end result of this process of negotiation. Safety pins, leather jackets and ripped jeans are taken out of the context of rebellion and translated into runway fashion, selling for thousands of dollars at ritzy boutiques.      The most recent works of scholarship that analyze punk rock as a subculture, most notably the volume edited by Roger Sabin Punk Rock; So What?, try to reevaluate punk rock within the parameters of cultural studies. In an article by Frank Cartledge, \"Distress to Impress: Local Punk Fashion and Commodity Exchange,\" punk rock can not be seen so much as a resistance to mainstream culture, but as a sort of virus whose \"success\" can be measured in terms of \"introducing new forms of dress and behavior.\" In this construct, punk rock functions as an active agent, or in the words of Douglas Rushkoff, a \"Media Virus,\" that infects society almost subliminally with aspects of its worldview. I believe that while Cartledge's view is much more realistic and optimistic than the usual dissections of punk's legacy, it fails to break with the usual British cultural studies' identification of punk rock as a uniquely British phenomenon based on British class structure. While it certainly is true that the British version of punk rock was intimately based along class lines, this simplistic version fails not only to recognize that punk rock is primarily an American creation, but also is distinctly American in its relationships with both taste and the generation of cultural capital.     Even a cursory look at the formations of punk, as demonstrated by recent works such as Legs McNeil and Gillian McCain's Please Kill Me , and Clinton Heylin's From the Velvets to the Voidoids , reveals that the origins of punk rock clearly lie not only in the late 1960's aggressive rock of the Stooges and the MC5, but also in the self-consciously artistic Velvet Underground, who's alliance with Andy Warhol and debt to Delmore Schwartz and Lamonte Young reveals punk rock to be a creation of the well-educated and art-school trained upper classes. Thus, the American version of punk rock can be seen not simply as a reaction against the decaying economic system of Great Britain, but also as a self-conscious pose to identify one as outside the mainstream of \"normal'\" rock and roll. As punk pioneer (and well regarded poet and novelist) Richard Hell famously said, \"punk made it possible to completely reinvent yourself.\"    The punk look in America became a recognizable set of signifiers that was used to set oneself apart from the mainstream. Stuart Ewen noted in his book All Consuming Images that punk itself became a form of conspicuous consumption, one where those who chose to identify themselves as punk could adapt mainstream commodities to create a sense of identity not based on the British punk \"uniform\" but by using (at least during the early days) disparate styles to self-identify as punk. The baggy overcoats of Pere Ubu were as punk as the leather jackets of The Ramones, and as punk as the flightsuits and goggles of Devo. However, this applied not merely to fashion, which was one of, but not the most important signifier of punk. In fact, the most important signifier of American punk rock was also the most ephemeral of all concepts, taste.     In America, taste, or liking the correct bands in the punk canon, became the dominant signifier of punk rock. American punk was far too geographically diverse to form the closed communities of style that marked most European punk. If there was no set dress code, the only way to identify fellow punks (especially in the days when school dress codes were more rigid in most of the country) was by wearing the correct button, scrawling the correct band names on a notebook, or wearing the right band patch provided passwords and codes that only the initiated understood. As American punk positioned itself intentionally outside of the mainstream of American music, and even increasingly outside of the major label dominated music industry, having the correct taste in bands became a sort of cultural capital, or form of \"musical currency\" that legitimized those in possession of the necessary knowledge. (An example of this, although based on a British book, is the movie High Fidelity, where record store employees obsess about music and define a proper customer by their breadth of knowledge and musical taste.) Thus, becoming a punk involved learning a canon of \"acceptable\" music, and in a very real sense, becoming not just a purist, but also a musical elitist.      American punk rock really was always about taste, about defining oneself as outside the mainstream, not through economic situation or a mythologized class consciousness, but through a secret society of musical taste where ones' identity was validated through what one accepted and rejected as legitimate forms of musical expression. In many ways, this is no different than other forms of musical fanaticism, but punk rock's canon of authenticity was by no means a static one. The canon was always capable of revision as endless debates of what was and was not \"punk\" began to dominate the 'zines and public discussions about punk rock. In a way, punk rock became similar to dance culture and club culture where the music is also seen as having a canon, but capable of (and in need of) constant evolution and adaptation, although it is doubtful that dance culture has become as relentlessly doctrinaire as modern punk culture. Punk bands that have achieved a modicum of mainstream success such as Green Day were seen as derivative of the original canon and also as \"selling out\" by a community that tries to avoid major record labels and access to widespread audiences as a conscious decision. Variations in musical style were not overt considerations in whether a band was considered authentic or not, rather a dedication to the ephemeral \"principles\" of punk rock were the main criteria. Maximum Rock and Roll , a 'zine often considered the \"bible\" and chief validator of authenticity for punk rock once tried to sum up the punk aesthetic simply as \"honest music, not money making.\" Likewise, the recent plethora of advertisements using punk rock seems on the surface a direct challenge to the closely guarded authenticity of punk rock, and another inevitable step towards the commodification of a subculture. However, this time the danger comes not from without, but from within.          &lt;&lt; Page 1 >> Page      2 >>                  :: I. M.

This focus provides a concrete means for deepening our understanding of alternative models of social explanation. Drawing on ethnographic material from a wide range of cultures, as well as feature films and our own observations and interviews, we consider topics such as the material dimensions of food production, distribution, and consumption (e.g., how food scarcity or abundance shapes collective possibilities, expectations, and values; the causes, consequences, forms, and myths of globalization) and the cultural meanings and social distinctions encoded in food practices (e.g., how food is used cross-culturally as a marker of social identity\u2014class, gender, and ethnicity\u2014and as a source of meaning\u2014nostalgia, anxiety, and so on). Formations of Indigeneity ANTH-UA 605 Formerly ANTH-UA 320. Prerequisite: Human Society and Culture (ANTH-UA 1) or equivalent. Offered every other year. 4 points. Through a case study of materials concerning indigenous people in Australia and North America, this course will investigate the consequences (cultural, sociological, policy) of a development that has taken place throughout the world. Many of the peoples in whom anthropologists have long been interested\u2013those organized into small-scale societies, kinship based\u2013have been encapsulated as indigenous minorities within nation states dominated by other cultural traditions. In this context, the capacity and practices of these peoples, who some have characterized as \u201cFourth World peoples,\u201d to reproduce themselves and their traditions in their own terms has been limited, undermined, co-opted and, on occasion, ironically reinforced.

Why do some primates live in large social groups while others are solitary and yet others live in pairs or cooperatively breeding families? Why are strong social hierarchies seen in some primate taxa but not in others? How do multiple species of primates often manage to coexist in the same habitat? Why are social relationships in some primate species characterized by strong bonds among females while such bonds are absent in other primate societies? Why do some species of primates show marked geographic variability in behavior and social structure? The answers to these and other questions lie in understanding the relationships between each species and its ecological and social setting and in understanding each species' phylogenetic history.

Integrates evolutionary biology, genetics, immunology, ecology, and behavioral ecology, along with sociocultural anthropology, politics, and economics, to better understand newly emerging and reemerging diseases as they affect human health. General evolutionary theory and an introduction to Darwinian medicine are provided before the course examines viral, bacterial, parasitic, and prion-based diseases along with their hosts, vectors, and other organisms. Particular attention is paid to how humans have purposely and inadvertently created both biological and cultural environments for the transmission of different diseases. Media representations and misrepresentations are examined throughout the course.    Human Ecology    ANTH-UA 90 Prerequisite: Human Evolution (ANTH-UA 2) or permission of the instructor. Crabtree. 4 points.   Investigates the degree to which variation in human biology and culture can be understood as adaptations to varying external conditions. Examines the relationship of human systems of action and the natural world to understand the various forms of human adaptation. Case studies of several living peoples, contemporary and past biological communities, and prehistoric cultures provide the material for interpretation and evaluation of theoretical positions.    Evolution of Language    ANTH-UA 240 Prerequisite: Human Evolution (ANTH-UA 2) or permission of the instructor. 4 points.   Explores the various hypotheses offered for the evolution of language. Perspectives from different disciplines are discussed. Topics include human evolution and the study of fossil humans, animal and primate behavior and communication, anatomy of the vocal tract, neuroanatomy, language acquisition, language universals, the origins and diversification of modern languages, and the origins of writing.    Introduction to Forensic Anthropology    ANTH-UA 326 Ant\u00f3n, Williams. 4 points.   Biological anthropology examines the evolutionary history and adaptability of humans and our ancestors. Forensic anthropology is an applied subfield of biological anthropology that provides expert analysis of the skeleton in a medicolegal setting by utilizing methods developed in skeletal biology, archaeology, and the forensic sciences. Forensic anthropologists play critical roles in identifying victims of mass fatalities (such as the World Trade Center and Oklahoma City bombings), in investigating homicides (such as identifying the Russian tsar's family), and in distinguishing cause of death. The course examines how forensic anthropologists approach modern and historic crimes in the laboratory and the field. Students are introduced to the underlying theory and the applied techniques that forensic anthropologists use to recover and identify individuals and assess cause of death.

Punk Rock, Authenticity and Cultural Capital.                    By Brian Cogan      >>Printable .PDF version                    After years of alternately being declared either dead, irrelevant, or simply too outrageous to be accepted into the fabric of American culture, and almost thirty years after it first reared it's mohawk'd head in public, the musical genre known as \"punk rock\" has finally been accepted as part of mainstream American culture. This is, unfortunately, not the result of changing musical tastes or a growing acceptance of subversive subcultures on the part of the American audience, but rather, is due to a single factor loathed by most participants in (the wide and diverse variety of) insular punk communities, the increasing ubiquity of the music itself in television commercials.     While using popular music identified with the counter-culture in advertising is nothing new (the controversial use of the Beatles \"Revolution\" in Nike commercials is a notorious example), still the use of a genre as universally identified as being against the values and political identity of mainstream America is a new, and some would say, a disturbing trend. The use of songs by punk stalwarts such as the Buzzcocks, Iggy Pop and the Stooges, Black Flag and The Minutemen, bands who were closely associated with the DIY movement (literally \"Do It Yourself\"- a term applied to the creation of production and distribution networks within the community and outside the influence of major labels and distributors), as well as \"alternative\" bands such as The Cult and The Smiths, and even the use of club and dance identified music by Air, Dimitri from Paris and others, could be seen as simply the inevitable commodification of subcultures by the mainstream. But, perhaps there are more positive connotations to this phenomenon to examine. In this essay I will discuss the most recent co-opting of underground music and analyze the negative, and surprisingly positive, implications of \"punk rock\" advertisements.      Punk Rock and Style    In recent years, there has been a renewed academic interest in the cultural implications of punk rock as a social movement. Most authors take Dick Hebdige's seminal work Subculture: The Meaning of Style as their template for examinations of punk rock. According to Hebdige, musical-based subcultures in general, and punk in particular, are engaged in a constant struggle for identity with mainstream culture where meaning is constantly negotiated and renegotiated. Subcultures such as punk try and create an identity set in resistance to the dominant culture and the dominant culture in turn tries to reintegrate the aberrant subculture, or at least place it within the dominant framework of meanings. As Hebdige notes, British punk in particular adopted symbols and forms of musical expression from other outcast cultures (such as the reggae music of Rastifarians and the suspenders and boots of post-World War II working class culture) and synthesized it into something uniquely their own. At the same time this process is taking place, the dominant culture tries to make sense of subcultures though various means, including news reports and articles in the mainstream mass media that identify the new subculture within a historical context, and by taking aspects of the culture such as fashion and commodifing them. (An example of this was the \"safety-pin chic\" promoted by designers such as Betsy Johnson.) According to Hebdige, commodification is the inevitable end result of this process of negotiation. Safety pins, leather jackets and ripped jeans are taken out of the context of rebellion and translated into runway fashion, selling for thousands of dollars at ritzy boutiques.      The most recent works of scholarship that analyze punk rock as a subculture, most notably the volume edited by Roger Sabin Punk Rock; So What?, try to reevaluate punk rock within the parameters of cultural studies. In an article by Frank Cartledge, \"Distress to Impress: Local Punk Fashion and Commodity Exchange,\" punk rock can not be seen so much as a resistance to mainstream culture, but as a sort of virus whose \"success\" can be measured in terms of \"introducing new forms of dress and behavior.\" In this construct, punk rock functions as an active agent, or in the words of Douglas Rushkoff, a \"Media Virus,\" that infects society almost subliminally with aspects of its worldview. I believe that while Cartledge's view is much more realistic and optimistic than the usual dissections of punk's legacy, it fails to break with the usual British cultural studies' identification of punk rock as a uniquely British phenomenon based on British class structure. While it certainly is true that the British version of punk rock was intimately based along class lines, this simplistic version fails not only to recognize that punk rock is primarily an American creation, but also is distinctly American in its relationships with both taste and the generation of cultural capital.     Even a cursory look at the formations of punk, as demonstrated by recent works such as Legs McNeil and Gillian McCain's Please Kill Me , and Clinton Heylin's From the Velvets to the Voidoids , reveals that the origins of punk rock clearly lie not only in the late 1960's aggressive rock of the Stooges and the MC5, but also in the self-consciously artistic Velvet Underground, who's alliance with Andy Warhol and debt to Delmore Schwartz and Lamonte Young reveals punk rock to be a creation of the well-educated and art-school trained upper classes. Thus, the American version of punk rock can be seen not simply as a reaction against the decaying economic system of Great Britain, but also as a self-conscious pose to identify one as outside the mainstream of \"normal'\" rock and roll. As punk pioneer (and well regarded poet and novelist) Richard Hell famously said, \"punk made it possible to completely reinvent yourself.\"    The punk look in America became a recognizable set of signifiers that was used to set oneself apart from the mainstream. Stuart Ewen noted in his book All Consuming Images that punk itself became a form of conspicuous consumption, one where those who chose to identify themselves as punk could adapt mainstream commodities to create a sense of identity not based on the British punk \"uniform\" but by using (at least during the early days) disparate styles to self-identify as punk. The baggy overcoats of Pere Ubu were as punk as the leather jackets of The Ramones, and as punk as the flightsuits and goggles of Devo. However, this applied not merely to fashion, which was one of, but not the most important signifier of punk. In fact, the most important signifier of American punk rock was also the most ephemeral of all concepts, taste.     In America, taste, or liking the correct bands in the punk canon, became the dominant signifier of punk rock. American punk was far too geographically diverse to form the closed communities of style that marked most European punk. If there was no set dress code, the only way to identify fellow punks (especially in the days when school dress codes were more rigid in most of the country) was by wearing the correct button, scrawling the correct band names on a notebook, or wearing the right band patch provided passwords and codes that only the initiated understood. As American punk positioned itself intentionally outside of the mainstream of American music, and even increasingly outside of the major label dominated music industry, having the correct taste in bands became a sort of cultural capital, or form of \"musical currency\" that legitimized those in possession of the necessary knowledge. (An example of this, although based on a British book, is the movie High Fidelity, where record store employees obsess about music and define a proper customer by their breadth of knowledge and musical taste.) Thus, becoming a punk involved learning a canon of \"acceptable\" music, and in a very real sense, becoming not just a purist, but also a musical elitist.      American punk rock really was always about taste, about defining oneself as outside the mainstream, not through economic situation or a mythologized class consciousness, but through a secret society of musical taste where ones' identity was validated through what one accepted and rejected as legitimate forms of musical expression. In many ways, this is no different than other forms of musical fanaticism, but punk rock's canon of authenticity was by no means a static one. The canon was always capable of revision as endless debates of what was and was not \"punk\" began to dominate the 'zines and public discussions about punk rock. In a way, punk rock became similar to dance culture and club culture where the music is also seen as having a canon, but capable of (and in need of) constant evolution and adaptation, although it is doubtful that dance culture has become as relentlessly doctrinaire as modern punk culture. Punk bands that have achieved a modicum of mainstream success such as Green Day were seen as derivative of the original canon and also as \"selling out\" by a community that tries to avoid major record labels and access to widespread audiences as a conscious decision. Variations in musical style were not overt considerations in whether a band was considered authentic or not, rather a dedication to the ephemeral \"principles\" of punk rock were the main criteria. Maximum Rock and Roll , a 'zine often considered the \"bible\" and chief validator of authenticity for punk rock once tried to sum up the punk aesthetic simply as \"honest music, not money making.\" Likewise, the recent plethora of advertisements using punk rock seems on the surface a direct challenge to the closely guarded authenticity of punk rock, and another inevitable step towards the commodification of a subculture. However, this time the danger comes not from without, but from within.          &lt;&lt; Page 1 >> Page      2 >>                  :: I. M.

Explores the history and development of anthropology's relationship to visual practices, focusing on, but not limited to, photography and film, both as a mode for representing culture and as a site of cultural practice. Examines the emergence of, as well as the contestations around, the genre known as ethnographic film and its relationship to wider debates about documentary and nonfictional film practice. One of the central themes of the course is the relationship between representation, power, and knowledge as manifest in cross-cultural representation.    Anthropology of Media    ANTH-UA 123 Prerequisite: Human Society and Culture (ANTH-UA 1) or permission of the instructor. Ganti, Ginsburg, Stout. 4 points.   Examines the social and political life of media and how it makes a difference in the daily lives of people as a practice\u2014in production, reception, or circulation. Introduces some key concepts in social theory such as ideology, hegemony, the public sphere, and the nation, which have been critical to the study of the media across disciplines. Provides an overview of the increasing theoretical attention paid to the mass media by anthropologists and focuses on concrete ethnographic examples. Examines cross-culturally how the mass media have become the primary means for the circulation of symbolic forms across time and space and crucial to the constitution of subjectivities, collectivities, and histories in the contemporary world. Topics include the role of media in constituting and contesting national identities, in forging alternative political visions, in transforming religious practice, and in creating subcultures.    Anthropology of Art    ANTH-UA 125 Prerequisite: Human Society and Culture (ANTH-UA 1) or permission of the instructor. Geismar, Myers. 4 points.   Introduces students to the \"classic\" literature within the anthropology of art, charts the development and interests of this subdiscipline of anthropology, and uses this material to develop an \"anthropological\" perspective on art that can be used as a key form of critical inquiry into diverse art forms\u2014even those not conventionally explored in the history of anthropology. The starting point for the anthropology of art is to ask, \"What is art?\" in comparative cultural perspective. Analyzes, among other things, the idea of aesthetics in cross-cultural context; the notion of style; the relation between art, technology, and skill; the entanglement of primitivism and modernity; the role of class and taste in appreciating art; art and value in the marketplace; art and museum practice; tourist art and the value of authenticity; and colonial and postcolonial art.    Religion and Media    ANTH-UA 220 Prerequisite: Human Society and Culture (ANTH-UA 1) or permission of the instructor. Zito. 4 points per term.   Introduces students to the long-standing and complex connection between religious practices and various media.

Race, \"Difference,\" and Social Inequality      ANTH-UA 323 Identical to SCA-UA 323. Prerequisite: Human Society and Culture (ANTH-UA 1) or permission of the instructor. Khan. 4 points.   Human beings have always grappled with some notion of identity, asking questions about who they are, about who others distinguished from themselves are, and about the ways that perceived similarities and differences are meaningful and important (or not) in social relationships. Examines how historical, social, and cultural contexts shape the forms that identities take, looking in particular at ideas about race and racial identity. We work with two premises: (1) race must be understood in relation to other identity categories: gender, class, sexuality, ethnicity, and so on, and (2) race is expressed in both obvious and subtle ways; thus, racial identity is implicit as well as explicitly expressed. We also consider whether race must necessarily be understood as stigma; discuss nonfiction, fiction, and films; and may visit public exhibitions.    Reimagining Community: Race, Nation, and the Politics of Belonging    ANTH-UA 325 Identical to SCA-UA 200. Prerequisite: Human Society and Culture (ANTH-UA 1) or permission of the instructor.

Language and Law    ANTH-UA 329 Prerequisite: Human Society and Culture (ANTH-UA 1) or permission of the instructor. Schieffelin. 4 points.   Arguments and conflicts are part of everyday life, and language is central to both their instigation and resolution. Explores how speakers ranging from small children to litigants in courts attempt to settle their differences. Comparative materials illustrate theories of disputes and dispute resolution, examining the power of language and the language of power in a variety of settings (e.g., mediation, arbitration, trials). Class includes fieldwork trips to small claims court. Students audio-record cases and transcribe and analyze them according to different analytic perspectives. Bilingual students are encouraged to focus on cases that use interpreters.    Gender, Violence, and the Law    ANTH-UA 330 Prerequisite: Human Society and Culture (ANTH-UA 1) or permission of the instructor. Merry. 4 points.   Examines the global prevalence of gender violence and the varied meanings of violence against women and changes in terminology over time. Examines ways of theorizing gender and violence, including performative ideas of gender. The creation of gender violence as a social problem is a product of social movements in the United States, Europe, India, and many other parts of the world. It is now understood globally as an important human rights violation. Also examines the forms of intervention that have been developed in the United States and globally for diminishing violence against women, including policing, prosecution, and punishment.    Human Rights and Culture    ANTH-UA 331 Prerequisite: Human Society and Culture (ANTH-UA 1) or permission of the instructor. Merry. 4 points.   Offers an overview of the human rights system, looking at its basic elements and studying how it works. Focuses on the relationships between human rights and culture. Human rights campaigns frequently encounter resistance in the name of protecting cultural differences. This is particularly common with issues concerning women, children, and the family. Explores several issues that raise questions of human rights and culture, such as female genital cutting, honor killing, trafficking of persons, and indigenous peoples' rights to culture. Using these examples, considers how the human rights system deals with tensions between global standards and local ways of life. Examines the meanings of rights and of culture in these debates and shows the implications of adopting an anthropological analysis of these situations. The goal of the course is developing an understanding of human rights in practice.    Body, Gender, and Belief in China    ANTH-UA 350 Identical to RELST-UA 350. Prerequisite: Human Society and Culture (ANTH-UA 1) or permission of the instructor. Zito. 4 points.

Discusses the practices of filiality in Buddhism, Confucian orthodoxy, and folk religion.    Transnationalism and Anthropology    ANTH-UA 400 Prerequisite: Human Society and Culture (ANTH-UA 1) or permission of the instructor. Das, Ganti, Khan. 4 points.   Examines what is considered \"new\" in the ongoing reconstruction of world order and its accompanying disorder. Also examines how this changes the ways people earn their livelihoods; how cultures are transmitted and hybridized; how migrating populations maintain connections to their homelands; how group identities are constructed and asserted; and how social movements around newly politicized issues arise. Discusses changing roles of nation-states and the growing significance of transnational, diasporic, and globalized social relations and cultural forms.    Culture Through Food    ANTH-UA 410 Prerequisite: Human Society and Culture (ANTH-UA 1) or permission of the instructor. Abercrombie, Rogers. 4 points.   Explores some of the ways that people use food, cuisines, and eating to organize and engage with social worlds. This focus provides a concrete means for deepening our understanding of alternative models of social explanation. Drawing on ethnographic material from a wide range of cultures, as well as feature films and our own observations and interviews, we consider topics such as the material dimensions of food production, distribution, and consumption (e.g., how food scarcity or abundance shapes collective possibilities, expectations, and values; the causes, consequences, forms, and myths of globalization) and the cultural meanings and social distinctions encoded in food practices (e.g., how food is used cross-culturally as a marker of social identity\u2014class, gender, and ethnicity\u2014and as a source of meaning\u2014nostalgia, anxiety, and so on). Formations of Indigeneity ANTH-UA 605 Formerly ANTH-UA 320. Prerequisite: Human Society and Culture (ANTH-UA 1) or equivalent. Offered every other year. 4 points. Through a case study of materials concerning indigenous people in Australia and North America, this course will investigate the consequences (cultural, sociological, policy) of a development that has taken place throughout the world. Many of the peoples in whom anthropologists have long been interested\u2013those organized into small-scale societies, kinship based\u2013have been encapsulated as indigenous minorities within nation states dominated by other cultural traditions. In this context, the capacity and practices of these peoples, who some have characterized as \u201cFourth World peoples,\u201d to reproduce themselves and their traditions in their own terms has been limited, undermined, co-opted and, on occasion, ironically reinforced.      Roma in East Central Europe   ANTH-UA 9200 Offered at NYU Prague. 4 points.   Introduces students to the development of Romany politics and culture from a persecuted minority to the emergence of Romany organizations, with an emphasis on Central and Eastern Europe.

Barbarian Europe    ANTH-UA 217 Prerequisite: Archaeology: Early Societies and Cultures (ANTH-UA 3) or permission of the instructor. Crabtree. 4 points.   Between the end of the Ice Age and the expansion of the Roman Empire, temperate Europe witnessed a series of social and economic transformations that represented a transition from a hunting and gathering way of life to urban chiefdoms. Along the way, these hunter-gatherers became agriculturalists and stockherders, learned to use metals, and developed social structures as complex as any found in Old World civilizations. Examines changes in later prehistoric Europe from about 8000 B.C.E. to the arrival of the Romans.    African Archaeology    ANTH-UA 218 Prerequisite: Archaeology: Early Societies and Cultures (ANTH-UA 3). Tryon. 4 points.   With the longest record of human occupation in the world and a landmass that represents more than one-fifth the habitable area of the globe, Africa plays a central role in our understanding of human evolution, the prehistory of our species, and the development of complex societies. Explores the experiences of ancient human populations in Africa using evidence drawn from archaeology as well as history, ethnography, linguistics, art history, geography, geology, paleontology, biology, and other disciplines. Focuses not only on the material evidence from across the continent and its interpretation, but also an understanding of the major questions, developing methods of inquiry and problem solving, and situating the African data in the broader context of the archaeological evidence for the evolution of human behavioral diversity. The scope of the course spans hominin origins, the study of Stone Age foragers of the first 2.5 million years of human prehistory, and more recent periods characterized by food production, metallurgy, sedentism, and the development of complex societies (e.g., in Egypt, Mali, Zimbabwe, and the East African coast) with influence and contacts across and outside the continent.    Discovering Archaeology in New York City    ANTH-UA 225 Wright. 4 points.   In this course, New York City is our archaeological site. The period covered is from 10,000 years ago to the beginning of the 20th century and is based on archaeological remains. Its history is both fascinating and mind-expanding as a different perspective on the city emerges in time and space from what is learned. Walking around its various boroughs, students learn that our modern landscape is vastly different from that of earlier eras. Along with our gains as a major cultural center, we will assess some losses brought about by the destruction of aspects of the city\u2019s past. In particular, students come to understand the meaning of stewardship in the context of urban development. At the same time, viewing our place in the city\u2019s 10,000 years of history gives us a deeper sense of time and place and a unity in its shared heritage. Last Hunters-First Farmers ANTH-UA 608 Prerequisite: Archaeology: Early Societies and Cultures (ANTH-UA 3) or instructor permission. Offered every two years. 4 points. Last   Hunters-First Farmers explores the transition from foraging to   agriculture throughout the Eastern Hemisphere and the Americas. The   course begins with a review of the theories that have been proposed to   explain the transition from hunting to gathering to farming and the   archaeological methods that have been used to explore this question. The   archaeological evidence for the beginnings of farming in various   regions of the world is then explored in greater detail in order to   understand the specific reasons for the transition from foraging to   farming and the consequences of the adoption of agriculture.

Why do some primates live in large social groups while others are solitary and yet others live in pairs or cooperatively breeding families? Why are strong social hierarchies seen in some primate taxa but not in others? How do multiple species of primates often manage to coexist in the same habitat? Why are social relationships in some primate species characterized by strong bonds among females while such bonds are absent in other primate societies? Why do some species of primates show marked geographic variability in behavior and social structure? The answers to these and other questions lie in understanding the relationships between each species and its ecological and social setting and in understanding each species' phylogenetic history. Explores the diversity of primate social systems and the evolutionary relationships among the primates and discusses many of the general ecological laws that have been proposed by evolutionary biologists as the keys to understanding important features of primate behavior and ecology.    Health and Disease in Human Evolution    ANTH-UA 55 Prerequisite: Human Evolution (ANTH-UA 2) or permission of the instructor. Ant\u00f3n, Disotell. 4 points.    Examines human health and disease within an ecological framework, exploring the interactions  of environmental, genetic, physiological, and cultural factors in the expression and distribution of human diseases. Develops pathology profiles for nonhuman primates; prehistoric human populations; and hunting and gathering, agricultural, and industrial groups, with emphasis on the expression of infectious disease in human history and newly (re)emerging diseases.    Comparative Biology of the Living Primates    ANTH-UA 56 Prerequisite: Human Evolution (ANTH-UA 2) or permission of the instructor. Harrison, Williams. 4 points.   Study of the comparative biology of the primates, our closest living relatives, is fundamental to a sound understanding of human biology and evolution.

Prerequisite: Human Evolution (ANTH-UA 2). Offered periodically. 4 points. Increased   social and communicative complexity is one of the defining features of   humans compared to other mammals. Key insights into the evolution of   human communication can come from studying our most closely related   extant relatives, our fellow members of the Primate order. The present   course features a mixture of lectures and discussion classes to consider   contemporary topics in primate (including human) communication. Topics   covered include definitions of communication and consideration of its   major theoretical issues such as the difference between signals and   cues, signal honesty, and concepts of signal information content and   evolutionary signal design. Sections of the class focus on communication   in different sensory modalities\u2014olfactory, auditory, and visual, as   well as multimodal communication\u2014before discussing theories and issues   related to the evolution of language. The class finishes by considering   some of the most contemporary topics in primate communication.    Emerging Diseases    ANTH-UA 80 Disotell, Harrison. 4 points.   Integrates evolutionary biology, genetics, immunology, ecology, and behavioral ecology, along with sociocultural anthropology, politics, and economics, to better understand newly emerging and reemerging diseases as they affect human health. General evolutionary theory and an introduction to Darwinian medicine are provided before the course examines viral, bacterial, parasitic, and prion-based diseases along with their hosts, vectors, and other organisms.
