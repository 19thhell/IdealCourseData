Notes: Primary sources emphasize the lack of intermediaries between the thing or events being studied and reports of those things or events based on the belief that firsthand accounts are more accurate. Examples of primary sources include letters and diaries; government, church, and business records; oral histories; photographs, motion pictures, and videos; maps and land records; and blueprints. Newspaper articles contemporaneous with the events described are traditionally considered primary sources, although the reporter may have compiled the story from witnesses, rather than being an eyewitness. Artifacts and specimens may also be primary evidence if they are the object of study.

Almost every special collection holds unprocessed, uncataloged collections as well as processed collections that may be described in a paper finding aid, inventory, calendar or other document that is available only by visiting the library. Some repositories allow researchers to use unprocessed collections, while others do not, so contact the staff of the collection to find out about the availability of specific materials.

These collections have rules and procedures that may differ from those of general libraries.   Special collections materials usually do not circulate, for example, and researchers may have to make appointments, register to use collections, and request items using call slips and forms. Collections may be stored offsite and require prior notice for access.                 It is always a wise policy to visit a special collection's website and.or contact library staff prior to visiting to find out about access policies and protocols.

Regulations vary by repository and usually include signing in daily, registering, showing a traceable photo ID, and using pencils to take notes.    Materials usually do not circulate outside the library, and food and drink, coats, and large bags are rarely allowed in special collections reading rooms.    Some repositories require that researchers make appointments to use manuscripts or archival materials.   Special collections are usually shelved in closed stacks areas and retrieved by library staff for researchers who have filled out call slips or request forms.  Visit the websites of NYU Special Collections  for information.

NYU Special Collections           Comments (0)                                         Access Restrictions                 Depending on the repository and/or the collection, access to certain materials may be restricted. Some repositories open their collections to researchers at the graduate level or above.   Others require researchers to apply to use a library before granting them access.   Donor restrictions might require researchers to request permission in writing before they may use a collection. Or researchers may be able to use a collection but not reproduce anything from it.   Certain materials might be accessible only by permission.   Consult the collection finding aid to see if any restrictions apply.   Materials might be housed at another location and require several days&rsquo; notice to retrieve.   Consult a repository&rsquo;s home page for details on access, reading room hours, ID requirements, etc., before visiting.   You might have to use a surrogate format (i.e., photocopies, microfilm, digital files) if the originals are in fragile condition.   Electronic finding aids for archival collections contain a section that details any restrictions governing use of the collection. Be certain to read that section carefully.   To make the most of your research visit, always contact a special collection prior to visiting, especially if you are traveling a long distance.

These items are often one-of-a-kind. To ensure their long-term preservation, please observe the following guidelines:     Handle documents carefully.    Read books in book cradles, if appropriate.    Inform library staff when you encounter volumes with uncut pages.   Keep folders of documents flat on the table.   Do not hold documents up in the air to read them.    Turn pages gently.   Do not disturb the order of the documents.    Use pencils to take notes.    Do not eat or drink near special collections materials.    Wash your hands before handling documents.    Be sure to alert archives staff if you encounter damaged or extremely fragile material that may need special attention before it can be safely handled.

Accurately record the collection name, box number, folder number, and document details when taking notes. If you are citing correspondence, record the author, the recipient, and the date of the letter, if known.   Format your citations as instructed in the finding aid for the collection.      If you wish to quote from unpublished materials in a special library collection, you must request permission from the repository as well as from the appropriate copyright holders. It is often wise to check with archivists before quoting to make sure there are no use restrictions.  Contact NYU Special Collections .

When a particular item is available in a surrogate format, researchers will be given the surrogate to preserve the original.    Primary sources originally in manuscript form, such as correspondence, diaries, ledgers, maps, and other hand-written documents, may be availabe in printed and/or electronic editions. The same is true with speeches and broadcasts, for which transcripts may have been published.   One example of printed correspondence is The Papers of George Washington (Washington, George, and Dorothy Twohig. 1998. The papers of George Washington. Retirement series . Charlottesville: University Press of Virginia.)   Find printed editions of an individual's manuscripts in BobCat or WorldCat with a search by Author or Subject. Subject searches may take the form \"Author -- Correspondence\" such as \"Abraham Lincoln -- correspondence\" or \"Presidents -- United States -- Correspondence.\"   One fine example of manuscripts published online is The Mark Twain Project Online , a website whose, \"ultimate purpose is to produce a digital critical edition, fully annotated, of everything Mark Twain wrote. \"   Finding aids for archival collections and records in BobCat , NYU&rsquo;s library catalog, will indicate the availability of microfilm or digitized images.   There are advantages to using surrogate formats: Microfilm and books are often available for interlibrary loan. Printing from microfilm for reference use is easy and inexpensive. And digitized primary source materials are becoming more widely available every day.

Good scholarship requires careful reading and critical analysis of information.   Basic evaluation criteria for all sources, adapted from The Information-Literate Historian by Jenny L. Presnell (New York: Oxford University Press, 2007), include the following:   Author Authority Who created the item? What is his or her affiliation?   Audience and Purpose Who is the intended audience? Why was the item created?   Accuracy and Completeness Is the evidence reliable? Are the important points covered?   Footnotes and Documentation Are the author's sources clearly identified with complete citations to allow you to find the original source yourself?   Perspective and Bias How do the author's bias and perspective inform the arguments and evidence presented?   Image: Stewardesses for Women's Rights . Tamiment Library &amp; Robert F.

Primary sources will provide the raw data for your research, but you will also need encyclopedias, dictionaries, subject guides and other reference tools to gather background information and to identify the people, places, dates, organizations, and themes central to your topic. Secondary sources such as books, scholarly journal articles, and newspapers synthesize current research and help put your topic into context. Secondary sources are also important for helping you position your own argument within the scholarly conversation.

All repositories have collections that have not yet been arranged and described. Unprocessed collections will not turn up in searches of these databases and may not appear in a library's own catalog.
