Today's urban planners must balance development, community needs and social justice, provision of critical public services, sustainability and security.   Housed within a school of public service, rather than a school of architecture, the Master of Urban Planning program uses the broader contexts of policy, management and finance to prepare students with the critical thinking they need to succeed in urban design, land use, economic and community development, housing, and environmental and infrastructure planning.   NYU Wagner is at the forefront of the vital issues and debates about the future of cities, and the program presents myriad opportunities to obtain and practice the skills needed to confront these challenges, in New York and beyond.

Today's urban planners must balance development, community needs and social justice, provision of critical public services, sustainability and security.   Housed within a school of public service, rather than a school of architecture, the Master of Urban Planning program uses the broader contexts of policy, management and finance to prepare students with the critical thinking they need to succeed in urban design, land use, economic and community development, housing, and environmental and infrastructure planning.   NYU Wagner is at the forefront of the vital issues and debates about the future of cities, and the program presents myriad opportunities to obtain and practice the skills needed to confront these challenges, in New York and beyond.
