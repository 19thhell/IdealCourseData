With a focus on the history of the European environmental problems from the ancient Greeks, Middle Ages, to colonial and Modern experiences, we will survey different ways of knowing nature.

Environmental Studies Students learn about modern environmental science in the context of contemporary global issues, exploring the impact that the decisions of nations and individuals have on local and world ecologies. The course emphasizes the science involved in environmental decisions while also examining the role of ethics, politics, and economics in environmental decisions at both personal and governmental levels. Students examine such topics as ecology and biodiversity, including the nature and effects of succession, evolution, and invasion species; the atmosphere, including air pollution, ozone depletion, and climate change; sources, use, and misuse of water resources; human population and feeding the world\u2019s people, including developments in agriculture and genetic modifications of organisms; and the nature of Earth\u2019s energy resources and their use by humankind. History of the Universe History of the Universe examines the nature of science as a way of looking at the world and   study that world as revealed through the work of scientists over the   years. They learn about the nature of matter and energy and how the   universe has evolved. Topics include the origin and development of the   stars, galaxies, planetary systems, and the universe itself, as well as   study of the Earth and the development of life on Earth and its   potential to exist elsewhere in the universe. The course begins with the   development of scientific thought at multiple locations around the   pre-modern world by reference to Babylonian and Chinese astronomy,   Indian numerical systems, and the work of such scientists as Aristotle,   Ptolemy, Al-Sufi, Copernicus, Kepler, and Galileo. It continues with   discoveries by the likes of Newton, Darwin, Curie, Einstein, and Hubble   during the period of Western scientific hegemony and ends with the   multinational world of present-day science. Students acquire an   understanding not only of modern science but also of its development and   of the methods, strengths, and limitations of the scientific method. Life Science Life Science examines fundamental principles and processes of biological science. The theme of evolution is woven throughout the course. Topics include genetics, cancer, cell biology, biochemistry, biotechnology, and bioethics, with special emphasis on the human species. Many of the topics are discussed within a social and historical context, demonstrating the global nature of scientific problems and scientific process. Selected readings from science journals, newspaper articles, and recent books expose students to the relevance and application of scientific work to their everyday lives, focusing particularly on genetic disease, the function and treatment of HIV infection, and other current important frontiers and ethical issues in the discipline. The course also acquaints students with the historical development of life science by reference to key figures from Galen to Averro\u00ebs to Mendel and Darwin. Science of Technology Science of Technology follows   the intertwined histories of science, technology, and society, focusing   mainly on the technology of communication from the earliest means of   communicating across space and time to present forms of communication.   Students investigate the science behind the technology by engaging in   inquiry-based group activities and group projects that illustrate the   scientific method and the role of experimentation in producing   scientific results. The course also looks at the impact technology has   had on societies, and the way the structure and values of different   societies have conditioned how technologies are actually used. Student   research projects investigate the basic science, history, and impact of   technologies in other fields such as energy, medicine, or   transportation.
