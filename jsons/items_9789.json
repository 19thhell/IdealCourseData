Lectures  These are short descriptions of the content of each lecture, after the fact.  January 29: A discussion of textbooks on finite elements; Braess' book, in particular its chapter 2 provides a good beginning. Poisson's equation in operator form and formulated as a variational problem in the Sobolev space H^1. Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions; they enter the problem in different ways. Ellipticity and boundedness in H^1 of the bilinear form that arises from using Green's formula. A few words on the triangulation of two- and three-dimensional domains. Eigenvalues of the Laplace operator with Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions. Poincare's inequality. Barycentric coordinates, which provide very convenient tools when describing and working with many finite element spaces. Lagrangian and Hermit elements which are conforming in H^1. A proof that H^1 conforming elements must be continuous across the interface between elements. The biharmonic equation providing a  reason to consider C^1 elements. Two examples of H^2 conforming elements, one with piece-wise P^5 functions and the other using P^3 macro elements where each element is partitioned into 3. A proof that these elements are C^1 but that their basis functions cannot be written in terms of the barycentric coordinates.   February 5: Some finite elements on quadrilaterals and hexagons. Q_k spaces. Bounds for the error in the Sobolev norm appropriate for the elliptic problem: Cea's lemma, which enables us to prove error bounds by studying the interpolation problem on individual elements. An example of an element in H^1 which is not bounded and for which the standard interpolant is not defined. Sobolev spaces including those with fractional indices. Sobolev's inequality providing bounds for the maximum of functions and derivatives of functions in terms of norms based on L_2. Rellish theorem and how to derive generalizations of Poincare's inequality.  An illustration that Neumann conditions do not necessarily survive when we take a limit of a sequence of H^1 functions.  February 12: Error bounds based on Cea's lemma and generalized Poincare inequalities: first work on an element of diameter 1 and then transform it by a trivial transformation. Aubin-Nitsche's bound for the L_2 norm of the error. That result is not valid for all elliptic problems since for second order problems a general H^2 regularity result is required. Such a result is available if the boundary of the domain is smooth or convex. An example of a problem for which H^2 regularity does not hold. A few words on how the stiffness and mass matrices of a finite element problem is computed and a few words on the condition number of stiffness matrices.  February 19: How to get bounds for the condition number of stiffness matrices by using Gerschgorin's theorem, Rayleigh quotients and an upper and lower bounds for the eigenvalues of the mass matrix. Maximum principle; very rarely available. The clamped plate problems and the Dirichlet problem for the biharmonic. Conforming approximations requires complicated higher order elements. The Morley element which is not even conforming in H^1. The Fraeijs de Veubeke triangle and Wilson's brick; the latter two examples of finite elements defined not just by nodal values. Strang's first and second lemmas. Analysis of the discontinuous P_1 element of Crouzeiz-Raviart.  February 26: A second application of the Strang lemmas for problems defined on domains which do not allow an exact triangulation using triangles with straight edges; this is a result for piece-wise linear elements. A few words on how to generalize this result to higher order Lagrange finite elements; the points on the curved side of the triangles next to the boundary should be selected as Gauss-Lobatto-Legendre nodes in the arc-length. The basic  trace theorem for Lipschitz domains. The equations of linear elasticity for compressible and almost incompressible material. The need for alternative methods in the almost incompressible case; an additional variable, the pressure, is introduced and a saddle point problem arises quite similar to that of incompressible Stokes. An exercise in block-Gaussian elimination to discover necessary conditions for the pair of finite element spaces now required.  March 5: Isoparametric elements, in particular using P_2 Lagrangian elements to define the mapping from the reference element to elements with one curved edge. Solving linear systems arising from mixed finite element formulations of almost incompressible elasticity. The central role of a parameter beta which appears in the denominators of expression in the right hand sides. Later it will be revealed that this is the inf-sup parameter of mixed finite element theory. A second example leading to mixed finite element problems arise in studies of flow in porous media. The H(div) space and the lowest order Raviart-Thomas elements, which are conforming in H(div). General saddle point problems arising in mixed finite elements and how to eliminate one of two right hand sides. In the continuous case this leads to a study of Necas equation.  March 12: The hand-out of two weeks ago revisited; the parameter beta is actually the inf-sup parameter prominent in the theory of mixed finite element methods. Fortin's criterion which gives a necessary and sufficient condition for inf-sup stability of a mixed finite element pair of spaces. An unstable pair for incompressible Stokes and how it can be fixed resulting in an awkward finite element pair. Taylor-Hood families with continuous pressure spaces. The modification of P_2-continuous P_1 by partitioning the triangular elements of the velocity space into four subtriangles. The MINI element in which the velocity space is enriched by bubble functions. A return to the discussion of mixed methods for scalar elliptic problem; there are two variants. The second if formulated in H(div) and ellipticity of the leading term can only be established in the subspace of divergence-free functions.  March 26: Error bounds for mixed finite element methods: Counter parts of Cea's lemma and the use of a Strang lemma is also required in some cases. H(div)-conforming spaces due to Raviart and Thomas and H(curl)-conforming spaces of Nedelec. what is relevant in these cases is continuity of the normal component and the tangential components, respectively. A discussion of how to establish inf-sup stability for pairs of finite element spaces; in some cases as for flow in porous media it can be straightforward while for incompressible Stokes equations, it is much harder. A few words on the Stokes case; to be continued.  April 2: Proving inf-sup stability for Stokes equations following Rolf Stenberg. Local problems on macro-elements can be shown to be inf-sup stable and global bounds can then be derived from the local bounds. A short introduction to solvers for large linear algebraic systems of equations arising in finite element work. For sparse Cholesky upper and lower bound on the complexity of these problems are known: work grows in proportion to N^{3/2} for problems in 2D and in proportion to N^2 for 3D. Here N is the number of unknowns.  April 9:"}]},

Cea's lemma and the issues that arise in its application.

An example of a problem which does not give the full regularity required in the Aubin-Nitsche context. The definition of W^k_p spaces  for positive k, not necessarily integer; k=1/2 needed when discussing the traces of elements in H^{1/2}. The need of more than minimal regularity in defining the standard, local finite element interpolants.  February 7. Class canceled; the instructor in San Diego attending a domain decomposition conference. A make-up class is scheduled for May 16.  February 14. The structure of the finite element problems and  and the standard nodal bases an how this is all reflected in the sparsity and other properties of the stiffness and mass matrices.

February 28. A generalized Poincare inequality expressed by using the H^k-norm of a quotient space. How different terms of a full H^k-norm scale under a dilation. Using a Sobolev inequality to estimate the norm of finite element interpolants by higher order H^k norms. Bramble-Hilbert estimates which combined with Cea's or Aubin-Nitsche's result give the basic error bound for conforming finite elements. The need to consider non-conforming finite element spaces and the need to modify the bilinear forms and the functionals in the right hand side, e.g., when numerical quadrature must be used.

Lipschitz domains and trace spaces and estimates for H^1. A problem on domains which are not the union of triangles: an application of a Strang lemma. Isoparametric elements; a main issue is if the Jacobian of the mapping vanishes. Two cases considered namely that of general quadrilaterals, using Q_1 functions to build the mapping and the finite element functions on the reference square and the case of using P_2 for  triangles with one side a parabola. Model problems for mixed finite element methods: flow in porous media, incompressible Stokes, and almost incompressible elasticity; to be continued.  March 14. NYU Spring break.  March 21.

Bounds for the energy of the different components of the mixed system in terms of dual norms of the right hand sides. The inf-sup condition and how the inf-sup parameter affects these bounds. The solution of a related continuous problem div u = p, with and without Dirichlet boundary conditions for the vector valued solution u. How to derive error bounds for the mixed system using the bounds obtained by linear algebra tools; a small inf-sup parameter will lead to loss of accuracy. Another look at the second model problem for flow in porous media; in one case we need to consider problems posed in H(div), a space intermediate between H^1 and L_2.  March 28.

Examples of a unstable pair of finite element spaces for incompressible Stokes and several fixes including the use of the mini element. Using Crouzeix-Raviart elements to solve the incompressible Stokes problem and a basis for this space for the two-dimensional case.  April 4. inf-sup theory for the incompressible Stokes problem following Stenberg, International Journal for Numerical Methods in Fluids, vol. 11, 1990, pp. 935-948. An introduction to domain decomposition algorithms based on slides developed for a tutorial   at the 20th international conference on domain decomposition methods held in February 2011. There is also a  four page introduction to this tutorial. This lecture covered the first 22 of the 98 slides.  April 11. Continuation of the discussion of domain decomposition algorithms using the slides of the tutorial starting with a short review of what was done last week and then covering slides 23 to 50.  April 18. Continuation of the discussion of domain decomposition algorithms using the slide set, essentially, slides 51-69 this week.  April 25. Continuation of the discussion of domain decomposition algorithms using the slide set, essentially, slide 70 to the last one.

More about FETI-DP and BDDC; the connection to analysis of other domain decomposition algorithms. An introduction to multi-grid methods. The hierarchical basis method of Yserentant.  May 9. More on Yserentant's algorithm. Zhang's proof of the optimality of the multigrid V-cycle and related methods. A posteriori error estimates, in particular, those based on residuals.  May 16. Make-up class. H(div) problems. Raviart-Thomas element spaces for arbitrary values of k. Continuity of the normal component guarantees that these finite element are in H(div). H(curl) problems and Nedelec elements in 2D; they can be obtained by a rotation from the Raviart-Thomas elements. H(curl) and Nedelec elements in 3D. The most important degrees of freedom are then associated with edges of the elements. The Nedelec elements are H(curl)-conforming since they have continuous tangential components.
