College students experience stress related to changes in lifestyle, increased workload, new responsibilities, and interpersonal relationships. 1 Extreme levels of stress can hinder work effectiveness and lead to poor academic performance and attrition. 2 College students who experienced stressful life events also reported worse health outcomes and reduced quality of life. 3 Introducing successful coping strategies may help students avoid the destructive consequences of excessive stress.              Key Facts     College students now report being more stressed-out than ever before. 4   Stress is the number one reported impediment to academic performance.6   55% of students, nationally, claimed their biggest stressor to be academic in nature. 7   6 in 10 college students report having felt so stressed they couldn\u2019t get their work done on one or more occasions. 8   Nationally, 53% of students report having felt so stressed they didn\u2019t want to hang out with friends on one or more occasions. 8   Many of the emotional and physical symptoms that occur commonly in the college population, such as headaches, fatigue, depression, anxiety, and the inability to cope, can be attributed to or exacerbated by stress. 9   Negative physical effects of stress include immune system suppression, which can increase susceptibility to physical illness and psychological conditions such as anxiety and depression. 10   Students who engaged in meditation practices demonstrated significantly greater reductions in perceived stress than students who did not. 11                                     Recommendations     Improve the coordination and promotion of stress management resources.  Nearly 2/3 of NYU students have expressed interest in receiving information about stress reduction - more than any other topic area. 5 Although numerous opportunities already exist for students to reduce or manage stress within the University and the surrounding community, many students are not aware and subsequently do not use available resources. Promoting the portfolio of stress reduction opportunities through an organized and interconnected approach will increase the visibility and accessibility to students.       Promote an institutional culture that recognizes stress as a source of academic and social impairment.  The university environment has been defined as \u201ca system of pressures, practices, and policies intended to influence the development of students toward the attainment of important goals of higher education.\u201d 9 Thus, a university\u2019s institutional culture has the power to guide the attitudes and priorities of its community members. Research indicates that students who suffer from severe stress may become depressed, 12 be hindered academically, 13 and experience adverse physical health. 14 Because the culture of academia can foster a system of high pressure and stress, it is imperative that faculty and staff support an environment which recognizes and mitigates the negative effects of stress in order to reinforce a healthy university culture.       Enhance university-wide infrastructure and availability of physical spaces to support and promote stress reduction.   The importance of establishing peaceful, relaxing spaces where students can unwind or engage in stress relieving practices such as meditation has been documented. 15 Specific factors of the physical environment can play a role in decreasing stress; for example, the configuration of a room, the color of its walls, and the amount of light it receives can either contribute to or minimize stress. 16, 17 Providing areas for relaxation and optimizing features of physical spaces effectively support stress reduction.       Expand and diversify evidence-based therapeutic interventions for prevention and management of stress-related consequences.  Evidence suggests that coping strategies differ across diverse identity groups;18 accordingly, offering multiple types of interventions for stress is necessary to maximize student engagement. While continuing to use effective stress reduction methods such as meditation,12 writing exercises,19 biofeedback,20 and mindfulness,21 NYU will look to expand options for students. Employing a variety of evidence-based methods ensures that each student can find a stress management or prevention approach that appeals to individual coping styles.       Increase opportunities for academic, social, and financial support.  Concerns regarding classes, relationships, and money are among the top stressors experienced by college students, 22 providing the University with an opportunity to address some of the leading impediments to student success. Research demonstrates that both tutorial 23 and social support 24 can act as a buffer for the consequences that stress has on students. Offering resources to assist students with budgeting, managing debt responsibly, and handling the financial aid system can minimize the financial stressors they experience. NYU has consistently demonstrated commitment to supplying students with strong support resources, such as the Academic Resource Center, and will continue to innovate and build on these accomplishments.       Reduce obstacles to the successful navigation of University systems.  Navigating a large university system can prove to be intimidating or even stressful to students. In order to improve service quality and lessen the barriers that may complicate students\u2019 ability to receive necessary University support, an interdisciplinary taskforce was established in 2009 to address potential obstacles. Additionally, NYU plays a valuable role in empowering students with the tools to manage the university system effectively, helping them to build skills essential to becoming independent adults, such as self sufficiency and autonomy.

College students experience stress related to changes in lifestyle, increased workload, new responsibilities, and interpersonal relationships. 1 Extreme levels of stress can hinder work effectiveness and lead to poor academic performance and attrition. 2 College students who experienced stressful life events also reported worse health outcomes and reduced quality of life. 3 Introducing successful coping strategies may help students avoid the destructive consequences of excessive stress.              Key Facts     College students now report being more stressed-out than ever before. 4   Stress is the number one reported impediment to academic performance.6   55% of students, nationally, claimed their biggest stressor to be academic in nature. 7   6 in 10 college students report having felt so stressed they couldn\u2019t get their work done on one or more occasions. 8   Nationally, 53% of students report having felt so stressed they didn\u2019t want to hang out with friends on one or more occasions. 8   Many of the emotional and physical symptoms that occur commonly in the college population, such as headaches, fatigue, depression, anxiety, and the inability to cope, can be attributed to or exacerbated by stress. 9   Negative physical effects of stress include immune system suppression, which can increase susceptibility to physical illness and psychological conditions such as anxiety and depression. 10   Students who engaged in meditation practices demonstrated significantly greater reductions in perceived stress than students who did not. 11                                     Recommendations     Improve the coordination and promotion of stress management resources.  Nearly 2/3 of NYU students have expressed interest in receiving information about stress reduction - more than any other topic area. 5 Although numerous opportunities already exist for students to reduce or manage stress within the University and the surrounding community, many students are not aware and subsequently do not use available resources. Promoting the portfolio of stress reduction opportunities through an organized and interconnected approach will increase the visibility and accessibility to students.       Promote an institutional culture that recognizes stress as a source of academic and social impairment.  The university environment has been defined as \u201ca system of pressures, practices, and policies intended to influence the development of students toward the attainment of important goals of higher education.\u201d 9 Thus, a university\u2019s institutional culture has the power to guide the attitudes and priorities of its community members. Research indicates that students who suffer from severe stress may become depressed, 12 be hindered academically, 13 and experience adverse physical health. 14 Because the culture of academia can foster a system of high pressure and stress, it is imperative that faculty and staff support an environment which recognizes and mitigates the negative effects of stress in order to reinforce a healthy university culture.       Enhance university-wide infrastructure and availability of physical spaces to support and promote stress reduction.   The importance of establishing peaceful, relaxing spaces where students can unwind or engage in stress relieving practices such as meditation has been documented. 15 Specific factors of the physical environment can play a role in decreasing stress; for example, the configuration of a room, the color of its walls, and the amount of light it receives can either contribute to or minimize stress. 16, 17 Providing areas for relaxation and optimizing features of physical spaces effectively support stress reduction.       Expand and diversify evidence-based therapeutic interventions for prevention and management of stress-related consequences.  Evidence suggests that coping strategies differ across diverse identity groups;18 accordingly, offering multiple types of interventions for stress is necessary to maximize student engagement. While continuing to use effective stress reduction methods such as meditation,12 writing exercises,19 biofeedback,20 and mindfulness,21 NYU will look to expand options for students. Employing a variety of evidence-based methods ensures that each student can find a stress management or prevention approach that appeals to individual coping styles.       Increase opportunities for academic, social, and financial support.  Concerns regarding classes, relationships, and money are among the top stressors experienced by college students, 22 providing the University with an opportunity to address some of the leading impediments to student success. Research demonstrates that both tutorial 23 and social support 24 can act as a buffer for the consequences that stress has on students. Offering resources to assist students with budgeting, managing debt responsibly, and handling the financial aid system can minimize the financial stressors they experience. NYU has consistently demonstrated commitment to supplying students with strong support resources, such as the Academic Resource Center, and will continue to innovate and build on these accomplishments.       Reduce obstacles to the successful navigation of University systems.  Navigating a large university system can prove to be intimidating or even stressful to students. In order to improve service quality and lessen the barriers that may complicate students\u2019 ability to receive necessary University support, an interdisciplinary taskforce was established in 2009 to address potential obstacles. Additionally, NYU plays a valuable role in empowering students with the tools to manage the university system effectively, helping them to build skills essential to becoming independent adults, such as self sufficiency and autonomy.

College students experience stress related to changes in lifestyle, increased workload, new responsibilities, and interpersonal relationships. 1 Extreme levels of stress can hinder work effectiveness and lead to poor academic performance and attrition. 2 College students who experienced stressful life events also reported worse health outcomes and reduced quality of life. 3 Introducing successful coping strategies may help students avoid the destructive consequences of excessive stress.              Key Facts     College students now report being more stressed-out than ever before. 4   Stress is the number one reported impediment to academic performance.6   55% of students, nationally, claimed their biggest stressor to be academic in nature. 7   6 in 10 college students report having felt so stressed they couldn\u2019t get their work done on one or more occasions. 8   Nationally, 53% of students report having felt so stressed they didn\u2019t want to hang out with friends on one or more occasions. 8   Many of the emotional and physical symptoms that occur commonly in the college population, such as headaches, fatigue, depression, anxiety, and the inability to cope, can be attributed to or exacerbated by stress. 9   Negative physical effects of stress include immune system suppression, which can increase susceptibility to physical illness and psychological conditions such as anxiety and depression. 10   Students who engaged in meditation practices demonstrated significantly greater reductions in perceived stress than students who did not. 11                                     Recommendations     Improve the coordination and promotion of stress management resources.  Nearly 2/3 of NYU students have expressed interest in receiving information about stress reduction - more than any other topic area. 5 Although numerous opportunities already exist for students to reduce or manage stress within the University and the surrounding community, many students are not aware and subsequently do not use available resources. Promoting the portfolio of stress reduction opportunities through an organized and interconnected approach will increase the visibility and accessibility to students.       Promote an institutional culture that recognizes stress as a source of academic and social impairment.  The university environment has been defined as \u201ca system of pressures, practices, and policies intended to influence the development of students toward the attainment of important goals of higher education.\u201d 9 Thus, a university\u2019s institutional culture has the power to guide the attitudes and priorities of its community members. Research indicates that students who suffer from severe stress may become depressed, 12 be hindered academically, 13 and experience adverse physical health. 14 Because the culture of academia can foster a system of high pressure and stress, it is imperative that faculty and staff support an environment which recognizes and mitigates the negative effects of stress in order to reinforce a healthy university culture.       Enhance university-wide infrastructure and availability of physical spaces to support and promote stress reduction.   The importance of establishing peaceful, relaxing spaces where students can unwind or engage in stress relieving practices such as meditation has been documented. 15 Specific factors of the physical environment can play a role in decreasing stress; for example, the configuration of a room, the color of its walls, and the amount of light it receives can either contribute to or minimize stress. 16, 17 Providing areas for relaxation and optimizing features of physical spaces effectively support stress reduction.       Expand and diversify evidence-based therapeutic interventions for prevention and management of stress-related consequences.  Evidence suggests that coping strategies differ across diverse identity groups;18 accordingly, offering multiple types of interventions for stress is necessary to maximize student engagement. While continuing to use effective stress reduction methods such as meditation,12 writing exercises,19 biofeedback,20 and mindfulness,21 NYU will look to expand options for students. Employing a variety of evidence-based methods ensures that each student can find a stress management or prevention approach that appeals to individual coping styles.       Increase opportunities for academic, social, and financial support.  Concerns regarding classes, relationships, and money are among the top stressors experienced by college students, 22 providing the University with an opportunity to address some of the leading impediments to student success. Research demonstrates that both tutorial 23 and social support 24 can act as a buffer for the consequences that stress has on students. Offering resources to assist students with budgeting, managing debt responsibly, and handling the financial aid system can minimize the financial stressors they experience. NYU has consistently demonstrated commitment to supplying students with strong support resources, such as the Academic Resource Center, and will continue to innovate and build on these accomplishments.       Reduce obstacles to the successful navigation of University systems.  Navigating a large university system can prove to be intimidating or even stressful to students. In order to improve service quality and lessen the barriers that may complicate students\u2019 ability to receive necessary University support, an interdisciplinary taskforce was established in 2009 to address potential obstacles. Additionally, NYU plays a valuable role in empowering students with the tools to manage the university system effectively, helping them to build skills essential to becoming independent adults, such as self sufficiency and autonomy.

Their findings, which appear in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, point to the limits of clinical techniques while also shedding new light on the barriers that must be overcome in addressing afflictions such as fear or anxiety.   \u201cWe have long suspected that stress can impair our ability to control our emotions, but this is the first study to document how even mild stress can undercut therapies designed to keep our emotions in check,\u201d said Elizabeth Phelps, a professor in NYU\u2019s Department of Psychology and Center for Neural Science and the study\u2019s senior author. \u201cIn other words, what you learn in the clinic may not be as relevant in the real world when you\u2019re stressed.\u201d   In addressing patients\u2019 emotional maladies, therapists sometimes use cognitive restructuring techniques\u2014encouraging patients to alter their thoughts or approach to a situation to change their emotional response. These might include focusing on the positive or non-threatening aspects of an event or stimulus that might normally produce fear.   But do these techniques hold up in the real world when accompanied by the stress of everyday life? This is the question the researchers sought to answer.   To do so, they designed a two-day experiment in which the study\u2019s participants employed techniques like those used in clinics as a way to combat their fears.   On the first day, the researchers created a fear among the study\u2019s participants using a commonly employed \u201cfear conditioning\u201d technique. Specifically, the participants viewed pictures of snakes or spiders. Some of the pictures were occasionally accompanied by a mild shock to the wrist, while others were not. Participants developed fear responses to the pictures paired with shock as measured by physiological arousal and self-report.   After the fear conditioning procedure, the participants were taught cognitive strategies\u2014akin to those prescribed by therapists and collectively titled cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)\u2014in order to learn to diminish the fears brought on by the experiment.   On the next day, the participants were put into two groups: \u201cthe stress group\u201d and \u201cthe control group.\u201d In the stress group, participants\u2019 hands were submerged in icy water for three minutes\u2014a standard method for creating a mild stress response in psychological studies. In the control group, subjects\u2019 hands were submerged in mildly warm water. To determine that the participants in the stress group were, in fact, stressed, the researchers gauged each participant\u2019s levels of salivary cortisol, which the human body is known to produce in response to stress. Those in the stress group showed a significant increase in cortisol following the stress manipulation, whereas there was no change in the control group.   After a short delay, the researchers then tested the participants\u2019 fear response to the same pictures of snakes or spiders in order to determine if stress undermined the utilization of the cognitive techniques taught the previous day.   As expected, the control group showed diminished fear response to the images, suggesting they were able to employ the cognitive training from the previous day. However, even though the stress group received identical training, they showed no reduction in fear, indicating they were unable to use these cognitive techniques to reduce fear on the second day.   \u201cThe use of cognitive techniques to control fear has previously been shown to rely on regions of the prefrontal cortex that are known to be functionally impaired by mild stress,\u201d Phelps observed. \u201cThese findings are consistent with the suggestion that the effect of mild stress on the prefrontal cortex may result in a diminished ability to use previously learned techniques to control fear.\u201d   \u201cOur results suggest that even mild stress, such as that encountered in daily life, may impair the ability to use cognitive techniques known to control fear and anxiety,\u201d added Candace Raio, a doctoral student in NYU\u2019s Department of Psychology and the study\u2019s lead author. \u201cHowever, with practice or after longer intervals of cognitive training, these strategies may become more habitual and less sensitive to the effects of stress.\u201d   The study\u2019s other co-authors included: Temidayo Orederu, an undergraduate at Hunter College; Laura Palazzolo, a medical student at SUNY Downstate College of Medicine; and Ashley Shurick, a doctoral student at Stanford University.
