Widlund               Olof B. Widlund     Silver Professor of Mathematics and Computer Science      Throughout his career, Olof Widlund has focused on numerical algorithms for partial differential equations. His primary concern has been new algorithms and mathematical tools for their analysis. For over two  decades, with students and other associates, he has concentrated his efforts on domain decomposition algorithms  for the large linear systems of algebraic equations that arise in many computational continuum mechanics problems, for example in fluid dynamics and elasticity. These algorithms use a preconditioned conjugate gradient approach and they are designed for parallel and distributed computers. A main challenge is to overcome the potential computational bottleneck arising because the solutions of the linear systems depend on the data everywhere in the region. A  research monograph, ``Domain Decomposition Methods - Algorithms  and Theory'',  coauthored with Andrea Toselli,  was published by the Springer Verlag in 2005. In February 2006, it received the Award for Excellence in Professional and Scholarly Publications of the Association of American Publisher,  in the category Mathematics and Statistics. The book contains many results developed by the seventeen doctoral students, who had completed doctoral dissertations at the Courant Institute in this field of research between 1989 and 2004.    These algorithms are increasingly being accepted by the user community and their usefulness on loosely-coupled computer systems and the very largest parallel computers has been demonstrated in a substantial number of experimental studies, some of them using the  PETSc  system developed at the   Mathematics and Computer Science Division  of the Argonne National Laboratory .     In recent years, the Courant Institute research group has focused its work on  FETI-DP and BDDC algorithms for elliptic systems,  including those of saddle point type and on  domain decomposition methods for electro-magnetics. The group has also actively developed new,  hybrid domain decomposition algorithms, which combine features of iterative substructuring methods and  two-level overlapping Schwarz methods; the principal applications so far has been to almost incompressible elasticity. Very recently, work on domain decomposition algorithms for isogeomtric analysis has also begun.    Several of his friends and colleagues organized a meeting    Fast Algorithms for Scientific Computing which was held at the Courant Institute on September 19-20, 2008, to mark his seventieth birthday.   A large number of his former students, and many other friends and coworkers,  participated in a meeting held at the Courant Institute on January 23-24, 1998, on the occasion of his sixtieth birthday.     He is also a regular participant in the  International Conferences on Domain Decomposition in Science and Engineering and has helped edit a number of the proceedings of these conference. The sixteenth, and one of the largest in the series, was held at the Courant Institute on  January 11-15, 2005. On the day just before the twentieth conference in the series, held at UCSD February 7-11, 2011,  he offered a full day tutorial ;  see also a four page introduction to  this set of slides.

Should you take this course?  The course lectures take place only once a week, and this means they will move fast. The lectures will be quite mathematical at times, but we will also use the computer a lot in class to illustrate the concepts. The course is mostly about numerical linear algebra, a surprisingly rich subject that lies at the heart of modern scientific computing, but we will also cover other  classical subjects of numerical analysis such as interpolation and quadrature.  (ODE's and PDE's are covered in Numerical Methods II.) Hopefully, if you like math and computers, you will like this class. On the other hand, if your math background is weak, or you have no experience with computing, you are likely to find it very difficult. Don't hesitate to discuss these issues with me, after class or in my office.    Prerequisites  A solid knowledge of undergraduate linear algebra, and experience with  writing computer programs (in C or other language). Prior knowledge of Matlab is not required, but you will be expected to learn it as the course progresses.    Requirements  Regular homework assignments, including programming assignments, primarily using Matlab, but also occasionally C  (alternatively, Fortran or Java).  It is important that you do the homework yourself, but when you get stuck, I encourage you to consult with other students, or the math computer  consultant, or me, to get help when necessary. However, when you get help, it's important to acknowledge it in writing. Passing off other people's  work as your own is called plagiarism and is not acceptable.    Homework   Homework may be given to me in class or in my office, or left under my office door.  Please do not leave homework in my lobby mailbox or send it by email.  Please staple all pages together. Late homework will be penalized 20%.  Homework will not be accepted more than one week late, except in special circumstances.

The emphasis will be on what you did for the homework. You pick one of the following topics and I pick one, and we will talk about what you learned about it. You do not have to memorize complicated details, but you should be able to explain the main ideas that we talked about in class and that you explored in the homework.    SVD, QR factorization and Least Squares (Text Lectures 4-11, not 18-19)  Conditioning and Stability (Text Lectures 12-17, not 18-19, plus my book  Chapters 12-13)  Systems of Equations (Text Lectures 20-23)  Eigenvalues (Text Lectures 24-29, not 30-31), but generalized to the  general nonsymmetric case, as covered in class  Iterative Methods (Text Lectures 32-38, not 39-40)     Official Syllabus     Official Syllabus for Numerical Methods I (this course)   Official Syllabus for Numerical Methods II (spring semester)       Books      Numerical Linear Algebra, by Trefethen and Bau (primary text)  A wonderful text at just the right level; we will follow it quite closely.  Typos in the Text    Numerical Computing with IEEE Floating Point Arithmetic, by the instructor   (supplementary text)  Brief, easy to read and only $20, but covers a lot of important basic matters; we will cover some parts in class, but you will be expected to read the rest on your own.   Applied Numerical Linear Algebra, by Demmel (not required, but may be helpful)  More detailed coverage of various topics, especially computational issues such as the BLAS, and algorithms for the nonsymmeric eigenvalue problem.     Software      MATLAB  We will use Matlab for most of the computing that we do in this course. Matlab is by far the best environment for small-scale numerical computing. Although by itself it is not the most efficient choice for large-scale computing, it can be used to call compiled C and Fortran routines and experiment with the results. Matlab is a product of  The MathWorks . You can order your own copy of   Matlab for $99  or you can use Matlab on the Courant Sparcstation network (or dial in from home). For Matlab documentation, type \"helpdesk\" at the Matlab prompt. To get started, try out  A Free Matlab Online Tutorial or   Another Tuturial  or look for others by a web search. You may want to look at a very outdated but still useful   Introductory Matlab Primer (3rd and last edition, postscript file) . There are many books on Matlab; I recommend  Matlab Guide, by  Higham and Higham , but you will find many other resources on the web, including the latest information on Matlab 7.0.    C  The lingua franca of computing. You will learn how to call the BLAS from C and how to call  C routines from Matlab using the MEX interface.  Even if you are not a C programmer,  this is a good time to learn a little C.   More information .     Fortran  Fortran is traditionally the language of numerical computing and is no longer the dinosaur it used to be. It's still widely used in scientific applications. Fortran 90, 95 and 2003  support vector operations and dynamic allocation and look a lot like Matlab. But the updated versions of Fortran 77 are fine for most purposes, especially when using the BLAS. Fortran routines can be called from Matlab using the MEX interface. More information .  You don't need to use Fortran in this course, but it's an alternative to using C.    Java  Java is becoming a popular choice for numerical computing, but the strict language requirements make it difficult to get good performance. Java methods can be called directly from Matlab, without the complications of the MEX interface.  More information .  You don't need to use Java in this course, but it's an alternative to using C.     Math Computer Consultant  There is a volunteer    Math Computer Consultant (email: mconsult@cims.nyu.edu).  Please contact the consultant if you have trouble with the Courant computer facilities or questions about the software we are using. The consultant is there to help, but cannot debug programs for you.    Class Mailing List  Important: you must join the    class mailing list . There are two steps to joining the list; the first is to follow the instructions on the web page (including picking  a password), and the second is to REPLY TO the confirmation message sent to you by the system. This list will be used for important announcements. You can also send questions or comments to this list yourself (contact me if you have questions about when this is appropriate). If you do not want to use an NYU email address, be sure to notify me in person or by email from an NYU address about your preferred address, so I can add it to my spam filter.     Sun Account  If you don't have a Sun workstation account, please request one, even if you plan to do most of the homework on your home computer. You will need it later. Request this account from petagna@cs if you are registered in G22.2420  and from the math department if you are registered in G63.G22.2420.     SIAM  As an NYU graduate student you have the opportunity to join   SIAM for free. SIAM is the main professional organization for applied and computational math, and offers a number of  benefits to members. I've been a member since I was a graduate student, and have benefitted in many ways from my association with SIAM.     Don't Hesitate to Ask for Help  If you have questions, send me email, give me a call, or drop by my office. Don't wait until it's too late!"}]}]
