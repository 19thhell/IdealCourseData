The major goals of this specialization are to enable students to:   Evaluate and use knowledge and understanding of values and institutional contexts for environmental and infrastructure planning.   Explore theories and historical trends to evaluate relationships between environmental condition, public service capacity, and development options, and their consequences of human actions on the environment.   Understand choices about and ways of balancing the use and protection of environmental resources in urban and natural environmental contexts and in the context of other social needs.   Engage public interests in the process of environmental, infrastructure and transportation planning.

Today's urban planners must balance development, community needs and social justice, provision of critical public services, sustainability and security.   Housed within a school of public service, rather than a school of architecture, the Master of Urban Planning program uses the broader contexts of policy, management and finance to prepare students with the critical thinking they need to succeed in urban design, land use, economic and community development, housing, and environmental and infrastructure planning.   NYU Wagner is at the forefront of the vital issues and debates about the future of cities, and the program presents myriad opportunities to obtain and practice the skills needed to confront these challenges, in New York and beyond.
