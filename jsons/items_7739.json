Organ donation is all about LIFE. When   you donate your organs you give someone the most precious gift--a chance   to live. Transplants provide hope for thousands of people with organ   failure. Your commitment to organ and tissue donation can save lives. The   most important part of deciding to be a donor is telling your family .   And that doesn't mean talking about death. It is talking about the   opportunity to give another person a second chance at life.     In most states, your family will be   consulted about your wish to donate at the time of death. Even with a   signed donor card, indication of your wishes on your driver's license,   or listing with a donor registry, it may be your family/next of kin who   gives final consent. Talk to your family about organ donation. Talk to   your family about donating LIFE.                                                               statistics                                    Each     day, an average of 18 people waiting for organs die in the     United States because no organs could be found for them.              About 6,200 people died in the United      States in 2004, waiting for organ transplants.              In the United States , every 12 minutes,      a new name is added to the national waiting list for organs.              One donor can save up to eight lives through organ donation.      One donor can save or improve up to 50 lives through corneal,      bone, skin and other tissue transplants.              Nearly 90,000 men, women and children are waiting for organs      for transplantation in the United States :                                                                                                        Kidney                                              61,544                                                                                                               Liver                                              17,319                                                                                                               Pancreas                                              1,688                                                                                                               Kidney-Pancreas                                              2,469                                                                                                               Heart                                              3,223                                                                                                               Lung                                              3,705                                                                                                               Heart/Lung                        168                                   Intestine                                              198                                   Total                          87,783                                                                                                              Source: United Network for Organ       Sharing (UNOS)/Organ Procurement and Transplantation       Network (OPTN), as of April 15, 2005                                                In 2004,      there were 7,150 deceased organ donors and 6,990 living      organ donors resulting in 27,028 organ transplants.              Nearly 47,000      cornea transplants were performed in 2004.

Someone may be able to donate his/her heart, kidneys,      liver, lungs, pancreas, and intestines, depending on their      age, medical condition and circumstances at the time of      death. Each organ is evaluated for possible donation      individually. Many patients who are organ donors may      also be candidates for tissue donation following the organ      recovery.        Which tissues can be donated?       Many classifications of tissue may be donated once the      legal next of kin grants permission (consent) for donation:             - Whole eyes or corneas may be donated to provide the gift      of sight.       - Hearts may be donated for human heart valves       - Cardiovascular tissue, which includes the thoracic aorta,      the abdominal aorta with iliac arteries, saphenous veins, and      femoral vessels, may be donated to restore compromised blood      circulation.       - Bone and soft musculoskeletal tissue, such as ligaments,      may be donated for orthoedic and spinal surgeries and sports      medicine injuries.       - Skin may be donated to promote healing and prevent      infection in critically burned individuals.

When vital organs, such as      the liver, kidneys, lungs,  pancreas,      or heart are severely damaged, they may need to be replaced      for a person to  survive.      Replacing some damaged tissues may allow a person to return to      a normal life a  cornea      to renew sight or a bone or tendon to restore the ability to      walk or move without  pain.      Organs can be donated by two types of donors: deceased and      living, with the  exception      of bone marrow which can only be donated by living donors.      Tissues can only  be      donated by deceased donors. The transplant process described      in this section deals  mainly      with organs donated by deceased donors. Bone marrow       transplantation      will not be covered extensively in these educational materials      (for additional  information      about bone marrow transplantation see: www.hhs.gov/diseases ).        Referral      and Evaluation        Once      a doctor determines the need for an organ transplant, the      individual is referred to a  transplant      centera hospital that performs transplantsfor      evaluation. If certain criteria  are      met, the individual is accepted into the transplant program at      that center. The  individuals      blood and tissue types are determined and he or she is placed      on a national  transplant      waiting list.        Waiting        The      period of time a patient may be on a waiting list before      receiving a transplant depends  on      a number of factors: How sick is the person? What is the      persons blood type? Is a  suitably      matched organ available? Unfortunately, because of the      shortage of donated  organs,      many people die before a compatible organ becomes available.      If an organ does  become      available for a particular patient on the waiting list, the      patients doctor is notified.  If      the doctor concludes that the donated organ is compatible, and      that the patient is in  suitable      condition to undergo the transplant operation, preparations      for surgery begin.        The      Transplant        The      donated organ is often surgically removed from the deceased      donor at the same time  as      the recipient is prepared for surgery to reduce the time that      the donated organ has to  survive      outside the body. Since the recipient is often at a different      hospital than the donor,  a      member of the recipients transplant team may have to travel      to the donors location to  remove      and transport the donated organ.        Recovery        After      surgery, the recipient undergoes a period of      recoverysometimes only a few  weeks.      However, if the recipients immune system rejects the      donated organ, the recovery  period      could be much longer. To combat rejection, doctors administer      immunosuppressive  drugs.        A      Better Life        If      the transplant is successful, the recipient may return to a      normal and active life, but must  have      regular check-ups and continue to take medicine for the rest      of his or her life. While  transplantation      is not a cure, when successful it provides an increase      in the quantity  and/or      quality of life.                                                                                                                         the donor                                    Becoming      a Donor        Many      people express a wish to be a donor when they die and take      steps during their  lifetime      to designate themselves as a donor. A person may use one of a      variety of methods  to      express an intention to be an organ and tissue donor: signing      a donor card, indicating  intent      to donate when applying for or renewing a drivers license,      or joining a donor  registry.       Minors      generally may indicate an intention to be a donor. While State      laws on requirements  for      minors vary, those States that allow a minor (often minors      over the age of 16) to  consent      to donation generally require the signature of a parent or      legal guardian.        Trauma      and Death        Most      organ donors are accident victims who have suffered severe and      eventually fatal  injuriesoften      a severe head injury. After arriving at the scene of such an      accident, emergency  medical      personnel immediately begin life-saving procedures while the      patient is  transported      to a hospital.        In      the Emergency Room        When      the ambulance arrives at the hospital, the patient is met by      doctors and nurses ready  to      employ all possible measures to save the victims life.        The      Intensive Care Unit        If      the injuries are severe, the patient is usually on a      life-support system. Doctors perform  tests      to determine the extent to which the brain and other organs      and tissues have been  damaged      as a result of the injury. If tests show the brain is no      longer alive, the patients  family      is informed that the patient is brain deadthat is, the      brain has ceased to function,  and      the patient is dead. Note: A coma, with its limited brain      function still in tact, is not the same as brain death.        The      Organ Procurement Organization        The      organizations responsible for coordinating organ donation and      transplantation are the  organ      procurement organizations (OPOs). Each of the 59 OPOs across      the country is a  Federally      designated nonprofit organization that works with the      hospitals in their designated  geographic      area to identify potential donors. These service areas may      cover a single State  or      parts of adjoining States. In addition to identifying donors      and obtaining consent where  necessary,      the OPOs are responsible for the evaluation, preservation,      allocation, recovery,  and      transport of donated organs. The crucial role of the OPO in      the organ donation and  transplantation      process is described below.        Hospital      Referral and Evaluation by the OPO        Federal      law requires that hospitals report all deaths and imminent      deaths (a per son      who is near death) to the local organ procurement      organization. Notification by the hospital allows an OPO      coordinator to go to the hospital. The brain dead person      is kept oxygenated by a mechanical support system until it is      determined whether the deceased will be a donor. If it is      determined that the deceased is  not      going to be a donor, the mechanical support system is      discontinued. If the deceased is  able      to be a donor, the OPO coordinator arranges for the      evaluation, surgical removal,  and      the preservation of donated organs and transport of each organ      to the transplant  center      where the recipient is waiting. Mechanical support of the      donors organ is maintained  until      the organs are surgically removed.        Consent      for Donation        Some States have passed laws providing that when a person      signs a donor card, indicates  an      intention to be a donor on a drivers license, or joins a      donor registry, this is a legal  form      of consent and must be honored. Family consent is not      necessary for that deceased  persons      organs and tissues to be donated. These laws are often      popularly referred to as  first      person consent and are based on the belief that the      donors wishes should be  paramount      and should not be overridden by family members. If the      deceased person had  not      designated him or herself as a donor, the family is asked to      make the decision whether  to      donate. (Generally, even if a deceased minor had indicated an      intention to be a donor,  the      family is asked to consent to the donation.) In States with      first person consent, OPO  representatives      take care to talk to the family before the removal of organs      to make sure  the      family understands and appreciates their loved ones      decision to save the lives of other  people      through organ donation.        In other States, even if a deceased person had signed a donor      card, indicated an intention  to      be a donor on a drivers license, or joined a donor      registry, the deceaseds family will  still      be asked for their consent before organs and tissues are      donated. A specially trained  OPO      representative offers the family the option of donating the      deceaseds organs and  explains      the donation procedures. The family is given time to consider      and discuss their  decision.      If the deceased had indicated a wish to be a donor, it is      often much easier for the  family      members to make a decision to donate their loved ones      organs. The decision  becomes      even easier if the deceased had discussed donation with family      members.        No matter what State you live in, it is important to indicate      your intention to be a donor  through      the various methods available and just as important to      convey those wishes  to      your family to increase the likelihood that your organs or      tissues will be donated or not  according      to your wishes. A familys decision to donate or their      acceptance of a loved  ones      decision to donate is made much easier if the deceased had      told them of his or her  desire      to be a donor.        Organ      Placement        Immediately      following the identification of the deceased as a donor, the      process of organ  placement      begins. Information about the donor, such as body size, blood      type, and  geographic      location of the donor, is entered into the computer system of      a national network  the      Organ Procurement and Transplant Network (OPTN). This computer      system  identifies      potential recipients on the national waiting list who best      match the available  organs.      Based on medical and scientific criteria, a list of potential      recipients is generated  for      each of the donors organs. One donor may be able to supply      organs and tissues for  many      recipients.        Organ      Recovery and Transportation        A      specific recipient for each organ to be donated is identified.      In some cases a surgeon  from      each recipients transplant team comes to the hospital to      surgically remove the organ  to      be donated to that recipient. In other cases surgeons at the      donors hospital remove  the      organs. In either case, organs are quickly preserved and      transported to the transplant  centers      where the recipients are waiting. Tissues are often removed      from the body a short  time      later, but both organ and tissue procedures are conducted      rapidly so as to reduce  the      chance of organ or tissue deterioration.        Funeral      Arrangements        The      usually quick removal of organs or tissues minimizes any delay      in funeral arrangements.  Organ      and tissue removal also is done in such a way that an      open-casket funeral is  still      possible.        Follow-Up        OPOs      ensure that the names of donors and recipients remain      confidential, but most donor  families      appreciate knowing that a gift of life came from their      tragedy. After a few weeks,  the      OPO sends the donors family a letter informing them how      their loved ones organs  and      tissues were used. While the names of the recipients remain      confidential, donor  families      can request updates about recipients by contacting their OPO.      Often recipients  ask      OPOs to pass letters on to a donors family expressing their      gratitude. This can be a  great      comfort to donor families. Recipients may eventually meet      donor families if both  parties      agree to this meeting.

Unusable organs A. Some \"organs\" have no apparent nor predictable function (based on the behavior of the species (or sex) in which they are found, or the anatomy of the particular feature): e.g., male mammae, rudiments of pelvis and hind limbs in snakes, wings on many flightless birds. B. Organs that serve dual purposes (such as flowers: production of gametes and attraction of pollinators) may be functional in one part and rudimentary in the other. C. Rudimentary organs can often be detected in the embryo, but are lost later during development (e.g., teeth in the upper jaws of embryos of whales and ruminants). II. How do the other hypotheses \"explain\" rudimentary organs? (That they are there \"for the sake of symmetry\" or to \"complete the scheme of nature\" are not explanatory statements.) III. How does descent explain their existence? A. Each feature in an organism tends to be inherited, even if they are not used by descendents. B. Explains why such features are of great importance in classification (which thereby reflect inheritance) C. Although Darwin suggests \"Disuse\" as the main mechanism of the degradation of rudimentary organs, he also invokes Natural Selection as a possible mechanism: An organ that is useful under some circumstances may be injurious under others (e.g., insects with wings on small exposed islands often have fused elytra).

Exercises    Even if a \"rudimentary organ\" actually has a function about which we observers are unaware (e.g., if vestigial pelvic bones of a whale may function to support gonads), why would it still provide excellent evidence in support of evolution by descent?

Organ donation is all about LIFE. When   you donate your organs you give someone the most precious gift--a chance   to live. Transplants provide hope for thousands of people with organ   failure. Your commitment to organ and tissue donation can save lives. The   most important part of deciding to be a donor is telling your family .   And that doesn't mean talking about death. It is talking about the   opportunity to give another person a second chance at life.     In most states, your family will be   consulted about your wish to donate at the time of death. Even with a   signed donor card, indication of your wishes on your driver's license,   or listing with a donor registry, it may be your family/next of kin who   gives final consent. Talk to your family about organ donation. Talk to   your family about donating LIFE.                                                               statistics                                    Each     day, an average of 18 people waiting for organs die in the     United States because no organs could be found for them.              About 6,200 people died in the United      States in 2004, waiting for organ transplants.              In the United States , every 12 minutes,      a new name is added to the national waiting list for organs.              One donor can save up to eight lives through organ donation.      One donor can save or improve up to 50 lives through corneal,      bone, skin and other tissue transplants.

Nearly 47,000      cornea transplants were performed in 2004.              Approximately      1,000,000 tissue transplants are performed annually.                                                                                     overview                                           Which organs can be donated?       Someone may be able to donate his/her heart, kidneys,      liver, lungs, pancreas, and intestines, depending on their      age, medical condition and circumstances at the time of      death. Each organ is evaluated for possible donation      individually. Many patients who are organ donors may      also be candidates for tissue donation following the organ      recovery.        Which tissues can be donated?       Many classifications of tissue may be donated once the      legal next of kin grants permission (consent) for donation:             - Whole eyes or corneas may be donated to provide the gift      of sight.       - Hearts may be donated for human heart valves       - Cardiovascular tissue, which includes the thoracic aorta,      the abdominal aorta with iliac arteries, saphenous veins, and      femoral vessels, may be donated to restore compromised blood      circulation.       - Bone and soft musculoskeletal tissue, such as ligaments,      may be donated for orthoedic and spinal surgeries and sports      medicine injuries.       - Skin may be donated to promote healing and prevent      infection in critically burned individuals.

When vital organs, such as      the liver, kidneys, lungs,  pancreas,      or heart are severely damaged, they may need to be replaced      for a person to  survive.      Replacing some damaged tissues may allow a person to return to      a normal life a  cornea      to renew sight or a bone or tendon to restore the ability to      walk or move without  pain.      Organs can be donated by two types of donors: deceased and      living, with the  exception      of bone marrow which can only be donated by living donors.      Tissues can only  be      donated by deceased donors. The transplant process described      in this section deals  mainly      with organs donated by deceased donors. Bone marrow       transplantation      will not be covered extensively in these educational materials      (for additional  information      about bone marrow transplantation see: www.hhs.gov/diseases ).        Referral      and Evaluation        Once      a doctor determines the need for an organ transplant, the      individual is referred to a  transplant      centera hospital that performs transplantsfor      evaluation. If certain criteria  are      met, the individual is accepted into the transplant program at      that center. The  individuals      blood and tissue types are determined and he or she is placed      on a national  transplant      waiting list.        Waiting        The      period of time a patient may be on a waiting list before      receiving a transplant depends  on      a number of factors: How sick is the person? What is the      persons blood type? Is a  suitably      matched organ available? Unfortunately, because of the      shortage of donated  organs,      many people die before a compatible organ becomes available.      If an organ does  become      available for a particular patient on the waiting list, the      patients doctor is notified.  If      the doctor concludes that the donated organ is compatible, and      that the patient is in  suitable      condition to undergo the transplant operation, preparations      for surgery begin.        The      Transplant        The      donated organ is often surgically removed from the deceased      donor at the same time  as      the recipient is prepared for surgery to reduce the time that      the donated organ has to  survive      outside the body. Since the recipient is often at a different      hospital than the donor,  a      member of the recipients transplant team may have to travel      to the donors location to  remove      and transport the donated organ.        Recovery        After      surgery, the recipient undergoes a period of      recoverysometimes only a few  weeks.      However, if the recipients immune system rejects the      donated organ, the recovery  period      could be much longer. To combat rejection, doctors administer      immunosuppressive  drugs.        A      Better Life        If      the transplant is successful, the recipient may return to a      normal and active life, but must  have      regular check-ups and continue to take medicine for the rest      of his or her life. While  transplantation      is not a cure, when successful it provides an increase      in the quantity  and/or      quality of life.                                                                                                                         the donor                                    Becoming      a Donor        Many      people express a wish to be a donor when they die and take      steps during their  lifetime      to designate themselves as a donor. A person may use one of a      variety of methods  to      express an intention to be an organ and tissue donor: signing      a donor card, indicating  intent      to donate when applying for or renewing a drivers license,      or joining a donor  registry.       Minors      generally may indicate an intention to be a donor. While State      laws on requirements  for      minors vary, those States that allow a minor (often minors      over the age of 16) to  consent      to donation generally require the signature of a parent or      legal guardian.        Trauma      and Death        Most      organ donors are accident victims who have suffered severe and      eventually fatal  injuriesoften      a severe head injury. After arriving at the scene of such an      accident, emergency  medical      personnel immediately begin life-saving procedures while the      patient is  transported      to a hospital.        In      the Emergency Room        When      the ambulance arrives at the hospital, the patient is met by      doctors and nurses ready  to      employ all possible measures to save the victims life.        The      Intensive Care Unit        If      the injuries are severe, the patient is usually on a      life-support system. Doctors perform  tests      to determine the extent to which the brain and other organs      and tissues have been  damaged      as a result of the injury. If tests show the brain is no      longer alive, the patients  family      is informed that the patient is brain deadthat is, the      brain has ceased to function,  and      the patient is dead. Note: A coma, with its limited brain      function still in tact, is not the same as brain death.        The      Organ Procurement Organization        The      organizations responsible for coordinating organ donation and      transplantation are the  organ      procurement organizations (OPOs). Each of the 59 OPOs across      the country is a  Federally      designated nonprofit organization that works with the      hospitals in their designated  geographic      area to identify potential donors. These service areas may      cover a single State  or      parts of adjoining States. In addition to identifying donors      and obtaining consent where  necessary,      the OPOs are responsible for the evaluation, preservation,      allocation, recovery,  and      transport of donated organs. The crucial role of the OPO in      the organ donation and  transplantation      process is described below.        Hospital      Referral and Evaluation by the OPO        Federal      law requires that hospitals report all deaths and imminent      deaths (a per son      who is near death) to the local organ procurement      organization. Notification by the hospital allows an OPO      coordinator to go to the hospital. The brain dead person      is kept oxygenated by a mechanical support system until it is      determined whether the deceased will be a donor. If it is      determined that the deceased is  not      going to be a donor, the mechanical support system is      discontinued. If the deceased is  able      to be a donor, the OPO coordinator arranges for the      evaluation, surgical removal,  and      the preservation of donated organs and transport of each organ      to the transplant  center      where the recipient is waiting. Mechanical support of the      donors organ is maintained  until      the organs are surgically removed.        Consent      for Donation        Some States have passed laws providing that when a person      signs a donor card, indicates  an      intention to be a donor on a drivers license, or joins a      donor registry, this is a legal  form      of consent and must be honored. Family consent is not      necessary for that deceased  persons      organs and tissues to be donated. These laws are often      popularly referred to as  first      person consent and are based on the belief that the      donors wishes should be  paramount      and should not be overridden by family members. If the      deceased person had  not      designated him or herself as a donor, the family is asked to      make the decision whether  to      donate. (Generally, even if a deceased minor had indicated an      intention to be a donor,  the      family is asked to consent to the donation.) In States with      first person consent, OPO  representatives      take care to talk to the family before the removal of organs      to make sure  the      family understands and appreciates their loved ones      decision to save the lives of other  people      through organ donation.        In other States, even if a deceased person had signed a donor      card, indicated an intention  to      be a donor on a drivers license, or joined a donor      registry, the deceaseds family will  still      be asked for their consent before organs and tissues are      donated. A specially trained  OPO      representative offers the family the option of donating the      deceaseds organs and  explains      the donation procedures. The family is given time to consider      and discuss their  decision.      If the deceased had indicated a wish to be a donor, it is      often much easier for the  family      members to make a decision to donate their loved ones      organs. The decision  becomes      even easier if the deceased had discussed donation with family      members.        No matter what State you live in, it is important to indicate      your intention to be a donor  through      the various methods available and just as important to      convey those wishes  to      your family to increase the likelihood that your organs or      tissues will be donated or not  according      to your wishes. A familys decision to donate or their      acceptance of a loved  ones      decision to donate is made much easier if the deceased had      told them of his or her  desire      to be a donor.        Organ      Placement        Immediately      following the identification of the deceased as a donor, the      process of organ  placement      begins. Information about the donor, such as body size, blood      type, and  geographic      location of the donor, is entered into the computer system of      a national network  the      Organ Procurement and Transplant Network (OPTN). This computer      system  identifies      potential recipients on the national waiting list who best      match the available  organs.      Based on medical and scientific criteria, a list of potential      recipients is generated  for      each of the donors organs. One donor may be able to supply      organs and tissues for  many      recipients.        Organ      Recovery and Transportation        A      specific recipient for each organ to be donated is identified.      In some cases a surgeon  from      each recipients transplant team comes to the hospital to      surgically remove the organ  to      be donated to that recipient. In other cases surgeons at the      donors hospital remove  the      organs. In either case, organs are quickly preserved and      transported to the transplant  centers      where the recipients are waiting. Tissues are often removed      from the body a short  time      later, but both organ and tissue procedures are conducted      rapidly so as to reduce  the      chance of organ or tissue deterioration.        Funeral      Arrangements        The      usually quick removal of organs or tissues minimizes any delay      in funeral arrangements.  Organ      and tissue removal also is done in such a way that an      open-casket funeral is  still      possible.        Follow-Up        OPOs      ensure that the names of donors and recipients remain      confidential, but most donor  families      appreciate knowing that a gift of life came from their      tragedy. After a few weeks,  the      OPO sends the donors family a letter informing them how      their loved ones organs  and      tissues were used. While the names of the recipients remain      confidential, donor  families      can request updates about recipients by contacting their OPO.      Often recipients  ask      OPOs to pass letters on to a donors family expressing their      gratitude. This can be a  great      comfort to donor families. Recipients may eventually meet      donor families if both  parties      agree to this meeting.                                                                                        The information in this   section comes from Decision: Donation,    a program developed by the US Department of Health and Human    Services to integrate the topic of organ and tissue donation in existing    school curriculums.
