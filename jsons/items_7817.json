The Department of Chemistry at New York University has a long and illustrious history, dating back to well before the founding of the American Chemical Society (ACS) at the University in 1876. The Department has been designated by the ACS as a landmark in commemoration of this event. Professor John W. Draper, chairman of the department and first president of the ACS, was an early pioneer in the development of photography, working with Professor Samuel F.B. Morse. The late Gertrude B. Elion, co-recipient of the 1988 Nobel Prize in medicine and physiology, earned a master's degree in chemistry in our department, and Phil Baran a BS recipient recently earned a MacArthur Foundation \"genius\" grant in 2013. The department offers a major in chemistry and one in biochemistry, the details of which are set forth in the College of Arts and Science Bulletin . For highly motivated students, there are advanced courses that cover the general and organic chemistry required for several science majors and for the pre-health curriculum. These courses form a core for either the chemistry or the biochemistry major. Students in the advanced courses include potential chemistry, biology, and computer science majors. The classes themselves are small enough to enable students to interact closely with faculty. A series of individualized laboratory experiments is offered.
