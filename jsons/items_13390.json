About three centuries later, Constantine the Great would rise to imperial power and with him came a new state religion\u2014Christianity. This course examines the social and political history of the Roman Empire from the time of Augustus to that of Constantine and also closely observes the parallel growth of Christianity. History of Ancient Law CLASS-UA 292 Offered periodically. 4 points.

Art and Archaeology Ancient Art at Risk: Conservation, Ethics, and Cultural Property CLASS-UA 100 Prerequisite: permission of the instructor. 4 points. Examines the environmental, material, social, and political forces that put ancient art at risk, including exposure to natural elements, acid rain, pollution, dam building, tourism, urban development, armed conflict, looting, theft, and the illicit trade in antiquities. Issues of conservation, preservation, and ethics are considered through case studies that focus on sites, monuments, and materials. Team-taught with physical chemistry professor Norbert S. Baer of the Institute of Fine Arts Conservation Center, this course reviews a range of applied technologies used in the analysis of ancient objects: radiocarbon dating, thermoluminescence, dendrochronology, stable isotope analysis, dedolomitization, and elemental analysis. Authenticity and forgery, dating and provenance, and the sourcing of ancient materials are among the issues examined. The use of coins, inscriptions, and stamped amphora handles and ceramics is evaluated as criteria for establishing absolute and relative chronologies. Consideration is given to the role that stylistic analysis and connoisseurship have played in our understanding of ancient art. This interdisciplinary course is ideal for students who are interested in the intersection of classical archaeology with law, science, ethics, public policy, cultural resource management, and the environment. We track developments in global cultural property laws, international conventions, and the repatriation of cultural materials. The Parthenon and Its Reception: From Antiquity to the Present CLASS-UA 150 Identical to ARTH-UA 150. Prerequisite: permission of the instructor. 4 points. This colloquium traces the history of the Parthenon and its reception through its transformations from the temple of Athena, to Christian church, to mosque, to ruin, to icon of Western art and culture. The landscape, topography, and topology of the Athenian Acropolis are examined with an eye toward understanding the interrelation of place, myth, cult, and ritual. The architectural phases of the Parthenon, its program of sculptural decoration, its relationship to other monuments on the Acropolis, and the foundation myths that lie behind its meaning are scrutinized. Issues of reception, projection, and appropriation are considered, as well as interventions through conservation and reconstruction. Efforts to secure the repatriation of the Parthenon sculptures are reviewed within the broader context of global cultural heritage law and the opening of the New Acropolis Museum.

This seminar explores the history and culture of Egypt's western oases, especially of Dakhleh Oasis. In the course of this month, as we travel physically around Dakhleh and Kharga and chronologically from deep prehistory to the advent of Christianity, we address issues of insularity and connectivity with respect to the Nile Valley, as well as the relationship between humans, technology, and the natural environment. Inhabitants of the oases always enjoyed a rather precarious existence, because of the difficulty of travel, the ever-present risk of salinization, hostile desert raiders, and general remoteness; thus, we are alerted to the ways in which the realities of living on an oasis provoked identifiable and to some degree recurrent cultural dynamics. The Archaeology of Egypt's Nile Valley CLASS-UA 9356 Prerequisites: The Oases of Egypt (CLASS-UA 9355) and Field Work in Egypt (CLASS-UA 9357). Offered in the spring. 4 points. In this traveling seminar, students leave Dakhleh Oasis for the Nile Valley to place what they have studied into a wider cultural context. During the course of the month, students visit temples, tombs, settlements, and other sites throughout Egypt, from Aswan to Alexandria. Seminar sessions and class presentations focus on themes related especially to Egypt's ever-evolving religious and funerary beliefs, as well as the complex, often multicultural, nature of Egyptian civic life at various periods. Field Work in Egypt CLASS-UA 9357 Prerequisite: The Oases of Egypt (CLASS-UA 9355). Offered in the spring. 4 points. This intensive course is largely field-based, with additional time spent processing, recording, and analyzing materials at the excavation house. Students are involved in almost every aspect of the archaeological field process. Specialists offer instruction in survey techniques, in the drafting of archaeological plans, and in the interpretation of ceramics and other highly indicative artifacts. As the bulk of excavation in Egypt is undertaken by local workmen, students receive training as a site supervisor (with all of the necessary background in archaeological methodology that this entails). Independent Project: Excavation at Amheida CLASS-UA 9358 Prerequisite: participation in the NYU Archaeology and History in Egypt program. Offered in the spring. 4 points. For this independent project, students produce original research on some aspect of the material culture so far unearthed at Amheida. Students may choose to specialize in a type of artifact (such as pottery, flints, or coins), choose to analyze specific contexts in depth, or develop a specific project based on their own interests and backgrounds.

About three centuries later, Constantine the Great would rise to imperial power and with him came a new state religion\u2014Christianity. This course examines the social and political history of the Roman Empire from the time of Augustus to that of Constantine and also closely observes the parallel growth of Christianity. History of Ancient Law CLASS-UA 292 Offered periodically. 4 points.

Issues of conservation, preservation, and ethics are considered through case studies that focus on sites, monuments, and materials. Team-taught with physical chemistry professor Norbert S. Baer of the Institute of Fine Arts Conservation Center, this course reviews a range of applied technologies used in the analysis of ancient objects: radiocarbon dating, thermoluminescence, dendrochronology, stable isotope analysis, dedolomitization, and elemental analysis. Authenticity and forgery, dating and provenance, and the sourcing of ancient materials are among the issues examined. The use of coins, inscriptions, and stamped amphora handles and ceramics is evaluated as criteria for establishing absolute and relative chronologies. Consideration is given to the role that stylistic analysis and connoisseurship have played in our understanding of ancient art. This interdisciplinary course is ideal for students who are interested in the intersection of classical archaeology with law, science, ethics, public policy, cultural resource management, and the environment. We track developments in global cultural property laws, international conventions, and the repatriation of cultural materials. The Parthenon and Its Reception: From Antiquity to the Present CLASS-UA 150 Identical to ARTH-UA 150. Prerequisite: permission of the instructor. 4 points.

As the bulk of excavation in Egypt is undertaken by local workmen, students receive training as a site supervisor (with all of the necessary background in archaeological methodology that this entails). Independent Project: Excavation at Amheida CLASS-UA 9358 Prerequisite: participation in the NYU Archaeology and History in Egypt program. Offered in the spring. 4 points. For this independent project, students produce original research on some aspect of the material culture so far unearthed at Amheida. Students may choose to specialize in a type of artifact (such as pottery, flints, or coins), choose to analyze specific contexts in depth, or develop a specific project based on their own interests and backgrounds. In all cases, they are encouraged to formulate and test hypotheses. Once completed, independent projects are archived in the library for the use of all other archaeologists who work at Amheida. Research undertaken while at Dakhleh is facilitated by our online database, by collections stored on site, and by the dig house library.        Graduate Courses Open to Undergraduates Courses in classics offered in the Graduate School of Arts and Science are open to all undergraduates who have reached the required advanced level of Greek or Latin language instruction.

Refer to Core Program and GLS course numbers and requirements here . Writing Cultural Foundations Sequence Social Foundations Sequence Global Cultures Science GLS Upper Division Courses GLS Elective Courses Economics Internships  WRITING Writing I and II WRI-UF 0101 and WRII-UF 0102 4 credits each The Writing sequence advances the global emphasis of Liberal Studies by engaging students in reading, analyzing, and interpreting works throughout the English-speaking world and, in translation, beyond it; in the classroom, instructors deal with the attendant issues of geography, political and social difference, and translation. Students also produce original work based on research and the incorporation of dialogue with other writers and thinkers. The Writing sequence forms the foundation of a student\u2019s writing career and shares important writing-intensive values with all other areas of the program. Global Writing Seminar GWS-UF 0101 4 credits Introduces students to the kinds of observational, reading, research, analytic, and writing practices upon which they will depend throughout their undergraduate careers and beyond. Students work in modes from self-examination to cultural analysis that lead into the research process, helping them recognize the role of writing as a tool for exposition, exploration, synthesis, and argumentation. The course includes a variety of forms of writing to help students recognize the habits, practices, and intellectual assumptions that may limit their writing and scholarship. Emphasis on independent work of increasing sophistication in research methodologies yields a fuller understanding of the role of the essay in contemporary writing. Course materials and activities engage global issues and perspectives, with an emphasis on the potential junior year global site as one of the objects of investigation. Advanced Writing Studio AWS-UF 0201 4 credits Involves advanced study and practice of writing and is intended for those who wish to develop their writing and who seek to explore and utilize writing as an important aspect of inquiry. Typically, the course will involve the study and practice of one mode or genre of writing (e.g., the screenplay, the poem, the personal essay, literary journalism, the scholarly essay, short fiction, the book or movie review, etc.-- the number of genres or modes that students may practice in a single course will be at the instructor\u2019s discretion), and the study and practice of interpretive or reflexive prose that analyzes, synthesizes and reflectively engages with the mode or genre under consideration. The class will incorporate the study of global traditions (that is, across several large geographic regions) in which the particular mode or genre is practiced and studied. All classes will involve the student in some form of collaboration (group presentations, team-teaching a text, interviewing same subject, co-authoring, etc.), and will also include some treatment of how writing in the mode under consideration and its analysis is transferable to other kinds of writing practices. Creative Writing: Global Voices and Forms CWGV-UF 0101 4 credits The conversations and work in Creative Writing: Global Voices and Forms are guided by a reading list that has been constructed with an emphasis on the global writing community. Readings are drawn from the diverse international tradition of modern and contemporary writing in order to facilitate a discussion of the role national or geographic identity plays in the construction of creative works. The course considers, when appropriate, the national or geographic origin of particular forms\u2014in fiction, for example, magical realism and its ties to Latin America, and the nouveau roman and its ties to France\u2014and the ways those forms have migrated and influenced creative works around the globe. Students complete creative writing exercises inspired by and related to the readings and discussions of form, some of which might turn into longer works. Creative Writing: Places CWP-UF 0101 4 credits This course considers place, setting, or location as central concerns of the creative writing craft. Students examine contemporary theories and poetics around issues of place, as well as consider how writers use place, geography, landscape, and nationality to shape their creative work. Students consider how one makes places with language, how one conveys what it feels like to be in a place, and how place influences narrative. CULTURAL FOUNDATIONS SEQUENCE Cultural Foundations I CFI-UF 0101 4 credits Introduces the arts from their origins to the end of antiquity, as defined for these purposes by the roughly coincident dissolutions of the Gupta, Han, and Western Roman empires, focusing on how individuals and social relations are shaped in literature and the visual, plastic, and performing arts, as well as through music. Conceptions of the divine, the heroic, power and disenfranchisement, beauty, and love are examined within the context of the art and literature of East and South Asia, the Mediterranean world, and contiguous regions (such as Germania, Nubia, and Mesopotamia). Concepts of Cultural Foundations II are introduced through the discussion of models by which cultural transmission occurred across these regions prior to the rise of Islam. Cultural Foundations II CFII-UF 0102 4 credits Examines the arts produced within diverse cultural traditions across the globe from the rise of Islam at the beginning of the 7th century to the global empire building of the late 17th/early 18th centuries. The course explores the distinctive conventions and traditions of different media and the development of cultural traditions from their ancient foundations to the early modern period through successive influences and assimilations, both local and external. Diverse cultural traditions are also considered in relation to one another: by direct comparisons of works even in the absence of historical cultural contact; by consideration of mutual interactions, exchanges, and contestations; by the assertion of cultural dominance; and by resistance to such assertions. Cultural Foundations III CFIII-UF 0103 4 credits Explores the arts from the late 17th/early 18th centuries to the post-World War II era, examining how they define and reflect both local cultural views and rapidly shifting global understandings of the world. The course considers how the diverse conceptions and conditions of modernity shaped and were shaped by the arts around the world. Many of the issues pertinent to the course\u2014industrialization/urbanization; the outcomes of cross-cultural contact; colonialism, decolonization, conflicts of political ideology, and liberation struggles; fundamental redefinitions of mind, language, gender, and sexual identity\u2014have had very different effects in various parts of the world. Instructors encourage students to explore what it means to study the arts from global perspectives and to examine what \u201cglobalization\u201d itself has meant and means in the context of the arts. SOCIAL FOUNDATIONS SEQUENCE Social Foundations I SFI-UF 0101 4 credits Introduces students to the ancient world and ends with the dissolution of the Western Roman Empire, the Gupta Empire in India, and the Han Dynasty in China. This course takes a global perspective and uses an interdisciplinary approach, and part of its aim is to explore enduring questions such as the relation between the individual and society, between justice and power, and between humanity and the divine. The ancient societies from which the texts emerged are as much objects of study as the ancient texts themselves. Students consider many ideas with which they might not agree, and they ask how these earlier conceptions speak to their own lives and connect to the world today. Students are encouraged to distinguish between understanding a text in its historical settings and engaging in broad historical criticism. Accordingly, writing assignments strive to strike a balance between close reading and comparative assessment. In addition to drawing on seminal texts from the Mediterranean world and the Middle East, instructors give extended attention to at least one Mediterranean/non-European culture. Social Foundations II SFII-UF 0102 4 credits Spans a thousand years, from the rise of Islam and the reunification of China under the Tang Dynasty (in the 7th century CE) through the Scientific Revolution and the decline of the Mogul Empire in India. Students consider great ideas that have often helped earlier peoples organize their lives\u2014but which have also set them in conflict either with other communities or among themselves. Such ideas have sparked movements for ethical and social reform, conquest, recovery of lost classics, and religious renewal. Vast new empires appear during this period, but so do challenges to their rule. Religious conflicts lead to civil war, and modern science emerges as a challenge to traditional beliefs. Throughout, different conceptions of human nature emerge and collide. Oppression gives rise to new movements for greater equality and individual rights, and bitter struggles for power lead to the creation of large new colonial empires, whose effects linger to the present day. In addition, the world\u2019s different civilizations come into increasing contact through exploration and trade. Students consider these ideas and developments critically, with an eye to their philosophical, political, and historical significance; and they explore the ways in which texts that have often been read in exclusively Western contexts yield new meaning when placed in non-Western settings. Social Foundations III SFIII-UF 0103 4 credits Examines major intellectual and historical events from the Enlightenment and the Qing Dynasty (around 1700) to the contemporary world, a period that features some of the most rapid and significant changes in human society and scientific understanding. At the same time, many of the enduring questions of humanity have become even more critical as disparate cultures interact in a new global arena. This course is a capstone to the Foundations sequence; accordingly, authors and themes come from a range of texts both interdisciplinary and international. Among the themes the course explores are the philosophical and political debates that followed the creation of global colonial empires, as societies from around the world confronted imperial polices and institutions. The course also considers the rise of vast, new international markets; the spread of revolutionary and national liberation movements in the 19th and 20th centuries; new challenges to established property; and the social effects of industrialization. In addition, instructors discuss postmodern attempts to question and undermine the institutions and practices that structure contemporary societies. Students consider criticisms of Western practices that form both within the West and from other regions of the world, giving special attention to the reception of Western texts by other traditions and, conversely, the influence of these other traditions on the West. GLOBAL CULTURES African Cultures AFGC-UF 0101 4 credits Offers a broad interdisciplinary introduction to the great diversity of peoples, places, and cultures on the African continent. Students use a variety of historical sources, literature, and film to explore the paradigms of traditional cultures of precolonial societies and the disruptions of those structures by the incursions of Islam and European colonialism. The course also explores the decolonialization of the continent, the attendant struggles for independence, and post-liberation problems. The impact of modernity on cultural roles and the transformation of African cultures in the diaspora also receive attention. East Asian Cultures EAGC-UF 0101 4 credits Offers a broad interdisciplinary introduction to China, Japan, and Korea, generally concentrating on one of these regions. Students study aspects of the traditional and/or modern cultures of one or more of these countries, such as the foundational texts of major schools of thought, as well as literary, political, philosophical, religious, and artistic works. Topics may include the roots and growth of East Asian culture, national or cultural identity in relation to imperialism and colonialism, East-West tensions, modernism\u2019s clash with tradition, the persistence of the traditional within the modern, the East Asian diaspora, and questions of East Asian \u201cmodernities.\u201d Latin American Cultures LAGC-UF 0101 4 credits Offers a broad, interdisciplinary introduction to the diversity in the Caribbean and the Americas beyond the United States and Canada. Given the European, American, African, Asian, and indigenous Indian influences on the region\u2019s varied cultures and societies, the course focuses on one or more of such topics as the social, political, artistic, economic, and ethnological issues of the pre-Columbian, colonial, independence, and contemporary periods. It traces both cultural communities and differences within Latin America. The course also explores Latin American ideas about the place that the region occupies in the Americas and the world. Middle Eastern Cultures MEGC-UF 0101 4 credits Offers a broad interdisciplinary introduction to the societies, cultures, politics, and history of the contemporary Near East and Islamic North Africa. Sociological, historical, and political texts, as well as achievements in the fine and performing arts, films, and literary works, are employed to examine the region\u2019s rich historical legacy and current complexity. Topics include the historical-cultural relations between the Middle East and the West; the impact of historical, economic, and political change in the region\u2019s cultures and societies; and the contemporary state of the region. South Asian Cultures SAGC-UF 0101 4 credits Offers a broad interdisciplinary introduction to the society and culture of the Indian subcontinent, concentrating on one or more of the nations of India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, and Sri Lanka. Students study aspects of the traditional and/or modern cultures of one or more of these countries, such as the foundational texts of major schools of thought, as well as literary, political, philosophical, religious, and artistic works. The course explores the interactions of historical tradition and change and illuminates such issues as colonialism, sectarianism, and modernization. SCIENCE History of the Universe HOU-UF 0101 4 credits Students examine the nature of science as a way of looking at the world and study that world as revealed through the work of scientists over the years. They learn about the nature of matter and energy and how the universe has evolved. Topics include the origin and development of the stars, galaxies, planetary systems, and the universe itself, as well as study of the Earth and the development of life on Earth and its potential to exist elsewhere in the universe. The course begins with the development of scientific thought at multiple locations around the pre-modern world by reference to Babylonian and Chinese astronomy, Indian numerical systems, and the work of such scientists as Aristotle, Ptolemy, Al-Sufi, Copernicus, Kepler, and Galileo. It continues with discoveries by the likes of Newton, Darwin, Curie, Einstein, and Hubble during the period of Western scientific hegemony and ends with the multinational world of present-day science. Students acquire an understanding not only of modern science but also of its development and of the methods, strengths, and limitations of the scientific method. Environmental Studies ENSTU-UF 0101 4 credits Students learn about modern environmental science in the context of contemporary global issues, exploring the impact that the decisions of nations and individuals have on local and world ecologies. The course emphasizes the science involved in environmental decisions while also examining the role of ethics, politics, and economics in environmental decisions at both personal and governmental levels. Students examine such topics as ecology and biodiversity, including the nature and effects of succession, evolution, and invasion species; the atmosphere, including air pollution, ozone depletion, and climate change; sources, use, and misuse of water resources; human population and feeding the world\u2019s people, including developments in agriculture and genetic modifications of organisms; and the nature of Earth\u2019s energy resources and their use by humankind. Life Science LISCI-UF 0101 4 credits Examines fundamental principles and processes of biological science. The theme of evolution is woven throughout the course. Topics include genetics, cancer, cell biology, biochemistry, biotechnology, and bioethics, with special emphasis on the human species. Many of the topics are discussed within a social and historical context, demonstrating the global nature of scientific problems and scientific process. Selected readings from science journals, newspaper articles, and recent books expose students to the relevance and application of scientific work to their everyday lives, focusing particularly on genetic disease, the function and treatment of HIV infection, and other current important frontiers and ethical issues in the discipline. The course also acquaints students with the historical development of life science by reference to key figures from Galen to Averro\u00ebs to Mendel and Darwin. Science of Technology SCTEC-UF 0101 4 credits Follows the intertwined histories of science, technology, and society, focusing mainly on the technology of communication from the earliest means of communicating across space and time to present forms of communication. Students investigate the science behind the technology by engaging in inquiry-based group activities and group projects that illustrate the scientific method and the role of experimentation in producing scientific results. The course also looks at the impact technology has had on societies, and the way the structure and values of different societies have conditioned how technologies are actually used. Student research projects investigate the basic science, history, and impact of technologies in other fields such as energy, medicine, or transportation. GLOBAL LIBERAL STUDIES UPPER DIVISION COURSES Sophomore Seminar: Approaches APR-UF 0201 4 credits Approaches seminars are concentration-specific courses that acquaint students with the most influential theories and methods that inform the study of global issues and questions in their concentration. Emphasis falls on current thinkers, practitioners, and methods, with some reference to their immediate antecedents. These theoretical models are examined both for the ways they illuminate the interpretation of specific texts and as important texts in their own rights. Theory is contextualized by application to a small number of particular cases in the field (such as a particular legal issue or literary text). Sophomore Seminar: Global Topics GT-UF 0201 4 credits Global Topics seminars put topics of contemporary or historical interest into a global framework. They normally draw examples from the regions in which the global academic centers are located, but their primary purpose is to study the global networks of influence and exchange that allow one to understand a specific topic across disparate places. Emphasis is placed on students encountering the global in the University\u2019s urban setting, as well as in the classroom. The concentration designation provided for Global Topics courses is informational; students may freely choose Global Topics courses outside the concentration they plan to pursue. Experiential Learning I EXLI-UF 9301 4 credits Comprises both classroom instruction and community experience to immerse students in the current and historical character of their junior year study abroad site. Whenever possible, students practice foreign language skills as part of this immersion. Classroom instruction provides an interdisciplinary perspective on the local, regional, national, and global forces that have shaped the character of life in the site city. The community experience (normally, an internship, volunteer opportunity, or independent study opportunity) immerses the student in the contemporary life of the city, giving an advanced introduction to the city\u2019s local character and its intersection with global forces along four dimensions: Arts and Media, Politics, Economics, and the social practices of everyday life. The historical development of the city is diffused through each of these units, but the instructor may also choose to begin with a preamble devoted explicitly to the geographical situation and historical development of the city. Experiential Learning II EXLII-UF 9302 2 credits A two-credit, Pass/Fail course focused primarily on a community placement each student undertakes in close conjunction with the course\u2019s classroom component. With the guidance of the instructor, students independently reflect on and formulate concepts relating directly to their community placement. The community placement, which the student actively participates in securing with guidance from the relevant site or professional personnel, falls within the area defined by the student\u2019s concentration and, as much as possible, relates to his or her individual academic interests. Junior Independent Research Seminar JIRS-UF 0301 2 credits A mandatory, concentration-specific class taken online during spring of junior year. Students begin to prepare for the rigorous independent research they will conduct and present as seniors. Students use library research (including online resources) and, when relevant, their own experiences at the sites to shape their topics and inform their work. In consultation with the instructor and in active communication with other students in the course, each student creates an annotated bibliography, an essay that might serve as a draft chapter of the thesis, and a prospectus outlining a potential thesis topic growing out of the essay. (Students do not actually begin the thesis in the seminar; ideally, their work will form the basis for the thesis, but it is not required that it do so.) The seminar focuses on the methodology of writing in the disciplinary areas of the student\u2019s concentration; the precise readings that will inform the student\u2019s research will be determined by each student in consultation with the instructor. Under the direction of the instructor, students provide online feedback to each other at least once a week. Advanced Global Cultures AGCI-UF 9301 4 credits Concentrates on issues that place the particular international site where the course is taught into a global context. The course typically gives students the chance to study alongside their colleagues from other NYU schools. It includes components that take full advantage of the specific site\u2014e.g., museum trips and architectural tours, explorations of neighborhoods, lectures by or conversations with members of the community, and the like. The course illuminates aspects of the culture and history of the host country in relation to regional and local issues. Senior Seminars* SCAI-UF 0401 4 credits each Address a focused global topic from a broad interdisciplinary standpoint. Students independently analyze issues of global significance. The courses are interdisciplinary both in the range of primary material they address and in synthesizing and applying secondary or theoretical sources from multiple disciplines. The work students produce for the course is similarly global in scope and interdisciplinary in approach and methods. Students develop advanced understanding of a narrowly-defined aspect of global contact, encounter, or connection. The courses are taught seminar-style, and as such, students have primary responsibility for setting the agenda of class discussion. *An upper-level College of Arts and Science (CAS) course, including those cross-listed with the Graduate School of Arts and Science, may (with permission) be substituted for one semester of the senior capstone seminar, providing the course is required for the student to complete a second major or minor, or meets a B.A./M.A. requirement. Senior Colloquium and Thesis SCOI-UF 0401 4 credits (Fall) &amp; SRTH-UF 0402 6 credits (Spring) Constitute a full-year course that acts as the final realization of the degree\u2019s emphasis on independent inquiry from a global perspective. Students take a concentration-specific course associated with the senior thesis in each semester: Senior Colloquium in the fall and Senior Thesis in the spring, when the final draft of the thesis is submitted and reviewed by its first reader (the instructor of the Colloquium/Thesis course) and a second reader who provides additional expertise in the thesis topic. Each section of the course unites students in the same concentration who have spent their junior year at various locations; thus, students gain a global perspective on their topics by drawing on the experience of their peers. The course offers grounding in the theoretical texts relevant to advanced work in the concentration, close guidance in the actual composition of the thesis, and practice in the oral presentation of complex ideas. The thesis normally runs approximately 40-50 pages (or the equivalent in a different medium) and concerns a topic related to the student\u2019s junior year international study experience and a global issue of contemporary importance in the student\u2019s concentration. GLOBAL LIBERAL STUDIES ELECTIVE COURSES Introduction to Global Studies INTGS-UF 0101 4 credits Introduces some of the most influential thinkers and key concepts of Global Studies, the multi-disciplinary academic study of globalization. In its least contentious sense, \u201cglobalization\u201d refers to the rapidly developing and ever-deepening network of interconnections and Interdependencies that characterize contemporary life. What is hotly debated in Global Studies is less the empirical reality of globalization than its drivers, outcomes, and historical origins. Is globalization essentially an economic process or set of processes that has political and cultural implications, or a multi-dimensional set of processes for which no single social domain holds causal priority? Is \u201cglobalization\u201d simply another word for \u201cWesternization,\u201d \u201cAmericanization,\u201d or capitalism and its attendant ideologies? Did globalization begin in the last quarter century or several centuries ago or even several millennia? This course will examine answers made to these questions by such thinkers as Immanuel Wallerstein, Anthony Giddens, Arjun Appaduria, Roland Roberston, Joseph Stiglitz, John Tomlinson, and Jan Nederveen Pieterse, and introduce such key concepts as World-Systems Analysis, Neoliberalism, Cosmopolitanism, Postnationalism, Deterriorialization, Glocalization, and Hybridity. Topics in the Humanities ELEC-UF 0101 4 credits Elective courses that concern any one of a broad range of topics, with a special emphasis on connecting coursework with experiences in the city. Recent topics have included Studies in Peace and Conflict, and Self-Fashioning in Print and Visual Cultures. Some electives may provide training in uses of multimedia tools and take the form of a studio course. Electives, by definition, do not meet any degree requirement in LS, but do count as credits toward graduation. ECONOMICS Principles of Macroeconomics ECI-UF 0101 4 credits Introduces basic concepts of macroeconomic theory. Topics include unemployment, inflation, aggregate demand, income determination and stabilization policies, fiscal and monetary policies, and the Keynesian monetarist debate over stabilization policy. Not a prerequisite of Principles of Microeconomics. Equivalent to Introduction to Macroeconomics (ECON-UA 1) in CAS. Principles of Microeconomics ECII-UF 0102 4 credits Introduces basic concepts of microeconomic theory by examining price theory and its applications. Topics include consumer demand and choice, indifference curve analysis, big business and public policy, and factor markets and the distribution of income. Not a prerequisite of Principles of Macroeconomics. Equivalent to Introduction to Microeconomics (ECON-UA 2) in CAS. INTERNSHIPS Students do not need permission from LS to take paid internships. Following are guidelines for internships for credit. Only LS students who have completed the first semester of freshman year may receive academic credit for internships by taking the Internship Seminar. Internship Seminar INT-UF 0201 1-4 credits The goal of the Pass/Fail Internship Seminar, which meets weekly for variable credit, is to guide students in developing an academic project that relates to the experience they are having in an approved internship outside the classroom. Students read texts devoted to the intellectual analysis of the working world, share their internship experiences with their peers, and write regular reports on their experience. They complete a substantial final project whose precise nature is to be determined in consultation with the faculty director and submitted by the end of the term. The faculty director provides written comment on the work; students must pass all elements of the course in order to receive a passing grade. Students must submit internship application forms through LS Advising; the internship must be approved by the course instructor for a student to be given permission to register for the seminar. Acceptable internships: Must be located in New York City May include governmental, corporate, or nonprofit organizations Will be structured as an apprenticeship (that is, skills and responsibilities graduate over the course of the internship) May incorporate a research component Provide opportunities to use academic skills (e.g., writing, analysis, computer literacy, public speaking) Require a variety of work assignments Include progressively challenging tasks/assignments Engage the intern in a culture of teamwork and collaboration Encourage autonomous decision-making and production Give opportunities for synthesizing knowledge and information As part of the intensive LS liberal arts curriculum, it is important that internships situate the student in an interdisciplinary, challenging, and flexible environment. During the course of the internships, students should develop their communication abilities, knowledge of the field, and analytical and critical thinking. Ideally, internships will train students in a variety of methodologies and promote self-confidence as the student moves forward. Internships should also familiarize students with ethical procedures and restrictions within the organization. Internships characterized by the following are not acceptable within LS criteria: Take place at a location outside New York City Involve an excessive amount of clerical or non-field-related work Do not provide for frequent contact between intern and supervisors/colleagues Limit intern\u2019s work to a narrow and repetitive activity Restrict the exercise of independent judgment Do not articulate clear objectives and methods for internship training Have unrealistic expectations for the student\u2019s performance and outcomes                        Home       About Liberal Studies       Academics       Global Study       Admissions       Student Life       Alumni       Parents       News       LS Current Student Advising Site       LS Faculty Information Site               Updated on 02&#047;19&#047;2015       Stay Connected       Facebook       Twitter       Instagram           Contact Us                             Contact Us"}]},

Examines the environmental, material, social, and political forces that put ancient art at risk, including exposure to natural elements, acid rain, pollution, dam building, tourism, urban development, armed conflict, looting, theft, and the illicit trade in antiquities. Issues of conservation, preservation, and ethics are considered through case studies that focus on sites, monuments, and materials. Team-taught with physical chemistry professor Norbert S. Baer of the Institute of Fine Arts Conservation Center, this course reviews a range of applied technologies used in the analysis of ancient objects: radiocarbon dating, thermoluminescence, dendrochronology, stable isotope analysis, dedolomitization, and elemental analysis. Authenticity and forgery, dating and provenance, and the sourcing of ancient materials are among the issues examined. The use of coins, inscriptions, and stamped amphora handles and ceramics is evaluated as criteria for establishing absolute and relative chronologies. Consideration is given to the role that stylistic analysis and connoisseurship have played in our understanding of ancient art. This interdisciplinary course is ideal for students who are interested in the intersection of classical archaeology with law, science, ethics, public policy, cultural resource management, and the environment. We track developments in global cultural property laws, international conventions, and the repatriation of cultural materials.

This seminar explores the history and culture of Egypt's western oases, especially of Dakhleh Oasis. In the course of this month, as we travel physically around Dakhleh and Kharga and chronologically from deep prehistory to the advent of Christianity, we address issues of insularity and connectivity with respect to the Nile Valley, as well as the relationship between humans, technology, and the natural environment. Inhabitants of the oases always enjoyed a rather precarious existence, because of the difficulty of travel, the ever-present risk of salinization, hostile desert raiders, and general remoteness; thus, we are alerted to the ways in which the realities of living on an oasis provoked identifiable and to some degree recurrent cultural dynamics. The Archaeology of Egypt's Nile Valley CLASS-UA 9356 Prerequisites: The Oases of Egypt (CLASS-UA 9355) and Field Work in Egypt (CLASS-UA 9357). Offered in the spring. 4 points. In this traveling seminar, students leave Dakhleh Oasis for the Nile Valley to place what they have studied into a wider cultural context. During the course of the month, students visit temples, tombs, settlements, and other sites throughout Egypt, from Aswan to Alexandria. Seminar sessions and class presentations focus on themes related especially to Egypt's ever-evolving religious and funerary beliefs, as well as the complex, often multicultural, nature of Egyptian civic life at various periods. Field Work in Egypt CLASS-UA 9357 Prerequisite: The Oases of Egypt (CLASS-UA 9355). Offered in the spring. 4 points. This intensive course is largely field-based, with additional time spent processing, recording, and analyzing materials at the excavation house. Students are involved in almost every aspect of the archaeological field process. Specialists offer instruction in survey techniques, in the drafting of archaeological plans, and in the interpretation of ceramics and other highly indicative artifacts. As the bulk of excavation in Egypt is undertaken by local workmen, students receive training as a site supervisor (with all of the necessary background in archaeological methodology that this entails). Independent Project: Excavation at Amheida CLASS-UA 9358 Prerequisite: participation in the NYU Archaeology and History in Egypt program. Offered in the spring. 4 points. For this independent project, students produce original research on some aspect of the material culture so far unearthed at Amheida. Students may choose to specialize in a type of artifact (such as pottery, flints, or coins), choose to analyze specific contexts in depth, or develop a specific project based on their own interests and backgrounds. In all cases, they are encouraged to formulate and test hypotheses. Once completed, independent projects are archived in the library for the use of all other archaeologists who work at Amheida. Research undertaken while at Dakhleh is facilitated by our online database, by collections stored on site, and by the dig house library.

Writing Cultural Foundations Sequence Social Foundations Sequence Global Cultures Science GLS Upper Division Courses GLS Elective Courses Economics Internships  WRITING Writing I and II WRI-UF 0101 and WRII-UF 0102 4 credits each The Writing sequence advances the global emphasis of Liberal Studies by engaging students in reading, analyzing, and interpreting works throughout the English-speaking world and, in translation, beyond it; in the classroom, instructors deal with the attendant issues of geography, political and social difference, and translation. Students also produce original work based on research and the incorporation of dialogue with other writers and thinkers. The Writing sequence forms the foundation of a student\u2019s writing career and shares important writing-intensive values with all other areas of the program. Global Writing Seminar GWS-UF 0101 4 credits Introduces students to the kinds of observational, reading, research, analytic, and writing practices upon which they will depend throughout their undergraduate careers and beyond. Students work in modes from self-examination to cultural analysis that lead into the research process, helping them recognize the role of writing as a tool for exposition, exploration, synthesis, and argumentation. The course includes a variety of forms of writing to help students recognize the habits, practices, and intellectual assumptions that may limit their writing and scholarship. Emphasis on independent work of increasing sophistication in research methodologies yields a fuller understanding of the role of the essay in contemporary writing. Course materials and activities engage global issues and perspectives, with an emphasis on the potential junior year global site as one of the objects of investigation. Advanced Writing Studio AWS-UF 0201 4 credits Involves advanced study and practice of writing and is intended for those who wish to develop their writing and who seek to explore and utilize writing as an important aspect of inquiry. Typically, the course will involve the study and practice of one mode or genre of writing (e.g., the screenplay, the poem, the personal essay, literary journalism, the scholarly essay, short fiction, the book or movie review, etc.-- the number of genres or modes that students may practice in a single course will be at the instructor\u2019s discretion), and the study and practice of interpretive or reflexive prose that analyzes, synthesizes and reflectively engages with the mode or genre under consideration. The class will incorporate the study of global traditions (that is, across several large geographic regions) in which the particular mode or genre is practiced and studied. All classes will involve the student in some form of collaboration (group presentations, team-teaching a text, interviewing same subject, co-authoring, etc.), and will also include some treatment of how writing in the mode under consideration and its analysis is transferable to other kinds of writing practices. Creative Writing: Global Voices and Forms CWGV-UF 0101 4 credits The conversations and work in Creative Writing: Global Voices and Forms are guided by a reading list that has been constructed with an emphasis on the global writing community. Readings are drawn from the diverse international tradition of modern and contemporary writing in order to facilitate a discussion of the role national or geographic identity plays in the construction of creative works. The course considers, when appropriate, the national or geographic origin of particular forms\u2014in fiction, for example, magical realism and its ties to Latin America, and the nouveau roman and its ties to France\u2014and the ways those forms have migrated and influenced creative works around the globe. Students complete creative writing exercises inspired by and related to the readings and discussions of form, some of which might turn into longer works. Creative Writing: Places CWP-UF 0101 4 credits This course considers place, setting, or location as central concerns of the creative writing craft. Students examine contemporary theories and poetics around issues of place, as well as consider how writers use place, geography, landscape, and nationality to shape their creative work. Students consider how one makes places with language, how one conveys what it feels like to be in a place, and how place influences narrative. CULTURAL FOUNDATIONS SEQUENCE Cultural Foundations I CFI-UF 0101 4 credits Introduces the arts from their origins to the end of antiquity, as defined for these purposes by the roughly coincident dissolutions of the Gupta, Han, and Western Roman empires, focusing on how individuals and social relations are shaped in literature and the visual, plastic, and performing arts, as well as through music. Conceptions of the divine, the heroic, power and disenfranchisement, beauty, and love are examined within the context of the art and literature of East and South Asia, the Mediterranean world, and contiguous regions (such as Germania, Nubia, and Mesopotamia). Concepts of Cultural Foundations II are introduced through the discussion of models by which cultural transmission occurred across these regions prior to the rise of Islam. Cultural Foundations II CFII-UF 0102 4 credits Examines the arts produced within diverse cultural traditions across the globe from the rise of Islam at the beginning of the 7th century to the global empire building of the late 17th/early 18th centuries. The course explores the distinctive conventions and traditions of different media and the development of cultural traditions from their ancient foundations to the early modern period through successive influences and assimilations, both local and external. Diverse cultural traditions are also considered in relation to one another: by direct comparisons of works even in the absence of historical cultural contact; by consideration of mutual interactions, exchanges, and contestations; by the assertion of cultural dominance; and by resistance to such assertions. Cultural Foundations III CFIII-UF 0103 4 credits Explores the arts from the late 17th/early 18th centuries to the post-World War II era, examining how they define and reflect both local cultural views and rapidly shifting global understandings of the world. The course considers how the diverse conceptions and conditions of modernity shaped and were shaped by the arts around the world. Many of the issues pertinent to the course\u2014industrialization/urbanization; the outcomes of cross-cultural contact; colonialism, decolonization, conflicts of political ideology, and liberation struggles; fundamental redefinitions of mind, language, gender, and sexual identity\u2014have had very different effects in various parts of the world. Instructors encourage students to explore what it means to study the arts from global perspectives and to examine what \u201cglobalization\u201d itself has meant and means in the context of the arts. SOCIAL FOUNDATIONS SEQUENCE Social Foundations I SFI-UF 0101 4 credits Introduces students to the ancient world and ends with the dissolution of the Western Roman Empire, the Gupta Empire in India, and the Han Dynasty in China. This course takes a global perspective and uses an interdisciplinary approach, and part of its aim is to explore enduring questions such as the relation between the individual and society, between justice and power, and between humanity and the divine. The ancient societies from which the texts emerged are as much objects of study as the ancient texts themselves. Students consider many ideas with which they might not agree, and they ask how these earlier conceptions speak to their own lives and connect to the world today. Students are encouraged to distinguish between understanding a text in its historical settings and engaging in broad historical criticism. Accordingly, writing assignments strive to strike a balance between close reading and comparative assessment. In addition to drawing on seminal texts from the Mediterranean world and the Middle East, instructors give extended attention to at least one Mediterranean/non-European culture. Social Foundations II SFII-UF 0102 4 credits Spans a thousand years, from the rise of Islam and the reunification of China under the Tang Dynasty (in the 7th century CE) through the Scientific Revolution and the decline of the Mogul Empire in India. Students consider great ideas that have often helped earlier peoples organize their lives\u2014but which have also set them in conflict either with other communities or among themselves. Such ideas have sparked movements for ethical and social reform, conquest, recovery of lost classics, and religious renewal. Vast new empires appear during this period, but so do challenges to their rule. Religious conflicts lead to civil war, and modern science emerges as a challenge to traditional beliefs. Throughout, different conceptions of human nature emerge and collide. Oppression gives rise to new movements for greater equality and individual rights, and bitter struggles for power lead to the creation of large new colonial empires, whose effects linger to the present day. In addition, the world\u2019s different civilizations come into increasing contact through exploration and trade. Students consider these ideas and developments critically, with an eye to their philosophical, political, and historical significance; and they explore the ways in which texts that have often been read in exclusively Western contexts yield new meaning when placed in non-Western settings. Social Foundations III SFIII-UF 0103 4 credits Examines major intellectual and historical events from the Enlightenment and the Qing Dynasty (around 1700) to the contemporary world, a period that features some of the most rapid and significant changes in human society and scientific understanding. At the same time, many of the enduring questions of humanity have become even more critical as disparate cultures interact in a new global arena. This course is a capstone to the Foundations sequence; accordingly, authors and themes come from a range of texts both interdisciplinary and international. Among the themes the course explores are the philosophical and political debates that followed the creation of global colonial empires, as societies from around the world confronted imperial polices and institutions. The course also considers the rise of vast, new international markets; the spread of revolutionary and national liberation movements in the 19th and 20th centuries; new challenges to established property; and the social effects of industrialization. In addition, instructors discuss postmodern attempts to question and undermine the institutions and practices that structure contemporary societies. Students consider criticisms of Western practices that form both within the West and from other regions of the world, giving special attention to the reception of Western texts by other traditions and, conversely, the influence of these other traditions on the West. GLOBAL CULTURES African Cultures AFGC-UF 0101 4 credits Offers a broad interdisciplinary introduction to the great diversity of peoples, places, and cultures on the African continent. Students use a variety of historical sources, literature, and film to explore the paradigms of traditional cultures of precolonial societies and the disruptions of those structures by the incursions of Islam and European colonialism. The course also explores the decolonialization of the continent, the attendant struggles for independence, and post-liberation problems. The impact of modernity on cultural roles and the transformation of African cultures in the diaspora also receive attention. East Asian Cultures EAGC-UF 0101 4 credits Offers a broad interdisciplinary introduction to China, Japan, and Korea, generally concentrating on one of these regions. Students study aspects of the traditional and/or modern cultures of one or more of these countries, such as the foundational texts of major schools of thought, as well as literary, political, philosophical, religious, and artistic works. Topics may include the roots and growth of East Asian culture, national or cultural identity in relation to imperialism and colonialism, East-West tensions, modernism\u2019s clash with tradition, the persistence of the traditional within the modern, the East Asian diaspora, and questions of East Asian \u201cmodernities.\u201d Latin American Cultures LAGC-UF 0101 4 credits Offers a broad, interdisciplinary introduction to the diversity in the Caribbean and the Americas beyond the United States and Canada. Given the European, American, African, Asian, and indigenous Indian influences on the region\u2019s varied cultures and societies, the course focuses on one or more of such topics as the social, political, artistic, economic, and ethnological issues of the pre-Columbian, colonial, independence, and contemporary periods. It traces both cultural communities and differences within Latin America. The course also explores Latin American ideas about the place that the region occupies in the Americas and the world. Middle Eastern Cultures MEGC-UF 0101 4 credits Offers a broad interdisciplinary introduction to the societies, cultures, politics, and history of the contemporary Near East and Islamic North Africa. Sociological, historical, and political texts, as well as achievements in the fine and performing arts, films, and literary works, are employed to examine the region\u2019s rich historical legacy and current complexity. Topics include the historical-cultural relations between the Middle East and the West; the impact of historical, economic, and political change in the region\u2019s cultures and societies; and the contemporary state of the region. South Asian Cultures SAGC-UF 0101 4 credits Offers a broad interdisciplinary introduction to the society and culture of the Indian subcontinent, concentrating on one or more of the nations of India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, and Sri Lanka. Students study aspects of the traditional and/or modern cultures of one or more of these countries, such as the foundational texts of major schools of thought, as well as literary, political, philosophical, religious, and artistic works. The course explores the interactions of historical tradition and change and illuminates such issues as colonialism, sectarianism, and modernization. SCIENCE History of the Universe HOU-UF 0101 4 credits Students examine the nature of science as a way of looking at the world and study that world as revealed through the work of scientists over the years. They learn about the nature of matter and energy and how the universe has evolved. Topics include the origin and development of the stars, galaxies, planetary systems, and the universe itself, as well as study of the Earth and the development of life on Earth and its potential to exist elsewhere in the universe. The course begins with the development of scientific thought at multiple locations around the pre-modern world by reference to Babylonian and Chinese astronomy, Indian numerical systems, and the work of such scientists as Aristotle, Ptolemy, Al-Sufi, Copernicus, Kepler, and Galileo. It continues with discoveries by the likes of Newton, Darwin, Curie, Einstein, and Hubble during the period of Western scientific hegemony and ends with the multinational world of present-day science. Students acquire an understanding not only of modern science but also of its development and of the methods, strengths, and limitations of the scientific method. Environmental Studies ENSTU-UF 0101 4 credits Students learn about modern environmental science in the context of contemporary global issues, exploring the impact that the decisions of nations and individuals have on local and world ecologies. The course emphasizes the science involved in environmental decisions while also examining the role of ethics, politics, and economics in environmental decisions at both personal and governmental levels. Students examine such topics as ecology and biodiversity, including the nature and effects of succession, evolution, and invasion species; the atmosphere, including air pollution, ozone depletion, and climate change; sources, use, and misuse of water resources; human population and feeding the world\u2019s people, including developments in agriculture and genetic modifications of organisms; and the nature of Earth\u2019s energy resources and their use by humankind. Life Science LISCI-UF 0101 4 credits Examines fundamental principles and processes of biological science. The theme of evolution is woven throughout the course. Topics include genetics, cancer, cell biology, biochemistry, biotechnology, and bioethics, with special emphasis on the human species. Many of the topics are discussed within a social and historical context, demonstrating the global nature of scientific problems and scientific process. Selected readings from science journals, newspaper articles, and recent books expose students to the relevance and application of scientific work to their everyday lives, focusing particularly on genetic disease, the function and treatment of HIV infection, and other current important frontiers and ethical issues in the discipline. The course also acquaints students with the historical development of life science by reference to key figures from Galen to Averro\u00ebs to Mendel and Darwin. Science of Technology SCTEC-UF 0101 4 credits Follows the intertwined histories of science, technology, and society, focusing mainly on the technology of communication from the earliest means of communicating across space and time to present forms of communication. Students investigate the science behind the technology by engaging in inquiry-based group activities and group projects that illustrate the scientific method and the role of experimentation in producing scientific results. The course also looks at the impact technology has had on societies, and the way the structure and values of different societies have conditioned how technologies are actually used. Student research projects investigate the basic science, history, and impact of technologies in other fields such as energy, medicine, or transportation. GLOBAL LIBERAL STUDIES UPPER DIVISION COURSES Sophomore Seminar: Approaches APR-UF 0201 4 credits Approaches seminars are concentration-specific courses that acquaint students with the most influential theories and methods that inform the study of global issues and questions in their concentration. Emphasis falls on current thinkers, practitioners, and methods, with some reference to their immediate antecedents. These theoretical models are examined both for the ways they illuminate the interpretation of specific texts and as important texts in their own rights. Theory is contextualized by application to a small number of particular cases in the field (such as a particular legal issue or literary text). Sophomore Seminar: Global Topics GT-UF 0201 4 credits Global Topics seminars put topics of contemporary or historical interest into a global framework. They normally draw examples from the regions in which the global academic centers are located, but their primary purpose is to study the global networks of influence and exchange that allow one to understand a specific topic across disparate places. Emphasis is placed on students encountering the global in the University\u2019s urban setting, as well as in the classroom. The concentration designation provided for Global Topics courses is informational; students may freely choose Global Topics courses outside the concentration they plan to pursue. Experiential Learning I EXLI-UF 9301 4 credits Comprises both classroom instruction and community experience to immerse students in the current and historical character of their junior year study abroad site. Whenever possible, students practice foreign language skills as part of this immersion. Classroom instruction provides an interdisciplinary perspective on the local, regional, national, and global forces that have shaped the character of life in the site city. The community experience (normally, an internship, volunteer opportunity, or independent study opportunity) immerses the student in the contemporary life of the city, giving an advanced introduction to the city\u2019s local character and its intersection with global forces along four dimensions: Arts and Media, Politics, Economics, and the social practices of everyday life. The historical development of the city is diffused through each of these units, but the instructor may also choose to begin with a preamble devoted explicitly to the geographical situation and historical development of the city. Experiential Learning II EXLII-UF 9302 2 credits A two-credit, Pass/Fail course focused primarily on a community placement each student undertakes in close conjunction with the course\u2019s classroom component. With the guidance of the instructor, students independently reflect on and formulate concepts relating directly to their community placement. The community placement, which the student actively participates in securing with guidance from the relevant site or professional personnel, falls within the area defined by the student\u2019s concentration and, as much as possible, relates to his or her individual academic interests. Junior Independent Research Seminar JIRS-UF 0301 2 credits A mandatory, concentration-specific class taken online during spring of junior year. Students begin to prepare for the rigorous independent research they will conduct and present as seniors. Students use library research (including online resources) and, when relevant, their own experiences at the sites to shape their topics and inform their work. In consultation with the instructor and in active communication with other students in the course, each student creates an annotated bibliography, an essay that might serve as a draft chapter of the thesis, and a prospectus outlining a potential thesis topic growing out of the essay. (Students do not actually begin the thesis in the seminar; ideally, their work will form the basis for the thesis, but it is not required that it do so.) The seminar focuses on the methodology of writing in the disciplinary areas of the student\u2019s concentration; the precise readings that will inform the student\u2019s research will be determined by each student in consultation with the instructor. Under the direction of the instructor, students provide online feedback to each other at least once a week. Advanced Global Cultures AGCI-UF 9301 4 credits Concentrates on issues that place the particular international site where the course is taught into a global context. The course typically gives students the chance to study alongside their colleagues from other NYU schools. It includes components that take full advantage of the specific site\u2014e.g., museum trips and architectural tours, explorations of neighborhoods, lectures by or conversations with members of the community, and the like. The course illuminates aspects of the culture and history of the host country in relation to regional and local issues. Senior Seminars* SCAI-UF 0401 4 credits each Address a focused global topic from a broad interdisciplinary standpoint. Students independently analyze issues of global significance. The courses are interdisciplinary both in the range of primary material they address and in synthesizing and applying secondary or theoretical sources from multiple disciplines. The work students produce for the course is similarly global in scope and interdisciplinary in approach and methods. Students develop advanced understanding of a narrowly-defined aspect of global contact, encounter, or connection. The courses are taught seminar-style, and as such, students have primary responsibility for setting the agenda of class discussion. *An upper-level College of Arts and Science (CAS) course, including those cross-listed with the Graduate School of Arts and Science, may (with permission) be substituted for one semester of the senior capstone seminar, providing the course is required for the student to complete a second major or minor, or meets a B.A./M.A. requirement. Senior Colloquium and Thesis SCOI-UF 0401 4 credits (Fall) &amp; SRTH-UF 0402 6 credits (Spring) Constitute a full-year course that acts as the final realization of the degree\u2019s emphasis on independent inquiry from a global perspective. Students take a concentration-specific course associated with the senior thesis in each semester: Senior Colloquium in the fall and Senior Thesis in the spring, when the final draft of the thesis is submitted and reviewed by its first reader (the instructor of the Colloquium/Thesis course) and a second reader who provides additional expertise in the thesis topic. Each section of the course unites students in the same concentration who have spent their junior year at various locations; thus, students gain a global perspective on their topics by drawing on the experience of their peers. The course offers grounding in the theoretical texts relevant to advanced work in the concentration, close guidance in the actual composition of the thesis, and practice in the oral presentation of complex ideas. The thesis normally runs approximately 40-50 pages (or the equivalent in a different medium) and concerns a topic related to the student\u2019s junior year international study experience and a global issue of contemporary importance in the student\u2019s concentration. GLOBAL LIBERAL STUDIES ELECTIVE COURSES Introduction to Global Studies INTGS-UF 0101 4 credits Introduces some of the most influential thinkers and key concepts of Global Studies, the multi-disciplinary academic study of globalization. In its least contentious sense, \u201cglobalization\u201d refers to the rapidly developing and ever-deepening network of interconnections and Interdependencies that characterize contemporary life. What is hotly debated in Global Studies is less the empirical reality of globalization than its drivers, outcomes, and historical origins. Is globalization essentially an economic process or set of processes that has political and cultural implications, or a multi-dimensional set of processes for which no single social domain holds causal priority? Is \u201cglobalization\u201d simply another word for \u201cWesternization,\u201d \u201cAmericanization,\u201d or capitalism and its attendant ideologies? Did globalization begin in the last quarter century or several centuries ago or even several millennia? This course will examine answers made to these questions by such thinkers as Immanuel Wallerstein, Anthony Giddens, Arjun Appaduria, Roland Roberston, Joseph Stiglitz, John Tomlinson, and Jan Nederveen Pieterse, and introduce such key concepts as World-Systems Analysis, Neoliberalism, Cosmopolitanism, Postnationalism, Deterriorialization, Glocalization, and Hybridity. Topics in the Humanities ELEC-UF 0101 4 credits Elective courses that concern any one of a broad range of topics, with a special emphasis on connecting coursework with experiences in the city. Recent topics have included Studies in Peace and Conflict, and Self-Fashioning in Print and Visual Cultures. Some electives may provide training in uses of multimedia tools and take the form of a studio course. Electives, by definition, do not meet any degree requirement in LS, but do count as credits toward graduation. ECONOMICS Principles of Macroeconomics ECI-UF 0101 4 credits Introduces basic concepts of macroeconomic theory. Topics include unemployment, inflation, aggregate demand, income determination and stabilization policies, fiscal and monetary policies, and the Keynesian monetarist debate over stabilization policy. Not a prerequisite of Principles of Microeconomics. Equivalent to Introduction to Macroeconomics (ECON-UA 1) in CAS. Principles of Microeconomics ECII-UF 0102 4 credits Introduces basic concepts of microeconomic theory by examining price theory and its applications. Topics include consumer demand and choice, indifference curve analysis, big business and public policy, and factor markets and the distribution of income. Not a prerequisite of Principles of Macroeconomics. Equivalent to Introduction to Microeconomics (ECON-UA 2) in CAS. INTERNSHIPS Students do not need permission from LS to take paid internships. Following are guidelines for internships for credit. Only LS students who have completed the first semester of freshman year may receive academic credit for internships by taking the Internship Seminar. Internship Seminar INT-UF 0201 1-4 credits The goal of the Pass/Fail Internship Seminar, which meets weekly for variable credit, is to guide students in developing an academic project that relates to the experience they are having in an approved internship outside the classroom. Students read texts devoted to the intellectual analysis of the working world, share their internship experiences with their peers, and write regular reports on their experience. They complete a substantial final project whose precise nature is to be determined in consultation with the faculty director and submitted by the end of the term. The faculty director provides written comment on the work; students must pass all elements of the course in order to receive a passing grade. Students must submit internship application forms through LS Advising; the internship must be approved by the course instructor for a student to be given permission to register for the seminar. Acceptable internships: Must be located in New York City May include governmental, corporate, or nonprofit organizations Will be structured as an apprenticeship (that is, skills and responsibilities graduate over the course of the internship) May incorporate a research component Provide opportunities to use academic skills (e.g., writing, analysis, computer literacy, public speaking) Require a variety of work assignments Include progressively challenging tasks/assignments Engage the intern in a culture of teamwork and collaboration Encourage autonomous decision-making and production Give opportunities for synthesizing knowledge and information As part of the intensive LS liberal arts curriculum, it is important that internships situate the student in an interdisciplinary, challenging, and flexible environment. During the course of the internships, students should develop their communication abilities, knowledge of the field, and analytical and critical thinking. Ideally, internships will train students in a variety of methodologies and promote self-confidence as the student moves forward. Internships should also familiarize students with ethical procedures and restrictions within the organization. Internships characterized by the following are not acceptable within LS criteria: Take place at a location outside New York City Involve an excessive amount of clerical or non-field-related work Do not provide for frequent contact between intern and supervisors/colleagues Limit intern\u2019s work to a narrow and repetitive activity Restrict the exercise of independent judgment Do not articulate clear objectives and methods for internship training Have unrealistic expectations for the student\u2019s performance and outcomes                        Home       About Liberal Studies       Academics       Global Study       Admissions       Student Life       Alumni       Parents       News       LS Current Student Advising Site       LS Faculty Information Site               Updated on 02&#047;19&#047;2015       Stay Connected       Facebook       Twitter       Instagram           Contact Us                             Contact Us"}, {"content": "2015-16 Course Descriptions &mdash;

You may then forward the permission email to marc.leblanc@nyu.edu to get the registration access code.    All classes are held in the 2nd floor seminar room unless indicated otherwise.  Fall 2015 Seminars    ISAW-GA 3002-001 Observation and Experiment in Ancient Physical Science Alexander Jones alexander.jones@nyu.edu Wednesdays, 2:00-5:00pm    This seminar explores the empirical elements in ancient scientific traditions that aimed at systematic description, explanation, or prediction of physical phenomena. Scientific practices of the Ancient Near East and the Greco-Roman world will figure prominently, but those of other civilizations may be investigated according to the interests and competences of participants. The evidence is largely textual; knowledge of at least one ancient language in which relevant scientific texts exist is required. Participants will choose topics, select study materials, and guide discussion for at least one session.    An initial selection of topics will include the following: the rise of systematic observation of spontaneously occurring phenomena in the context of interpretation of the phenomena as ominous signs; practices of recording and transmitting observations of astral, meteorological, and mundane events; precision, accuracy, and instruments of measurement, especially in astronomical observation records; experiment and experimental apparatus in Greek harmonic theory; empirical claims within deductive scientific texts, e.g. in optics, mechanics, and astronomy; empirical argument in Ptolemy's Optics; adjustment and fabrication of reported observations and measurements.    Permission of the instructor is required.    ISAW-GA 3007-001 Greco-Arabic Translation Movement Robert Hoyland rgh2@nyu.edu Tuesdays, 9:00am-12:00pm    This course will explore the different paths along which knowledge of Antiquity passed into Muslim intellectual culture and how it was received and interpreted.\u00a0 The focus will not just be on the so-called \u2018translation movement\u2019, but also the broader question of how pre-Islamic histories and cultures fared in the Middle East after the Arab conquests.\u00a0 We will principally look at\u00a0Greek texts translated into Arabic, which receive the most scholarly attention, because they are regarded as crucial to understanding how classical learning was conveyed to Europe and because classicists are always hoping to find lost Greek works preserved in Arabic. However, we will also give consideration to\u00a0translation from Middle Persian and Sanskrit, which may well have been substantial, though the question has been too little studied to be sure.    \u00a0 Assessment will be via a final paper which should draw upon study of original Arabic texts (or a text) and should have a research dimension to it (i.e. not be just a survey of what is known).    Permission of the instructor and knowledge of Arabic are required, and some familiarity with Greek would be an advantage.    ISAW-GA 3010-001 The Manuscripts of Early Chinese Natural Philosophy Ethan Harkness harkness@nyu.edu Fridays, 2:00-5:00pm    This course will introduce students to a variety of recently excavated Chinese technical manuscripts dating from the late Warring States, Qin, and Western Han periods (4th \u2013 1st centuries BCE).\u00a0 We will pay particular attention to the various calendrically-based divination texts promulgated in the manuscripts known as rishu (\u201cdaybooks\u201d), but the fields of astronomy, geography, medicine, and mathematics will all receive due consideration.\u00a0 When appropriate, reference will be made to connections with transmitted texts and to the later repercussions of ideas developed and refined in the years immediately surrounding the formation of the Chinese empire.\u00a0 Topics to consider will include the social function of the early technical texts; the nature of their transmission and evolution; regional idiosyncrasies; the interconnected roles of scribes and readers; and the possible function of both political ideology and private interests in shaping the texts.    Prerequisites are good reading knowledge of modern and classical Chinese and permission of the instructor.    ISAW-GA 3010-002 Advanced Study in Chinese Art &amp; Archaeology Lillian Tseng lillian.tseng@nyu.edu Tuesdays, 2:00-5:00pm    This course is intended to provide intensive analyses of primary sources and related scholarship in Chinese art &amp; archaeology for graduate students who have sufficient knowledge of the field. Topics to study depend on the research need of the students.    Ability to read Classical Chinese and permission of the instructor are required.    ISAW-GA 3012-001 Archaeology and Historiography: Perspectives on Time, Space, Text and Material Roderick Campbell rbc2@nyu.edu Thursdays, 2:00-5:00pm    Though treated as separate disciplines and usually housed in different departments, at the highest level history and archaeology share the common goal of understanding the human past. Nevertheless, in both theory and method, not only are archaeology and history internally diverse, but also frequently miles apart. This seminar will embark on an interdisciplinary exploration of the historical sciences: their histories, philosophies and methodologies. Special focus will be on theories of time (change, tradition, process, event, etc.), space (physical space, place, landscape, etc.), text (context, genre, discourse, memory, etc.) and material (material culture, materiality, things, actor-networks, etc.)    The reading load in this course will be heavy. Permission of the instructor is required.    ISAW-GA 3013-001 Production, Accumulation, Trade, and Value: Political Economy in the Ancient Mediterranean Lorenzo d\u2019Alfonso and Elizabeth Murphy lda5@nyu.edu ; elizabeth.murphy@nyu.edu Mondays, 2:00-5:00pm    During the last decades, renewed attention has been devoted to the importance of market and private enterprise in the economies of the ancient Mediterranean, as exemplified by such works as A history of market performance: from ancient Babylonia to the modern world (van der Spek et al., eds., 2015), Commerce and colonization in the ancient Near East (Aubet, 2013), and The Roman market economy (Temin, 2013). On the one hand, interest in market and private enterprise enables us to traverse artificial distinctions between pre-classical and classical ancient Mediterranean civilizations and to pose cross-culturally comparative questions about ancient state economies. On the other hand, this new trend in some respects pays less attention to institutional and political impacts on ancient economies. This impact has perhaps received too much attention in the historiography of ancient western Asia, but the meaning of political intervention in the economic process acquires a different meaning when embedded in a context of private enterprises. For the Roman world, the interests of imperial institutions (e.g., military supply chains, annona redistributions, imperial monopolies) as influencing the scale and organization of economic activities has been long recognized, but recent approaches have turned to the more subtle and indirect ways that institutions affected regional economic development. In response to these academic trends, this course aims to examine the role of political economy in the ancient Mediterranean from multiple vantages.\u00a0 The first classes will focus on recent theoretical works on political economy such as Piketty\u2019s Capital , and North\u2019s Institutions, Institutional Change, and Economic Performance , as well as some of the \u2018classic\u2019 works on ancient economies, such as those by Polanyi, Finley, and Rostovtzeff. In the following classes, ideas developed through the theory classes will then be confronted with specific case studies from the protohistory of ancient western Asia and the Greco-Roman world. These thematic classes will consider issues of primary production, storage and hoarding (accumulation of surpluses and wealth), trade, and the definition of value.\u00a0    Permission of the instructors is required.    Fall 2015 Tutorials    ISAW-GA 3014-001 Texts from the Libraries of the Kingdom of Eshnunna Beate Pongratz-Leisten bpl2@nyu.edu Tuesdays, 2:00-5:00pm Large Conference Room, 6th Floor\u00a0    Various cities of the kingdom of Eshnunna have yielded literary texts, among them the city of Eshnunna, which seems to have housed a center for scribal training already during the Old Akkadian period, where a forerunner to The Great Revolt Against Naram-Sin has come to light; the city of Tell Harmal, ancient Shaduppum, where the only copy of Sargon in Foreign Lands has been found; and the city of Tell Haddad, ancient Meturan, which yielded a remarkable collection of tablets from a private house owned by an exorcist. In addition to Akkadian archival texts found in separate rooms, there has come to light from two areas a library containing a fragment of the Laws of Eshnunna as well as numerous lexical, liturgical, literary and magic texts (incantations), two prayers to the sun god, and the earliest attested bilingual forerunner to the hemerological series Inbu bel arhi . Among the literary texts, perhaps the most unexpected discovery is a copy of the Sumerian version of the story of Adapa and two larger fragments of the Death of  Gilgamesh . Other Gilgamesh stories represented at Meturan are Gilgamesh and the Bull of An , Gilgamesh and Huwawa , and Gilgamesh, EnkIdu and the Netherworld .    The goal of this seminar is to examine Eshnunna\u2019s role in the transmission of scholarly knowledge through an in-depth analysis of the written compositions extant from the major cities of the kingdom.    Permission of the instructor and knowledge of Akkadian and Sumerian are required.    ISAW-GA 3014-002 Advanced Akkadian: Old Babylonian Historical Texts Beate Pongratz-Leisten bpl2@nyu.edu Thursdays, 11:00am-1:00pm Small Conference Room, 6th Floor\u00a0    This advanced course in Akkadian will emphasize the reading of Old Babylonian texts from the sites of Mari and Eshnunna in order to investigate the rise to power and political relations of these two kingdoms during the Old Babylonian period. Primary texts read will include the treaty concluded between between Zimri-lim of Mari and Ibal-pi-el II of Eshnunna and a lengthy letter from Ibal-pi-el II to Zimri-lim offering a political alliance.\u00a0 These two texts offer insight into the form and structure as well as the terminology of international treaties during the first half of the second millennium BCE. Additional readings will include not only other historical inscriptions of the kings of Mari and of Eshnunna but also, for the purposes of comparison and contrast, inscriptions of the kings of Larsa.    Students will acquire an in-depth understanding of the variety and scope of historical and particularly royal inscriptions in the time of the competing territorial states of the Old Babylonian period.    Permission of the instructor and Intermediate Akkadian are required.    Fall 2015 Other Courses    ISAW-GA 1000-001 Intro to Ancient Egyptian I Ogden Goelet ogden.goelet@nyu.edu Time and Location, TBD    This course, in the first part of a full year course over two semesters, introduces students to the Middle Egyptian (Classical) dialect of the Ancient Egyptian language in its hieroglyphic form. The classes are structured primarily according to the lessons in J.P. Allen, Middle Egyptian. An Introduction to the Language and Culture of the Hieroglyphs . The course will usually proceed at the rate of one chapter per week, but occasionally a chapter may be skipped or two chapters will be combined. The goal of the first semester is to reach the treatment of the Egyptian verb and the infinitive in Allen\u2019s 13th and 14th chapters. The lessons will be supplemented with readings from A.H. Gardiner, Egyptian Grammar , 3rd. edition, M. Collier and B. Manley, How to Read Egyptian Hieroglyphs , revised edition, and occasional excerpts from Egyptian funerary stelae.    Permission of the instructor is required.    ISAW-GA 1002-001 Advanced Ancient Egyptian I Ogden Goelet ogden.goelet@nyu.edu Time and Location, TBD    This course is based on readings from actual Egyptian hieroglyphic texts in their original form. In the early stages of the course, the readings will be presented in both a \u201cnormalized\u201d form with the individual sentences and clauses demarked as well as in the original, continuous text format. The readings will be drawn from a wide range of genres and will increase in difficulty as the course progresses. Where appropriate, photographs and line drawings will be used so that students will learn to handle hieroglyphic text as it actually appears on Egyptian objects. The readings are drawn from a text book in progress.    Permission of the instructor is required.    Spring 2016 Seminars    ISAW-GA 3007-001 Roman Law and the Papyri Roger Bagnall roger.bagnall@nyu.edu Thursdays, 9:00am-12:00pm    Ever since the first legal documents on papyrus dating to the Roman imperial period were published in the nineteenth century, it has been evident to jurists that the papyri offered a unique opportunity to look in depth at how the majestic and complex structure of Roman law that we know from the classical jurists (largely excerpted in Justinian\u2019s Digest) worked on the ground in the provinces. A sizable literature on the subject developed in the early twentieth centuy and has continued to evolve. This seminar will take a series of key issues and institutions, including marriage, the legal status of women, slavery, testation, and major contract types. For each we will examine both selections from the jurists and some representative papyrus documents.    Permission of the instructor is required.    ISAW-GA 3010-001 Shang Civilization: Text and Material Culture Roderick Campbell rbc2@nyu.edu Fridays, 2:00-5:00pm    This seminar will focus on the Shang dynasty of ancient China from the perspective of archaeology, epigraphy and transmitted texts. The archaeology will cover north China in the 2nd millennium BCE, but focus on the site of Anyang where inscribed oracle-bones and bronzes, monumental tombs and palatial buildings were discovered in the early 20th century demonstrating the historicity of the Shang dynasty. The oracle-bones and bronze inscriptions of the Anyang period will present an opportunity to glimpse a partial image of Shang royal and high elite concerns, especially concerning ritual. A study of Shang history from the perspective of transmitted texts will give both an opportunity to understand the place of the Shang dynasty in later Chinese history as well as its formation as historical subject. This course will be taught at several levels and students of non-sinological background are welcome. While the ability to read classical and modern Chinese would be an asset, neither language is a requirement for this seminar.    Permission of the instructor is required.    ISAW-GA 3012-001 Beyond China and Byzantium Robert Hoyland and S\u00f6ren Stark rgh2@nyu.edu ; \u00a0 soeren.stark@nyu.edu Tuesdays, 9:00am-12:00pm    Permission of the instructors is required.    ISAW-GA 3014-001 Cultural Memory and the Libraries in Mesopotamia Beate Pongratz-Leisten bpl2@nyu.edu Tuesdays, 2:00-5:00pm    Permission of the instructor is required.    ISAW-GA 3023-001 Special Topics in Digital Humanities for the Ancient World: Computational Photography and 3D Modeling Sebastian Heath sh1933@nyu.edu Wednesdays, 2:00-5:00pm    The premise of this course is that virtual representations of the ancient world will become increasingly important to both research and teaching as the ability to create, work with, and share such digital resources becomes less expensive and more widely available. Accordingly, the course will combine hands-on experience with creating and using virtual representations of ancient material culture, including objects and architectural spaces, with a review of current practices being employed by projects around the world. Students will use such tools as the open-source 3d-suite Blender, the game engine Unity, and applications for making models with smartphone cameras. We will explore techniques for making richly-textured 3d models of real objects as well as create immersive virtual environments. Readings will include reports of ongoing work as well as discussions of why 3D matters and how it is being used in the classroom. Guest speakers from academia and industry will provide a broad perspective on current trends. Students will use their own computers and should be willing to apply themselves to learning the digital skills the class introduces.    Permission of the instructor is required.    Spring 2016 Tutorials    ISAW-GA 3014-002 Advanced Akkadian: Neo-Babylonian Historical Inscriptions Beate Pongratz-Leisten bpl2@nyu.edu Thursdays, 11:00am-1:00pm Small Conference Room, 6th Floor\u00a0    The Advanced Reading of Akkadian Class of Neo-Babylonian Inscriptions is designed to introduce into the Neo-Babylonian dialect and to familiarize the student with its particular paleography and grammar. Simultaneously, a diachronic choice of Neo-Babylonian inscriptions reaching from Nabupolassar, its founder, to Nabonidus will provide an insight into the history of the Neo-Babylonian empire.    Permission of the instructor and knowledge of Akkadian are required.    Spring 2016 Other Courses    ISAW-GA 1001-001 Intro to Ancient Egyptian II Ogden Goelet ogden.goelet@nyu.edu Time and Location, TBD  This course is a continuation of the first semester. The course will proceed at the rate of a chapter per week through J.P. Allen, Middle Egyptian. An Introduction to the Language and Culture of the Hieroglyphs . From time to time, passages from actual Egyptian texts will supplement the examples in Allen\u2019s grammar. Depending on the progress of the class, the last weeks of the course will cover the hieroglyphic transcription of The Tale of the Shipwrecked Sailor , an actual Egyptian literary tale.    Permission of the instructor is required.    ISAW-GA 1003-001 Advanced Ancient Egyptian II Ogden Goelet ogden.goelet@nyu.edu Time and Location, TBD    This is a continuation of the fall semester course, using additional sources of increasing difficulty. Depending on the progress of the class, there will be occasional readings from hieratic primarily based on sources that the students have already read in hieroglyphic transcription during this course and the previous semester.    Permission of the instructor is required.
