In every aspect of our daily lives, from the way we work, shop, communicate, or socialize; we are both consuming and creating vast amounts of information. More often than not, these daily activities create a trail of digitized data that is being stored, mined, and analyzed by firms hoping to create valuable business intelligence. However, much of the promises of such data-driven policies have failed to materialize because managers find it difficult to translate data into actionable strategies. The broad objective of this program is to fill this gap by training you with tools and techniques to analyze large databases, use effective data visualization to gauge key metrics, and by instilling a general intuition for data-driven decision making.     Philosophy : Extracting useful insights from the vast amount of information involves a combination of analytical skills and intuition. It is both an art and science. The pedagogic philosophy in this course embraces the principle of learning-by-doing. Our emphasis will be on applications and interpretation of the results for making business decisions such as estimating market potential and forecasting demand, developing optimal pricing/promotional policies, using data mining techniques to identify market segments and develop optimal targeting models. The underlying framework in all these decisions will be return on marketing investments for maximizing customer life time value.     Approach : In order to provide a broad intuition of the concepts and methods, we will use a combination of lectures, group exercises, and elaborate case analysis. As mentioned above, this program embraces learning-by-doing, so it includes a lot of hands-on training with Excel and data visualization for analysis.     Program Benefits:       Understand how analytical techniques can enhance decision making    Learn how to convert data to information and insights    Develop necessary toolkits to become an accomplished empirical analyst    Translate conceptual understanding into operational plans      This program is eligible for Continuing Professional Education Credits (CPE).

If you realize the bus service in your neighborhood is only half as good as across town, for instance, you can make some noise about that.&quot; \u2014Steven Koonin, Director of CUSP                                     UPCOMING EXECUTIVE EDUCATION PROGRAMS                                                                CUSP is a unique public-private research center that uses New York City as its laboratory and classroom to help cities around the world become more productive, livable, equitable, and resilient.
