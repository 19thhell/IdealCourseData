Professional and school leadership positions continue to be a strong point as Geeta Menon continues in her position as Dean of the Undergraduate College, and Joel Steckel continues as Vice Dean of Doctoral Education. On the programmatic front, our courses and specializations in Entertainment, Media and Technology (EMT ), Luxury and Retail, and Digital Marketing continue to attract MBA and Undergraduate students.    Stern faculty research is frequently featured in The Wall Street Journal , Time , NPR , The New York Times , and other prestigious media outlets.    We are justifiably proud of our doctoral program, as it is one of the best in the world. Our placement record continues to be superb, and we are fortunate to have a strong current group of students. Over the last two years, we have placed students at Harvard Business School, Dartmouth's Tuck School of Business, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, and The Chinese Europe International Business School.
