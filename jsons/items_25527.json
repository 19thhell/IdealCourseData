The candidacy examination has two parts -- a three-hour written comprehensive and a two-hour oral session. The written part focuses on the basic literature covering modernization theory, cultural identity, nationalism, globalization, and socialization. The oral examination focuses on the major field of specialization in International Education (Global Education, International Development Education, or Cross Cultural Exchange and Training) and the area studies concentration. Students must also demonstrate competence in one of the following academic disciplines: anthropology, economics, history, philosophy, politics, or sociology. Students can use electives in their specialized field of international education and in their area studies concentration to satisfy this requirement. The oral examination is conducted by three professors, at least one of whom must be a specialist in the area studies concentration of the student. Prior to taking the examination each student must submit for approval a list of books for each part of the examination.    VIII. Specialized Research Methods (6-12 credits)    Students should develop competence in the research methods that they will use in their dissertation research. They should consult their advisor or dissertation chair in determining what methodological courses they need. Listed below are recommended courses offered by the Department of the Humanities and the Social Sciences.

Non-credit Specialization Requirement    All students are required to pass a language examination related to the area studies in which she/he is concentrating.    X. Dissertation Committee    When a student has successfully completed the candidacy examination and has chosen a topic for research she/he will form a sponsoring committee by inviting three faculty members to supervise the writing of the dissertation. The chairperson must be selected from the full time faculty of the International Education program unless there is a compelling reason for another choice. At least one committee member must come from outside the International Education Program. In most cases at least one of the members of the committee is a specialist in the country or region in which the student has conducted his research. While preparing the dissertation students must enroll in a 1 credit course, HMSS-GE 3004, Dissertation Seminar III, to maintain matriculation; credits accumulated in this seminar do not count towards the completion of the degree.    XI. Final Oral Defense    After submitting the dissertation each student will defend the document before an examining commission of five faculty including the three sponsoring professors and two outside readers. The defense may include general areas of knowledge in the student's field of specialization as well as specific questions on the dissertation itself.    Total Credits    In general most students will be required to take at least 54 credits above the masters degree to fulfill the course work for the degree. In certain cases, the course requirements may be lowered if the student has taken the M.A. in International Education at NYU, or relevant graduate courses at other institutions within the last ten years, which have not been counted toward another degree.

Dissertation Committee    When a student has successfully completed the candidacy examination and has chosen a topic for research she/he will form a sponsoring committee by inviting three faculty members to supervise the writing of the dissertation. The chairperson must be selected from the full time faculty of the International Education program unless there is a compelling reason for another choice. At least one committee member must come from outside the International Education Program. In most cases at least one of the members of the committee is a specialist in the country or region in which the student has conducted his research. While preparing the dissertation students must enroll in a 1 credit course, HMSS-GE 3004, Dissertation Seminar III, to maintain matriculation; credits accumulated in this seminar do not count towards the completion of the degree.    XI. Final Oral Defense    After submitting the dissertation each student will defend the document before an examining commission of five faculty including the three sponsoring professors and two outside readers. The defense may include general areas of knowledge in the student's field of specialization as well as specific questions on the dissertation itself.    Total Credits    In general most students will be required to take at least 54 credits above the masters degree to fulfill the course work for the degree. In certain cases, the course requirements may be lowered if the student has taken the M.A. in International Education at NYU, or relevant graduate courses at other institutions within the last ten years, which have not been counted toward another degree.
