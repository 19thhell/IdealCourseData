The Intel Science Talent Search (Intel STS) is the nation's most prestigious pre-college science competition. This year, Intel STS chose its finalists from 1,839 applicants from around the US. The CGSB-associated students are:   Angela Fan (Stuyvesant High School, NYC), who worked in the plant genomics and systems biology laboratory of Professor Gloria Coruzzi, studied root nutrient foraging. She applied a morphometric approach to quantifying the developmental plasticity space of different ecotypes of the model plant species Arabidopsis thaliana in laboratory and natural environments.   Mimi Yen (Stuyvesant High School), who worked in the evolutionary genomics laboratory of Assistant Professor Matt Rockman, focused on characterizing the behavior and genetics of head plugging in the model nematode C. elegans, a worm and the first animal species whose genome was completely sequenced, making it a model organism for studying genetics.   All finalists will now go to Washington, DC in March to undergo final judging, display their work to the public, meet with notable scientists, and compete for the top award of $100,000.   Previously, three other area high school students working with CGSB faculty were among the 300 selected as semifinalists. They were:   Rebecca Alford (Commack High School, Long Island), who worked in the computational biology group of Associate Professor Richard Bonneau, examined a novel structure-based approach to predicting the functional effects of mutations in membrane proteins using computational approaches.   Ian Grant (Stuyvesant High School), who worked in the bacterial genomics laboratory of Associate Professor Patrick Eichenberger, conducted a project that included the characterization of spore kinases in the bacterial species Bacillus subtilis.   Benjamin Loffredo (The Fieldston School, Bronx), who worked with Projessor John Jost of the Social Psychology department on the direct and carry-over justification of global and local systems in response to system threats.     Each semifinalist received a $1,000 award from the Intel Foundation with an additional $1,000 going to his or her school.   Previous STS winners have gone on to capture more than 100 of the world's most distinguished science and math honors, including seven Nobel Prizes and four National Medals of Science.

Intel is pleased to contribute to and support these efforts.&rdquo;   Last year, Intel Corporation awarded the NYU Polytechnic School of Engineering funding for research in wireless communications as part of a collaborative project involving Rappaport and a team of professors at the University of Southern California and Princeton University. The award was made through Intel&rsquo;s highly competitive &ldquo;5G&rdquo; university research program (Intel Strategic Research Alliance on 5G), which selected outstanding proposals from university researchers competing from around the world.   Intel becomes the latest major international technology firm to join NYU WIRELESS as an affiliate sponsor. Additional sponsors include L-3 Communications, National Instruments, Nokia Solutions and Networks, Qualcomm Technologies, and Samsung. Each industrial affiliate company assigns two board members to the research center&rsquo;s industrial affiliates board, ensuring an unusually deep working relationship. These directors inform the faculty and students about what is important to the industry, and the academics bring new ideas to their corporate thinking. Sponsors get early access to NYU WIRELESS research and often work with students and faculty on directed research projects. The sponsors also frequently hire NYU School of Engineering students into positions of technical leadership.     The NYU Polytechnic School of Engineering dates to 1854, when the NYU School of Civil Engineering and Architecture as well as the Brooklyn Collegiate and Polytechnic Institute (widely known as Brooklyn Poly) were founded. Their successor institutions merged in January 2014 to create a comprehensive school of education and research in engineering and applied sciences, rooted in a tradition of invention, innovation and entrepreneurship. In addition to programs at its main campus in downtown Brooklyn, it is closely connected to engineering programs in NYU Abu Dhabi and NYU Shanghai, and it operates business incubators in downtown Manhattan and Brooklyn.

The Intel Science Talent Search (Intel STS) is the nation's most prestigious pre-college science competition. This year, Intel STS chose its finalists from 1,839 applicants from around the US. The CGSB-associated students are:   Angela Fan (Stuyvesant High School, NYC), who worked in the plant genomics and systems biology laboratory of Professor Gloria Coruzzi, studied root nutrient foraging. She applied a morphometric approach to quantifying the developmental plasticity space of different ecotypes of the model plant species Arabidopsis thaliana in laboratory and natural environments.   Mimi Yen (Stuyvesant High School), who worked in the evolutionary genomics laboratory of Assistant Professor Matt Rockman, focused on characterizing the behavior and genetics of head plugging in the model nematode C. elegans, a worm and the first animal species whose genome was completely sequenced, making it a model organism for studying genetics.   All finalists will now go to Washington, DC in March to undergo final judging, display their work to the public, meet with notable scientists, and compete for the top award of $100,000.   Previously, three other area high school students working with CGSB faculty were among the 300 selected as semifinalists. They were:   Rebecca Alford (Commack High School, Long Island), who worked in the computational biology group of Associate Professor Richard Bonneau, examined a novel structure-based approach to predicting the functional effects of mutations in membrane proteins using computational approaches.   Ian Grant (Stuyvesant High School), who worked in the bacterial genomics laboratory of Associate Professor Patrick Eichenberger, conducted a project that included the characterization of spore kinases in the bacterial species Bacillus subtilis.   Benjamin Loffredo (The Fieldston School, Bronx), who worked with Projessor John Jost of the Social Psychology department on the direct and carry-over justification of global and local systems in response to system threats.     Each semifinalist received a $1,000 award from the Intel Foundation with an additional $1,000 going to his or her school.   Previous STS winners have gone on to capture more than 100 of the world's most distinguished science and math honors, including seven Nobel Prizes and four National Medals of Science.
