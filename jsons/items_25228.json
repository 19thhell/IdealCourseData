NYU COMMON APPLICATION: All applicants must complete New York University's Application for Undergraduate Admission and provide the required academic documentation and supporting credentials. The application may be obtained from the NYU Undergraduate Admissions web site . Deadlines for portfolio submission are scheduled according to the NYU undergraduate application deadlines: November 1st for Early Decision Applicants January 1st for Early Decision II Applicants\u2028 January 1st for Regular Decision Applicants \u2028March 1st for Internal Transfer Applicants \u2028April 1st for Non-NYU Transfer Applicants.  Creative materials will only be accepted through tischphoto.slideroom.com . Portfolio Requirements for Fall 2015 Applicants. I) PORTFOLIO: Submit 15 -20 images via SlideRoom.com 10 images should be on a single theme. Title or caption each of your images. Include a brief description with the medium/format (analog, digital, etc.) and indicate which 10 images are within the single theme. You will be asked to explain your chosen series in your written statement. Sequence your work to effectively communicate your ideas. Your portfolio should be a cohesive body of work that reveals your passion, effort, and most importantly your point of view. We look for diversity in student thinking, experience, and media presentation. Effective development of meaningful content is of particular importance. The portfolio assignment requests images on a single theme, but this should not limit you to submitting work from a single photo shoot or a single roll of film. Take time to review our suggestions for generating portfolio content and consider the myriad ways you can approach your selected theme. We accept submission of new and interactive media based work, sound and video art. You may include up to 5 non-photo based images (fine art, drawing, etc.), but if you choose to do so, you must submit a total of 20 images.  Tips For Developing a Portfolio (for New York University)  Avoid compiling a disjointed group of images that are intended to be considered individually. A large variety of photographs that show a sampling of every genre and technique often appear incoherent or lacking in vision. When selecting the content for your portfolio, include images that expand on the same theme (or a series of themes and ideas) rather than images that are thematically unrelated. Sequence your work so that the images flow and relate to one another in a thematic and visual way Consider what the work tells the viewer about you. The Department of Photography &amp; Imaging does not have access to your common application and will never get to read your personal essay. How you can convey this information visually? Your portfolio is an opportunity to share your opinions, passion for ideas, and personal vision of the world with your viewer.  Suggestions for Generating Portfolio Content Create from your passion and embrace the fact that personal passion is subjective. You may find inspiration exploring something you absolutely love or you may feel driven to create work in response to something you find unjust, unpleasant or reprehensible. Any theme can be worthy of exploration. Show us what evokes your excitement to create images.  For inspiration, see photography/art exhibitions, and movies. Read literature, poetry. In short, seek out media that excites your creativity. Try to understand what makes this work engaging and coherent. Keep a journal of ideas for image-making Ask yourself what elements to add to the images so that other possibilities can be explored and developed, expanding the boundaries of your idea. Ask others for critical feedback Accept critical feedback  II) SHORT ESSAYS: Four responses, 100 words or less per question, to the following: 1. Introduce yourself.  You may write something or include the link to a video of 30 seconds or less. 2. Statement Write a brief statement about your submitted work. Discuss the primary issue that you want to discuss in your images and include what drives you to make your work. Please also explain your response to the assignment. 3. Describe a photograph or photographer that you consistently return to view and explain how this photograph or image engages you. 4. In your opinion, what does it mean to make photo/image-based art in the 21st Century? III) QUESTIONNAIRE: List the photography, digital imaging, art and art history courses, if any, that you have taken at your high school and/or college. Briefly list your photography and imaging skills. Do you have any other experience relating to your image-making work that you'd like to share? If you have a website or blog you would like to share, please include the URL. Your portfolio must be submitted through tischphoto.slideroom.com .

                                                                    \u00a9Yasser Alwan                                  Akkasah, the Center for Photography at NYU Abu Dhabi, explores the histories and contemporary practices of photography in the Arab world from comparative perspectives: it fosters the scholarly study of these histories and practices in dialogue with other photographic cultures and traditions from around the world. Through a range of activities, the center also supports the developing photographic culture in the UAE.   Photographers were working in the Middle East very soon after the invention of photography in the mid-nineteenth century. But despite the fact that there are rich traditions of documentary, art and vernacular photography throughout the Middle East and North Africa, these traditions have yet to receive the full critical attention they deserve.   The Arabian Peninsula is a crossroads where the peoples, arts, cultures and economies of Asia, Africa and Europe have encountered each other for centuries. Today the Gulf is cosmopolitan in a truly global sense. Abu Dhabi\u2019s embrace of this history is most clearly manifested in its ambitious plans to build three major museums (the Zayed National Museum, the Louvre Abu Dhabi, and the Guggenheim Abu Dhabi) dedicated to regional heritage and world art. Akkasah aims to contribute to these crossroad encounters through an ongoing program of conferences, colloquia, publications, workshops, artist residencies, and exhibitions and through the creation of a photographic archive.                             Contributiors Information     A few Details for Contributors     Akkasah will provide managed digital storage \u2013 that is, digital storage in perpetuity with forward-migration for files once their original formats become obsolete \u2013 as well as state-of-the- art physical preservation for negatives or prints in the collection.   Contributors may submit their photos for high quality scanning after which the photos will be returned or they may give the photos to the archive permanently. In either case, a copy of the scanned image for each photo will be provided to the contributor.   To make the collection useful, descriptive information about the photos (either individually or in groups) will be necessary. Contributors may provide this information themselves or work with a staff member, effectively dictating the information.   The photos will be presented as separate collections, each with its own name and details about its origin. All of the collections will be aggregated in the main website for the Archive and will be accessible to the public.   Should a contributor want to provide photos to be made available publicly only at a later date, the possibility could be discussed with the Project Director.   Intellectual property rights for the photos will remain with the photographer unless specific arrangements are made to transfer the rights to NYU Abu Dhabi. The use of the photos will be governed by a memorandum of agreement composed for each collection.                                                         Conferences and Colloquia     Akkasah plans to host a conference or a smaller colloquium of international scholars each year. These gatherings are intended to encourage and develop new scholarly research. They will address topics either directly related or of broad relevance to photography in the Arab world. The organizers of each conference or colloquium will seek publication for a selection of the papers presented.                                                   Exhibitions     Occasional exhibitions of both historical and contemporary works will be held at New York University Abu Dhabi\u2019s public gallery at the University\u2019s new campus on Saadiyat Island.

From the Akkasah archives: The Yasser Alwan Collection                                                                         Archive   Akkasah aims to establish a photographic collection at NYU Abu Dhabi drawn from the Arab world and with a special focus on histories of the UAE. Photography has an especially important role to play in recording the rapid transformation and social diversity of the UAE. There are many collections of photographs, private and corporate, Emirati and non-Emirati, that provide invaluable insights into the UAE\u2019s past. Akkasah will seek to preserve such collections (in either digital or analog form), create for them narrative contexts based on oral interviews and historical research, and make them available via a website for scholarly and general consultation. Akkasah also intends to commission new work. The archive is governed by the scholarly and ethical codes that define the educational mission of the University; the advanced technical resources and professional expertise of both New York University and New York University Abu Dhabi are at the disposal of the archive.
