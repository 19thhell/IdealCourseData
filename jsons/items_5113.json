To achieve this, the class will delve into the methods, objectives, and technical aspects of post-production. It will thoroughly explore the two major editing programs (Avid and Final Cut Pro) used in today\u2019s digital postproduction environment, and acquaint the student with every stage of the editing workflow from capture to final output.    With Final Cut Pro, students will be given a more in-depth look into the program, as well as teach and reinforce the professional standards and practices that are necessary when editing with the program. With Avid, the software will be learned in an environment that compares and contrasts it with FCP to give the user a better understanding of how it functions. At all points when new maneuvers are introduced, overarching similarities between systems will be noted. Students will learn to approach these and other non-linear programs as variations on common themes rather than as completely new and foreign tools.    In addition, the class will present examples of edited sequences from both narrative and documentary films for discussion, and have invited guests who will share their experiences in bringing films to completion.    Good editing is crucial to the success of every film &amp; video. This course is recommended to any student, from Sophomore to Senior, who would like to gain a clearer understanding of the role of the editor as an artist, a technician, and a collaborator, along with a foundation in the software platforms in use by professional editors today. This class is also recommended to any student pursuing directing or producing who wants a better understanding of how the Post-Production work flow functions.    Enrollment is limited to 12.
