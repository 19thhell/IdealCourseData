Writing Fashion in Early Modern Italy emphasizes the centrality of Italian literature and culture for understanding modern theories of fashion and gauging its impact in the shaping of codes of civility and taste in Europe and the West. Using literature to uncover what has been called the \u2018animatedness of clothing,\u2019 author Eugenia Paulicelli explores the political meanings that clothing produces in public space. At the core of the book is the idea that the texts examined here act as maps that, first, pinpoint the establishment of fashion as a social institution of modernity; and, second, gauge the meaning of clothing at a personal and a political level. As well as Castiglione\u2019s The Book of the Courtier and Cesare Vecellio\u2019s The Clothing of the Renaissance World, the author looks at works by Italian writers whose books are not yet available in English translation, such as those by Giacomo Franco, Arcangela Tarabotti, and Agostino Lampugnani. Paying particular attention to literature and the relevance of clothing in the shaping of codes of civility and style, this volume complements the existing and important works on Italian fashion and material culture in the Renaissance. It makes the case for the centrality of Italian literature and the interconnectedness of texts from a variety of genres for an understanding of the history of Italian style, and serves to contextualize the debate on dress in other European literatures.

This tradition   involves defining the actor as a source for expression and   interpretation that is at the center of dramatic creation.    This course delves into the mask work of the commedia dell\u2019 arte in   order to liberate spontaneity, physical presence, and a sense of play.   In recreating the crude as well as the subtle roots of commedia, the   participants work toward combining popular theatre with social   commentary, stock characters with a sense of self, and the absurd with   daily dramatic life. Prerequisites: Acting I or permission of instructor. Tisch Drama majors must complete two years of studio training before attending. Acceptance to the program is by  Auditions only.   Program Curriculum ITHEA-UT 2002 8 units Instructor: Jim Calder Throughout the course, areas of specialty are developed in mask work, circus skills, scene improvisation, individual lazzi (bits and specialty acts), and the search for one\u2019s own clown work. Scene work consists of scenarios, texts, and lazzi from the 17th century, as well as the development of scenarios from present-day topics and texts. Parallel studies of the historical development of theatre and the visual arts in 17th-century Italy and how they influenced each other are integrated with the studio work, creating a larger perspective of the development of European theatre. The course involves students in the local festivals and carnivals and integrates mask makers and specialists from both Italy and Switzerland as it juxtaposes European styles of theatre with American sensibilities.
