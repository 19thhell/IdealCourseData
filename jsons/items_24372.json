Boolean Operator       Search Example       Retrieves             AND     A good way to limit/refine your search.   Decreases your results.       rivers AND salinity     Retrieves articles that contain both the words river and salinity.                 OR     A good way to expand your search   Useful if you have synonyms that you would like to search for.   Increases your results.           fruit OR vegetables       Returns articles that contain either the word fruits or vegetables .           Not     A good way to limit your search   Allows you to exclude terms from your search results       fruit NOT apples   Returns articles that contain the word fruits but do not contain the word apples .             Advanced Boolean: Putting It All Together   In the above examples, we showed the use of boolean operators with 2 search terms; however, you can join any number of terms with boolean operators.   Parentheses! In the examples below, you'll notice that we use parentheses to group search terms and operators. The parentheses tell the search engine how to read your search statement. Remember when you learned about order of operations in math and using parentheses? Same concept.           Search Example       Retrieves           Europe AND dairy products AND export   Articles that contain all of the following words: dairy products, Europe, and export.         canoeing AND (kayaking OR sculling)   Articles that contain the both of the words canoeing and sculling ; also brings back articles that contain both of the words canoeing and kayaking.         South America AND (puma OR panther) NOT Brazil   Articles that contain the terms South America and Puma ; articles that contain the terms South America and Panther . Will not bring back articles with the term Brazil .                   Comments (0)                                         Advanced Searching Techniques                 Most databases support these techniques, but sometimes the syntax or symbol used varies. If in doubt, check the Help section of the database.           Search Technique       Symbol       Example       Retrieves           Phrase Searching   Useful when you have a string of words that must appear next to each other in your search statement.       Most search engines use quotation marks around phrases.   &ldquo;mad cow disease&rdquo;   Articles where the exact phrase \"mad cow disease\" is present.         Truncation   Allows you to search for variant endings of a word. Remember that when you search, the database is looking for an exact match for your term so using truncation can increase the flexibility of your search.        Most databases use the asterisk however, some use a different symbol. Most notably, LexisNexis uses the exclamation point.   parent*   Articles with any of the following words: parent, parents, parenting, parental         Wildcards   Allows you to search for different variants of a word where the difference may be within the word as opposed to at the end of the word. This technique is most useful when searching for plurals that do not use an \"s\" (ex. woman vs. women) or when searching for articles in which there may be slightly different British spelling (ex. color vs. colour)       Some databases use the asterisk ; others use the question mark . Check the help section to determine which symbol is use.   wom*n   Articles that contain either the word woman or women.

Plagiarism (pronounced: play -juh-riz-um) is the act of taking someone else&rsquo;s words, ideas, or information and passing them off as your own. If you don&rsquo;t give credit to the author of these ideas in footnotes or endnotes and a bibliography, you are committing plagiarism, which is a serious academic offense.    Everything you find that is written, whether in print in books and journals, or on the web, should be considered copyrighted . That means that you should think of it as belonging to someone else. Information that you find on the web is not free to take or use &ndash; it is someone else&rsquo;s intellectual property . Any material lifted from an original source, including web resources, without proper acknowledgement or credit is considered plagiarized. Inadvertent or accidental plagiarism is still plagiarism. Plagiarism can inadvertently happen if you are not careful about taking notes while you research; it is sometimes difficult to remember exactly where your ideas came from when you are doing research, so remember to cite your sources while you work.   It is your responsibility to know what constitutes plagiarism. Not knowing citation standards is not an excuse. When in doubt, err on the side of over-documentation and cite the source. You can also ask your professor, teaching assistant, or a librarian for help in determining what is and is not plagiarism.

When you are writing a paper, you must cite your sources in order to:     avoid plagiarism   acknowledge the author of ideas and words other than your own   enable readers of your paper to re-locate your source     If you need writing help, the Academic Resource Center is an excellent resource for NYU students.           Comments (0)                                         How Do I Cite My Sources Properly?                     Academic or scholarly work requires a bibliography, which may also be referred to as a works cited page, a citations list, or a reference list . Below are two examples of formatted citations.   A complete list of examples in APA, MLA, and other styles is found on the library's Bibliographic and Footnote Style Guide .                   Reference Type     A sample citation in APA format:    In-Text Citation        Book with one author                       Batavia , M. (2006).

Use the ideas of others to reinforce your own argument, and give the original author credit by citing the source.       Keep track of complete citation information whenever you take notes and while you are writing your paper. Unintentional plagiarism can result from sloppy research or from careless \"cutting and pasting\" of online sources.       Make it a habit to regularly use EasyBib to keep track of every source you find. Better yet, learn how to use RefWorks to not only format your citations but also provide you with an online file cabinet of your research sources.       Any words, ideas, opinions, or original research that are not your own must be cited. This is true whether you copy material word-for-word or if you summarize a passage and change a few words around. Use quotation marks when you directly state another person's words.           Common knowledge, established facts, and well-known proverbs do not need to be cited. None of these sentences needs a citation:     Albany is the capital of New York.   Water freezes at 32 degrees Fahrenheit.   Look before you leap.

Boolean Operator       Search Example       Retrieves             AND     A good way to limit/refine your search.   Decreases your results.       rivers AND salinity     Retrieves articles that contain both the words river and salinity.                 OR     A good way to expand your search   Useful if you have synonyms that you would like to search for.   Increases your results.           fruit OR vegetables       Returns articles that contain either the word fruits or vegetables .           Not     A good way to limit your search   Allows you to exclude terms from your search results       fruit NOT apples   Returns articles that contain the word fruits but do not contain the word apples .             Advanced Boolean: Putting It All Together   In the above examples, we showed the use of boolean operators with 2 search terms; however, you can join any number of terms with boolean operators.   Parentheses! In the examples below, you'll notice that we use parentheses to group search terms and operators. The parentheses tell the search engine how to read your search statement. Remember when you learned about order of operations in math and using parentheses? Same concept.           Search Example       Retrieves           Europe AND dairy products AND export   Articles that contain all of the following words: dairy products, Europe, and export.         canoeing AND (kayaking OR sculling)   Articles that contain the both of the words canoeing and sculling ; also brings back articles that contain both of the words canoeing and kayaking.         South America AND (puma OR panther) NOT Brazil   Articles that contain the terms South America and Puma ; articles that contain the terms South America and Panther . Will not bring back articles with the term Brazil .                   Comments (0)                                         Advanced Searching Techniques                 Most databases support these techniques, but sometimes the syntax or symbol used varies. If in doubt, check the Help section of the database.           Search Technique       Symbol       Example       Retrieves           Phrase Searching   Useful when you have a string of words that must appear next to each other in your search statement.       Most search engines use quotation marks around phrases.   &ldquo;mad cow disease&rdquo;   Articles where the exact phrase \"mad cow disease\" is present.         Truncation   Allows you to search for variant endings of a word. Remember that when you search, the database is looking for an exact match for your term so using truncation can increase the flexibility of your search.        Most databases use the asterisk however, some use a different symbol. Most notably, LexisNexis uses the exclamation point.   parent*   Articles with any of the following words: parent, parents, parenting, parental         Wildcards   Allows you to search for different variants of a word where the difference may be within the word as opposed to at the end of the word. This technique is most useful when searching for plurals that do not use an \"s\" (ex. woman vs. women) or when searching for articles in which there may be slightly different British spelling (ex. color vs. colour)       Some databases use the asterisk ; others use the question mark . Check the help section to determine which symbol is use.   wom*n   Articles that contain either the word woman or women.

Plagiarism (pronounced: play -juh-riz-um) is the act of taking someone else&rsquo;s words, ideas, or information and passing them off as your own. If you don&rsquo;t give credit to the author of these ideas in footnotes or endnotes and a bibliography, you are committing plagiarism, which is a serious academic offense.    Everything you find that is written, whether in print in books and journals, or on the web, should be considered copyrighted . That means that you should think of it as belonging to someone else. Information that you find on the web is not free to take or use &ndash; it is someone else&rsquo;s intellectual property . Any material lifted from an original source, including web resources, without proper acknowledgement or credit is considered plagiarized. Inadvertent or accidental plagiarism is still plagiarism. Plagiarism can inadvertently happen if you are not careful about taking notes while you research; it is sometimes difficult to remember exactly where your ideas came from when you are doing research, so remember to cite your sources while you work.   It is your responsibility to know what constitutes plagiarism. Not knowing citation standards is not an excuse. When in doubt, err on the side of over-documentation and cite the source. You can also ask your professor, teaching assistant, or a librarian for help in determining what is and is not plagiarism.

When you are writing a paper, you must cite your sources in order to:     avoid plagiarism   acknowledge the author of ideas and words other than your own   enable readers of your paper to re-locate your source     If you need writing help, the Academic Resource Center is an excellent resource for NYU students.

Academic or scholarly work requires a bibliography, which may also be referred to as a works cited page, a citations list, or a reference list . Below are two examples of formatted citations.   A complete list of examples in APA, MLA, and other styles is found on the library's Bibliographic and Footnote Style Guide .                   Reference Type     A sample citation in APA format:    In-Text Citation        Book with one author                       Batavia , M. (2006).

Use the ideas of others to reinforce your own argument, and give the original author credit by citing the source.       Keep track of complete citation information whenever you take notes and while you are writing your paper. Unintentional plagiarism can result from sloppy research or from careless \"cutting and pasting\" of online sources.       Make it a habit to regularly use EasyBib to keep track of every source you find. Better yet, learn how to use RefWorks to not only format your citations but also provide you with an online file cabinet of your research sources.       Any words, ideas, opinions, or original research that are not your own must be cited. This is true whether you copy material word-for-word or if you summarize a passage and change a few words around. Use quotation marks when you directly state another person's words.           Common knowledge, established facts, and well-known proverbs do not need to be cited. None of these sentences needs a citation:     Albany is the capital of New York.   Water freezes at 32 degrees Fahrenheit.   Look before you leap.

Boolean Operator       Search Example       Retrieves             AND     A good way to limit/refine your search.   Decreases your results.       rivers AND salinity     Retrieves articles that contain both the words river and salinity.                 OR     A good way to expand your search   Useful if you have synonyms that you would like to search for.   Increases your results.           fruit OR vegetables       Returns articles that contain either the word fruits or vegetables .           Not     A good way to limit your search   Allows you to exclude terms from your search results       fruit NOT apples   Returns articles that contain the word fruits but do not contain the word apples .             Advanced Boolean: Putting It All Together   In the above examples, we showed the use of boolean operators with 2 search terms; however, you can join any number of terms with boolean operators.   Parentheses! In the examples below, you'll notice that we use parentheses to group search terms and operators. The parentheses tell the search engine how to read your search statement. Remember when you learned about order of operations in math and using parentheses? Same concept.           Search Example       Retrieves           Europe AND dairy products AND export   Articles that contain all of the following words: dairy products, Europe, and export.         canoeing AND (kayaking OR sculling)   Articles that contain the both of the words canoeing and sculling ; also brings back articles that contain both of the words canoeing and kayaking.         South America AND (puma OR panther) NOT Brazil   Articles that contain the terms South America and Puma ; articles that contain the terms South America and Panther . Will not bring back articles with the term Brazil .                   Comments (0)                                         Advanced Searching Techniques                 Most databases support these techniques, but sometimes the syntax or symbol used varies. If in doubt, check the Help section of the database.           Search Technique       Symbol       Example       Retrieves           Phrase Searching   Useful when you have a string of words that must appear next to each other in your search statement.       Most search engines use quotation marks around phrases.   &ldquo;mad cow disease&rdquo;   Articles where the exact phrase \"mad cow disease\" is present.         Truncation   Allows you to search for variant endings of a word. Remember that when you search, the database is looking for an exact match for your term so using truncation can increase the flexibility of your search.        Most databases use the asterisk however, some use a different symbol. Most notably, LexisNexis uses the exclamation point.   parent*   Articles with any of the following words: parent, parents, parenting, parental         Wildcards   Allows you to search for different variants of a word where the difference may be within the word as opposed to at the end of the word. This technique is most useful when searching for plurals that do not use an \"s\" (ex. woman vs. women) or when searching for articles in which there may be slightly different British spelling (ex. color vs. colour)       Some databases use the asterisk ; others use the question mark . Check the help section to determine which symbol is use.   wom*n   Articles that contain either the word woman or women.

Plagiarism (pronounced: play -juh-riz-um) is the act of taking someone else&rsquo;s words, ideas, or information and passing them off as your own. If you don&rsquo;t give credit to the author of these ideas in footnotes or endnotes and a bibliography, you are committing plagiarism, which is a serious academic offense.    Everything you find that is written, whether in print in books and journals, or on the web, should be considered copyrighted . That means that you should think of it as belonging to someone else. Information that you find on the web is not free to take or use &ndash; it is someone else&rsquo;s intellectual property . Any material lifted from an original source, including web resources, without proper acknowledgement or credit is considered plagiarized. Inadvertent or accidental plagiarism is still plagiarism. Plagiarism can inadvertently happen if you are not careful about taking notes while you research; it is sometimes difficult to remember exactly where your ideas came from when you are doing research, so remember to cite your sources while you work.   It is your responsibility to know what constitutes plagiarism. Not knowing citation standards is not an excuse. When in doubt, err on the side of over-documentation and cite the source. You can also ask your professor, teaching assistant, or a librarian for help in determining what is and is not plagiarism.

When you are writing a paper, you must cite your sources in order to:     avoid plagiarism   acknowledge the author of ideas and words other than your own   enable readers of your paper to re-locate your source     If you need writing help, the Academic Resource Center is an excellent resource for NYU students.           Comments (0)                                         How Do I Cite My Sources Properly?                     Academic or scholarly work requires a bibliography, which may also be referred to as a works cited page, a citations list, or a reference list . Below are two examples of formatted citations.   A complete list of examples in APA, MLA, and other styles is found on the library's Bibliographic and Footnote Style Guide .

Use the ideas of others to reinforce your own argument, and give the original author credit by citing the source.       Keep track of complete citation information whenever you take notes and while you are writing your paper. Unintentional plagiarism can result from sloppy research or from careless \"cutting and pasting\" of online sources.       Make it a habit to regularly use EasyBib to keep track of every source you find. Better yet, learn how to use RefWorks to not only format your citations but also provide you with an online file cabinet of your research sources.       Any words, ideas, opinions, or original research that are not your own must be cited. This is true whether you copy material word-for-word or if you summarize a passage and change a few words around. Use quotation marks when you directly state another person's words.           Common knowledge, established facts, and well-known proverbs do not need to be cited. None of these sentences needs a citation:     Albany is the capital of New York.   Water freezes at 32 degrees Fahrenheit.   Look before you leap.
