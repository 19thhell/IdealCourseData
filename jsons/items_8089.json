Nine out of ten accidents happen at intersections . 89% of all major bike accidents occurred within 25 feet of an intersection.    You&#8217;re five times more likely to get hurt riding on major roads . 52% of all serious accidents occurred on arterial roads (boulevards and avenues) which comprise just 10% of the city&#8217;s road stock.    Big trucks are big problems . 32% of all major bike accidents involved a large truck or bus, despite such vehicles comprising a mere 5 to 17% of vehicles on the roadway at any given time.    Almost all accidents are the result of human error . 95% of crashes with documented factors were the result of human error, such as inattention or disregard of traffic controls. Environmental factors, such as obstruction, glare, and slippery pavement, accounted for 3% of contributing factors.    Parks, pedestrians, and bikes don&#8217;t mix . 36% of serious collisions with pedestrians occurred around the perimeters of parks.    Show some respect; watch out for your elders . 73% of pedestrians struck were age 60 or older.      Wow, that&#8217;s a lot of compelling data. What can I do to be safe?    Always look both ways, even when crossing one-way streets . 7% of cars run red lights. Green does not always mean go. Use your eyes to scan the intersection for oncoming traffic every time. You never know when a quick glance will keep you from colliding with a delivery cyclist riding counter to the flow of traffic.    Wear a sexy helmet . The 3% of the time when environmental factors intervene to cause an accident, you&#8217;ll wish you had a helmet. A whopping 73% of accidents involve head trauma of some sort.    Stop at reds, enjoy life around you . You&#8217;ll avoid the chance of a $190 fine while gaining the chance to score a date with the biker next to you, strike up a fulfilling conversation, or see the most awesome bank heist ever. You&#8217;ll also develop a good image for bicyclists citywide.    When stopping, line up prominently at the light and keep the crosswalk clear. If you pull ahead of the crosswalk to wait for the light, make sure your rear wheel is not in the way of pedestrians.    No bike lane? Drive your bike like you would a car . If a bike lane is absent or obstructed on the block, claim a lane of traffic. It&#8217;s your right as a vehicle in New York City to take a full lane of traffic while riding.    Don&#8217;t be a salmon; ride with the flow of traffic . You&#8217;ll get to your destination legally and more quickly than riding upstream against oncoming cars.    Ride on the driver&#8217;s side when on one-way side streets . It will increase your visibility to drivers and give them a better sense of how much room they need to pass safely.    Doors are no fun, keep away from them . Keep four feet between you when riding along parked cars. You&#8217;ll also avoid jaywalkers.    Ride predictably and keep a presence . Don&#8217;t weave in and out of traffic or slalom around stopped cars. Take a straight line and stay visible. When changing lanes or merging, check your blind spot behind you and throw out a hand signal to let drivers know your intentions.    Keep your peripherals around pedestrians . Keep your peripherals on greenways and cycle tracks. Pedestrians adjacent to the lane sometimes step into bike traffic without looking and cause both rider and walker headaches.    How to perform the safest left turn : Proceed through the light to the opposite corner of the intersection and wait for the green light going the other way. (If heading north, wait at the northeast corner for the westbound light.) This is called a &#8220;Copenhagen left.&#8221;    If confused, just &#8220;drive your bike.&#8221; Remembering all the details can be tough and overwhelming. When in doubt, think about what you&#8217;d do if you were &#8220;driving&#8221; your bike. It all comes down to being as predictable, courteous, and present in mind and body as possible.    Unsure what it means to drive your bike? Watch this sexy 50&#8217;s PSA!                      Unless otherwise noted, all content copyright New York University. All rights reserved.

Ride on the driver&#8217;s side when on one-way side streets . It will increase your visibility to drivers and give them a better sense of how much room they need to pass safely.    Doors are no fun, keep away from them . Keep four feet between you when riding along parked cars. You&#8217;ll also avoid jaywalkers.    Ride predictably and keep a presence . Don&#8217;t weave in and out of traffic or slalom around stopped cars. Take a straight line and stay visible. When changing lanes or merging, check your blind spot behind you and throw out a hand signal to let drivers know your intentions.    Keep your peripherals around pedestrians . Keep your peripherals on greenways and cycle tracks. Pedestrians adjacent to the lane sometimes step into bike traffic without looking and cause both rider and walker headaches.    How to perform the safest left turn : Proceed through the light to the opposite corner of the intersection and wait for the green light going the other way. (If heading north, wait at the northeast corner for the westbound light.) This is called a &#8220;Copenhagen left.&#8221;    If confused, just &#8220;drive your bike.&#8221; Remembering all the details can be tough and overwhelming. When in doubt, think about what you&#8217;d do if you were &#8220;driving&#8221; your bike. It all comes down to being as predictable, courteous, and present in mind and body as possible.

It&#8217;s a completely new experience, and it requires being focused and on your study game 100 percent. But there is a new and different challenge that emerges in 2L: namely, learning to balance the competing demands of school and life.   During 1L, everyone is pretty much in the same boat. We&#8217;re all taking the same classes, and everyone (students, administrators, and professors included) expects your whole life to revolve around school. For me, that was a pretty joyful experience. I loved my section immensely, so going to class and seeing them every day was really fun. I also loved the material, because it was more intellectually stimulating and engaging than what I had been doing in my time between college and law school. So spending time after class discussing the issues with my section mates was actually not a chore for me; it was the highlight of my day!   We are extremely intellectual at all times   (As a quick aside to demonstrate my supreme nerdiness, I\u00a0give you the following story: when I got to Columbia University, I was devastated to find out that people didn&#8217;t actually sit in the halls of the dorms discussing the\u00a0 Iliad like the brochures said they did. But people actually DO sit in the halls of NYU Law and discuss Palsgraf , so you can imagine my general excitement when my high school dream finally came true.)   Now comes 2L, though, and the focus shifts away from school and toward work. There are a lot more commitments, ranging from journals and student organizations to clinics and internships. Everyone is rushing from one activity to the next, which makes the impromptu hallway discussions shorter and rarer. For a school-lover like myself, this is not an altogether welcome change. I miss the after-class discussions, the general single-minded focus on a shared academic experience.   Of course, there are many positives to being surrounded by people whose interests have begun to diverge. I learn a lot more about different areas of the law as my friends begin to enter them, and each meeting with my Section 5 buddies is all the more sweet for it being less ordinary. And I certainly am glad that my circle of friends ha s expanded to include people outside my section (although the flip side is that I don&#8217;t get to see friends from my section whose career interests don&#8217;t intersect with mine). And of course, on the practical side, it&#8217;s always good to get in the habit of balancing competing demands on your time, because that&#8217;s what will be expected of you as a lawyer in any field.\u00a0   But I still spend a few moments each week thinking fondly of the intensity of 1L, although the grass is pretty green on this side of the summer, too.
