EAST-UA 91 East Asian Art II: China , Korea, Japan from 1000 CE to Present (4 credits) Instructor: Michele Matteini Art History sponsored. Same as ARTH-UA 511. An introductory survey of the arts in China, Japan, and Korea from approximately 1000 C.E. Emphasizes an overall understanding of the development of art and culture, as well as mastery of specific works of art. East Asian Art I followed the development of the common cultural heritage of the Northeast Asia region. Part of this commonality is due to the extraordinary influence of an early-developing Chinese civilization on Japan and Korea. However, Japan and Korea also developed their own cultures and arts, developments that accelerated in the last millennia up to the present. Topics include Song landscape paintings, Edo \"floating world\" prints, Koryo celadons, and modern art.         EAST-UA 517 Problems in Contemporary China (4 credits) Instructor: Rebecca Karl Same as HIST-UA 538 This course is designed to examine intensively several major problems in contemporary China (1980s to the present). On the one hand, these problems can be seen as partially representative of China\u2019s social, economic, and intellectual transformation from a Maoist-socialist state to a quasi-capitalist one-party state, transformations that have had and continue to have far-reaching consequences for China and the world in the past three decades; on the other hand, these problems also can be seen as representative of global transformations that chronologically coincided with and helped shape the direction of China\u2019s changes, as China firmly integrated itself into global capitalism and its attendant systems of knowledge production and social formations beginning in the 1980s.      EAST-UA 519 Law &amp; Justice in Chinese Society (4 credits) Instructor: Masato Hasegawa History sponsored. Same as HIST-UA 551. As calls for government openness and transparency increase in China, the notion and application of the rule of law in Chinese society has become the subject of an intense debate both within and beyond China. This seminar aims to situate the contemporary debate over China's rule of law in a broader historical context and examines the historical processes of the production and interpretation of law in China from the pre-modern period to the modern era. Particular emphasis will be placed on assessing the manner in which the notion of justice has been defined and invoked in Chinese historical sources. The general course format combines critical reading of texts and active discussion. Readings will include both contemporary historical scholarship on law and society in China and an array of primary source materials in English or in English translation. Some background knowledge of Chinese history will be helpful, but is not required.      EAST-UA 531 Asia's Revolutions: China/India/Vietnam 1885-1962 (4 credits) Instructor: Moss Roberts Same as HIST-UA 538.                               The aim of this introductory course is to establish a framework    for modern Asian history by a comparative approach to the national    independence movements in China, India, and Vietnam, as well as    the context within which they unfolded, in the period 1885-1962,    that is, from the Sino-French War to the Sino-Indian War. We    begin with the questions: why could there be no Gandhi in China,    no Mao in India? And how does Ho Chi Minh compare to these two    figures? The course will introduce students to some of the figures in    modern Asian history who played a major role in the transition of    India and Vietnam from colonial subordination to independent    nationhood and of China from its semi-colonial status to    liberation. The principal figures whose lives and writings will be    studied and compared are Mohandas Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru, Sun    Yat-sen, Mao Zedong, and Ho Chi Minh. The course will give due    attention to other relevant figures such as M. Jinnah in the case    of India; Chiang Kai-shek in the case of China; Phan Boi Chau in    the case of Vietnam. The main focus of the course is comparing    India and China, which have separate internal dynamics and little    to do with one another until World War Two, and then become    crucially involved in the post World War Two / Cold War world. Since war together with revolution constitutes the determinative    process of this historical period, we will pay attention to the    sequence of wars after 1885: the Sino-Japanese War (1894-95), the    Russo-Japanese War (1904-05), World War One (1914-18), the    Siberian Intervention (1918-23), the invasion of Manchuria (1931),    the Resistance War of China against Japan (1937-45), World War Two    in the Pacific, the Korean War, and the Indochina Wars (up to    1962). We will also compare the internal struggle in India,    between the Hindu and Muslim communities, leading to the formation    of Pakistan in 1947, and in China between the Communists and the    Nationalists, leading to the completion of the revolution in    1949. Consideration is given to the role of Tibet as a site of    conflict between India and China, the main cause of the    Sino-Indian War of 1962.      EAST-UA 552 The Cold War in Asia (4 credits) Instructor: James L Peck History sponsored. Same as HIST-UA 552 This course will focus on U.S. foreign policy in Asia since 1945. The ways U.S. global interests and concerns sought to shape Asian realities (and were shaped in turn by them) will be the touchstone for examining the Cold War in Asia. We will examine the following topics: the occupation of Japan and early US global economic visions; the US and the Chinese revolution before the Korean War; the Korean War and the isolation of China; the Vietnam War and the Kennedy/Johnson years; Nixon\u2019s global geopolitical vision and his policies towards Vietnam, China, and Japan; Carter and the meaning of human rights diplomacy in Asia; Reagan and the Asian issues involved in an intensified Cold War against Russia; George H. W. Bush and Asia\u2019s place in \u201ca New World Order;\u201d and finally, the Clinton and George W. Bush years. Throughout the course, we shall examine key de-classified National Security documents, interpreting their meaning and language, while carefully assessing the arguments used to justify American policy. EAST-UA 610 Korean Modernism (4 credits) Instructor: June Hee Kwon This course explores the key debates and questions about modernity with a   focus on Colonial Korea. The concept of modernity\u2014as a particular   historical moment as well as a new thought system\u2014has emerged from the   rise of nation states, the development of capitalism,   and the growth of bodies of scientific knowledge. It indicates a   radical break from tradition, disenchantment with the religious life,   and strong belief in reason and progress. It also celebrates the newness   emerging from the interaction between the self and   the other, and an openness to the foreign and the world. This course   juxtaposes various interpretations of \u201cmodern\u201d events of colonial Korea   in conversation with theories that explicate modernity and what it means   to be modern. We will explore historiographies,   novels, and films dealing with the following themes: national ideology   and national bodies, economic and political contentions, modern   education and scientific management, class and gender formation,   capitalism and urbanization, colonial migration and cosmopolitanism,   anti-colonialism and socialist/revolutionary thought.\u200b      EAST-UA 613 Japanese Cinema (4 credits) Instructor: TBD Same as DRLIT-UA 613. This course examines Japanese cinema from its prehistory to its contemporary developments. The focus will be on the rise of Japanese subculture/popular culture in the 1980s and onward, and its long-term implications. The course is organized roughly chronologically, tracing major historical developments of Japanese popular culture, literature and film from the early modern (17-19th century) to the modern (20-21st century) period. Topics include Japanese pure film movement, genbun-itchi (unification of written-spoken language), benshi (orators), Ozu, anime (Japanese animation), \u201cthe end of literature\u201d discourse, and Japanese nouvelle-vague. This course includes screenings of film with English subtitles.      EAST-UA 710 Japan &amp; WWII in Asia (4 credits) Instructor: George S Solt History sponsored. Same as HIST-UA 710.     The course examines Japan and World War II in Asia from a variety of critical perspectives. Two themes in particular will be highlighted throughout the course. First, we will consider how imperialism and colonialism of both the Euro-American and Japanese varieties were central to the War\u2019s outbreak, conduct, and resolution. Second, we will explore various local experiences and memories of the war. These will include the experiences and memories of marginalized groups in Japan and its colonies, \u201ccomfort women,\u201d victims of war atrocities, Japanese Americans, African Americans, and Pacific Islanders. Please note that we will discuss the readings in class every week. Therefore, you must keep up with the readings and complete the weekly assignments.      EAST-UA 729 Traditional Drama China &amp; Japan (4 credits) Instructor: Moss Roberts The course will compare a set of Chinese and Japanese pre-modern dramas, mainly as literature but also as performance, by exploring the contrasts and parallels of incident, character, plot design, and theme of the two theatrical traditions. Attention will be given to the historical background of each work and to the social conditions and customs that each reflects. The cultural salience of each work is also considered. Where possible and appropriate scenes or entire plays will be screened for the class or assigned for viewing. EAST-UA 731 20th Century Chinese Literature in Translation (4 credits) Instructor: Max Bohnenkamp Realism has often been regarded as a dominant force in modern Chinese literature, but other styles of representation have also been important to Chinese literary creativity during the 20th century. This course examines the significance of three modes of literary \u201cexcess\u201d that disrupt the expectations of realism- the fantastic, the grotesque and the sublime \u2013 in the history of Chinese literature from the late-Qing dynasty to the late-20th century. While each of these modes possesses links to traditional Chinese culture, they have also provided new expressive resources for reflecting the reconfiguration of social values and human perception in China during the modern era. Focusing on close readings of fiction and some poetry, we will examine how Chinese writers have used the fantastic to transgress the boundaries of the real, employed the grotesque to expose reality\u2019s ugliness, and invoked the sublime to try to invest literature with the potential to change reality.  EAST-UA 736 Issues and Debates in Contemporary Korea (4 credits) Instructor: June Hee Kwon This course aims to understand the principles, logics, and dynamics that   have constituted the contemporary divided Korea\u2014with a particular focus   on South Korea. The postcolonial era in Korea soon led to the Korean   War and then the Cold War, which took the   two Koreas down dramatically different pathways. South Korea achieved   rapid and dramatic economic development, eventually witnessing exemplary   democratization movements emerge from the fight against dictatorial   government, class inequality, and sexual discrimination.   Despite an earlier start on economic development following its   socialist revolution, North Korea has suffered from a poor economy and a   repressive authoritarian regime. Paying attention to Cold War politics   as a major influence in creating and sustaining the   two Koreas, we explore three primary themes in the history of   contemporary Korea: 1) Nationalism, 2) Developmentalism, and 3)   Neoliberalism. The subtopics include: the Korean War and its impact,   anti-communistic nationalism and state violence, developmentalism   and democracy, class differentiation and gender formation,   multiculturalism and cosmopolitanism, urbanization and environmental   issues, youth and precarious labor, North Korea and human rights.        EAST-UA 832 Intro to Buddhism (4 credits) Instructor: Christopher Kelley Religious Studies sponsored. Same as RELST-UA 832 An introduction to this complex religion, emphasizing its history, teachings, and practices. Discusses its doctrinal development in India, then emphasizes certain local practices: Buddhism and the family in China; Buddhism, language, and hierarchy in Japan; the politics of Buddhist Tibet; and Buddhist art. Finally, the course touches on Buddhism in the United States.      EAST-UA 950 Topics in Asian Studies: The Planetary Imagination (4 credits) Instructor: Phil Kaffen The planetary has emerged a contested site across a variety of fields   from comparative literature and area studies to media studies and   philosophy. Partly marking itself off from older universalist claims   (cosmopolitanism, world history, globalization), the planetary   imagination as we will discuss it in this class foregrounds an   ecological dimension and at the same time, shifts the grounds of   human-centered thought and politics. While touching on a wide variety of   issues, including technology, scale, identity, and ethics, the core   problem for the class will be to consider \u201cthe world\u201d from a standpoint   that does not privilege the human as its center or apex. The goal of the   course is neither to immediately endorse nor repudiate a critique of   anthropocentrism, but to examine some of its diverse forms of   expression, underlying assumptions, and possible repercussions. To that   end, this class seeks to explore the planetary imagination from a   broadly (and possibly contradictory) humanities-based perspective, at   the intersection of area studies (East Asia in particular) and   comparative literature\u2014through fiction, philosophy, and contemporary   arts and media.      EAST-UA 952 Topics in Chinese Studies: Modern Chinese Drama (4 credits) Instructor: Max Bohnenkamp   China has always been home to a rich theatrical tradition, visible in such forms as Kun and Beijing operas. Yet beginning in the late-1800s, new knowledge of Western culture inspired major creative attempts to modernize the traditional theater and to introduce foreign styles of performance. While the efforts of such figures as Mei Lanfang led to the transformation of Beijing opera into China\u2019s first form of internationally- known theater, the spoken dramas of modern playwrights like Cao Yu and Tian Han offered realist plays of social critique to advance the reform of Chinese culture. Upon such foundations, drama developed into one of the most important and contested areas of artistic innovation and public engagement through China\u2019s 20th-century history of war, revolution and reform. This course examines the history of modern Chinese drama through close readings of exemplary dramatic texts, film viewings and the study of current scholarship on the topic.

EAST-UA 91 East Asian Art II: China , Korea, Japan from 1000 CE to Present (4 credits) Instructor: Michele Matteini Art History sponsored. Same as ARTH-UA 511. An introductory survey of the arts in China, Japan, and Korea from approximately 1000 C.E. Emphasizes an overall understanding of the development of art and culture, as well as mastery of specific works of art. East Asian Art I followed the development of the common cultural heritage of the Northeast Asia region. Part of this commonality is due to the extraordinary influence of an early-developing Chinese civilization on Japan and Korea. However, Japan and Korea also developed their own cultures and arts, developments that accelerated in the last millennia up to the present. Topics include Song landscape paintings, Edo \"floating world\" prints, Koryo celadons, and modern art.         EAST-UA 517 Problems in Contemporary China (4 credits) Instructor: Rebecca Karl Same as HIST-UA 538 This course is designed to examine intensively several major problems in contemporary China (1980s to the present). On the one hand, these problems can be seen as partially representative of China\u2019s social, economic, and intellectual transformation from a Maoist-socialist state to a quasi-capitalist one-party state, transformations that have had and continue to have far-reaching consequences for China and the world in the past three decades; on the other hand, these problems also can be seen as representative of global transformations that chronologically coincided with and helped shape the direction of China\u2019s changes, as China firmly integrated itself into global capitalism and its attendant systems of knowledge production and social formations beginning in the 1980s.      EAST-UA 519 Law &amp; Justice in Chinese Society (4 credits) Instructor: Masato Hasegawa History sponsored. Same as HIST-UA 551. As calls for government openness and transparency increase in China, the notion and application of the rule of law in Chinese society has become the subject of an intense debate both within and beyond China. This seminar aims to situate the contemporary debate over China's rule of law in a broader historical context and examines the historical processes of the production and interpretation of law in China from the pre-modern period to the modern era. Particular emphasis will be placed on assessing the manner in which the notion of justice has been defined and invoked in Chinese historical sources. The general course format combines critical reading of texts and active discussion. Readings will include both contemporary historical scholarship on law and society in China and an array of primary source materials in English or in English translation. Some background knowledge of Chinese history will be helpful, but is not required.      EAST-UA 531 Asia's Revolutions: China/India/Vietnam 1885-1962 (4 credits) Instructor: Moss Roberts Same as HIST-UA 538.                               The aim of this introductory course is to establish a framework    for modern Asian history by a comparative approach to the national    independence movements in China, India, and Vietnam, as well as    the context within which they unfolded, in the period 1885-1962,    that is, from the Sino-French War to the Sino-Indian War. We    begin with the questions: why could there be no Gandhi in China,    no Mao in India? And how does Ho Chi Minh compare to these two    figures? The course will introduce students to some of the figures in    modern Asian history who played a major role in the transition of    India and Vietnam from colonial subordination to independent    nationhood and of China from its semi-colonial status to    liberation. The principal figures whose lives and writings will be    studied and compared are Mohandas Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru, Sun    Yat-sen, Mao Zedong, and Ho Chi Minh. The course will give due    attention to other relevant figures such as M. Jinnah in the case    of India; Chiang Kai-shek in the case of China; Phan Boi Chau in    the case of Vietnam. The main focus of the course is comparing    India and China, which have separate internal dynamics and little    to do with one another until World War Two, and then become    crucially involved in the post World War Two / Cold War world. Since war together with revolution constitutes the determinative    process of this historical period, we will pay attention to the    sequence of wars after 1885: the Sino-Japanese War (1894-95), the    Russo-Japanese War (1904-05), World War One (1914-18), the    Siberian Intervention (1918-23), the invasion of Manchuria (1931),    the Resistance War of China against Japan (1937-45), World War Two    in the Pacific, the Korean War, and the Indochina Wars (up to    1962). We will also compare the internal struggle in India,    between the Hindu and Muslim communities, leading to the formation    of Pakistan in 1947, and in China between the Communists and the    Nationalists, leading to the completion of the revolution in    1949. Consideration is given to the role of Tibet as a site of    conflict between India and China, the main cause of the    Sino-Indian War of 1962.      EAST-UA 552 The Cold War in Asia (4 credits) Instructor: James L Peck History sponsored. Same as HIST-UA 552 This course will focus on U.S. foreign policy in Asia since 1945. The ways U.S. global interests and concerns sought to shape Asian realities (and were shaped in turn by them) will be the touchstone for examining the Cold War in Asia. We will examine the following topics: the occupation of Japan and early US global economic visions; the US and the Chinese revolution before the Korean War; the Korean War and the isolation of China; the Vietnam War and the Kennedy/Johnson years; Nixon\u2019s global geopolitical vision and his policies towards Vietnam, China, and Japan; Carter and the meaning of human rights diplomacy in Asia; Reagan and the Asian issues involved in an intensified Cold War against Russia; George H. W. Bush and Asia\u2019s place in \u201ca New World Order;\u201d and finally, the Clinton and George W. Bush years. Throughout the course, we shall examine key de-classified National Security documents, interpreting their meaning and language, while carefully assessing the arguments used to justify American policy. EAST-UA 610 Korean Modernism (4 credits) Instructor: June Hee Kwon This course explores the key debates and questions about modernity with a   focus on Colonial Korea. The concept of modernity\u2014as a particular   historical moment as well as a new thought system\u2014has emerged from the   rise of nation states, the development of capitalism,   and the growth of bodies of scientific knowledge. It indicates a   radical break from tradition, disenchantment with the religious life,   and strong belief in reason and progress. It also celebrates the newness   emerging from the interaction between the self and   the other, and an openness to the foreign and the world. This course   juxtaposes various interpretations of \u201cmodern\u201d events of colonial Korea   in conversation with theories that explicate modernity and what it means   to be modern. We will explore historiographies,   novels, and films dealing with the following themes: national ideology   and national bodies, economic and political contentions, modern   education and scientific management, class and gender formation,   capitalism and urbanization, colonial migration and cosmopolitanism,   anti-colonialism and socialist/revolutionary thought.\u200b      EAST-UA 613 Japanese Cinema (4 credits) Instructor: TBD Same as DRLIT-UA 613. This course examines Japanese cinema from its prehistory to its contemporary developments. The focus will be on the rise of Japanese subculture/popular culture in the 1980s and onward, and its long-term implications. The course is organized roughly chronologically, tracing major historical developments of Japanese popular culture, literature and film from the early modern (17-19th century) to the modern (20-21st century) period. Topics include Japanese pure film movement, genbun-itchi (unification of written-spoken language), benshi (orators), Ozu, anime (Japanese animation), \u201cthe end of literature\u201d discourse, and Japanese nouvelle-vague. This course includes screenings of film with English subtitles.      EAST-UA 710 Japan &amp; WWII in Asia (4 credits) Instructor: George S Solt History sponsored. Same as HIST-UA 710.     The course examines Japan and World War II in Asia from a variety of critical perspectives. Two themes in particular will be highlighted throughout the course. First, we will consider how imperialism and colonialism of both the Euro-American and Japanese varieties were central to the War\u2019s outbreak, conduct, and resolution. Second, we will explore various local experiences and memories of the war. These will include the experiences and memories of marginalized groups in Japan and its colonies, \u201ccomfort women,\u201d victims of war atrocities, Japanese Americans, African Americans, and Pacific Islanders. Please note that we will discuss the readings in class every week. Therefore, you must keep up with the readings and complete the weekly assignments.      EAST-UA 729 Traditional Drama China &amp; Japan (4 credits) Instructor: Moss Roberts The course will compare a set of Chinese and Japanese pre-modern dramas, mainly as literature but also as performance, by exploring the contrasts and parallels of incident, character, plot design, and theme of the two theatrical traditions. Attention will be given to the historical background of each work and to the social conditions and customs that each reflects. The cultural salience of each work is also considered. Where possible and appropriate scenes or entire plays will be screened for the class or assigned for viewing. EAST-UA 731 20th Century Chinese Literature in Translation (4 credits) Instructor: Max Bohnenkamp Realism has often been regarded as a dominant force in modern Chinese literature, but other styles of representation have also been important to Chinese literary creativity during the 20th century. This course examines the significance of three modes of literary \u201cexcess\u201d that disrupt the expectations of realism- the fantastic, the grotesque and the sublime \u2013 in the history of Chinese literature from the late-Qing dynasty to the late-20th century. While each of these modes possesses links to traditional Chinese culture, they have also provided new expressive resources for reflecting the reconfiguration of social values and human perception in China during the modern era. Focusing on close readings of fiction and some poetry, we will examine how Chinese writers have used the fantastic to transgress the boundaries of the real, employed the grotesque to expose reality\u2019s ugliness, and invoked the sublime to try to invest literature with the potential to change reality.  EAST-UA 736 Issues and Debates in Contemporary Korea (4 credits) Instructor: June Hee Kwon This course aims to understand the principles, logics, and dynamics that   have constituted the contemporary divided Korea\u2014with a particular focus   on South Korea. The postcolonial era in Korea soon led to the Korean   War and then the Cold War, which took the   two Koreas down dramatically different pathways. South Korea achieved   rapid and dramatic economic development, eventually witnessing exemplary   democratization movements emerge from the fight against dictatorial   government, class inequality, and sexual discrimination.   Despite an earlier start on economic development following its   socialist revolution, North Korea has suffered from a poor economy and a   repressive authoritarian regime. Paying attention to Cold War politics   as a major influence in creating and sustaining the   two Koreas, we explore three primary themes in the history of   contemporary Korea: 1) Nationalism, 2) Developmentalism, and 3)   Neoliberalism. The subtopics include: the Korean War and its impact,   anti-communistic nationalism and state violence, developmentalism   and democracy, class differentiation and gender formation,   multiculturalism and cosmopolitanism, urbanization and environmental   issues, youth and precarious labor, North Korea and human rights.        EAST-UA 832 Intro to Buddhism (4 credits) Instructor: Christopher Kelley Religious Studies sponsored. Same as RELST-UA 832 An introduction to this complex religion, emphasizing its history, teachings, and practices. Discusses its doctrinal development in India, then emphasizes certain local practices: Buddhism and the family in China; Buddhism, language, and hierarchy in Japan; the politics of Buddhist Tibet; and Buddhist art. Finally, the course touches on Buddhism in the United States.      EAST-UA 950 Topics in Asian Studies: The Planetary Imagination (4 credits) Instructor: Phil Kaffen The planetary has emerged a contested site across a variety of fields   from comparative literature and area studies to media studies and   philosophy. Partly marking itself off from older universalist claims   (cosmopolitanism, world history, globalization), the planetary   imagination as we will discuss it in this class foregrounds an   ecological dimension and at the same time, shifts the grounds of   human-centered thought and politics. While touching on a wide variety of   issues, including technology, scale, identity, and ethics, the core   problem for the class will be to consider \u201cthe world\u201d from a standpoint   that does not privilege the human as its center or apex. The goal of the   course is neither to immediately endorse nor repudiate a critique of   anthropocentrism, but to examine some of its diverse forms of   expression, underlying assumptions, and possible repercussions. To that   end, this class seeks to explore the planetary imagination from a   broadly (and possibly contradictory) humanities-based perspective, at   the intersection of area studies (East Asia in particular) and   comparative literature\u2014through fiction, philosophy, and contemporary   arts and media.      EAST-UA 952 Topics in Chinese Studies: Modern Chinese Drama (4 credits) Instructor: Max Bohnenkamp   China has always been home to a rich theatrical tradition, visible in such forms as Kun and Beijing operas. Yet beginning in the late-1800s, new knowledge of Western culture inspired major creative attempts to modernize the traditional theater and to introduce foreign styles of performance. While the efforts of such figures as Mei Lanfang led to the transformation of Beijing opera into China\u2019s first form of internationally- known theater, the spoken dramas of modern playwrights like Cao Yu and Tian Han offered realist plays of social critique to advance the reform of Chinese culture. Upon such foundations, drama developed into one of the most important and contested areas of artistic innovation and public engagement through China\u2019s 20th-century history of war, revolution and reform. This course examines the history of modern Chinese drama through close readings of exemplary dramatic texts, film viewings and the study of current scholarship on the topic.

Painting and sculpture of the 19th century and the secularization of  Latin American art is then examined before a discussion of the establishment of  modernism that comes about with the formation of academies and the travels of  many artists from all parts of Latin America and the Caribbean to Europe and  the U.S. from 1900 onward. Important modern artists such as the Mexican  muralists, Frida  Kahlo, Joaqu\u00edn  Torres-Garc\u00eda, Tarsila  do Amaral, Wifredo  Lam, and  the surrealists will bring the course up to approximately 1950.

Offered every year. 4 points.    The  Enlightenment shaped the visual arts in two seemingly antithetical ways. On the  one hand, the period's valorization of cool rationalism contributed to the rise  of neoclassicism as a dominant style during the 18th century. The other course  of Enlightenment thinking, exemplified by the writings of J. J. Rousseau,  celebrated emotion as the purest form of intellectual as well as spiritual  expression. Romanticism, with its emphasis on subjectivity and intense  emotionalism, is as much a product of the Enlightenment as neoclassicism.  Following on the heels of romanticism, realism has been alternately described  as a rejection of romanticism and as an extension of it. Focusing on these  three stylistic movements, examines how late 18th- and early 19th-century  artists negotiated not just the aesthetic ideas of the Enlightenment but its  political consequences as well.          Impressionism  and After, 1860-1900    ARTH-UA  412 Prerequisite:  History of Western Art II (ARTH-UA 2), or Modern Art (ARTH-UA 6), or a score of  5 on the AP Art History exam.

Following impressionism and post-impressionism, close attention is paid to  symbolism, aestheticism, art nouveau, the Arts and Crafts movement, fauvism,  and expressionism. The aesthetic aims of these movements are analyzed in tandem  with the social and cultural conditions that generated them.          Era  of the Avant-Gardes, 1900-1945    ARTH-UA  413 Prerequisite:  History of Western Art II (ARTH-UA 2), or Modern Art (ARTH-UA 6), or a score of  5 on the AP Art History exam.

The dada movement in the period during  and after World War I is examined as a reaction to the apparent bankruptcy,  cultural and artistic, of Western civilization. However, this nihilistic  impulse is followed by a \"return to order\" in the 1920s. Then examines the  tensions in the multiple currents of surrealism: metamorphic, academic, and  abject. Painting after World War II, from Pollock to Dubuffet, is analyzed as  an extension and transformation of prewar trends.

An  introduction to the art and culture of the Far East, presented in a  chronological and thematic approach corresponding to the major dynastic and  cultural changes of China, Korea, and Japan. Teaches how to \"read\" works of art  in order to interpret a culture or a historical period; aims at a better  understanding of the similarities and differences among the cultures of the Far  East.          East  Asian Art II: China, Korea, Japan from 1000 C.E. to Present    ARTH-UA  511 Identical  to EAST-UA 92. Offered periodically. 4 points.    An  introductory survey of the arts in China, Japan, and Korea from approximately  1000 C.E. Emphasizes an overall understanding of the development of art and  culture, as well as mastery of specific works of art. East Asian Art I followed  the development of the common cultural heritage of the Northeast Asia region.  Part of this commonality is due to the extraordinary influence of an  early-developing Chinese civilization on Japan and Korea. However, Japan and  Korea also developed their own cultures and arts, developments that accelerated  in the last millennia up to the present. Topics include Song landscape  paintings, Edo \"floating world\" prints, Koryo celadons, and modern art.          South  Asian Art I: Indus Valley to 1200    ARTH-UA  530 Offered  periodically. 4 points.    An  introductory survey of the history of South Asia from 2000 B.C.E. to 1200 C.E.,  with an emphasis on the Indian subcontinent. From the Indus Valley culture to  the present day, artistic production has played a critical role in the  transmission of religious beliefs and the development of cultural systems in  and around South Asia. Diverse regions were linked by trade, politics, and  cultural relationships, and interaction can be charted through the changing  forms and functions of art. We consider the historical circumstances  surrounding the production of South and Southeast Asian art, as well as the  problems that art historians face when trying to interpret the surviving  evidence. We look at art in a variety of media, including, but not limited to,  architecture, urban form, sculpture, painting, and performance.          South  Asian Art II: 1200 to Present    ARTH-UA  531 Offered  periodically. 4 points.

Follows the cultivation of new tastes in the Mughal and Rajput  courts through the vigorous interaction among Persian, Indic, and European  artists and elites. Finally turns to the colonial and postcolonial artistic  responses to South Asia's complex past(s). By looking at art in a range of  media\u2014including, but not limited to, painting, sculpture, architecture, and  photography\u2014we consider how art actively served as an expression of  political authority and cultural identity.          Art  in the Islamic World I: From the Prophet to the Mongols    ARTH-UA  540 Offered  periodically. 4 points.    Provides  an outline of Islamic material in its early and classical periods, from  650 to 1200 C.E. The period saw the initial formation of an Arab empire  stretching from the Atlantic Ocean to the Indian Ocean, a  decline in centralized authority, and  the rise to political prominence of various North African, Iranian,  and  Central Asian dynasties from the 10th century onward. These political  developments are reflected in the increasingly heterogeneous nature of Islamic  material culture over this time span.          Art  in the Islamic World II: From the Mongols to Modernism    ARTH-UA  541 Offered  periodically. 4 points.
