Since the     work of Donoho and Johnstone, soft and hard thresholding operators have been     extensively studied for denoising of digital signals, mainly in a statistical     framework. Usually associated to wavelet or curvelet expansions,     thresholding allows to eliminate those coefficients which encode noise     components. The assumption is that signals are sparse in origin with respect to     such expansions and that the effect of noise is essentially to perturb the     sparsity structure by introducing non zero coefficients with     relatively small magnitude. While a simple and direct thresholding is used for     statistical estimation of the relevant components of an explicitly given     signal, and to discard those considered disturbance, the     computation of the sparse representation of a signal implicitly given as the     solution of an operator equation or of an inverse problem requires more     sophistication. We refer, for instance, to deconvolution and     superresolution problems, image recovery and enhancing, and problems arising in     geophysics and brain imaging. In these cases, thresholding has been     combined with Landweber iterations to compute the solutions. In     this talk we present a unified theory of iterative thresholding     algorithms which includes soft, hard, and the so-called firm     thresholding operators. In particular, we develop a variational approach of     such algorithms which allows for a complete analysis of their     convergence properties. As a matter of fact, despite their simplicity     which makes them very appealing to users and their enormous impact for     applications, iterative thresholding algorithms converges very slowly and     might be impracticable in certain situations. By analyzing their typical     convergence dynamics we propose acceleration methods based 1. on     projected gradient iterations, 2. on alternating subspace corrections     (domain decompositions.) Also for both these latter families of algorithms, a     variational approach is fundamental in order to correctly analyse the     convergence.                Holger Rauhut , University of Vienna           Sparse Recovery      Abstract. I will give     an overview on the topic of sparse recovery with some emphasis on my     own contributions. This emerging field, which is also refered to     as compressed sensing or compressive sampling, was initiated in 2004 with     pioneering work by Emmanuel Cands, Justin Romberg and     Terence Tao, and independently by David Donoho.           A signal (vector,     function) is called sparse if it has an expansion with     only a small number of non-vanishing coefficients in terms of a     suitable basis.      Many real-world signals can be well-approximated by     sparse ones.      The basic idea of compressed sensing is that a sparse signal can be efficiently     recovered from a number of linear non-adaptive     measurements (inner products), which is much smaller than     the ambient dimension of the signal (but of course     larger than the sparsity, i.e., the number of     non-vanishing coefficients). This surprising principle     has many potential applications in signal and image processing.     As reconstruction procedures, mainly l_1-minimization (basis pursuit) and greedy algorithms such     as orthogonal matching pursuit have been investigated so     far. All known good constructions of suitable linear measurements     are of probabilistic nature.           As an important special     case, it is possible to reconstruct a sparse trigonometric polynomial     from random samples provided the number N of samples scales as N =     O(M log(D)), where M is the number of non-vanishing Fourier     coefficients      and D the dimension of the corresponding space of     trigonometric polynomials.           Extensions to     multichannel (vector-valued) signals (distributed compressed     sensing) and applications to the operator identification problem     will be discussed briefly.                Vladimir Temlyakov , University of South      Carolina           On the Lebesgue Type Inequalities for Greedy     Approximation (Joint work with D.L. Donoho and     M. Elad)      Abstract. We study the     efficiency of greedy algorithms with regard to redundant     dictionaries      in Hilbert spaces. We obtain upper estimates for the     errors of the Pure Greedy Algorithm and the Orthogonal Greedy     Algorithm in terms of the best m-term approximations. We     call such     estimates the Lebesgue type inequalities. We prove the     Lebesgue type inequalities for dictionaries with special     structure. We assume that the dictionary has a property     of mutual      incoherence (the coherence parameter of the dictionary     is small). We develop a new technique that, in particular,     allowed us to get rid of an extra factor m ^{1/2} in the Lebesgue type     inequality for     the Orthogonal Greedy Algorithm.

Since the     work of Donoho and Johnstone, soft and hard thresholding operators have been     extensively studied for denoising of digital signals, mainly in a statistical     framework. Usually associated to wavelet or curvelet expansions,     thresholding allows to eliminate those coefficients which encode noise     components. The assumption is that signals are sparse in origin with respect to     such expansions and that the effect of noise is essentially to perturb the     sparsity structure by introducing non zero coefficients with     relatively small magnitude. While a simple and direct thresholding is used for     statistical estimation of the relevant components of an explicitly given     signal, and to discard those considered disturbance, the     computation of the sparse representation of a signal implicitly given as the     solution of an operator equation or of an inverse problem requires more     sophistication. We refer, for instance, to deconvolution and     superresolution problems, image recovery and enhancing, and problems arising in     geophysics and brain imaging. In these cases, thresholding has been     combined with Landweber iterations to compute the solutions. In     this talk we present a unified theory of iterative thresholding     algorithms which includes soft, hard, and the so-called firm     thresholding operators. In particular, we develop a variational approach of     such algorithms which allows for a complete analysis of their     convergence properties. As a matter of fact, despite their simplicity     which makes them very appealing to users and their enormous impact for     applications, iterative thresholding algorithms converges very slowly and     might be impracticable in certain situations. By analyzing their typical     convergence dynamics we propose acceleration methods based 1. on     projected gradient iterations, 2. on alternating subspace corrections     (domain decompositions.) Also for both these latter families of algorithms, a     variational approach is fundamental in order to correctly analyse the     convergence.                Holger Rauhut , University of Vienna           Sparse Recovery      Abstract. I will give     an overview on the topic of sparse recovery with some emphasis on my     own contributions. This emerging field, which is also refered to     as compressed sensing or compressive sampling, was initiated in 2004 with     pioneering work by Emmanuel Cands, Justin Romberg and     Terence Tao, and independently by David Donoho.           A signal (vector,     function) is called sparse if it has an expansion with     only a small number of non-vanishing coefficients in terms of a     suitable basis.      Many real-world signals can be well-approximated by     sparse ones.      The basic idea of compressed sensing is that a sparse signal can be efficiently     recovered from a number of linear non-adaptive     measurements (inner products), which is much smaller than     the ambient dimension of the signal (but of course     larger than the sparsity, i.e., the number of     non-vanishing coefficients). This surprising principle     has many potential applications in signal and image processing.     As reconstruction procedures, mainly l_1-minimization (basis pursuit) and greedy algorithms such     as orthogonal matching pursuit have been investigated so     far. All known good constructions of suitable linear measurements     are of probabilistic nature.           As an important special     case, it is possible to reconstruct a sparse trigonometric polynomial     from random samples provided the number N of samples scales as N =     O(M log(D)), where M is the number of non-vanishing Fourier     coefficients      and D the dimension of the corresponding space of     trigonometric polynomials.           Extensions to     multichannel (vector-valued) signals (distributed compressed     sensing) and applications to the operator identification problem     will be discussed briefly.                Vladimir Temlyakov , University of South      Carolina           On the Lebesgue Type Inequalities for Greedy     Approximation (Joint work with D.L. Donoho and     M. Elad)      Abstract. We study the     efficiency of greedy algorithms with regard to redundant     dictionaries      in Hilbert spaces. We obtain upper estimates for the     errors of the Pure Greedy Algorithm and the Orthogonal Greedy     Algorithm in terms of the best m-term approximations. We     call such     estimates the Lebesgue type inequalities. We prove the     Lebesgue type inequalities for dictionaries with special     structure. We assume that the dictionary has a property     of mutual      incoherence (the coherence parameter of the dictionary     is small). We develop a new technique that, in particular,     allowed us to get rid of an extra factor m ^{1/2} in the Lebesgue type     inequality for     the Orthogonal Greedy Algorithm.
