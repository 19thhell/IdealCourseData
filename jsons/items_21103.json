Policy analysts are concerned with the development and evaluation of strategies to improve the functioning of the health care delivery system. In some instances this role is played in a governmental agency responsible for regulating and financing health services. In other instances a policy analyst works for an organization that provides health care services, a nonprofit service organization, or a professional association or foundation. Responsibilities often include the development and analysis of data to support policy initiatives, an assessment of new health care initiatives using techniques such as cost-benefit analysis, program evaluation, implementation analysis, and the development of formal health plans to anticipate future needs for health care resources.
