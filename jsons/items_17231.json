Courses         Description |    Syllabi |    Evaluations           The rapid rate and massive scale of urbanization globally make urban planning and design more critical than ever. This course introduces a selection of key ideas, experiences, and planning practices that shaped the contemporary city, and those that contend to shape the future city. In a lecture-seminar format, it examines important cases drawn from major cities around the world such as Mumbai, Paris, New York, Shanghai, and Detroit. Topics include megacities and megaslums, sustainable cities, \"cybercities,\" and some of the most important planning interventions and visions from the past. The aim of the course is three-fold: To develop a critical reading of a selection of urban spaces, planning efforts, and texts; to provide a vocabulary of some of the major urban plans, ideas, and spaces: and to identify crucial issues that planners and designers now confront.

The Planning Team of SAPD is responsible for the long and short-range physical planning needs for the University\u2019s local and global campuses. The team serves NYU\u2019s academic and administrative units through the management of the University\u2019s space inventory. With each individual client, the Planning Team works to allocate space through collaboration to find the best space to meet each need. The Planning Team offers programming, planning, pre-design, and capital planning services to clients engaging in long-range plans and in preparation for major capital projects. The Planning Team guides the University\u2019s NYU PLANS 2031, a 25-year plan to envision the University as it approaches its Bicentennial.   The Design Team of SAPD sets the guidelines for the quality of NYU\u2019s built environments. The promotion of design excellence and the implementation of sustainable design practices throughout the built and landscaped environments of the University are the paramount objectives. The Design Team is responsible for the development of a set of written design guidelines, which will guide the development of future capital projects. The Design Team advises and guides the process for the selection of architects for planning and capital projects. Members of the Design Team follow major capital projects through the design and construction process to insure the integration of design excellence on the campus.   SAPD is an ambitious advocate for the maintenance, adaptive-reuse, and the preservation of NYU\u2019s architectural and fiscal resources. We strive for thoughtful and considered solutions that help the University to better fulfill its academic mission and we are committed to NYU\u2019s founding mandate to be a university \u201cin and of the City\u201d.
