What\u2019s the difference between a cookbook author and a Pulitzer-Prize nominated novelist? A video-game reviewer and a literary icon? An anthropologist and a cultural satirist? Less than you\u2019d think, if you examine the work of writers whose brilliance spans these genres and more over the course of their careers. In Sidelines, we\u2019ll look at Patricia Highsmith\u2019s first novel,\u00a0 The Price of Sal \u00a0t, a lesbian coming-of-age work; Martin Amis\u2019s video game reviews; Ernest J. Gaines\u2019 children\u2019s novel,\u00a0 A Long Day in November \u00a0; Nora Ephron\u2019s searing\u00a0 GQ \u00a0cultural criticism; Shirley Jackson\u2019s comedic essays on parenting, and other forgotten works in order to gain valuable understanding about the writing life and the use of mastering many media. Students will also take a crack at writing in the standard and nonstandard forms of the writers of our age, such as blogging, Tumblring, and tweeting, and then write their own cross-genre works, anything from straightforward fiction to narrative recipes for nutmeg cake.
