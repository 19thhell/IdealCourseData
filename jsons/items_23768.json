Course Descriptions    Detailed descriptions of the required courses for the MA, Teaching Art, All Grades (Initial Certification - 36 credits).    Fieldwork    A description of Art + Education fieldwork (serving as learning partners and student teaching experiences).    Visionary Studios Saturday Workshop As part of the program&rsquo;s emphasis on praxis, our graduate students enrolled in School Art II: Issues in Pedagogy and Curriculum teach a 9-week Saturday Art Workshop for high school students from across New York City. As an opportunity to design and implement a thematic unit plan based on social issues, this field experience allows students to establish a dialogue between theory introduced in the seminar and practice in the classroom, as well as develop their teaching style. Thematic classes are designed to help high school students explore ideas using a range of visual media and through multi-disciplinary projects that may include drawing, painting, printmaking, video, installation, and photography. An exhibition at the end of the session allows students to share their work with a wide audience of parents, friends, teachers, and NYU faculty.

Course Descriptions    Detailed descriptions of the required courses for the MA, Teaching Art, All Grades (Initial Certification - 36 credits).    Fieldwork    A description of Art + Education fieldwork (serving as learning partners and student teaching experiences).    Visionary Studios Saturday Workshop As part of the program&rsquo;s emphasis on praxis, our graduate students enrolled in School Art II: Issues in Pedagogy and Curriculum teach a 9-week Saturday Art Workshop for high school students from across New York City. As an opportunity to design and implement a thematic unit plan based on social issues, this field experience allows students to establish a dialogue between theory introduced in the seminar and practice in the classroom, as well as develop their teaching style. Thematic classes are designed to help high school students explore ideas using a range of visual media and through multi-disciplinary projects that may include drawing, painting, printmaking, video, installation, and photography. An exhibition at the end of the session allows students to share their work with a wide audience of parents, friends, teachers, and NYU faculty.
