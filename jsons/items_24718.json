The goal of the program is to train and prepare child and adolescent psychiatrists to meet the challenging demands of a complex and expanding field while translating research into effective clinical care. Graduating residents have the necessary knowledge and clinical skills to function independently as medical specialists in coordinating and delivering skilled and comprehensive treatment to children and adolescents who have psychiatric disorders.   The child and adolescent psychiatry program at NYU is one of the oldest in the country with a longstanding tradition of combining clinical and research excellence. The multi-disciplinary faculty of behavioral scientists and clinicians is committed to providing state-of-the-art care in their quest to assist children, adolescents and their families.   The NYU Child Study Center, Bellevue Hospital Center, and the Rockland Children\u2019s Psychiatric Center (RCPC) offer a unique combination of comprehensive clinical facilities serving diverse patient populations. Residents gain clinical experience at Bellevue on the Child Inpatient Service (the first in the United States); the Adolescent Inpatient Service (also the first in the country); the Adolescent Day Hospital; the Pediatric Emergency Service; Public School 35M (one of the first public school programs established in a hospital); the Child and Adolescent Mental Hygiene Clinic (which includes a Therapeutic Nursery/Preschool); and the Pediatric Consultation-Liaison Service. At NYU there are clinical opportunities at Tisch Hospital's inpatient Young Adult Program; pediatric consultation liaison activities at Tisch Hospital, Rusk Institute of Rehabilitation Medicine, and Stephen D. Hassenfeld Children's Center for Cancer and Blood Disorders; and the varied components of the NYU Child Study Center. First year child residents also rotate at RCPC, an intensive, family-based inpatient program, where they learn to psychiatrically diagnose and treat some of the most troubled and disruptive children in the state.   This comprehensive didactic/supervisory program offers year-long seminars on child and adolescent development and psychopathology as well as two years of psychopharmacology; continuous case seminars (by members of the NYU Psychoanalytic Institute) and seminars in assessment; research; treatment modalities; forensics; ethics; substance abuse; and other related child and adolescent mental health issues. NYU Child Study Center holds one of the few weekly grand rounds in child and adolescent psychiatry in the country. At these presentations residents hear from national experts each week and then meet with the speaker for lunch immediately afterwards, providing more opportunities for learning, mentorship, and future collaboration.   The Family Studies Program, in collaboration with the Ackerman Institute of Family Therapy, offers a first-year didactic seminar and two years of weekly live family therapy supervision. Second-year residents also have weekly group and cognitive behavior therapy supervision. Individual long-term therapy supervision is provided throughout the two years along with individual supervision by attending on clinical rotations.   The Department has one of seven federally funded Research Units for Pediatric Psychopharmacology (RUPP). Residents are welcome to participate in ongoing research through RUPP or the many other ongoing research studies at the NYU Child Study Center, Bellevue Hospital Center, or RCPC.

The Child Study Center (CSC) is a center for training, research, education, outreach, and clinical service delivery dedicated to the understanding, prevention, and treatment of child and adolescent mental health, behavioral, and learning problems. The faculty is committed to empirically demonstrated assessment and treatment methodologies, and to evaluating treatment outcome.   The Child and Adolescent Psychology Track was initiated in the 1997-1998 training year and offers an outstanding opportunity for interns who wish to pursue specialized training in clinical child and adolescent psychology. The program combines the assets of the Child Study Center and Bellevue Hospital Center to offer concentrated training with children, adolescents, young adults and families in both inpatient and outpatient settings.   The interns in the Child and Adolescent Psychology Track will be assigned, in consultation with the internship director, to three four-month rotations, at least one of which will be an inpatient experience (either the child inpatient or adolescent inpatient psychiatry unit at Bellevue). One of the other two rotations will also be child- or adolescent- focused; the third rotation need not be. Bilingual and multilingual students are encouraged to apply.   Child and adolescent psychology track interns will:   Treat outpatient cases with internalizing and externalizing disorders.   Conduct neuropsychological and/or educational testing protocols.

First year child residents also rotate at RCPC, an intensive, family-based inpatient program, where they learn to psychiatrically diagnose and treat some of the most troubled and disruptive children in the state.   This comprehensive didactic/supervisory program offers year-long seminars on child and adolescent development and psychopathology as well as two years of psychopharmacology; continuous case seminars (by members of the NYU Psychoanalytic Institute) and seminars in assessment; research; treatment modalities; forensics; ethics; substance abuse; and other related child and adolescent mental health issues. NYU Child Study Center holds one of the few weekly grand rounds in child and adolescent psychiatry in the country. At these presentations residents hear from national experts each week and then meet with the speaker for lunch immediately afterwards, providing more opportunities for learning, mentorship, and future collaboration.   The Family Studies Program, in collaboration with the Ackerman Institute of Family Therapy, offers a first-year didactic seminar and two years of weekly live family therapy supervision. Second-year residents also have weekly group and cognitive behavior therapy supervision.

CAMS Program Adviser   Tommy Canale Offered by the College of Arts and Science in cooperation with the Child Study Center at the NYU School of Medicine , this minor aims to heighten students\u2019 awareness of childhood mental health issues and their sustained impact on adolescents and adults. In the child and adolescent mental health studies (CAMS) minor, students will (1) explore the relationship between human behavior and its biological and environmental bases; (2) increase their intellectual curiosity and build analytic and problem-solving skills; (3) be challenged to think critically about the concepts of \u201cnormal\u201d or \u201ctypical\u201d versus \u201cabnormal\u201d behavior and engage in a meta-level analysis of the social, historical, and cultural context of mental health, illness, and diagnosis; and (4) be encouraged\u2014if they have a natural interest in and inclination toward careers in social work, education and special education, psychology, law, medicine, sociology, nursing, public health, and scientific journalism\u2014to consider focusing their future career in some significant capacity on children and adolescents.
