Engineering Connection:   Conservation and reuse of water are areas of focus for environmental engineers, who work on such problems as wastewater treatment, water recycling, and technologies to conserve water.     Pre-Requisite Knowledge:   Basic arithmetic     Learning Objectives:   After this lesson, students will be able to:     Understand how water is used and why conservation and reuse are important   Understand the wastewater treatment process   Describe a grey water system       Materials List:   1) Video: Water Changes Everything   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCHhwxvQqxg   2) Water Calculations     Calculators     3) Water Filtration &amp; Treatment     Dirt   Clear plastic cups   Water   Stirrers   Selection of filter papers of various grades   Funnels   Digital scale       Introduction/Motivation:   The lack of clean water around the world is beginning to turn water into a commodity. Scientists and engineers are working on technologies and systems to both conserve and recycle water.     According to the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, a four-person family uses about 400 gallons of water each day; 70% of that water is used on indoor activities such as bathing, washing clothes, and flushing the toilet.      There are various household technologies that can be used to conserve water at the level of an individual family. One way to reduce water used in flushing toilets is by installing a dual flush system. A dual flush toilet has two flushing options \u2013 a full flush and a light flush. The light flush is used for only liquid waste. A dual flush system has a larger trapway so that it requires less water for flushing, and is more expensive than a conventional toilet. Student can calculate the amount of water and money saved by using a dual flush toilet.   Water can be recycled and thus conserved using a grey water system. Grey water is water that is not clean enough to drink, but that can be used in other ways, such as flushing the toilet or watering plants. Water that has been used for washing clothes, bathing, or washing dishes is grey water.   Another way to recycle water is by filtration and water treatment to remove and neutralize contaminants. This is done in wastewater treatment facilities. The wastewater treatment process is a continual cycle that is repeated until the water is deemed clean enough for a specified use. Flocculation, filtration, and chlorination are three essential steps in wastewater treatment.   Flocculation is a necessary step to remove solid particles from wastewater. Before flocculation can occur, coagulation dosing takes place. Coagulation is a chemical treatment that destabilizes suspended particles in a water sample. These particles are bonded together chemically via a physical process of gentle stirring, or agitation known as flocculation. The resulting large particles are removed by filtration. Finally, the water is chlorinated. This chemically neutralizes any remaining bacteria, disinfecting the water and making it safe to drink.   Students will conduct a water filtration experiment to investigate how effective various filters are at removing particles from water.      Source: Masters, Gilbert M., and Wendel P. Ela.

Choose a filtration material from a variety of filter papers of different grades and prices. Note the grade and price of your paper.   2. Fill a glass with clean water.   3. Using a balance, weigh out 0.4-0.8g of dirt. Record the weight of your sample.   4. Mix the dirt into the clean water. Thoroughly suspend the dirt so that the water appears uniformly brown.   5. Cut the filter paper into a circle. Weigh the filter paper and record the weight.   6. Fold the paper in half and then in half again. Place the filter in the funnel.   7. Pour the dirty water through the funnel into a clean cup. Time how long it takes for the water to run through the filter, and record your time.   8. Set the filter paper to dry flat for about 5 minutes. Once it is dry, weigh the filter paper. Record your data.   9. Determine the percentage of dirt you removed from the water according to the following equation:     Safety Issues   None     Investigating Questions     What are some ways that an individual household can save water?   What are your observations on the wastewater treatment activity? What effect did the type of filter paper you used have on the amount of dirt you were able to filter out?   Based on your experiment, what are some problems that you think engineers need to consider when designing a wastewater filtration system?

Math knowledge may be lacking for the water calculations activity. Have teacher review proportions and percentages prior to activity. Example: If you go to a store and apples cost $2 for 5 apples. How many apples can you get for $6. Make sure to have students set up the ratio and pay attention to units.   2. Grey water systems must be explained. This is a form of recycling water. These systems are not common although are growing in popularity. A good example to explain greywater is to emphasize the sources of greywater including washing machines and sinks. However toilet water is too dirty.   3. Water filtration is a step of the water treatment process. The water treatment process is complex and further explanation of the processes may be required. This explanation can include a discussion on how a coffee filter works. Filters are classified by a number that relates the number of openings to the area covered.   4. Engineers are responsible for the movement of water supply as well as the treatment of water &#8211; these are two related but different topics. Emphasize that environmental engineering is related to the treatment and quality of water. Water resource engineering, a separate field, has to do with the distribution, volume, and flow of water, irrespective of its quality.
