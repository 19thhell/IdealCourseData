Google Scholar is a time-saving, scholarly search interface accessible from within the Google interface. With Google Scholar, you can access peer-reviewed journal articles, books and book sections. For literature searching, specialized databases have more functionality and access more comprehensive results, but Google Scholar is a good tool to use for a search for a known item .   You can configure Google Scholar to:     Display a link to NYU options for the full-text of an article   Export your citations to RefWorks or EndNote     Here's how to display NYU links:     Open scholar.google.com   Go to the Settings icon (upper right screen)   Click on left menu item, \"Library Links\"   Type in: NYU   From the results, put a check mark next to \"New York University Libraries-GetIt at NYU\"   Click on Save to save preferences.     The next time you search scholar.google.com, the GetIt at NYU option will be available next to accessible article citations.     Here's how to change settings for Bibliography manager:     Open scholar.google.com   Go to the Settings icon (upper right screen)   In the Search Results, go to Bibliography Manager   Select Show Links to import citation into: (your choice of bibliography manager, Refworks, Endnote, etc.)   Click on Save to save preferences.

Thus, limiting your literature search to the peer-reviewed journals ensures a higher level of scholarship and research methodology. Magazines, trade journals, and newspapers tend to be \"non-peer-reviewed,\" meaning perhaps just the editor or someone who is not an expert in the field has reviewed the content before publishing. How do you know if a journal citation is from a peer-reviewed journal?     You can do a journal title search in Ulrich's Global Serials Directory . The symbol: indicates a journal is \"refereed\"   You can look for the \"Limits\" feature in many databases to narrow search results by publication type.

PICO (T) elements include: P r oblem/Patient/Population, I ntervention/Indicator , C omparison, O utcome, and (optional) T ime element or T ype of Study.          1.  Frame the question:  write out your information need in the form of a question, for example:        Does hand washing among healthcare workers reduce hospital acquired infections?         The question above includes the PICO elements:                  Example:       P ( P roblem or P atient or P opulation)   hospital acquired infection       I (intervention/indicator)   hand washing       C (comparison)   no hand washing; other solution; masks       O (outcome of interest)   reduced infection                 2. Plan a search strategy by identifying the major elements of your question, and translate natural language terms to subject descriptors, MeSH terms, or descriptors.         TIP:  start with the P and the I only to begin your search and keep initial search results broad:           natural language   term mapped to database vocabulary       P ( P roblem/ P atient/ P opulation) = hospital acquired infection     cross infection [MeSH]   cross infection [CINAHL]         I (intervention/indicator)= hand washing     hand disinfection [MeSH]   handwashing [CINAHL]               A simple database search strategy should begin with the P AND I :  cross infection  AND  (Handwashing OR Hand disinfection)        Start with both CINAHL and Medline/PubMed as initial article databases for a scoping search for most health sciences questions. If your topic has a behavioral/mental health component, also try PsycINFO.            3. After viewing the initial search results  you may decide to narrow your search with terms for the Comparison, Outcome, Time factors or Type of study. Or you may view results, abstracts, and full text of articles to view the comparison and outcome elements. Use database filters , explained in Filtering the Evidence.      Need more help?

Below are ways to narrow a search:     View the online thesaurus. Select a narrower, more specific term for your topic, for example:     in PubMed, search the MeSH thesaurus on infection and notice narrower MeSH terms such as catheter-related infections [MeSH]   In PsycINFO, a thesaurus search on Sleep reveals that narrower terms under Sleep include Napping, NREM Sleep, REM Sleep    In the CINAHL thesaurus,  Education, Nursing is a broad term, with narrower headings for   Education, Nursing, Baccalaureate  Education, Nursing, Graduate             Narrow with subheadings ( restrict your search to a subtopic of interest)          e.g., in PubMed: Hand hygiene/standards     e.g., in CINAHL: Management Styles/trends      Apply LIMITS. Use the feature that allows you to edit or limit search results:         LIMIT by article type/publication type, by level of evidence (link to screenshots on limiting )             Are you looking for an overview of a topic? \"Review\" articles synthesize a review of the literature that an author conducts at a certain point in time. A good quality review article may provide a useful overview and starting point.     LIMIT by Age group if appropriate.   LIMIT results by year of publication, language, etc.           Limit by using tools that apply preformulated filters to search topics, for example:     o  PubMed Clinical Queries http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/pubmedutils/clinical (PubMed research methodology filters are explained here )   o  CINAHL Clinical Queries (click on &ldquo;Show More, Search Options, to locate limits for clinical queries filters)     Pre-evaluated, pre-synthesized sources (including &ldquo;systematic reviews&rdquo;) aggregate the best evidence for a given topic.

Below are ways to expand (broaden) your search:     Harvest added search terms (synonyms for one or more of your search terms) by viewing the records retrieved in your initial search. For example, a search for health care reform may retrieve citations described with added terms you can \"harvest\" for an expanded search:   health care reform bill OR health care bill OR (Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act) OR Affordable Care Act OR PPACA OR Health Care Reform/legislation &amp; jurisprudence [MeSH] OR Obamacare         Use the online thesaurus. Each database has an online thesaurus of controlled vocabulary terms.     o  In CINAHL, use the CINAHL Headings link to explore the tree structure of terms; EXPLODE to include narrower terms   o  In PubMed, do a search using the MESH dropdown option; explore the tree structure of terms; using a broader term automatically EXPLODES to include narrower terms   o  In PsycINFO, click on Search Tools, Thesaurus; explore the tree structure of terms; EXPLODE to include narrower terms     Truncate one or more of your search terms     o  Truncation symbols in a database, such as * or ? allow you to search on a root word and include plurals         Diab* (to retrieve diabetes, diabetic, diabetogenic)   Autis* (to retrieve autism, autistic)   Nurs* (to retrieve nurse, nurses, nursing, etc.).         o  Warning! Truncation may also retrieve false hits. A search on nurs* retrieves &ldquo;nursery school&rdquo;       \"Citation pearl growing\" uses a relevant source to lead to more sources on a topic.     Look for a link to \"Related\" articles or &ldquo;find similar results.\" Also known as \"snowballing.\"   From a relevant article, follow up on citations in the bibliography (the \"ancestry\" method)   Use the \"cited references\" feature if available. More about \"cited reference searching\" is described here .         Try another database. Often the scope of the database doesn't match your search needs.

PICO (T) elements include: P r oblem/Patient/Population, I ntervention/Indicator , C omparison, O utcome, and (optional) T ime element or T ype of Study.          1.  Frame the question:  write out your information need in the form of a question, for example:        Does hand washing among healthcare workers reduce hospital acquired infections?         The question above includes the PICO elements:                  Example:       P ( P roblem or P atient or P opulation)   hospital acquired infection       I (intervention/indicator)   hand washing       C (comparison)   no hand washing; other solution; masks       O (outcome of interest)   reduced infection                 2. Plan a search strategy by identifying the major elements of your question, and translate natural language terms to subject descriptors, MeSH terms, or descriptors.         TIP:  start with the P and the I only to begin your search and keep initial search results broad:           natural language   term mapped to database vocabulary       P ( P roblem/ P atient/ P opulation) = hospital acquired infection     cross infection [MeSH]   cross infection [CINAHL]         I (intervention/indicator)= hand washing     hand disinfection [MeSH]   handwashing [CINAHL]               A simple database search strategy should begin with the P AND I :  cross infection  AND  (Handwashing OR Hand disinfection)        Start with both CINAHL and Medline/PubMed as initial article databases for a scoping search for most health sciences questions. If your topic has a behavioral/mental health component, also try PsycINFO.            3. After viewing the initial search results  you may decide to narrow your search with terms for the Comparison, Outcome, Time factors or Type of study.

Like a magnet in a haystack, a search strategy will help you to systematically apply limits to database search results to sift through the profusion of published literature.   Limits to use:     Database limits may include choices for filtering publication types : case studies, editorials, news articles, as well as higher levels of evidence such as clinical trials, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses.   Limiting by publication type is one way to ensure that the research retrieved was based on a more rigorous methodology and thus reflects a higher level of evidence.     Date of publication limits are usually available and can help reduce your set of results. Date limits are particularly helpful when you have too many results, or you have a clinical topic and wish to retrieve only the most recent literature.   Age group: databases with limits for age group provide a useful way to limit results when an age group limit is relevant for your topic. When you wish to limit results by age group, use the limit feature rather than putting in your own keywords. Using these limits ensures a standard approach to narrowing your search, rather than using your own keywords such as \"elderly\" or \"pediatric.\"   \"Peer-reviewed articles,\" \"research,\" \"evidence-based,\" l anguage, species, and other subsets for topics may be available. Use with care, and be sure to read the description of what they mean, as they may inadvertently apply limits you don't want!     Limits to avoid:     \"Full text\" or \"full text available,\" limits may appear and you should avoid using these ! At NYU we subscribe to full text in many ways and from multiple vendors and packages. From individual citations you will see the NYU full text links. Avoid biasing your search results by using the database full text limit, as that will limit to just articles available from that individual service.      The instructions below depict beginning strategies for limiting by publication type (or methodology) in each selected database.    Limiting (filtering) strategies:       Limiting in CINAHLPlus (limit to \"Research,\" \"peer-reviewed,\" etc.)    Limiting using Popular Filters in Medline via PubMed    Limiting by Study Type in PubMed using MeSH terms       Limiting in Medline (via Ovid)        Limiting in PsycINFO (via Ovid)        Limiting in PsycINFO (via APAPsycNet)        Limiting to Scholarly articles (including peer reviewed) in Proquest Central        The InterTASC Information Specialists' Sub-Group Search Filter Resource    The InterTASC Information Specialists' Sub-Group Search Filter Resource is a collaborative venture to identify, assess and test search filters designed to retrieve research by study design.

Results are synthesized to present the current state of knowledge regarding the concept. Includes integrated or integrative reviews).        Browse the many Publication types; notice the range from case study or letter (lower levels of evidence) to Systematic Reviews and Clinical Trials (higher levels of evidence).        Using the CINAHL &ldquo;Evidence-based Practice&rdquo; limiter includes &ldquo;Research&rdquo; articles (including systematic reviews, clinical trials, meta analyses, etc.) as well as articles from evidence-based practice journals, articles about evidence-based practice , and commentaries on research studies (applying practice to research). Use with caution; every result may not be an evidence-based study. More about the evidence-based practice limiter.    Advanced Searches:      Limit using Clinical Queries filter in five research areas: Therapy, Prognosis, Review, Qualitative, Causation (Etiology)   High Sensitivity is the broadest search, to include ALL relevant material. It may also include less relevant materials.   High Specificity is the most targeted search to include only the most relevant result set, may miss some relevant materials.   Best Balance retrieves the best balance between Sensitivity and Specificity.     &ndash;A detailed explanation of the strategies behind these limits can be found at http://hiru.mcmaster.ca/hiru/HIRU_Hedges_home.aspx          Popular Filters in Medline (via PubMed)   Medline (via Pubmed or Ovid) is the premier source for bibliographic coverage of biomedical literature.

Leave the box empty to include other sources in your search.   A publication is considered to be Scholarly if it is published for an academic audience by a recognized society with academic goals and missions.   A publication is considered to be Peer-reviewed if it has been assessed by other scholars in the same field for quality of scholarship, relevance to the field, and appropriateness for the journal. Most (but not all) scholarly publications are peer reviewed. Some trade publications and magazine are also peer reviewed.                          Comments (0)                                         Limiting to \"Peer Reviewed\" Articles                 \"Peer reviewed\" (or \"refereed\" journals) are those that subject content to a critical review by other experts in the field prior to accepting a manuscript for publication. Thus, limiting your literature search to the peer-reviewed journals ensures a higher level of scholarship and research methodology. Magazines, trade journals, and newspapers tend to be \"non-peer-reviewed,\" meaning perhaps just the editor or someone who is not an expert in the field has reviewed the content before publishing. How do you know if a journal citation is from a peer-reviewed journal?     You can do a journal title search in Ulrich's Global Serials Directory .

Start by asking the following questions:     Who is the author?   Was it published by a credible source? (a scholarly journal? a popular periodical, e.g, newspaper or magazine? an association? an organization?)   Is the source a book? A journal article? (Usually a journal name will be in italics.) Use a library catalog like Bobcat , to find a book in Bobst Library.   What is the date of publication?   What is the data or research based on? If it is a scholarly article, is there a \"Methods\" section?   Is there a reference list at the end of the document? From the reference list, you can assess currency of the information, credibility of the sources, level of evidence of the source material.     Tips for determining the \"level of evidence\" for an article.     Use the evidence pyramid or scheme supplied by your professor.     One approach to levels of evidence is linked here at the Centre for Evidence Based Medicine.       Understanding Research Study Designs ( downloadable pdf ) (University of Minnesota)       To track down a journal citation, select an article database (PubMed, CINAHL, PsycINFO etc.) using the author, article title, OR journal title.   Consult database tutorials for help with #2.   Other tools for tracking down a citation not easily found in databases: scholar.google.com OR google.com Googling may provide a path to a more obscure document or report.   Within the article database, notice the \"Publication Type\" field for an individual citation. There is often an indication that a citation is a \"randomized controlled trial,\" a \"case report,\" a \"Review\" article, etc.   Caution, a \"review\" is not necessarily a \"systematic review.\" Even if the title or abstract says \"systematic review,\" carefully evaluate whether it is a true systematic review or merely a literature/narrative review.   Look at the article Abstract. Often an abstract will indicate the research design or methodology. This can indicate the level of evidence.   Link to the Full Text of an article; then look for the Methods section to review how the research was conducted.   Use critical appraisal tools (CASP, PRISMA, etc.) to fully appraise article evidence.   If you have difficulty tracking down a citation in a reference list using the above tips, consider this a potential indication of the quality of the original document. Perhaps a typo or mistake is the result of careless information. What does that tell you about the quality of the evidence?

Literature reviews are secondary sources and as such, do not report any new or original experimental work.\" ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature review )   Integrative review: A method that includes and synthesizes both experimental and nonexperimental research, such as qualitative studies (Whittemore &amp; Knafl, 2005)   Systematic review: from the Cochrane Handbook:   \"A systematic review attempts to collate all empirical evidence that fits pre-specified eligibility criteria in order to answer a specific research question. It uses explicit, systematic methods that are selected with a view to minimizing bias, thus providing more reliable findings from which conclusions can be drawn and decisions made (Antman 1992, Oxman 1993) . The key characteristics of a systematic review are:       a clearly stated set of objectives with pre-defined eligibility criteria for studies;       an explicit, reproducible methodology;       a systematic search that attempts to identify all studies that would meet the eligibility criteria;       an assessment of the validity of the findings of the included studies, for example through the assessment of risk of bias; and       a systematic presentation, and synthesis, of the characteristics and findings of the included studies.         Many systematic reviews contain meta-analyses....\"    Meta-analysis:    \"Meta-analysis is the use of statistical methods to summarize the results of independent studies (Glass 1976). By combining information from all relevant studies, meta-analyses can provide more precise estimates of the effects of health care than those derived from the individual studies included within a review ... They also facilitate investigations of the consistency of evidence across studies, and the exploration of differences across studies.\" (Higgins JPT &amp; Green S, 2011)    Conducting a \"Review of the Literature\"      Locating an existing Review article :        Search pre-synthesized sources of reviews, such as the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, the Joanna Briggs EBP database, etc.    Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses are also searchable in individual databases:              CINAHL Plus via Ebsco : Use Refine Search tab to limit by Publication type: \"systematic review.\"               MEDLINE via Ovid: Enter your search query.

PsycINFO (via Ovid): When you have performed a search by topic in PsycINFO, you may then choose to restrict your search to one or more &ldquo;Methodology,&rdquo; e.g. \"systematic review.\"             Preparing to conduct and publish your own review?     Begin with a scoping search to locate existing literature syntheses: \"... a scoping review is an iterative process whereby existing literature is identified, examined and conceptually mapped, and where gaps are identified. Think of a scoping review as a first step in doing a systematic review or large study.\" ( http://hlwiki.slais.ubc.ca/index.php/Scoping_studies )       References:     Garrard, J.

Rather, you are to view a reference, follow up if possible by looking at the book, the website, or an citation in a database, or possibly the full text. But it may not be available. (What does that tell you?) You might have to evaluate the level of evidence as well as whether it is primary or secondary source just on the basis on the reference citation itself and the information given (the year, the organization, etc).   Hints:     If you DO have a citation to a scholarly article, look it up in one of the health sciences databases like PubMed or CINAHL . If you locate it, notice the \"publication type,\" an indication of the level of evidence. Is it an original (primary) study? Or a secondary synthesis? Certainly link to the full text of the article if available.   If you have a web link, even a partial web link, evaluate the strength and quality of the evidence based on what you find there. What audience is it aimed at? Consumers or professionals? Who are the authors?   Use the evidence pyramid supplied by your professors. Often it is only by process of elimination that you can make a determination of whether it fits into a category or appears to be the opinion of \"experts.\"               Comments (0)                                              close                                                                 Description  Loading content... please wait                                     More Information  Loading content... please wait       Close window                           ^ Top  |  Home Page  |  Full Site                                           Powered by Springshare and iWebKit.
