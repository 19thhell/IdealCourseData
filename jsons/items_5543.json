Established in 1958 as NYU's first global academic center, NYU Madrid offers students with little or no Spanish language skills a Fast-Track Spanish for Beginners program that includes a set of four courses designed to bring them to proficiency in one semester. During the spring semester, students with advanced Spanish language skills may enroll in up to two courses at the Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de Madrid (UAM). Homestays with Spanish host families encourage students to build a deeper connection with Spanish culture and provides an opportunity to practice speaking in a more casual environment. An Intercambio Program brings NYU Madrid students together with local college students to practice their Spanish and make friends.       Madrid is the political and cultural center of Spain and one of the liveliest and friendliest capital cities in Europe, replete with magnificent architecture, world-class museums, and delicious cuisine. Students at NYU Madrid enjoy a semester of rich cultural experiences that complement their studies, whether they\u2019re on a class trip to the Museo del Prado to learn firsthand about Goya's masterpieces or at an out-of-the way tapas bar on Cava Baja.

Established in 1958 as NYU's first global academic center, NYU Madrid offers students with little or no Spanish language skills a Fast-Track Spanish for Beginners program that includes a set of four courses designed to bring them to proficiency in one semester. During the spring semester, students with advanced Spanish language skills may enroll in up to two courses at the Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de Madrid (UAM). Homestays with Spanish host families encourage students to build a deeper connection with Spanish culture and provides an opportunity to practice speaking in a more casual environment. An Intercambio Program brings NYU Madrid students together with local college students to practice their Spanish and make friends.       Madrid is the political and cultural center of Spain and one of the liveliest and friendliest capital cities in Europe, replete with magnificent architecture, world-class museums, and delicious cuisine. Students at NYU Madrid enjoy a semester of rich cultural experiences that complement their studies, whether they\u2019re on a class trip to the Museo del Prado to learn firsthand about Goya's masterpieces or at an out-of-the way tapas bar on Cava Baja.

Madrid is the political and cultural center of Spain and one of Europe's most lively and charming cities. It boasts a history that goes back to the Middle Ages; from the 16th century on, it was the seat of a brilliant royal court. This is reflected in the city's rich architecture and abundance of monuments.   Contemporary Madrid is a clean and efficient city of wide boulevards, outstanding museums, monuments, theatres, and libraries. The city's public transportation-metro and buses-is first rate. Madrid is famous for its restaurants as well as its nightlife. The numerous caf\u00e9s are frequented by students, writers, artists, and journalists. Because of its location in the geographical center of the country, Madrid is also an ideal base for exploring the rest of the Iberian Peninsula and beyond through a network of rapid, modern bus and rail transportation. Students who have lived and studied in Madrid often look at that period as one of the most transforming experiences of their lives.           ACADEMICS   NYU Summer in Madrid offers Spanish language courses at all levels, including intensive study, as well as Spanish literature, culture, fine arts, history, and cinema courses in English or Spanish. Courses are taught by NYU Madrid faculty and Spanish university professors who are recognized experts in their fields. Students also enjoy a full range of cultural activities, seminars, and excursions led by experts in history, art, and architecture. Visits include the world-renowned Prado museum, other important museums and monuments, and Old Madrid, the &quot;Greenwich Village&quot; of this historic city. In addition, students' knowledge and understanding of Spain is broadened by excursions to other regions and cities such as Santiago de Compostella, Gij\u00f3n and Toledo.           HOUSING &amp; MEALS      The NYU Madrid academic center is two chalet-style buildings located in the beautiful El Viso neighborhood just a few Metro stops from the city center.     All students participating in the program are required to live in NYU-provided housing. The program arranges for students to live in Spanish homes, which is strongly recommended as the best way to encourage the use of Spanish and to immerse oneself in the rhythms of everyday life. Apartments are also available. Students are informed of their homestay families and apartments before arrival in Madrid.           EXCURSIONS   There is a three-day excursion as part of the Summer Program. Option A is Castilla-Leon and the Basque Country (Burgos, Bilbao, and Soria); Option B is Northern Spain: Oviedo and Gijon. Possible day trips include El Escorial, Toledo, and Segovia.           COURSES     Students must register for 8 points. It is strongly suggested that students register for one 4 point language course and one 4 point content course, or for one 8 point intensive language course.
