But despite what we might remember from our school days, it turns out that the story of Spanish immigration doesn\u2019t stop at the colonial heyday of old Florida\u2019s St. Augustine.   Between 1880 and 1930, four million Spaniards arrived in the Americas\u2014more than the previous four centuries (1492-1880) combined, explains James Fern\u00e1ndez, an associate professor in NYU\u2019s Department of Spanish and Portuguese Languages and Literatures. But this fact would probably surprise the descendants of these immigrants, in part because their ties to the past are looser than those of other ethnic communities. Fern\u00e1ndez has found that Spanish-Americans living in, say, Donora, Pa., tend not to know of similar communities in places like Cherryvalle, Kan., or even Tampa, Fla.. Whereas the contributions of Irish-Americans and Italian-Americans are celebrated and mythologized in museums and parades galore, U.S. cities offer few cultural landmarks commemorating the Spanish-American experience.   But Fern\u00e1ndez is out to change that. Since 2010, he and his collaborator, the Spanish filmmaker and journalist Luis Argeo, have been traveling the country to conduct interviews and collect photographs and documents that tell the all-but-forgotten story of the scores of Spanish immigrants who settled\u2014and quickly assimilated\u2014in towns from Vermont to Hawaii during the first decades of the 20th century. The grandson of Spanish immigrants who met and married in New York City in the 1920s, Fern\u00e1ndez says he grew up believing that his grandparents\u2019 journey here was unique\u2014a perception that his interview subjects often share.   \u201cThis has become a lesson about how public memory is inscribed in private photo albums,\u201d Fern\u00e1ndez says of the archiving project, which he calls \u201c Ni Frailes ni Conquistadores (Neither Friars nor Conquistadors): Spanish Immigrants in the U.S., 1898-1936.\u201d As the 80- or 90-year-old daughters and sons of Spanish immigrants, Fernandez\u2019s sources are often able to put names to faces in family photos\u2014but don\u2019t always know the significance of pictures that were taken when they were still in diapers.   \u201cVery often the owners of these photo albums can\u2019t see beyond their private, intimate meaning\u2014but to someone with a historical perspective, they often contain valuable information,\u201d Fern\u00e1ndez says. Among his own family\u2019s possessions, for example, Fern\u00e1ndez recently identified an unfamiliar man photographed with a group of his relatives as Jos\u00e9 Miaja, the Spanish Republican Army commander who led the defense of Madrid against siege by General Francisco Franco\u2019s troops during the Spanish Civil War.   For now, Fern\u00e1ndez\u2019s growing archive lives online , and with the students in his 2011 undergraduate seminar on Spain in New York he built a website marking historic Spanish sites at and around NYU\u2019s Greenwich Village campus, which overlaps the neighborhood once known as New Spain. He and Argeo have also built a Facebook page, called Spanish Immigrants in the United States , where they post four times a day, sharing documents, photographs, and newspaper clippings and soliciting the same from their growing following of more than 2,000. Photos they share of celebrities, like the glamorous Rita Hayworth, whose father emigrated from Spain, garner a predictable flurry of \u201clikes.\u201d And food? \u201cIt drives \u2019em crazy!\u201d Fern\u00e1ndez says. \u201cI can start a fight on Facebook over who makes the best chorizo, or where the best Christmas cookies come from.\u201d   But the social network has also proved a valuable scholarly tool: Fern\u00e1ndez and Argeo have planned trips to St. Louis, Mo., San Leandro, Ca., to meet with Spanish-Americans with whom they first connected through Facebook. Their main source in Cleveland, a former flight attendant who had been carefully preserving her Spanish grandparents\u2019 archive, also found their project through the page. No two family\u2019s histories are identical, of course, but part of Fern\u00e1ndez\u2019s charge is to stitch those apparently isolated stories into a broader narrative about an overlooked diaspora.   There were myriad reasons for leaving Spain in the first two decades of the 20th century: The Spanish economy was in shambles following the loss of its colonies in Cuba, the Philippines, Guam, and Puerto Rico after the Spanish-American War of 1898, and military conscription meant that young men could expect to die in similar bloody battles in Northern Africa as the former imperial power dwindled. Fleeing these conditions, many Spaniards moved first to Spanish-speaking Latin America, and then made their way from Mexico or Cuba to the United States. Others were recruited directly for work in specific industries, from sugarcane to canal digging to zinc mining.   \u201cAssimilation, for most of these folks, was incredibly fast and successful,\u201d Fern\u00e1ndez says\u2014which could be one reason few traces of Spanish identity remain in the communities where they settled. Another has to do with the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War in 1936. Fernandez suspects that much Spanish settlement in the United States was somewhat accidental: Immigrants who arrived in the U.S. in the 1910s and 1920s with no intention of planting roots here decided not to return home only after Spain\u2019s democratic government was overthrown in Francisco Franco\u2019s fascist coup. His hypothesis is supported by a curious pattern he\u2019s noticed in family documents\u2014a glut of U.S. naturalization papers dated 1939, \u201940, and \u201941 for people who\u2019d been in the country since 1920 or earlier.   Complicating things further is the fact that those who opposed Franco and supported Spain\u2019s democratic loyalists ended up being targeted as communists during the McCarthy era\u2014leading some Spanish families to keep quiet about their roots. It\u2019s a practice analogous to German-Americans abandoning their own native celebrations and associations in the years following World War I. \u201cWe\u2019ve even found cases of families destroying or tearing the inscriptions off of photographs,&quot; Fernandez says. In that sense, he says, the stories that descendants of immigrants tend to misremember or even obscure are often as illuminating as the family memories they cherish.   For Fern\u00e1ndez, \u201cNi frailes ni conquistadores\u201d is also a journey of personal discovery: Though he\u2019s taught Spanish language and literature for years, it wasn\u2019t until recently that he contemplated the intersections between his academic interests and his family history. \u201cFor years I taught Federico Garcia Lorca, who came to New York in 1929 and wrote one of his major books of poems, Poeta in Nueva York, here,\u201d Fern\u00e1ndez reflects. \u201cBut it never occurred to me that Lorca and abuelo [grandfather] inhabited the same sphere.\u201d   Reading Lorca\u2019s letters from New York back to his family in Spain, Fern\u00e1ndez found a mention of a lunch at a dive on the Hudson River that finally helped him to make the connection. \u201cLorca described the owner as an astute guy from Galicia who was selling bootleg liquor,\u201d he says. \u201cIt could\u2019ve been my grandfather serving that anise.\u201d   View the slideshow above to take Fern\u00e1ndez\u2019s historic tour through hidden Spanish-American outposts in the U.S.   Top photo: Cleveland Spanish community picnic, June 1942, courtesy of Laura Goyanes. Employment opportunities in the heavy industries (steel, rubber, etc.) in and around Cleveland attracted large numbers of Spanish immigrants to the area in the 1910s and \u201920s, among them the Galician-born father of Oscar-winning actor Martin Sheen, who lived and worked in Dayton.       \u2014Eileen Reynolds                                                                                                                                                         NYU Footer          Search      Directory      Campus Map      Events      Contact Us      Site Map      Copyright and Fair Use      Feedback         Unless otherwise noted, all content copyright New York University.

But despite what we might remember from our school days, it turns out that the story of Spanish immigration doesn\u2019t stop at the colonial heyday of old Florida\u2019s St. Augustine.   Between 1880 and 1930, four million Spaniards arrived in the Americas\u2014more than the previous four centuries (1492-1880) combined, explains James Fern\u00e1ndez, an associate professor in NYU\u2019s Department of Spanish and Portuguese Languages and Literatures. But this fact would probably surprise the descendants of these immigrants, in part because their ties to the past are looser than those of other ethnic communities. Fern\u00e1ndez has found that Spanish-Americans living in, say, Donora, Pa., tend not to know of similar communities in places like Cherryvalle, Kan., or even Tampa, Fla.. Whereas the contributions of Irish-Americans and Italian-Americans are celebrated and mythologized in museums and parades galore, U.S. cities offer few cultural landmarks commemorating the Spanish-American experience.   But Fern\u00e1ndez is out to change that. Since 2010, he and his collaborator, the Spanish filmmaker and journalist Luis Argeo, have been traveling the country to conduct interviews and collect photographs and documents that tell the all-but-forgotten story of the scores of Spanish immigrants who settled\u2014and quickly assimilated\u2014in towns from Vermont to Hawaii during the first decades of the 20th century. The grandson of Spanish immigrants who met and married in New York City in the 1920s, Fern\u00e1ndez says he grew up believing that his grandparents\u2019 journey here was unique\u2014a perception that his interview subjects often share.   \u201cThis has become a lesson about how public memory is inscribed in private photo albums,\u201d Fern\u00e1ndez says of the archiving project, which he calls \u201c Ni Frailes ni Conquistadores (Neither Friars nor Conquistadors): Spanish Immigrants in the U.S., 1898-1936.\u201d As the 80- or 90-year-old daughters and sons of Spanish immigrants, Fernandez\u2019s sources are often able to put names to faces in family photos\u2014but don\u2019t always know the significance of pictures that were taken when they were still in diapers.   \u201cVery often the owners of these photo albums can\u2019t see beyond their private, intimate meaning\u2014but to someone with a historical perspective, they often contain valuable information,\u201d Fern\u00e1ndez says. Among his own family\u2019s possessions, for example, Fern\u00e1ndez recently identified an unfamiliar man photographed with a group of his relatives as Jos\u00e9 Miaja, the Spanish Republican Army commander who led the defense of Madrid against siege by General Francisco Franco\u2019s troops during the Spanish Civil War.   For now, Fern\u00e1ndez\u2019s growing archive lives online , and with the students in his 2011 undergraduate seminar on Spain in New York he built a website marking historic Spanish sites at and around NYU\u2019s Greenwich Village campus, which overlaps the neighborhood once known as New Spain. He and Argeo have also built a Facebook page, called Spanish Immigrants in the United States , where they post four times a day, sharing documents, photographs, and newspaper clippings and soliciting the same from their growing following of more than 2,000. Photos they share of celebrities, like the glamorous Rita Hayworth, whose father emigrated from Spain, garner a predictable flurry of \u201clikes.\u201d And food? \u201cIt drives \u2019em crazy!\u201d Fern\u00e1ndez says. \u201cI can start a fight on Facebook over who makes the best chorizo, or where the best Christmas cookies come from.\u201d   But the social network has also proved a valuable scholarly tool: Fern\u00e1ndez and Argeo have planned trips to St. Louis, Mo., San Leandro, Ca., to meet with Spanish-Americans with whom they first connected through Facebook. Their main source in Cleveland, a former flight attendant who had been carefully preserving her Spanish grandparents\u2019 archive, also found their project through the page. No two family\u2019s histories are identical, of course, but part of Fern\u00e1ndez\u2019s charge is to stitch those apparently isolated stories into a broader narrative about an overlooked diaspora.   There were myriad reasons for leaving Spain in the first two decades of the 20th century: The Spanish economy was in shambles following the loss of its colonies in Cuba, the Philippines, Guam, and Puerto Rico after the Spanish-American War of 1898, and military conscription meant that young men could expect to die in similar bloody battles in Northern Africa as the former imperial power dwindled. Fleeing these conditions, many Spaniards moved first to Spanish-speaking Latin America, and then made their way from Mexico or Cuba to the United States. Others were recruited directly for work in specific industries, from sugarcane to canal digging to zinc mining.   \u201cAssimilation, for most of these folks, was incredibly fast and successful,\u201d Fern\u00e1ndez says\u2014which could be one reason few traces of Spanish identity remain in the communities where they settled. Another has to do with the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War in 1936. Fernandez suspects that much Spanish settlement in the United States was somewhat accidental: Immigrants who arrived in the U.S. in the 1910s and 1920s with no intention of planting roots here decided not to return home only after Spain\u2019s democratic government was overthrown in Francisco Franco\u2019s fascist coup. His hypothesis is supported by a curious pattern he\u2019s noticed in family documents\u2014a glut of U.S. naturalization papers dated 1939, \u201940, and \u201941 for people who\u2019d been in the country since 1920 or earlier.   Complicating things further is the fact that those who opposed Franco and supported Spain\u2019s democratic loyalists ended up being targeted as communists during the McCarthy era\u2014leading some Spanish families to keep quiet about their roots. It\u2019s a practice analogous to German-Americans abandoning their own native celebrations and associations in the years following World War I. \u201cWe\u2019ve even found cases of families destroying or tearing the inscriptions off of photographs,&quot; Fernandez says. In that sense, he says, the stories that descendants of immigrants tend to misremember or even obscure are often as illuminating as the family memories they cherish.   For Fern\u00e1ndez, \u201cNi frailes ni conquistadores\u201d is also a journey of personal discovery: Though he\u2019s taught Spanish language and literature for years, it wasn\u2019t until recently that he contemplated the intersections between his academic interests and his family history. \u201cFor years I taught Federico Garcia Lorca, who came to New York in 1929 and wrote one of his major books of poems, Poeta in Nueva York, here,\u201d Fern\u00e1ndez reflects. \u201cBut it never occurred to me that Lorca and abuelo [grandfather] inhabited the same sphere.\u201d   Reading Lorca\u2019s letters from New York back to his family in Spain, Fern\u00e1ndez found a mention of a lunch at a dive on the Hudson River that finally helped him to make the connection. \u201cLorca described the owner as an astute guy from Galicia who was selling bootleg liquor,\u201d he says. \u201cIt could\u2019ve been my grandfather serving that anise.\u201d   View the slideshow above to take Fern\u00e1ndez\u2019s historic tour through hidden Spanish-American outposts in the U.S.   Top photo: Cleveland Spanish community picnic, June 1942, courtesy of Laura Goyanes.

Archives: The Use of Primary Sources in the Classroom            A Summer Institute for High School Teachers    Sponsored by the Abraham Lincoln Brigade Archives (ALBA)                        In cooperation with The King Juan Carlos I of Spain Center   of New York University, the NYU Steinhardt School of Culture, Education and   Human Development and The NYU Tamiment Library .

Place    New York University    Coordinator    James D. Fern&aacute;ndez, Associate Professor of Spanish, NYU    ALBA Project Director    Jeanne Houck, Executive Director, ALBA    Guest participants (partial list)    Peter N. Carroll, Chair, Board of Governors, Abraham Lincoln Brigade Archives; Lecturer   of History, Stanford University   Robert Cohen, Chair, Teaching and Learning, Steinhardt, NYU   Juan Salas, PhD Candidate, Performance Studies, Tisch School of the Arts   Jordana Mendelson, Associate Professor, Spanish and Portuguese, NYU    Eligible applicants    Any full-time teacher in a public high school working in the Humanities or Social   Sciences, including the Spanish language (eg. History, Social Studies, English,   Spanish, Art, etc.). Preference will be give to cross-disciplinary teams from   the same school (e.g. one History and one Spanish teacher from the same school)   Applicants are therefore encouraged to enlist colleagues from other disciplines   in their schools to apply.    Stipend and benefits    All teachers chosen to participate in the program will eligible for a $600 stipend,   a package of curricular materials (books and DVDs) valued at about $200, and   a certificate of participation. The stipend will be paid in two parts: half   upon satisfactory participation in the Institute, half upon completion of lesson   plans/curriculum modules assigned during the Institute.    Description    The study of a war is not just about conflict and battles, but more importantly   about how and why a country chooses to fight&mdash;or not to fight. The Spanish Civil   War was the &ldquo;Vietnam&rdquo; or &ldquo;Iraq&rdquo; of the 1930s, an early battleground of World   War II that forced Americans in all walks of life to take sides. Some, like   the men and women volunteers of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade, actually went   off to war in violation of U.S. neutrality laws. Others supported the military-led   uprising against the democratically elected government of Spain, sent aid to   Franco&#39;s rebel forces, and urged the United States to intervene on behalf of   Franco--or at least to maintain a neutrality that served Franco&#39;s interests.   This program is inspired by the recent acquisition by NYU of the complete archives   of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade. These archives include thousands of personal   letters, photographs, posters and other original materials from participants   in the war. This unique collection offers a special opportunity for high school   teachers to introduce their students to the use of primary source materials   in learning about history and the relationship of war to society and American   culture. Workshop participants will have direct access to the Archives, and   access will be further extended to their students through the web. The opportunities   for original historical exploration by high school students are outstanding.   Moreover, the Spanish Civil War, because of its great complexity, is a very   difficult subject to teach at any level, and especially in the high school   grades. But the issues raised by that war are very much alive today. By making   these archives, and this professional development workshop, available to high   school teachers, we hope to renew interest in study of the War as an important   historical laboratory. High school teachers will work directly with University   faculty and archivists to develop lesson plans specifically geared to high   school classes. We hope that these lessons will enable us to assemble a curriculum   which can be made available to high schools all over the country.    Objectives    To foster professional and curricular development of public school teachers;   to enable ALBA to learn more about the curricular needs of public school teachers   for the purpose of developing a curriculum that can be widely used in high   schools; to increase awareness about, and make use of, the unique resources   at NYU related to the Spanish Civil War and US participation in that conflict;   to explore a crucial episode in world history and US history from multiple   perspectives (history, literature, visual arts, etc.); to examine these issues   as a case study of the links between democratic principles and foreign policy   decisions; to discuss the various sources of historical understanding, and   how to work with, teach, and interpret those sources.    Outcomes    Participants will enjoy a week of intense professional and curricular development,   while meeting a group of leading scholars and working with a set of unique   primary sources. ALBA will learn about the curricular needs of public school   teachers, which will help the organization as it plans subsequent educational/curricular   initiatives. After the institute, participants will be expected to contribute   to a compilation of lesson plans, curriculum modules, etc. that will be circulated   among the participants, and other high school teachers, and posted on the ALBA   website.
