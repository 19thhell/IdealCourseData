The NYU Print Studio is dedicated to an environment where this range is encouraged along with experimentation and personal exploration.    The print studio, with 14' high ceilings and northern light, is equipped to realize ideas in multiple techniques, including silkscreen (photo-process darkroom), etching (two Charles Brand etching presses), relief print, book arts and letterpress (Vandercook UNI-1 press), digital imaging/printing (Epson 4900 Archival Printer, Epson scanner, AccuRIP software, Xante PostScript large formate laser printer), as well as Departmental facilities for laser cutting and 3-D printing. New York City at large provides a unique context for the study of print, which includes numerous special print exhibitions, vast museum collections, the annual New York City Print Week, and a vibrant diy, zine, and street art scene.

Painting and Drawing    The skills of painting and drawing enable the artist-student to transform ideas, be they internal or external, to the planarity of a piece of paper or canvas. This process of converting thoughts and signs into visually accessible shapes is complex and, at times, very direct. For this reason, painting and drawing will always be considered by many to be at the heart and soul of the visual arts.    The recent resurgence of interest in traditional hand made media speaks to many issues in contemporary life, and the demand for courses in these areas is higher than ever. Our painting and drawing faculty, led by Area Director Maureen Gallace, with the support of John Torreano, Jesse Bransford, Ross Bleckner, Peter Rostovsky, and Jason Tomme reflects the broad range of acclaimed artists working in classical materials.
