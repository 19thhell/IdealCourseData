Once you have selected a topic and discussed it with your instructor you will want to start your research. To start looking for materials in British History you should start with two items: the American Historical Association 's published bibliography, Guide to Historical Literature , and the preeminent database for articles on British history, Historical Abstracts . These two items serve different purposes.     The two volume  Guide to Historical Literature  is a listing of the most important books -- usually in the English language --- by topic, and thus is invaluable to learning what is the past scholarship in the field, including what are some of the debates and who are the leading scholars on a specific topic. The pages relevant to this course are in volume 1, Section 24, Britian and Ireland Since 1760. This section opens four page introduction by R.K. Webb, a distinguished specialist on the field. the section is divided into eighteen topics and thirty-nine sub-topics with 471 titles listed, each with a signed short abstract by a specialist. Using relevant titles gleaned from the section you should then check them against Bobcat to find out not only if the library owns the book, but also what the Library of Congress considers the subject(s) to be. Using these library subject headings in the catalogue will give you a number of other published works, but also -- and importantly -- similar books published since the Guide to Historical Literature . You should also mine the bibliographies of the books you find in Bobst to identify more works, but also to identify relevant primary sources such as newspapers, archival and manuscript collections and published works such as diaries, memoirs, etc.      Historical Abstracts   is the source for periodical literature in British history from 1450 to the present. It includes scholarship in  over fifty languages -- from Afrikans to Yiddish. Because it is online you can also search it using keywords, or use the database's own subject headings to explore and find more works. Historical Abstracts has a growing body of full-text but also contains references to material that is available to you in other formats, including H-Net reviews. You can identify reviews of the books you have picked to find out where other scholars have agreed or disagreed with their findings..    Aside from these two items, what other bibliographies and databases you chose to use will largely be driven by your specific research. This research guide tries to help guide your selections amongst in the vast number of available sources. You can also contact me for assistance. Buen provecho.

Parliament is divided into two Houses: the House of Commons whose members are elected and the House of Lords, which are not. Members of the House of Lords are of two types, bishops from the Church of England (Spiritual) and those from the Peerage (now appointed titles). According to the Parliament website the Commons is a \"Democratically elected house, makes laws and checks the work of Government\" and the Lords is \"A forum of expertise, making laws and providing scrutiny of Government.\" There are 550 members of the House of Commons (Members of Parliament, or MPs) and 786 Lords. Below are brief descriptions of the four currently functioning 'national' legislative bodies, with their logos and links to their websites. [Any quotations are from the body's own web-pages.]       The Parliament is properly known as the Parliament of United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. In 1707 the Treaty of Union between England and Scotland created the Parliament of Great Britain from the Parliament of England and added Scottish members to both Houses. The 1800 Act of Union created the Parliament of Great Britain and Ireland, abolished the existing Parliament of Ireland, and added Irish members to both houses. In 1920 the government of Ireland Act created two parliaments in Ireland, Northern Ireland and Southern Ireland, while reducing Irish representation in Westminster. In 1922 the independent Irish Free State was created and in 1927 the name of Parliament was officially changed to the current Parliament of United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.      The Parliament of Northern Ireland existed from 1920 until 1972, with 52 members of Commons and 26 members of a Senate. Suspended in 1972 and then abolished in 1973, the Parliament of Northern Ireland was replaced with the Northern Ireland Assembly with 108 members.According to its web-site \"The Northern Ireland Assembly is the devolved legislature for Northern Ireland. It is responsible for making laws on transferred matters in Northern Ireland and for scrutinising the work of Ministers and Government Departments. The Assembly sits at Parliament Buildings, Stormont Estate, in Belfast. Members (MLAs) meet to debate issues; question Ministers; and make laws for the benefit of people in Northern Ireland. Each MLA represents her or his constituency, and there are 6 MLAs for each constituency.\"      In 1999 the Scottish Parliament (or P&agrave;rlamaid na h-Alba) was created with 129 members. \"Scotland was granted devolution by the passing of the Scotland Act in 1998 which means that Scotland has a parliament with &lsquo;devolved&rsquo; powers within the United Kingdom. Any powers which remain with the UK Parliament at Westminster are reserved. Reserved matters were set out in Schedule 5 of the Scotland Act. A basic breakdown is given below. Essentially the powers of the Scottish Parliament are set out by what it does not have legislative competence in rather than in what it can do.Devolved powers: Matters such as education, health and prisons, which used to be dealt with by the Parliament at Westminster, are now decided in Scotland. Reserved powers: Decisions (mostly about matters with a UK or international impact) are reserved and dealt with at Westminster.\"      The same year was also the founding and first meeting of The National Assembly for Wales (or Cynulliad Cenedlaethol Cymru ), which has 60 members.\"The National Assembly for Wales is the democratically elected body that represents the interests of Wales and its people, makes laws for Wales, and holds the Welsh government to account.\"           Comments (0)                                         Reference Works to Identify 20th Century Parliamentary Materials                 These breviates very useful for identifying specific parliamentary papers.

This is a rich and consequently complex database. It does not include debates (in Hansards, see below), the Journal , and a few other items. The dates of coverage are 1688 to the present. Below is the detailed secription of the tyoe of content included in the database:   Guide to Parliamentary Papers   From: http://parlipapers.chadwyck.com/infoCentre/hcppguide.jsp   As the working documents of government, the parliamentary papers encompass all areas of social, political,  economic and foreign policy, showing how issues were explored and legislation was formed. Many contributors  to the papers were found outside the official world, providing evidence or supplying memoranda to  committees and commissions. The labours and concerns of Matthew Arnold, John Stuart Mill, Michael Faraday,  Charles Babbage, Edwin Chadwick, Marconi, Keynes and Beveridge are recorded in these pages, alongside  thousands of others. The evidence gathered by numerous Committees and Royal Commissions influenced  public opinion and social and political philosophies as disparate as those of Marx, Dickens and Disraeli.   Before the advent of a fully formed Whitehall departmental system, Parliament was the main source of  public information, ordering the publication of papers, returns, reports and evidence on a grand scale.  These papers and reports are often fascinating and exhaustive in their detail. In an environment of  relatively inexpensive printing, the result was around 5,900 bound volumes and 4.2 million pages of  papers for the 19th century alone. An additional 5.5 million pages was added between 1901 and 2004.   HCPP includes digital versions of these sessional papers. It does not include debates (Hansard),  the House of Commons Journal, or daily business papers, such as Order papers and Votes and  Proceedings. These are outside the scope of a precise application of the term &lsquo;parliamentary papers&rsquo;.   Sessional papers, sometimes called &lsquo;blue books&rsquo;, were required for   the work of the House of Commons, providing information on matters of policy   and administration, and &lsquo;ordered by the House to be printed&rsquo;. They   fall into the following three categories:     Bills - drafts of legislation, to be reviewed through    various parliamentary stages. If the Bill passes through these stages, it    will become an Act of Parliament.   House Papers - documents resulting from the work of the    House and its Committees.   Command Papers - Government papers (from Ministers) conveying    information or decisions the Government wishes to draw to the attention    of the House, presented ' by Command of Her Majesty '.     As the parliamentary papers evolved, each of these categories acquired its   own unique numerical sequence. Prior to this, from the beginning of the 19th   century when papers first began to be bound into sessional volumes, all papers   consisted of a single, numbered series, with a new sequence beginning with   each session from 1801.   Within these categories, there are further classifications reflecting the   disparate nature of Parliament - its legislative function, its quasi-judicial   and inquisitorial role, and its duty to supervise and control the executive   functions of government:     Bills - drafts of legislation, to be reviewed through various   parliamentary stages. If the Bill passes through these stages, it will become   an Act of Parliament. e.g. 1842, (282) Bill for carrying into effect   Treaty between H.M. and Argentine Confederation for Abolition of Slave Trade .   Reports of Committees - Select or the Whole House. Appointed   to investigate issues of concern. e.g. 1844, (556), Select Committee   on State of Colony of New Zealand .   Reports of Commissioners - Commissions appointed by the   Crown to investigate social problems, to conduct inquiries into events, and   as a preparation for legislation. The Commission was made up of experts in   the field in question, who are not usually MPs. Alternatively, investigating   committees were sponsored by particular government departments, and reported   back to the Minister in question. e.g. 1851 (415) Report of Inquiry   into Fatal Collision near Clay Cross Station, on Midland Railway, May 1851    Accounts and Papers -         Accounts. Statistical information, originating primarily from the Treasury,    the Board of Trade and the War Office/Admiralty.   Papers    Correspondence from ambassadors, governors, army officers abroad.     Commercial, trade and navigation accounts   Statistical abstracts: judicial, taxation, etc   Census data.   Slavery and slave trade documents.   Treaties.           e.g. 1852-53 [1481] Census of Ireland 1851: Part I., Area, Population,   and Number of Houses, by Townlands and Electoral Divisions, County of Kildare ,   1854-55 (38) Return of Quantity of Coffee sent to Army in Crimea     The final three categories above were used until 1969. Thereafter, documents were classified only as Bills, House of Commons  Papers or Command papers.   Both Houses of Parliament, the Commons and the Lords, produce parliamentary   papers. Although HCPP is a collection of Commons papers, some from the Lords   are also included. This is because the Lords often presented papers to the   Commons, such as reports prepared by Lords Select Committees. These reports   were then included in the House of Commons Papers, and therefore appear in   HCPP.   House of Commons Parliamentary Papers Provides full-text access to the House of Commons Parliamentary Papers. The Parliamentary papers influenced public opinion and social and political philosophy, and provided a forum for ideas for hundreds of thinkers, among them Marconi, Keynes, and Beveridge. They are the working documents of government for all areas of social, political, economic and foreign policy, showing how issues were explored and legislation was formed.
