Students in the Executive LLM program may take summer exams using the remote proctor device for any online course or an on campus course with a corresponding online section. Other students who are located outside of the NYC area may petition to take exams using the remote proctor device, but should do so at the outset of the summer session. All summer exams must be taken on a computer using either the securexam software (for exams taken using the remote proctor device) or using exam4 for on campus exams. Take home exams are downloaded using the take home exam system, or THES.     Rescheduling   Summer examinations can only be rescheduled for documented health or other emergencies. Exceptions will not be made to accommodate bar examinations or bar review courses. Summer session students should not register for a course unless they are sure that they will be able to sit for the exam at its scheduled time. For a full discussion of the examination rescheduling policy, see the Examinations section of the Academic Policy Guide. Students meeting the criteria in the guide for a postponement should contact Academic Services.     Attendance   In cases where a student is excessively absent, the student may be denied a grade in, and credit for, the course without any notice, and the grade of WD or F/AB will be entered. Rules of the American Bar Association, the New York State Court of Appeals, other state high courts and the Law School itself all require regular classroom attendance. Students are advised that excessive absenteeism can result without further warning in: 1) grade lowering or 2) denial of permission to complete coursework and/or sit for the exam, and receipt of a grade of WD or F/AB.   Missing more than one-fifth of the classes for any course is presumptively excessive. Any student who finds himself or herself at risk of missing more than one-fifth of classes for any course should immediately speak with the instructor and/or the Assistant Dean for Student Affairs and explain the situation.   Faculty members may establish a higher standard of regular attendance than that described above, and may also take attendance, class participation, and the quality of class performance into account in determining the student's grade as long as the faculty member has, during the first week of class, announced an intention to do so or has included that intention in the syllabus or other class materials distributed in the first week of class.   More information on the attendance policy is available in the Academic Policy Guide.     Anonymous Grading   Examinations are graded anonymously at NYU School of Law; students may not write their names on exams. Instead, students must use their Examination Number. All students must obtain their Examination Number by logging into Albert . The four digit number is located on the Schedule screen on each student's Albert record. Students may not substitute their Social Security Number or Student Identification Number for their Examination Number. Students should remember to bring their Examination Number with them to the exam, as additional time cannot be allotted to students who fail to bring their Examination Numbers. In addition to their Examination Number, students must bring valid photo ID to the examination.     Additional Time   No additional time is given to foreign-educated students taking examinations for whom English is not their first language. However, dictionaries are permitted, unless the faculty member prohibits their use. Students with disabilities in need of accommodation should contact the Moses Center, 240 Greene Street, Fourth Floor, at (212) 998-4980. To preserve anonymity, students should not discuss accommodations with the course instructor.     Grading Guidelines   Non-mandatory grading guidelines adopted by the faculty are listed below. Percentages are rounded to the closest integer. Faculty are strongly encouraged to adhere to the guidelines. The guidelines do not apply to seminar courses, defined for this purpose to mean any course in which there are no more than 28 students taking the course for a letter grade. In classes in which the credit/fail grades are permitted, these percentages are calculated only using students taking the course for a letter grade.         A+   0-2%   (target 1%) (*mandatory cap)       A   7-13%   (target 10%)       A-   16-24%   (target 20%) (maximum for A tier = 31%)       B+   22-30%   (target 26%) Maximum grades above B = 57%       B   Remainder         B-   4-11%   (target 7-8%)       C   2-5%         D/F   0-5%             * To maintain the vitality of the A grade, the cap on the A+ grade is mandatory for all courses. However, at least one A+ can be awarded in every course in the law school. These rules apply even in courses, such as seminars, where fewer than 28 students are enrolled: only a single A+ can be awarded.     Changing Grades   After a professor has submitted a grade to the Office of Records and Registration, the professor may not change the grade unless he or she certifies in writing that it was incorrect as a result of a mechanical computation or transcription error. A grade may not be changed as a result of a reevaluation of a student's work. No grade may be changed for any reason after a student has graduated.     Reporting of Grades   Grades and transcripts may be obtained by logging into Albert after the exam period is over. Students who are in financial arrears will not be able to obtain transcripts.

Students in the Executive LLM program may take summer exams using the remote proctor device for any online course or an on campus course with a corresponding online section. Other students who are located outside of the NYC area may petition to take exams using the remote proctor device, but should do so at the outset of the summer session. All summer exams must be taken on a computer using either the securexam software (for exams taken using the remote proctor device) or using exam4 for on campus exams. Take home exams are downloaded using the take home exam system, or THES.     Rescheduling   Summer examinations can only be rescheduled for documented health or other emergencies. Exceptions will not be made to accommodate bar examinations or bar review courses. Summer session students should not register for a course unless they are sure that they will be able to sit for the exam at its scheduled time. For a full discussion of the examination rescheduling policy, see the Examinations section of the Academic Policy Guide. Students meeting the criteria in the guide for a postponement should contact Academic Services.     Attendance   In cases where a student is excessively absent, the student may be denied a grade in, and credit for, the course without any notice, and the grade of WD or F/AB will be entered. Rules of the American Bar Association, the New York State Court of Appeals, other state high courts and the Law School itself all require regular classroom attendance. Students are advised that excessive absenteeism can result without further warning in: 1) grade lowering or 2) denial of permission to complete coursework and/or sit for the exam, and receipt of a grade of WD or F/AB.   Missing more than one-fifth of the classes for any course is presumptively excessive. Any student who finds himself or herself at risk of missing more than one-fifth of classes for any course should immediately speak with the instructor and/or the Assistant Dean for Student Affairs and explain the situation.   Faculty members may establish a higher standard of regular attendance than that described above, and may also take attendance, class participation, and the quality of class performance into account in determining the student's grade as long as the faculty member has, during the first week of class, announced an intention to do so or has included that intention in the syllabus or other class materials distributed in the first week of class.   More information on the attendance policy is available in the Academic Policy Guide.     Anonymous Grading   Examinations are graded anonymously at NYU School of Law; students may not write their names on exams. Instead, students must use their Examination Number. All students must obtain their Examination Number by logging into Albert . The four digit number is located on the Schedule screen on each student's Albert record. Students may not substitute their Social Security Number or Student Identification Number for their Examination Number. Students should remember to bring their Examination Number with them to the exam, as additional time cannot be allotted to students who fail to bring their Examination Numbers. In addition to their Examination Number, students must bring valid photo ID to the examination.     Additional Time   No additional time is given to foreign-educated students taking examinations for whom English is not their first language. However, dictionaries are permitted, unless the faculty member prohibits their use. Students with disabilities in need of accommodation should contact the Moses Center, 240 Greene Street, Fourth Floor, at (212) 998-4980. To preserve anonymity, students should not discuss accommodations with the course instructor.     Grading Guidelines   Non-mandatory grading guidelines adopted by the faculty are listed below. Percentages are rounded to the closest integer. Faculty are strongly encouraged to adhere to the guidelines. The guidelines do not apply to seminar courses, defined for this purpose to mean any course in which there are no more than 28 students taking the course for a letter grade. In classes in which the credit/fail grades are permitted, these percentages are calculated only using students taking the course for a letter grade.         A+   0-2%   (target 1%) (*mandatory cap)       A   7-13%   (target 10%)       A-   16-24%   (target 20%) (maximum for A tier = 31%)       B+   22-30%   (target 26%) Maximum grades above B = 57%       B   Remainder         B-   4-11%   (target 7-8%)       C   2-5%         D/F   0-5%             * To maintain the vitality of the A grade, the cap on the A+ grade is mandatory for all courses. However, at least one A+ can be awarded in every course in the law school. These rules apply even in courses, such as seminars, where fewer than 28 students are enrolled: only a single A+ can be awarded.     Changing Grades   After a professor has submitted a grade to the Office of Records and Registration, the professor may not change the grade unless he or she certifies in writing that it was incorrect as a result of a mechanical computation or transcription error. A grade may not be changed as a result of a reevaluation of a student's work. No grade may be changed for any reason after a student has graduated.     Reporting of Grades   Grades and transcripts may be obtained by logging into Albert after the exam period is over. Students who are in financial arrears will not be able to obtain transcripts.

I find this odd in a few ways.   One way is that it produces a lot of false negatives . A false negative occurs when something is incorrectly labeled as &#8220;not good.&#8221; Think of the NBA. We could rank every player in the league by skill level from 1 to 500, and one player would necessarily be #500. There is a man who has played basketball his entire life with great success and has made it to the NBA! . . . where he is now the worst. He is the worst basketball player in the NBA, and that is truly unfair&#8211;this guy is an incredible basketball player who is only bad compared to the absolute best in the world.     At our orientation we were given an allegory of monkeys playing games in trees in a big jungle. In each tree, the cleverest monkey gets to do whatever she wants, and all the others respect her. But a day comes when each &#8220;cleverest monkey in the tree&#8221; moves to the same tree in the middle of the forest. Suddenly none of these monkeys are special anymore. NYU Law is supposed to be like this. The sharpest students from around the country are picked for the super tree. What happens then? I don&#8217;t really know. If we don&#8217;t have to compare ourselves to each other, then we just enjoy our intellectual company and play clever games that we couldn&#8217;t play before. (It is important to note that while this tree does involve a lot of fun and games, there is also a lot of reading to do, a whole lot. Unfortunately, I think the monkey analogy breaks down when we imagine them reading in their tree all day.)     I like the NBA analogy quite a bit.\u00a0Actually, in a convenient series of events, ESPN.com recently did rank all players from 1 to 500. Eddy Curry , a 29-year-old, 295-pound, 7-foot-tall NBA champion was ranked dead last (given a rating of 1.21 out of 10), with his former teammate Lebron James (9.99) at number one. Truthfully, NBA fans might argue that Eddy Curry is not a false negative. Instead, he is just an overweight dude who can&#8217;t play much basketball anymore. To this, Eddy Curry might rightly reply that they are just jealous. In fact, I bet Eddy Curry doesn&#8217;t care that you think he is bad at basketball. Why should he? I still think he would beat me one-on-one (it is also worth noting that in the 2011 version of this study, Eddy Curry was ranked #493 and he still didn&#8217;t care).   Another odd thing about the curve is what it incentivizes. I came to law school because I like school, I like education, and I wanted to learn the law and get a J.D. With or without grades, I would read my casebooks and ask questions in class and take my exams at year&#8217;s end. I came to law school on purpose. I wasn&#8217;t forced to come here. I am paying money to be here&#8212;-I don&#8217;t need grades to tell me to try. A curved grade may indirectly encourage learning, but it may also directly encourage me to just hope that other people do poorly. In a reverse NBA example, it is easy to become amazing at basketball in a curved system. If I moved to Mars, I would literally be the best player on the planet ( population 1 ).   But this is true of all competitions. Someone has to win and someone has to lose. Different people care different amounts about their final place in the rankings; for example, some people who run marathons try to win, while others just hope to finish. Though it is not entirely clear why law school is a competition at all.   Here is how I like to think of the curve: I am average. We are all average. Every one of us will get a &#8220;B.&#8221; I know this isn&#8217;t exactly true, but if we assume that the grades are centered around a &#8220;B&#8221; average with rare &#8220;A&#8221; or &#8220;C&#8221; grades, and even rarer &#8220;A+&#8221; or failing grades, then we can feel free from pressure. It is no longer about the grade at the end of the year. As long as I do all the work, if I do my best and try to learn as much as I can then I will get my stamp of approval at the end of the year (in this case, the letter &#8220;B&#8221; on a sheet of paper), and that is it. Only extraordinary circumstance, maybe luck, will change that. I like this, because in the NBA it is okay to be average. I even think it is okay to be the worst.
