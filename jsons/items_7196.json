We have always believed that the best setting in which  to pursue psychoanalytic training incorporating these principles is at a  university with an established tradition of intellectual inquiry, freedom of  thought, interdisciplinary exchange, and a commitment to research.      Our Psychoanalytic Training Program offers a diverse curriculum including  Contemporary Freudian, Interpersonal, Relational, and Independent orientations,  and is unique in offering comprehensive training in each of these approaches.  Candidates in psychoanalytic training are encouraged to sample courses and  supervisors from each of the orientations although they are also free to  concentrate in any one of them. Each orientation features an internationally  known teaching faculty and outstanding clinical supervisors who have made a  significant contribution to the field of psychoanalysis.      Currently, with over 600 graduates, Postdoc is not only the largest  psychoanalytic training program in New York, but in the entire country, and  also offers Advanced Specialization in Trauma Studies and Couple &amp; Family  Therapy. The Postdoctoral Program was the first psychoanalytic training program  to be fully accredited by The Accreditation  Council for Psychoanalytic Education Inc.               CODE OF ETHICAL CONDUCT       The New York University Postdoctoral Program in  Psychotherapy &amp; Psychoanalysis has long enjoyed a reputation for  professional, clinical and educational excellence. This reputation is founded  on the maintenance of the highest ethical standards for our postdoctoral  students and faculty. It is expected that all students and faculty members  adhere to the highest ethical standards of the university and of the  profession. The purpose of the New York University Code of Ethical Conduct is  to highlight the essential elements of an ethical and responsible environment  in which the central educational goals of the University can be met effectively  and efficiently. The Code articulates ethical standards, principles and  policies which all NYU members--at home and abroad--are expected to uphold by  incorporating these values into their daily University activities. For  information on New York University's Code of Ethics and for further information  on related policies and resources see: http://www.nyu.edu/about/policies-guidelines-compliance/compliance/code-of-ethical-conduct.html       Additionally, it is expected that all students will  strictly adhere to the American Psychological Association's (APA) Ethical  Principles of Psychologists and Code of Conduct:  http://www.apa.org/ethics/code/index.aspx      or to the equivalent code of ethics of the mental  health discipline in which the student is licensed.       All  students are to familiarize themselves with the GSAS Policies and Procedures  manual which may be found at:  http://gsas.nyu.edu/page/policiesprocedures   \u261e For more information about Postdoc or the application instructions: email gsas.postdoc@nyu.edu or call 212.998.7890                         Related Information         &gt; Letter from the Director       &gt; Administration       &gt; History of the Program                 Useful Links         &gt; NYU Public Directory                                           Sitemap       |      Contact Us       |              &copy; New York University       |       Arts and Science"}]},

We have always believed that the best setting in which  to pursue psychoanalytic training incorporating these principles is at a  university with an established tradition of intellectual inquiry, freedom of  thought, interdisciplinary exchange, and a commitment to research.      Our Psychoanalytic Training Program offers a diverse curriculum including  Contemporary Freudian, Interpersonal, Relational, and Independent orientations,  and is unique in offering comprehensive training in each of these approaches.  Candidates in psychoanalytic training are encouraged to sample courses and  supervisors from each of the orientations although they are also free to  concentrate in any one of them. Each orientation features an internationally  known teaching faculty and outstanding clinical supervisors who have made a  significant contribution to the field of psychoanalysis.      Currently, with over 600 graduates, Postdoc is not only the largest  psychoanalytic training program in New York, but in the entire country, and  also offers Advanced Specialization in Trauma Studies and Couple &amp; Family  Therapy. The Postdoctoral Program was the first psychoanalytic training program  to be fully accredited by The Accreditation  Council for Psychoanalytic Education Inc.               CODE OF ETHICAL CONDUCT       The New York University Postdoctoral Program in  Psychotherapy &amp; Psychoanalysis has long enjoyed a reputation for  professional, clinical and educational excellence. This reputation is founded  on the maintenance of the highest ethical standards for our postdoctoral  students and faculty. It is expected that all students and faculty members  adhere to the highest ethical standards of the university and of the  profession. The purpose of the New York University Code of Ethical Conduct is  to highlight the essential elements of an ethical and responsible environment  in which the central educational goals of the University can be met effectively  and efficiently. The Code articulates ethical standards, principles and  policies which all NYU members--at home and abroad--are expected to uphold by  incorporating these values into their daily University activities. For  information on New York University's Code of Ethics and for further information  on related policies and resources see: http://www.nyu.edu/about/policies-guidelines-compliance/compliance/code-of-ethical-conduct.html       Additionally, it is expected that all students will  strictly adhere to the American Psychological Association's (APA) Ethical  Principles of Psychologists and Code of Conduct:  http://www.apa.org/ethics/code/index.aspx      or to the equivalent code of ethics of the mental  health discipline in which the student is licensed.
