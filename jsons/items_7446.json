In short, we are the premier training  ground for future music moguls.     How We Define \u201cCreative Entrepreneur\u201d A passionate self-starter who draws on his/her innovative  vision and business acumen \u2013 often with unconventional flair \u2013 to launch a  successful, unique enterprise.

By offering business courses and studio training in  tandem with a range of historical-critical studies, we encourage students to  assume leadership roles in the art and business of creating and selling  recorded music.      Seven Types of Creative Entrepreneurs The Clive Davis Institute recognizes seven main types of creative Entrepreneurs in music: Executive Entrepreneurs, Producer Entrepreneurs, Performer Entrepreneurs, Tech-Preneurs, Songwriter Entrepreneurs, Social Entrepreneurs and Journalist Entrepreneurs. **ENTREPRENEUR WITH AN EXECUTIVE FOCUS ** Do you want to eventually launch and operate a record label, a live music venue, music festival, a retail store, an artist management company, or become involved in A&amp;R, marketing, branding, touring, booking or promotion? If you want to be chiefly involved in the business of creating, marketing, managing, and distributing music beyond producing or performing, you may be what we describe as an aspiring executive entrepreneur. Examples of renowned executive entrepreneurs: Virgin Records founder Richard Branson ; Atlantic Records founder Ahmet Ertegun ; Arista and J Records founder Clive Davis ; Motown founder Berry Gordy ; Downtown Records co-founder and CEO Josh Deutsch ; Geffen Records and Dreamworks founder David Geffen ; Def Jam co-founder Russell Simmons ; Vested in Culture/Epic Records President Sylvia Rhone ; Atlantic Records Group Chairman/COO Julie Greenwald ; Whitesmith Entertainment co-founder Emily White ; Fania Records co-founder Johnny Pachecho ; Senior VP of Concerts/Head of Contemporary Rock at ICM Marsha Vlasic ; concert promoter Bill Graham ; management titan Irving Azoff , Coachella Music Festival founder Paul Tollett ; artist manager and media impresario Simon Fuller .  ** ENTREPRENEUR WITH A SOCIAL FOCUS ** Are you interested in one day launching a music business venture that has a social or philanthropic mission, or seek to use music to call attention to an existing social issue, or that aims to bring about transformative change affecting communities and groups of people? If so, you may be an aspiring social entrepreneur. Examples of renowned social entrepreneurs: Lauren Sullivan and Adam Gardner , founders of Reverb; John Carlin and Leigh Blake , founders of the Red Hot Project; Russell Simmons , founder of Rush Philanthropic Arts Foundation; Daniel Glass and Bob Caviano , the founders of Lifebeat; and artists like Bob Geldof , John Legend , Alicia Keys , Bono , Jack Johnson , and Peter Gabriel all leveraged their artistic success to emerge as social entrepreneurs. ** ENTREPRENEUR WITH A TECHNOLOGY FOCUS ** Do you think you have the skills to become a technology visionary who starts and launches a music venture for the Internet, mobile or any other form of new/emergent media? If so, you may be an aspiring entrepreneur with a focus on technology, or what we call a music tech-preneur: someone who leverages technology to develop new innovative ways to create, produce, consume, market, broadcast, promote, or distribute music. Examples of famous tech-preneurs: founder of Spotify Daniel Ek ; founder of Pandora Tim Westergren ; StageIt Founder and CEO Evan Lowenstein ; Section 101 Founder and CEO Liz Leahy ; founder of Songify and CEO of app development company Khu.sh Prerna Gupta ; founder of Soundcloud Alexander Ljung ; co-founder of Beats Electronics Dr. Dre . ** ENTREPRENEUR WITH A PRODUCTION FOCUS ** Do you want to become a renowned producer or DJ who chiefly works \u201cbehind the glass\u201d in the record studio?

This browser will not display the photo gallery correctly.                   The Clive Davis Department of Recorded Music at Tisch School of the Arts, NYU is proud to have the great performer-songwriter-producer Leon Ware residing with us in the department this week, in conjunction with our ongoing Motown U conversation series. For the uninitiated, the Detroit born Mr. Ware is one of the great under-appreciated songwriters and producers. He helped craft the sound of sensual soul music in the 70s and he\u2019s best known for crafting Marvin Gaye\u2019s classic 1976 I Want You \u2013 a deeply challenging and complex album of romantic melancholy. No study of Motown is complete without some attention to the work of Leon Ware. The delicate, sensual Leon Ware sound rippled throughout the industry and artists like Todd Rundgren, Massive Attack, Madonna, and John Legend would later praise his work and cite it as a source of inspiration. In the 1990s, r&amp;b artist Maxwell sought out Leon Ware to help him craft his groundbreaking Maxwell\u2019s Urban Hang Suite album. Among Leon Ware\u2019s many hits songs: \u201cI Wanna Be Where You Are\u201d for Michael Jackson, \u201cInside My Love\u201d for Minnie Riperton, \u201cIf I Ever Lose This Heaven\u201d for Quincy Jones/ The Average White Band, and \u201cSumthin\u2019 Sumthin\u2019\u201d for Maxwell. A heavily sampled songwriter, he has had many solo projects for major labels and he is currently signed to Concord/Universal: his most recent album was 2008\u2019s critically acclaimed Moon Ride. Leon Ware will be visiting Recorded Music classes this week as a guest speaker. And on 10/9 he will headline a special event at the Audio Engineering Society convention to discuss the songwriting and producing behind Marvin Gaye\u2019s classic album I Want You. We\u2019ve also arranged a secret performance/discussion industry event while he\u2019s here.
