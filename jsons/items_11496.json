conceptual, empirical, policy-oriented \u2014 that societies everywhere face today. How do different political systems affect policy-making? What are the intrinsic and instrumental virtues of democracy? Why do dictatorships survive in many countries, but evolve into democracies in others? Why do countries go to war? What are the connections between internal conflicts (such as civil war) and political or economic development? What are the main characteristics and causes of economic underdevelopment? Why are prosperity and stagnation distributed so unequally, both across countries and within them?                               Political Science: Distinguished Faculty Highlight     Ronald Rogowski, Global Distinguished Professor of Political Science, NYU Abu Dhabi                                                                                                                                 NYU Abu Dhabi is pleased to welcome Dr Ronald Rogowski , professor of comparative politics and political economy. Having served as the Chair of the Political Science Department at UCLA during a period of growing national prominence, Rogowski served as Editor-in-Chief of the American Political Science Review between 2007 and 2012, and has held research appointments at Harvard University (3 occasions), the Center for Advanced Study in Behavioral Sciences (Stanford), and Wissenschaftskolleg zu Berlin (2007-2008).                                                         His book Commerce and Coalitions (1989) explores how international trade shapes domestic political coalitions. In 1999, the American Political Science Association honored him by organizing a roundtable discussion to commemorate the tenth anniversary of its publication. His current research considers how the design of electoral systems affects a nation's economic policies. He has also investigated globalization, capital mobility, and the sources of price differentials across national boundaries.

The key research questions informing this project are: What conceptions do Somalis in Somalia, Ethiopia and the diaspora harbor to address historic and recent violence and how do these relate to Islamic, Somali customary and human rights law? What are the implications of these conceptions and plural legal orders for a place-based approach to transitional justice in protracted conflict?
