For information on policies relating to email at NYU, visit the   ITS Policies page of this website.    Access and Configurations   Email can be accessed via a web browser at email.nyu.edu , via   NYUHome or by using a mobile device or desktop program such as Thunderbird or Outlook. If you wish to access NYU Email via a mobile device or desktop program, configuration instructions can be found in the ServiceLink knowledge base .    Email Addresses &amp; Aliases   The format of your official NYU email address is YourNetID&#64;nyu.edu (e.g., aqe123&#64;nyu.edu), but you may also  set up a personal email address of your own choosing through NYUHome. Instructions for configuring this personal address can be found in the ServiceLink knowledge base . Note that personal email addresses are subject to limitations, see the   Appropriate Use of Email at New York University Policy and NYU Email: Personal email address limitations and FAQs for details.    NYU Groups and NYU Lists are available to create email aliases, group or departmental mailing lists, or forums. See When to use NYU Groups and NYU Lists for help in deciding which tool to use.      Spam &amp; Phishing   Spam is unsolicited bulk email. The key term is \"unsolicited\" &mdash; if you signed up for a mailing list (commercial or otherwise) which you no longer  wish to receive, that is not spam. The easy differentiation is that legitimate businesses will have a mailing policy posted on the site where you sign up  for the mail, and will give you correct information about how to unsubscribe. NYU Email powered by Google features built-in spam filtering.  For more information on spam, please see our  NYU Email: Removing spam from your inbox .    NYU Email powered by Google features built-in spam filtering. To read more about how it works and how to use it, see the ServiceLink knowledge base .    NYU recommends that you use the NYU Email web interface instead of email programs (Outlook, Thunderbird, iPhone, etc.). However, if you choose to use a desktop email client, you must create a filtering rule based on specific spam rating levels. Mail that matches the rule is then redirected into a folder of your choice and you can decide how you wish to handle the redirected messages. The filter level you select will determine the amount of spam you receive. If you find that you are receiving too much spam in your Inbox, try adjusting the level of filtering to be more strict. If you find that desired mail is being filtered, select a level that is less strict.    IMPORTANT: Keep in mind that some legitimate messages will end up in your spam folder if they exhibit characteristics of spam, for example, lots of capital letters, many exclamation points, or phrases such as \"click here.\" Therefore, it is important to check your spam folder regularly to ensure that you receive messages that may have been inadvertently flagged as spam.    Phishing messages appear to be sent from NYU, ITS, or other organizations affiliated with NYU requesting your personal information such as name, date of birth, password, etc. Do not reply to these messages. ITS will never request your password information. If a message informs you of an impending account closure or similar action unless you comply with its demands, it is often a sign that the message is a phishing scam. Do not comply with the request. To report phishing or spam attempts, please follow the instructions in the ServiceLink knowledge base .    NYU Email Direct   NYU Email Direct is a bulk email service through which pre-authorized NYU faculty, staff, and administrators can request to send an email message to a segment or segments of the University community or to the entire University community.

About Email at NYU   NYUHome and NYU-NET   NYUHome Email Addresses &amp; Aliases   Spam &amp; Phishing   NYU Email Direct        About Email at NYU   ITS provides email service to NYU faculty, staff, and students in degree or diploma programs,  both in the United States and overseas. For information on policies relating to email at NYU, visit the   ITS Policies page of this website.    Access and Configurations   Email can be accessed via a web browser at email.nyu.edu , via   NYUHome or by using a mobile device or desktop program such as Thunderbird or Outlook. If you wish to access NYU Email via a mobile device or desktop program, configuration instructions can be found in the ServiceLink knowledge base .    Email Addresses &amp; Aliases   The format of your official NYU email address is YourNetID&#64;nyu.edu (e.g., aqe123&#64;nyu.edu), but you may also  set up a personal email address of your own choosing through NYUHome. Instructions for configuring this personal address can be found in the ServiceLink knowledge base . Note that personal email addresses are subject to limitations, see the   Appropriate Use of Email at New York University Policy and NYU Email: Personal email address limitations and FAQs for details.    NYU Groups and NYU Lists are available to create email aliases, group or departmental mailing lists, or forums. See When to use NYU Groups and NYU Lists for help in deciding which tool to use.      Spam &amp; Phishing   Spam is unsolicited bulk email. The key term is \"unsolicited\" &mdash; if you signed up for a mailing list (commercial or otherwise) which you no longer  wish to receive, that is not spam. The easy differentiation is that legitimate businesses will have a mailing policy posted on the site where you sign up  for the mail, and will give you correct information about how to unsubscribe. NYU Email powered by Google features built-in spam filtering.  For more information on spam, please see our  NYU Email: Removing spam from your inbox .    NYU Email powered by Google features built-in spam filtering. To read more about how it works and how to use it, see the ServiceLink knowledge base .    NYU recommends that you use the NYU Email web interface instead of email programs (Outlook, Thunderbird, iPhone, etc.). However, if you choose to use a desktop email client, you must create a filtering rule based on specific spam rating levels. Mail that matches the rule is then redirected into a folder of your choice and you can decide how you wish to handle the redirected messages. The filter level you select will determine the amount of spam you receive. If you find that you are receiving too much spam in your Inbox, try adjusting the level of filtering to be more strict. If you find that desired mail is being filtered, select a level that is less strict.    IMPORTANT: Keep in mind that some legitimate messages will end up in your spam folder if they exhibit characteristics of spam, for example, lots of capital letters, many exclamation points, or phrases such as \"click here.\" Therefore, it is important to check your spam folder regularly to ensure that you receive messages that may have been inadvertently flagged as spam.    Phishing messages appear to be sent from NYU, ITS, or other organizations affiliated with NYU requesting your personal information such as name, date of birth, password, etc. Do not reply to these messages. ITS will never request your password information. If a message informs you of an impending account closure or similar action unless you comply with its demands, it is often a sign that the message is a phishing scam. Do not comply with the request. To report phishing or spam attempts, please follow the instructions in the ServiceLink knowledge base .    NYU Email Direct   NYU Email Direct is a bulk email service through which pre-authorized NYU faculty, staff, and administrators can request to send an email message to a segment or segments of the University community or to the entire University community. For more information, visit the NYU E-mail Direct page of this website.    Additional Support   Should you have any questions or concerns, please contact the IT Service Desk via email at AskITS@nyu.edu or by calling 212-998-3333.

See joined New York University Stern School of Business as Assistant Professor of Management and Organizations in July 2006. Professor See's research focuses on how workplace interactions and decisions practices are affected by the broader organizational context in which they are embedded. She is particularly interested in how cognitive and organizational contextual factors (such as uncertainty, power, and organizational structure) affect the flow of input or advice through the organizational hierarchy, as well as the downstream consequences of advice utilization for fairness, innovation, and corporate sustainability. Another area of research interest concerns the use of extreme goals in organizations. Professor See's research appears in leading business and disciplinary journals, including the Academy of Management Review, Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, Journal of Experimental Psychology, Personnel Psychology, and Operations Research, as well as in the edited volume, Thinking: Psychological Perspectives on Reasoning, Judgment, and Decision Making. Her research has won several awards and has been covered in a variety of media outlets, such as Forbes, The Wall Street Journal, ABC News, FOX news, and INC.      Before joining NYU Stern, Professor See spent two years as a visiting faculty member at the Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania. She has also worked extensively with executives as a feedback coach and instructor in the Leadership Program at Duke University. Prior to her academic career, she worked in Washington, DC as a consultant in the private sector and a research analyst at an environmental policy think tank.      Professor See holds a B.S. in Economics and English Literature from the University of Wisconsin-Madison and a Ph.D. in Business Administration from Duke University.
