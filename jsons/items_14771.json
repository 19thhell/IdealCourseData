It is a 1.5 credit graduate level course offered from August 25-29 at NYU.   You&rsquo;ll work in teams, getting your hands dirty talking to customers, partners, and competitors, as you encounter the chaos and uncertainty of how a startup actually works. It is a highly intensive, experiential class comprised of team presentations, customer interviews, and feedback from startup experts.   Each day will be a new adventure outside the classroom as you test each part of your business model and then share your hard earned knowledge with the rest of the class.   Who is this class for?      All NYU graduate students are eligible to apply (Masters, PhD, JD, MD).    You must apply to this course as part of a team (2-4 members per team).    All teams must enter the course with a startup idea they&rsquo;d like to pursue.     What should you expect?      Five intense days of primary customer research/interviews and team presentations, guided by best practices in entrepreneurship education.    Feedback from successful entrepreneurs and investors from the NYU and NYC startup community, including Steve Blank.    Startup culture &ndash; fast paced, direct, open, and tough.     This class is not about:      Lecture-style presentations by the faculty.    Researching online or in the library.    Writing a business plan.    Creating a PowerPoint slide deck for a VC presentation.    Building the &ldquo;hot-idea&rdquo; you have in mind.

It is a 1.5 credit graduate level course offered from August 25-29 at NYU.   You&rsquo;ll work in teams, getting your hands dirty talking to customers, partners, and competitors, as you encounter the chaos and uncertainty of how a startup actually works. It is a highly intensive, experiential class comprised of team presentations, customer interviews, and feedback from startup experts.   Each day will be a new adventure outside the classroom as you test each part of your business model and then share your hard earned knowledge with the rest of the class.   Who is this class for?      All NYU graduate students are eligible to apply (Masters, PhD, JD, MD).    You must apply to this course as part of a team (2-4 members per team).    All teams must enter the course with a startup idea they&rsquo;d like to pursue.     What should you expect?      Five intense days of primary customer research/interviews and team presentations, guided by best practices in entrepreneurship education.    Feedback from successful entrepreneurs and investors from the NYU and NYC startup community, including Steve Blank.    Startup culture &ndash; fast paced, direct, open, and tough.
