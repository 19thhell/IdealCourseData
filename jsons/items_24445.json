A study of the impact of capital punishment in the Caribbean republic is of particular interest because of its high level of death-penalty sentencing.   \u201cIt has been hard to measure capital punishment as a deterrent to murder in the U.S. because it is administered infrequently,\u201d explained Greenberg. \u201cBy contrast, in Trinidad and Tobago, the chances of actually being executed have historically been much higher.\u201d   In the United States, the death penalty was reinstated by states more than 30 years ago\u2014following a 1976 landmark Supreme Court ruling\u2014while capital punishment has not existed in Canada or in western Europe for several decades.   By contrast, Trinidad and Tobago had high rates of death-penalty sentencing and executions prior to a 1993 court ruling, which barred the death penalty for inmates on death row longer than five years, thereby reducing the number of executions and death-penalty sentences. Though the courts continue to impose death sentences, none has been carried out in more than a decade.    The researchers note that from 1955 to 1980, homicide rates were relatively stable in Trinidad and Tobago, ranging from 4.44 per 100,000 (1955) to 4.34 (1980) during this period. However, during this same stretch, executions ranged from a high of 16 in 1969 to zero between 1980 and 1993. By contrast, when executions rose to 11 in 1999, the murder rate rose in nearly every subsequent year until 2007, the last year calculated. In 2007, 391 homicides were recorded in Trinidad and Tobago\u2014a country with a population of just 1,328,412\u2014resulting in a rate of 29.4 per 100,000 population. This compares to a US homicide rate in the same year of 5.6 per 100,000 population.   The researchers acknowledged the role geography could play into the findings.   \u201cGeneralizations from Trinidad and Tobago to other settings must obviously be made cautiously,\u201d they wrote. \u201cEvery country has distinctive elements of culture, social structure, and social organization that may influence the way its population responds to criminal justice sanctions, including the death penalty.\u201d   The researchers acknowledged that murders in the republic have risen dramatically since 2000\u2014when executions ceased, even though death-penalty sentences have continued\u2014but maintained this change says little about the impact of capital punishment as a deterrent to murder.   \u201cWe can reject the argument that the cessation of executions brought about a big increase in murder in the last decade\u2014in earlier years, big swings in the execution rate had no visible effect and the 11 executions in 1999 brought about no detectable drop in homicides,\u201d explained Greenberg.

Music of Trinidad and Tobago          The Caribbean islands of Trinidad and Tobago are best known for calypso music and the homeland of the only instrument invented in the 20th century, is pan, also called steelpan or steeldrums. Other music forms that found roots on the island are soca, rapso, brass bands, chutney, parang, and yoruban shango. The arrival of African, Spanish, French, East Indian, and European people influenced these musics as well.  Calypso also called kaiso came from a West African form of communication among the slaves in Trinidad and Tobago. Calypsos rich rhythms and harmonious vocals are sometimes sung in French creole. It is very similar to the African griot (a traveling musician in West Africa) where the singer or calypsonian sometimes discusses political and social issues in the community through song. The competitive lyrics found in other styles including calypso also have roots in the griot/ storytelling West African tradition. Do you think you could be a calypsonian? Trinidads Calypso Pioneers Competition is looking for young talented calypsonians from all over the islands. Calypso has also spread to many other islands in the Caribbean. Even adults get involved with King and Queens Calypso and Soca competitions around the Carnival season. Carnival is a major event on the island. Some people wear elaborate costumes, which are also called mas. Not to mention one of the largest steelband orchestral competitions in the world, Panorama. Interestingly enough an underlying theme in Carnival and steelpan history is the act of oppression bringing new creations. Steelpan began with the banning of the African drum, then becoming the tamboo bamboo band, to pots, pans, and dustbins, and finally evolved into what we know as a wide array of steelpans.  Soca is a result of calypso added with Jamaican reggae, American soul, disco, and funk music. Its popularity has grown while making its way to American airwaves.   In addition to Trinidad and Tobagos styles of music R&B, Classical, and Jazz can be heard on the steelpans as well.  Check out artists like Lord Kitchener, Mighty Sparrow, David Rudder, Len Boogsie Sharpe, Brother Resistance, and Machel Montano for more information on Trinidad and Tobagos music.         Dance of Trinidad and Tobago        The African influence can be seen in several of the folk dances of Trinidad and Tobago. Dances such as the Bongo, Kalinda, Shango, and Limbo owe their roots to Africa. The Bongo dance depicts the passing of a person from one world to the next. The Kalinda (stickfighting) can be seen in Trinidad and Tobagos Carnival celebration and is performed only by men. The Shango is a religious dance and is usually performed daily and nightly for three or four weeks of the year. People come to the ceremony seeking either to be cured from some sickness or to have a spell cast upon a lover or an enemy. Limbo is a competitive dance. It is the most recognized dance because young people see this as a party dance where two people hold a stick and each dancer goes underneath the stick as it gets lower and lower with each rotation."}]},

A study of the impact of capital punishment in the Caribbean republic is of particular interest because of its high level of death-penalty sentencing.   \u201cIt has been hard to measure capital punishment as a deterrent to murder in the U.S. because it is administered infrequently,\u201d explained Greenberg. \u201cBy contrast, in Trinidad and Tobago, the chances of actually being executed have historically been much higher.\u201d   In the United States, the death penalty was reinstated by states more than 30 years ago\u2014following a 1976 landmark Supreme Court ruling\u2014while capital punishment has not existed in Canada or in western Europe for several decades.   By contrast, Trinidad and Tobago had high rates of death-penalty sentencing and executions prior to a 1993 court ruling, which barred the death penalty for inmates on death row longer than five years, thereby reducing the number of executions and death-penalty sentences. Though the courts continue to impose death sentences, none has been carried out in more than a decade.    The researchers note that from 1955 to 1980, homicide rates were relatively stable in Trinidad and Tobago, ranging from 4.44 per 100,000 (1955) to 4.34 (1980) during this period. However, during this same stretch, executions ranged from a high of 16 in 1969 to zero between 1980 and 1993. By contrast, when executions rose to 11 in 1999, the murder rate rose in nearly every subsequent year until 2007, the last year calculated. In 2007, 391 homicides were recorded in Trinidad and Tobago\u2014a country with a population of just 1,328,412\u2014resulting in a rate of 29.4 per 100,000 population. This compares to a US homicide rate in the same year of 5.6 per 100,000 population.   The researchers acknowledged the role geography could play into the findings.   \u201cGeneralizations from Trinidad and Tobago to other settings must obviously be made cautiously,\u201d they wrote. \u201cEvery country has distinctive elements of culture, social structure, and social organization that may influence the way its population responds to criminal justice sanctions, including the death penalty.\u201d   The researchers acknowledged that murders in the republic have risen dramatically since 2000\u2014when executions ceased, even though death-penalty sentences have continued\u2014but maintained this change says little about the impact of capital punishment as a deterrent to murder.   \u201cWe can reject the argument that the cessation of executions brought about a big increase in murder in the last decade\u2014in earlier years, big swings in the execution rate had no visible effect and the 11 executions in 1999 brought about no detectable drop in homicides,\u201d explained Greenberg.

Music of Trinidad and Tobago          The Caribbean islands of Trinidad and Tobago are best known for calypso music and the homeland of the only instrument invented in the 20th century, is pan, also called steelpan or steeldrums. Other music forms that found roots on the island are soca, rapso, brass bands, chutney, parang, and yoruban shango. The arrival of African, Spanish, French, East Indian, and European people influenced these musics as well.  Calypso also called kaiso came from a West African form of communication among the slaves in Trinidad and Tobago. Calypsos rich rhythms and harmonious vocals are sometimes sung in French creole. It is very similar to the African griot (a traveling musician in West Africa) where the singer or calypsonian sometimes discusses political and social issues in the community through song. The competitive lyrics found in other styles including calypso also have roots in the griot/ storytelling West African tradition. Do you think you could be a calypsonian? Trinidads Calypso Pioneers Competition is looking for young talented calypsonians from all over the islands. Calypso has also spread to many other islands in the Caribbean. Even adults get involved with King and Queens Calypso and Soca competitions around the Carnival season. Carnival is a major event on the island. Some people wear elaborate costumes, which are also called mas. Not to mention one of the largest steelband orchestral competitions in the world, Panorama. Interestingly enough an underlying theme in Carnival and steelpan history is the act of oppression bringing new creations. Steelpan began with the banning of the African drum, then becoming the tamboo bamboo band, to pots, pans, and dustbins, and finally evolved into what we know as a wide array of steelpans.  Soca is a result of calypso added with Jamaican reggae, American soul, disco, and funk music. Its popularity has grown while making its way to American airwaves.   In addition to Trinidad and Tobagos styles of music R&B, Classical, and Jazz can be heard on the steelpans as well.  Check out artists like Lord Kitchener, Mighty Sparrow, David Rudder, Len Boogsie Sharpe, Brother Resistance, and Machel Montano for more information on Trinidad and Tobagos music.         Dance of Trinidad and Tobago        The African influence can be seen in several of the folk dances of Trinidad and Tobago. Dances such as the Bongo, Kalinda, Shango, and Limbo owe their roots to Africa. The Bongo dance depicts the passing of a person from one world to the next. The Kalinda (stickfighting) can be seen in Trinidad and Tobagos Carnival celebration and is performed only by men. The Shango is a religious dance and is usually performed daily and nightly for three or four weeks of the year. People come to the ceremony seeking either to be cured from some sickness or to have a spell cast upon a lover or an enemy. Limbo is a competitive dance. It is the most recognized dance because young people see this as a party dance where two people hold a stick and each dancer goes underneath the stick as it gets lower and lower with each rotation."}, {"content": "Charlotte's mayor, Trinidad and Tobago's prime minister, and U.N. under-secretary-general to speak at 2012 convocations | NYU School of Law                           Skip to main content                                     &rsaquo;               Quicklinks       Areas of Study   Calendar   Career Services   Colloquia   Courses   Departments   Directories   Docket   Housing   Library   News and Press   NYU Home   Student Links   Technology                                              JD Admissions   Faculty &amp; Scholarship   Global Opportunities   LLM/JSD Admissions   Academics &amp; Courses   Law &amp; Business   Executive Education   Current Students   Public Service   About NYU Law   Alumni &amp; Giving   Centers &amp; Institutes                               Home &rsaquo; News &rsaquo; Charlotte&#039;s mayor, Trinidad and Tobago&#039;s prime minister, and U.N. under-secretary-general to speak at 2012 convocations             Charlotte&#039;s mayor, Trinidad and Tobago&#039;s prime minister, and U.N. under-secretary-general to speak at 2012 convocations                 News       Alumni   Centers   Faculty   Global   Students   Press Highlights   For the Media   Faculty Experts                             Anthony Foxx &#8217;96, the mayor of Charlotte, North Carolina, will address the Class of 2012 at NYU School of Law&#8217;s J.D.

At the&#160;graduate ceremony later the same day, Prime Minister Kamla Persad-Bissessar of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago will speak to graduates, along with Patricia O&#8217;Brien, the United Nations&#8217; under-secretary-general for legal affairs and legal counsel. Foxx, the youngest mayor in Charlotte&#8217;s history and only the second African American to hold the office, served for four years on the city council before winning the mayoral election at age 38, and has been praised for his bipartisan collaborative style. Foxx has worked in all branches of the federal government, clerking for Judge Nathaniel Jones of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, working as a trial attorney for the Justice Department&#8217;s Civil Rights Division, and serving as staff counsel to the House Judiciary Committee.

At NYU Law, Foxx was a Root-Tilden Scholar and a student in the Juvenile Defender Clinic , through which he represented juveniles in Brooklyn&#8217;s Family Court. Persad-Bissessar became the first female prime minister of Trinidad and Tobago in 2010. She was previously the first woman to serve as attorney general in that state as well as a member of the parliament, minister of education, and minister of legal affairs. Before pursuing politics, Persad-Bissessar was first a social worker and teacher, and later a lawyer. O&#8217;Brien, the first woman to hold her U.N. position, took on her current role in 2008. Overseeing a staff of more than 200, O&#8217;Brien provides legal advice on an array of matters and consults daily with Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon on political, practical, and management issues.

Music of Trinidad and Tobago          The Caribbean islands of Trinidad and Tobago are best known for calypso music and the homeland of the only instrument invented in the 20th century, is pan, also called steelpan or steeldrums. Other music forms that found roots on the island are soca, rapso, brass bands, chutney, parang, and yoruban shango. The arrival of African, Spanish, French, East Indian, and European people influenced these musics as well.  Calypso also called kaiso came from a West African form of communication among the slaves in Trinidad and Tobago. Calypsos rich rhythms and harmonious vocals are sometimes sung in French creole. It is very similar to the African griot (a traveling musician in West Africa) where the singer or calypsonian sometimes discusses political and social issues in the community through song. The competitive lyrics found in other styles including calypso also have roots in the griot/ storytelling West African tradition. Do you think you could be a calypsonian? Trinidads Calypso Pioneers Competition is looking for young talented calypsonians from all over the islands. Calypso has also spread to many other islands in the Caribbean. Even adults get involved with King and Queens Calypso and Soca competitions around the Carnival season. Carnival is a major event on the island. Some people wear elaborate costumes, which are also called mas. Not to mention one of the largest steelband orchestral competitions in the world, Panorama. Interestingly enough an underlying theme in Carnival and steelpan history is the act of oppression bringing new creations. Steelpan began with the banning of the African drum, then becoming the tamboo bamboo band, to pots, pans, and dustbins, and finally evolved into what we know as a wide array of steelpans.  Soca is a result of calypso added with Jamaican reggae, American soul, disco, and funk music. Its popularity has grown while making its way to American airwaves.   In addition to Trinidad and Tobagos styles of music R&B, Classical, and Jazz can be heard on the steelpans as well.  Check out artists like Lord Kitchener, Mighty Sparrow, David Rudder, Len Boogsie Sharpe, Brother Resistance, and Machel Montano for more information on Trinidad and Tobagos music.         Dance of Trinidad and Tobago        The African influence can be seen in several of the folk dances of Trinidad and Tobago. Dances such as the Bongo, Kalinda, Shango, and Limbo owe their roots to Africa. The Bongo dance depicts the passing of a person from one world to the next. The Kalinda (stickfighting) can be seen in Trinidad and Tobagos Carnival celebration and is performed only by men. The Shango is a religious dance and is usually performed daily and nightly for three or four weeks of the year. People come to the ceremony seeking either to be cured from some sickness or to have a spell cast upon a lover or an enemy. Limbo is a competitive dance. It is the most recognized dance because young people see this as a party dance where two people hold a stick and each dancer goes underneath the stick as it gets lower and lower with each rotation."}]},

A study of the impact of capital punishment in the Caribbean republic is of particular interest because of its high level of death-penalty sentencing.   \u201cIt has been hard to measure capital punishment as a deterrent to murder in the U.S. because it is administered infrequently,\u201d explained Greenberg. \u201cBy contrast, in Trinidad and Tobago, the chances of actually being executed have historically been much higher.\u201d   In the United States, the death penalty was reinstated by states more than 30 years ago\u2014following a 1976 landmark Supreme Court ruling\u2014while capital punishment has not existed in Canada or in western Europe for several decades.   By contrast, Trinidad and Tobago had high rates of death-penalty sentencing and executions prior to a 1993 court ruling, which barred the death penalty for inmates on death row longer than five years, thereby reducing the number of executions and death-penalty sentences. Though the courts continue to impose death sentences, none has been carried out in more than a decade.    The researchers note that from 1955 to 1980, homicide rates were relatively stable in Trinidad and Tobago, ranging from 4.44 per 100,000 (1955) to 4.34 (1980) during this period. However, during this same stretch, executions ranged from a high of 16 in 1969 to zero between 1980 and 1993. By contrast, when executions rose to 11 in 1999, the murder rate rose in nearly every subsequent year until 2007, the last year calculated. In 2007, 391 homicides were recorded in Trinidad and Tobago\u2014a country with a population of just 1,328,412\u2014resulting in a rate of 29.4 per 100,000 population. This compares to a US homicide rate in the same year of 5.6 per 100,000 population.   The researchers acknowledged the role geography could play into the findings.   \u201cGeneralizations from Trinidad and Tobago to other settings must obviously be made cautiously,\u201d they wrote. \u201cEvery country has distinctive elements of culture, social structure, and social organization that may influence the way its population responds to criminal justice sanctions, including the death penalty.\u201d   The researchers acknowledged that murders in the republic have risen dramatically since 2000\u2014when executions ceased, even though death-penalty sentences have continued\u2014but maintained this change says little about the impact of capital punishment as a deterrent to murder.   \u201cWe can reject the argument that the cessation of executions brought about a big increase in murder in the last decade\u2014in earlier years, big swings in the execution rate had no visible effect and the 11 executions in 1999 brought about no detectable drop in homicides,\u201d explained Greenberg.
