The faculty at New York University is particularly strong in Economic Theory, Macroeconomics, International Economics, and Economic Growth and Development. Although Economics is a large Department, its students enjoy an excellent student-faculty rapport. Many of the faculty members are associated with distinguished research institutions. By being able to study with faculty who are actively engaged in research, students learn not only about the fundamentals of economic theory but also about how such theory is utilized. They have the opportunity to conduct research on their own. Honors students are required to write a research paper as an Honors Thesis under direct faculty supervision.    Academic Programs    The Department offers a major in Economics and joint majors in Economics and Mathematics and in Economics and Computer Science. The details are set forth in the College of Arts and Science Bulletin.    The Department's major can be taken in either one of two concentrations, a Theory concentration or, a Policy concentration. The former is for students who desire a more formal approach to economic analysis. The latter is for students who prefer an approach less formal and that emphasize the role of economic institutions and the interplay between policy and theory. Highly motivated students may wish to explore the possibilities of participation in the Department's honors programs, which gives students access to excellent professors in small classes and culminates in the writing of a senior thesis under faculty supervision. Students who plan to go on to advanced degrees in Economics or to law school are strongly encouraged to pursue the Theory concentration, but should consider taking Honors as well. Honors may also be taken in the Policy concentration and eligible students are urged to do so.    Activities and Awards    All students interested in Economics are welcome to join the student-run Undergraduate Economics Society. In the past, the Society has organized a series of guest speakers, visits to local economic institutions, and social activities. The Department also has chapters of two national academic honor societies, Omicron Delta Epsilon and the Honorary Economics Society. The Murray Altman Prize is given to a junior with an outstanding record in Economics and related fields. The Emanuel Stein Memorial Award in Economics goes to a senior for outstanding scholarship in economics.    Career Options    Students majoring in Economics have many options open to them after graduation. The major prepares them for graduate school in Economics, business management, or public administration. Pre-professional students will find that an Economics major not only fosters the discipline medical or law school demands, but provides a solid foundation for these and other careers. Studying Economics at New York University is especially rewarding because of the urban environment. Students often find internships and eventually career opportunities on Wall Street, at the United Nations, or in various corporate, financial, governmental, agency, and nonprofit institutional settings.    Admission and Financial Aid    Students seeking admission should apply to the Office of Undergraduate Admissions, New York University, 22 Washington Square North, New York, NY 10011. The University sponsors and administers a wide variety of financial aid programs. Awards are based on the student's record of academic achievement and test scores as well as on financial need.
