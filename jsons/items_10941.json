McNealys comment reflects what many people believe, namely that technology, in particular, new media -- computers, information technology, and digital electronic networks -- have dramatically and irrevocably diminished our privacy. The picture, in fact, is far more complex. This course is a critical study of the multi-faceted relationship between privacy and technology. We will study technical innovations as well as new applications of old technologies that have caused alarm, from photography, cheap printing, and wire-taps to databases, video surveillance cameras, biometrics, and the Internet; we will also take note of technologies that have been offered as antidotes. We will study the people, practices, institutions, and vested interests that have supported the application of these technologies to observe people, store information about them, and hold them accountable for their actions. We will review prominent theories of privacy, contemporary privacy policy, privacy law, and privacy as a social, legal, and moral value.

This information is stored and used. It is of great value to the patients themselves and to society at large public health and research. But many people feel that information about their health is sensitive and personal and should not be widely shared. Are they right?

March 15: Recess         March 22: Privacy and Law    Guest Lecturer: Gaia Bernstein    U.S. law has grappled with both conceptual and normative privacy issues. Pulled in opposite directions by those, on the one hand, who see privacy as a distinctive value and on the other, by those who see it as a hodge-podge of more fundamental values, the law reveals complexity and confusion in its commitment to privacy. We examine various sources of legal protection for privacy, and will consider some of both the skeptical and committed positions.

March 29: Philosophical Conceptions of Privacy    What is privacy and why do we value it? These are the basic questions philosophers have asked. The questions are important because they provide reasons or justifications for heartfelt opinions on controversial issues. We will see, however, why theorists and activists alike have found privacy a challenging notion to grasp and defend. What interests and values does privacy challenge and how do we settle important tradeoffs?         Readings:       Reiman, Jeffrey.

April 5: Privacy, Communications and the Media    We sometimes take for granted the privacy of our communications. We can whisper, pass notes, even send things in the mail, and expect them to remain secret. What can we expect, hope, or demand of our new communications technologies, from telephones to landlines to cell phones to email?

A majority of people in the developing parts of the world do not have access to basic communications without which the &quot;digital divide&quot; in the world is bound to significantly grow over the years.     The premise of this course is that the development of appropriate Information and Communication Technologies, often referred to as ICT, can play a substantial role in addressing many of the pressing problems in developing regions especially in rural areas. ICT is not a solution by itself - it can primarily act as an enabler to improve the state of affairs in developing regions. In this course, we will study how ICT can be used to address problems in the following areas (to name the important ones and the focus areas for this class):     - Healthcare   - Education   - Micro-finance and Rural Banking   - Supply Chain Management   - Agriculture   - Traffic Control   - E-Governance     Applying ICT to address problems in these areas is not an easy task and involves addressing several challenges including research, development, deployment and social challenges. The research and development challenges cover several areas of computer science including networking, systems databases, security, user interfaces, HCI and architecture. In this course, we will review some of the ongoing efforts in this space and discuss in detail the challenges that arise in the above mentioned seven focus areas.     Course Details and Grading     This course is a projects oriented course with the project forming about 75% of the grade. 25% of the grade will be based on class discussion and a presentation. For the class, a pre-specified set of project topics related to ongoing research efforts will be suggested and each student will work in one of these projects. Students will be asked to make presentations during regular lecture schedules.     The suggested project topics are as follows:   - Low-cost zero maintenance wireless mesh networks   - Cellphone based healthcare record system   - Cellphone based micro-finance transaction system   - Low cost paper watermarking for securing paper-based transactions in financial transactions and E-governance   - Medical Education modules for prevalent healthcare problems (eg.malaria, obstetrics and gynecology)   - Video streaming in low-bandwidth environments for distance learning applications   - Traffic Signaling system for improving road capacity in chaotic urban environments   - User interface design for semi-literate and illiterate users   - Content distribution in intermittent environments for education, healthcare purposes     More details along with project pages will be posted soon. Motivated students can suggest their own project topics.     Who can take the course?     The course is accessible to students from a variety of backgrounds including computer science students, ITP students,   MSIS students and students in specific application domains (healthcare, finance, education). It is important that any student taking this class have basic exposure to IT courses. In any project group, it is very important that atleast a few if not all the students have some coding experience in languages such as C/C++/Java. Most of the projects do not require hacking skills but definitely require reasonable amount of coding. Application specific exposure/expertise is a huge plus in any project.     If you are interested in this space, I would strongly encourage you to drop by for the first class and check it out.       Lecture Schedule (tentative)     The readings for the classes will be posted soon. For the first class, no readings are essential.

McNealys comment reflects what many people believe, namely that technology, in particular, new media -- computers, information technology, and digital electronic networks -- have dramatically and irrevocably diminished our privacy. The picture, in fact, is far more complex. This course is a critical study of the multi-faceted relationship between privacy and technology. We will study technical innovations as well as new applications of old technologies that have caused alarm, from photography, cheap printing, and wire-taps to databases, video surveillance cameras, biometrics, and the Internet; we will also take note of technologies that have been offered as antidotes. We will study the people, practices, institutions, and vested interests that have supported the application of these technologies to observe people, store information about them, and hold them accountable for their actions. We will review prominent theories of privacy, contemporary privacy policy, privacy law, and privacy as a social, legal, and moral value.

This information is stored and used. It is of great value to the patients themselves and to society at large public health and research. But many people feel that information about their health is sensitive and personal and should not be widely shared. Are they right?

Pulled in opposite directions by those, on the one hand, who see privacy as a distinctive value and on the other, by those who see it as a hodge-podge of more fundamental values, the law reveals complexity and confusion in its commitment to privacy. We examine various sources of legal protection for privacy, and will consider some of both the skeptical and committed positions.

A majority of people in the developing parts of the world do not have access to basic communications without which the &quot;digital divide&quot; in the world is bound to significantly grow over the years.     The premise of this course is that the development of appropriate Information and Communication Technologies, often referred to as ICT, can play a substantial role in addressing many of the pressing problems in developing regions especially in rural areas. ICT is not a solution by itself - it can primarily act as an enabler to improve the state of affairs in developing regions. In this course, we will study how ICT can be used to address problems in the following areas (to name the important ones and the focus areas for this class):     - Healthcare   - Education   - Micro-finance and Rural Banking   - Supply Chain Management   - Agriculture   - Traffic Control   - E-Governance     Applying ICT to address problems in these areas is not an easy task and involves addressing several challenges including research, development, deployment and social challenges. The research and development challenges cover several areas of computer science including networking, systems databases, security, user interfaces, HCI and architecture. In this course, we will review some of the ongoing efforts in this space and discuss in detail the challenges that arise in the above mentioned seven focus areas.     Course Details and Grading     This course is a projects oriented course with the project forming about 75% of the grade. 25% of the grade will be based on class discussion and a presentation. For the class, a pre-specified set of project topics related to ongoing research efforts will be suggested and each student will work in one of these projects. Students will be asked to make presentations during regular lecture schedules.     The suggested project topics are as follows:   - Low-cost zero maintenance wireless mesh networks   - Cellphone based healthcare record system   - Cellphone based micro-finance transaction system   - Low cost paper watermarking for securing paper-based transactions in financial transactions and E-governance   - Medical Education modules for prevalent healthcare problems (eg.malaria, obstetrics and gynecology)   - Video streaming in low-bandwidth environments for distance learning applications   - Traffic Signaling system for improving road capacity in chaotic urban environments   - User interface design for semi-literate and illiterate users   - Content distribution in intermittent environments for education, healthcare purposes     More details along with project pages will be posted soon. Motivated students can suggest their own project topics.     Who can take the course?     The course is accessible to students from a variety of backgrounds including computer science students, ITP students,   MSIS students and students in specific application domains (healthcare, finance, education). It is important that any student taking this class have basic exposure to IT courses. In any project group, it is very important that atleast a few if not all the students have some coding experience in languages such as C/C++/Java. Most of the projects do not require hacking skills but definitely require reasonable amount of coding. Application specific exposure/expertise is a huge plus in any project.     If you are interested in this space, I would strongly encourage you to drop by for the first class and check it out.       Lecture Schedule (tentative)     The readings for the classes will be posted soon. For the first class, no readings are essential.
