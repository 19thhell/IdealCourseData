There are many great benefits to showing your support for your school:      Because participation in alumni giving is a factor in the University\u2019s rankings, your gift not only supports today\u2019s students, it also bolsters the value of the degree you worked so hard to earn.   But the biggest benefit of all is that you\u2019ll know that you are making a difference in the life of today\u2019s NYU students. Your support will help students have the NYU experience of their dreams.   You may be eligible to join a giving club .     Fundraising Priorities            Annual Giving           NYU's annual fund, The Fund for NYU, enables alumni, parents, and friends to support their schools, Bobst Library, scholarships, and student life. The cumulative impact of tens of thousands of generous donors is staggering. Giving to NYU every year ensures that the Fund for NYU's impact is continuous and consistent.           Scholarships and Financial Aid           The ability to attract and support the best and the brightest students, regardless of their financial circumstances, is of the utmost importance to NYU. In the past year, NYU doubled the amount of money raised for scholarships, and we will continue to do even more. Even students have gotten involved with helping their classmates by creating scholarships for students, by students through the 1831 Fund. Meet some of the amazing students who have benefited from scholarship support. To help create scholarships for these deserving students, please make a gift today.              Faculty, Staff, and Research       NYU is the only school on earth to have faculty win the Nobel Prize, the Pulitzer Prize, and a Tony Award in the same year. To maintain our status as a world-class institution, we need to be able to continue to attract high-caliber faculty and provide them with the resources they need to perform critical research. And our commitment has not gone unrewarded: our faculty have made important advances in fields as diverse as archaeology, genomics, entrepreneurship, and medicine.               Equipment and Technology       As technology changes rapidly, so do the needs of our campus. From providing our medical and nursing students with access to the most up to date equipment to connecting our global network of sites through videoconferencing and networked resources, it is critical that NYU stay ahead of the technology curve.              Schools       NYU\u2019s schools are at the forefront of their fields, and they are constantly growing, changing, and shaping the landscape of scholarship.                                                                             \u201cWithout the support of the scholarships and donations I received from you, I believe that I would not have accomplished nearly as much as I have. Your generous gift allows me to concentrate on being a student and for that, I am deeply grateful.\u201d   \u2014 Clifford Chang (CAS \u201914)      Join a Giving Club                         We invite you to lead a new tradition of annual giving by joining one of these clubs, which recognize individuals who have taken a leadership role in ensuring the strength of NYU.
