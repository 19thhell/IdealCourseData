While world history has proved of great  value in uncovering and exploring the range of 'transregional' connections that  bound the world together over many centuries, global history(ies) seeks to go  further in this exploration by offering a more historical treatment of  globalization. This course offers an introduction to global history through an  exploration of the themes and literature that are of current interest in the  field. It will offer an opportunity to examine the differences between world  and global history, and the explanatory frameworks and models that have been  used to explain global change and development over the long run.                  Course Requirements:              This course is  designed as a graduate seminar. As such, the classes will revolve around  discussion of the weekly texts and the issues they raise. This discussion will  spring, in part, from the questions and commentaries on the readings submitted  weekly by all students in the class. These written critiques should be no  longer than 500-800 words, and are to be circulated by email to all members of  the seminar. They should highlight the key arguments of the author(s), the  importance of such arguments, and any critiques you might have of the work(s)particularly  in relation to the other material covered in the course. Critiques have to be  sent to everyone in the seminar class including the Professor by 9   am   of the morning of the class. Failure to do so will affect the final grade.             Participation in class  discussion is important and will contribute significantly toward the final  grade. There will be 2 pieces of written work for this seminar course: 1 long  research paper (6,000 8,000 words) based on independent research, and a 2,000  word review of a piece (or pieces) you found most challenging, engaging or  thought-provoking. The topics for the research papers must be chosen by each  student in consultation with me. The deadlines for these will be given to you  in the second week of class. The final  grade will be determined by the weekly critiques (20%), class participation  (20%), the review (20%) and the research paper (40%).            Weekly readings are to be  found as PDFs on the online progamme, Blackboard. It is accessible through NYU  Home. You will need to familiarize yourself with the programme as soon as  possible. Note that, where readings are accessible via an online academic  journals site like JSTOR, you will need to download the article yourself (i.e.  it will NOT be provided for you in Blackboard).

New ideas, methodologies, and historical understandings are coming to the fore as we grapple with the dynamics of an ever-shrinking but ever more complex world. Global Histories provides a framework to investigate transnational viewpoints and local history, cultural study, and world politics.    Blending established themes with contemporary questions, Global Histories incorporates broad topics such as postcolonialism, nationalism, and state formation with specialized and creative approaches to historical analysis. Drawing on the cultural diversity of the Graduate School and New York City, Global Histories offers innovative perspectives on the contemporary world, both past and present.  Sample Courses:  Students should refer to a current class schedule each semester to   determine current course offerings. The list below is representative, not exhaustive.  International Studies in Human Rights G65.1048 Introduces   students to international human rights and the movement\u2019s relationship   to the field of comprehensive peace education. As a multidisciplinary   field, peace education takes a holistic approach to conflict and   education. Essentially, peace education is the creation and transmission   of knowledge needed to achieve and maintain peace. It is also about   developing the critical and reflective capacities to apply knowledge in   order to control, reduce, and eliminate various forms of violence. Using   a peace education approach, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights   and related normative global standards are used as the primary   conceptual frameworks to guide the course\u2019s inquiries.  Introduction to Global Histories I G65.1107 Surveys   world historical trends by examining spaces and practices outside the   normative expectations of national histories. Students read accounts   from different historical periods of human encounters on and across the   world\u2019s major seas and oceans\u2014\u201ccontact zones\u201d that blur conventional   territorial and cultural definitions\u2014and review related concepts, tools,   and methodologies adopted by world and global historians in their   analyses. Introduction to Global   Histories II 65.2107 Studies colonialism from a   comparative perspective. Examines the ways in which relations of power,   subordination, and negotiation were constituted across time and space   and poses questions about the most effective ways in which to understand   the colonial \u201cmoment\u201d in world history. Themes that are covered include   race and classification, political subjectivity, and nationalism. Topics in Global Histories: Islam and the   Left: Languages of Resistance G65.3005 Explores the   complex interactions between two major intellectual and activist   traditions of transnational resistance to Western imperialism over the   last century and a half: leftist and Islamist political movements\u2014each,   contrary to popular perception (and orthodox insistence), a discourse of   great internal diversity. The course starts with theoretical framing,   locating both in the historical context of accelerated global   connectivity, capital expansion, and processes of modernization.   Students examine alternate critiques of Western capitalist modernity   possible from vantage points along a spectrum of relationships within   both genealogies, discussing the implications of liberalism, secularism,   orientalism, and alternate modernities. Topics in Global   Histories seminars examine particularly focused subject matter and   themes, which change frequently. Previous seminars have included   \u201cViolence, Culture, and Democracy in South Asia\u201d and \u201cHistory, Economy,   Society, and Diaspora in the Indian Ocean.\u201d                   Back to Top                             Updated on 07&#047;29&#047;2010         Contact Us | &copy; New York University , Arts and Science"}]}]
