The primary purposes of these assessments are to determine:      The degree to which the health issues exist in ethnic-specific Asian American community      The resources available      The best approaches to meet the needs of the these communities in New York City.     The first such assessment was developed in 2004 to better understand the health needs and resources available in the Filipino American community. Since then, similar efforts have been implemented in the Cambodian, Chinese, Korean, South Asian, and Vietnamese communities in NYC. In 2008 CSAAH will complete its Community Health Needs and Resource Assessments in the Japanese community, and will conduct in-depth analysis of findings from the three major South Asian communities: Bangladeshis, Indians and Pakistanis.
