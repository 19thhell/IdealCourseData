We will explore the materiality and history of the letter as form as well as the philosophical and literary performances and interventions letters and letter \u00adwriters make. Texts will include letters by Horace, Cicero, Ovid, St. Paul, Abelard &amp; Heloise, Petrarch, Cl\u00e9ment Marot, Jacopo Sadoleto &amp; John Calvin, John Donne, John Milton, and modern treatments of the epistolary form by Sigmund Freud &amp; Wilhelm Fliess, Jacques Lacan, Jacques Derrida, and Chris Kraus. Along the way, we will also explore the history and technology of letter writing from classical antiquity through to the European Renaissance. Junior Theory Seminar: Modernity Iampolski Modernity is a product of Enlightenment that dramatically changed the   face of the Western culture by proclaiming the autonomy and supremacy of   human Reason. This new attitude allowed an unprecedented development of   science and became a basis for many fundamental achievements of the   Western civilization. However the same attitude has created a lot of   contradictions that define modernity. The course is designed to analyze   the antinomies of the culture of modernity. We will start with a   founding document of European rationalism - philosophical statements by   Descartes and will see how the cult of Reason and the great western   political principles (equality of rights, the rule of law) related to   the dominance of Reason are paradoxically responsible for new kinds of   violence and social exclusion.The following subjects will be discussed: - Individual and masses in modern society; - Violence and modern war; - Totalitarianism; - Mechanization of life, alienation, machines; - The emergence of subjectivity and the \"loss experience\"; - Market, capitalism, and many others. Senior Seminar in Comparative Literature: Honors Thesis Garcia This   seminar, limited to senior Comparative Literature majors engaged in   writing a senior honors thesis, is designed to be a writing workshop.   Students will articulate and research a thesis topic, identify an   appropriate critical approach and methodology, and write at least one   chapter of their thesis. Periodical writing installments give the   students the opportunity to receive feed-back from their peers and   instructor as well as to learn to critique others' work-in-progress.   Permission of the DUS is required to enroll in the course. Students   must also have a 3.65 or better GPA, both overall and in the major. The   Senior Thesis Seminar must be followed by Independent Study (COLIT-UA   997) to complete the honors thesis. Topics in Asian Studies: The Planetary Imagination Kaffen The planetary has emerged a contested site across a variety of fields   from comparative literature and area studies to media studies and   philosophy. Partly marking itself off from older universalist claims   (cosmopolitanism, world history, globalization), the planetary   imagination as we will discuss it in this class foregrounds an   ecological dimension and at the same time, shifts the grounds of   human-centered thought and politics. While touching on a wide variety of   issues, including technology, scale, identity, and ethics, the core   problem for the class will be to consider \u201cthe world\u201d from a standpoint   that does not privilege the human as its center or apex. The goal of the   course is neither to immediately endorse nor repudiate a critique of   anthropocentrism, but to examine some of its diverse forms of   expression, underlying assumptions, and possible repercussions. To that   end, this class seeks to explore the planetary imagination from a   broadly (and possibly contradictory) humanities-based perspective, at   the intersection of area studies (East Asia in particular) and   comparative literature\u2014through fiction, philosophy, and contemporary   arts and media. Travel Literature Halim  The course \u201cTravel Literature\u201d  brings together a set of theoretical, critical and literary texts about travel  from the Middle Ages to the present. While transnationalism and mobility appear  to typify our times, this course traces much older trajectories of travel in  relation to questions of motive (e.g.: imperialism, ethnography, hajj ), genre (guidebook, letters home, travelogue,   Rihla , travel blog, etc.) and shifting  perceptions of \u201cEast\u201d and \u201cWest.\u201d The course brings together theoretical  readings\u2014by, among others, James Clifford, Mary Louise Pratt and Edward Said\u2014and  literary texts\u2014by, among others, Ibn Battuta, Rifa\u2019a Rafi\u2019 al-Tahtawi, Edward  Lane, Mourid Barghouti, and Jamaica Kincaid.      Culture and Politics in the Hispanic World: A Transatlantic Perspective Matos-Martin      This course will explore the intersections of culture and  politics in Spain and Latin America with a special focus on their entangled  histories. In that light, we will consider different issues to engage  \u201cTransatlantic\u201d perspective as a comparative paradigm to flesh out shared  histories and experiences. These may include colonialism, dictatorships and  exile, immigration processes, exclusions, or today\u2019s neoliberal States. We will  analyze literary and visual sources such as short stories, novels, poems,  painting, fiction films or documentaries. Primary materials will be paired with  texts by leading cultural and political thinkers working on questions of  biopolitics, transatlantic studies, immigration, globalization, exclusion or  violence. Readings in Contemporary Literary Theory: Conflict Sanders      Conflict is an underlying theme  in many, if not most, contemporary theorists. In this class, we will explore  some of the forerunners of this conflict thinking in Marx, Nietzsche, and  Freud, as well as in its uses, sometimes critical, by, among others, Carl  Schmitt, Melanie Klein, Jacques Derrida, Judith Butler, Slavoj Zizek, and  Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak. In order to measure the explanatory power of our  theorists, we shall read them over against more literal accounts of  conflict\u2014the famous war memoirs of Ernst J\u00fcnger and Michael Herr.

In this class our aim is to read a range of difficult texts from both antiquity and modernity slowly and carefully, examining closely a series of important philosophical conjunctions. By examining these scenes of reception, both the ancient text and the modern shed light upon one another \u2013why do certain ancient texts come to illustrate and illuminate modern philosophy, and how do modern concerns come to re-animate the ancient texts? The conjunctions will include Sophocles\u2019 Antigone and Hegel; Presocratic philosophy and Nietzsche; Sophocles\u2019 Oedipus Tyrannos and Freud; Plato\u2019s Phaedrus and Derrida; Plato\u2019s Republic and Irigaray; Antigone and Judith Butler. This class recommended for students with some experience with theory and continental philosophy who wish to deepen their understanding of these difficult thinkers. Topics: Lyric Subjectivity and Transculturation Duffy This course will explore the development of lyric poetry from the troubadours to the European metaphysicals, exploring imitation, competition, and anxiety as driving forces of lyric production within a transcultural framework. Primary Texts will include works by Arnaut Daniel, Dante, Petrarch, Pietro Aretino, Garcilaso de la Vega, Lu\u00eds Vas de Cam\u00f5es, Joachim du Bellay, Pierre de Ronsard, Jan Van der Noot, Sir Philip Sidney, Edmund Spenser, John Donne, Jean de Sponde, Francisco de Quevedo, Fernando Herrera, Giambattista Marino, George Herbert, and Richard Crashaw. Critical works will include those by Thomas Greene, Leonard Forster, Teodolinda Barolini, Roland Greene, Terence Cave, Maria Rosa Menocal, Ignacio Navarette, Mario Praz, Gilles Deleuze, Heather DuBrow, and others.  Topics in 18th Century Literature: Enlightenment Evil Gadberry This semester, we will investigate a series of attempts to justify the existence of evil in the world \u2013 and in us. As we read poems, novels, letters, and works of philosophy of the long eighteenth century, we will study the complaints hurled at an incomprehensibly unjust universe in a moment known for its confidence in the powers of the understanding. Our inquiry will take us from texts that try to justify a system that makes us rotten from the very beginning, to works that suggest we live in the best of possible worlds, to scathing satires of these defenses, and \u2013 most scandalously of all \u2013 to outright celebrations of wickedness. We will look at the impersonal evil of natural calamities (in the writings that emerged around the devastating Lisbon earthquake of 1755) to the carefully wrought cruelties of sadism (in the Marquis deSade\u2019s Justine, for instance). As we do so, we\u2019ll think about how Enlightenment reason grapples with problems that seem to resist reason, how Enlightenment optimism stands up to critique, and how some instrumentalize (and even eroticize!) reason in pursuit of amoral pleasures. Required works will include the following primary works, many of which will be available in a coursepack: Kant, \u201cOn the Miscarriage of All Philosophical Trials in Theodicy\u201d; Kleist, \u201cThe Earthquake in Chile\u201d; Laclos, Dangerous Liaisons; Leibniz, Theodicy (selections); John Milton, Paradise Lost (selections); Pope, \u201cAn Essay on Man\u201d; Rousseau, letter to Voltaire defending Pope and Leibniz and selections from the Confessions and Social Contract; Sade, Justine; Voltaire, Candide and \u201cPoem on the Lisbon Disaster.\u201d The coursepack will also include secondary readings by Bakunin, Foucault, Lacan, and others.    Topics in 20th Century Literature: Cosmopolitanism and Urban Spaces Halim The notion of cosmopolitanism has been associated, traditionally, with the city, the cosmopolite being conceived of as a privileged urbanite. Although much has changed in the way we have come to think of cosmopolitanism in recent years, we still need to ask: to what extent is everyone potentially a cosmopolite nowadays? Are there good and bad candidates for that status, and if so, what are the criteria, and who gets to decide? Are all the world\u2019s cities global cities? And what of \u201cvillage\u201d in \u201cglobal village\u201d? If we bear in mind that a substantial portion of the world\u2019s population still lives in relatively deprived semi-rural areas, how would that alter our understanding of this new cosmopolitanism, or propose other forms? In what way does the city-bred cosmopolite\u2019s thirst for pastoral images and idyllic vistas impact peasants and the countryside? What, if any, are the tactics to which rural migrants in big urban centers resort to rework old patterns of belonging and forge new attachments? In this course, we will attend to these and other questions of cosmopolitanism and globalization in rural and urban spaces through theory, literary texts and films from the Middle East, Europe and the USA.    Topics in 20th Century Literature: Violence and Technology Kaffen Frequently characterized as an aberration within modernity, pervasive violence in its various forms (war, terror, crime, culture) has proven disastrously resistant to the ideals of the enlightenment, throwing them into question if not crisis. More, its relationship to technology in particular remains among the most fraught legacies of modernity. Indeed, the intersections of technology and violence have engendered the most profound critical debates and contentious cultural and artistic works of the twentieth century. In the interest of grappling with the ever increasing complexity of this relationship, we will read a broad array of critical writings on violence and technology, as they intersect with questions of politics, security, and sovereignty. At the same time, we will pay attention to the cultural and artistic expressions that critically engage with these issues from literature, music, architecture, painting, photography, cinema, video games, and assorted new media. Readings will include Eyal Weizman, George Bataille, Paul Virilio, Sasaki Ataru, TJ Clark, Walter Benjamin, Adriana Caverero, Hannah Arendt, Carl von Clausewitz, Ariella Azoulay, Jean Genet, Michel Foucault, Carl Schmitt, George Didi- Huberman, W.G. Sebald, Ernst Junger.  Topics: Fascism/Violence/Memory: The Case of the Spanish Civil War Matos-Martin The Spanish Civil War (1936-1939) is the defining event in Spanish modern history as well as widely acknowledged as a precursor to World War II. As the earliest example of battleground against fascism, those three years fascinated and attracted individuals from across the world, including George Orwell and Ernest Hemingway, and have continued to be the object of numerous books and other cultural products. Not so well known and studied, however, is the long-lasted and violent fascist regime established once the democratic Spanish Republic was eventually defeated. The purpose of the course is to examine the war and the fascist dictatorship that followed and perpetuated the logic of war, with a special focus on fictional and cultural representations. Literary texts, films, and documentaries will be analyzed in comparison with other artistic and cultural forms of expression (photography, painting), and accompanied by readings in history and theory. Topics to be discussed include political and ideological dynamics of war and fascism (comparing the Spanish case with other fascist regimes such as the Nazis through such theoretical lenses as biopolitics, for example), representations of violence, memory and history, and justice.  Topics in 19th Century History: Century Literary History: Arthur Rimbaud Ross A seminar devoted to the poetry, cultural, and political context of Arthur Rimbaud.   Students must have some reading knowledge of French (there will surely be differing   levels of familiarity with French in the group) and a good French dictionary. Discussion conducted in English.  Senior Seminar in Comparative Literature: Honors Thesis Vatulescu This seminar, limited to senior Comparative Literature majors engaged in writing a senior honors thesis, is designed to be a writing workshop. Students will articulate and research a thesis topic, identify an appropriate critical approach and methodology, and write at least one chapter of their thesis. Periodical writing installments give the students the opportunity to receive feed-back from their peers and instructor as well as to learn to critique others' work-in-progress. Permission of the DUGS is required to enroll in the course. Students must also have a 3.65 or better GPA, both overall and in the major.
