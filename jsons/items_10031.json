At NYU more than 40 undergraduate and 40 graduate courses deal with Slavic Studies in the following disciplines: art, Central and East European literature, cinema studies, comparative literature, cultural studies, drama, economics and economic development, gender studies, history, immigration studies, international education, linguistics, music, politics, public administration, Russian language and literature, theater, and translation studies.   On the undergraduate level the department of Russian and Slavic Studies offers a major and a minor. On the graduate level, the department offers an interdisciplinary Master of Arts degree in Russian studies, with concentrations in literature and culture, area studies, and linguistics. A newly instituted Ph.D. program is now being offered with emphases on either History or Comparative Literature. In addition, the department participates in two dual Master's degree programs: a Master of Arts degree in Russian and Journalism, in association with the Arthur L. Carter Jounalism Institute; and a dual degree in Library Science and Russian, jointly sponsored and administered by Long Island University\"s Palmer School of Library and Information Science, and NYU's Graduate School of Arts and Sciences. The latter program allows library students to be trained as Slavic subject specialist librarians. In addition, the department is in the process of adding Czech language and cultural history in connection with the recently-opened program, New York University in Prague at Charles University. Finally, the Departments of Comparative Literature, History, and the Program in International Education grant doctorates on Slavic subjects.       Scope       Language   The majority of materials are acquired in Russian and English, and more selectively in Old Church Slavonic, French, German, and Italian. In the last few years core collections have been initiated in Polish and Czech on the subjects of Polish and Czech history, literature, and cultural studies. English translations of titles in non-collected Slavic languages are acquired when available and of scholarly interest. Materials on Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania are acquired in English only.       Geographical Areas   The Slavic collection covers the following areas: - For material concerning events before 1917: the Russian empire, all Slavic-speaking countries of Eastern Europe, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Georgia.   - For materials concerning events between 1917 and 1991: the 15 republics of the Former Soviet Union and all Slavic-speaking Eastern bloc countries.   - For materials concerning events since the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991: the Russian Federation, Ukraine, Belarus, Latvia, Estonia, Lithuania, Georgia, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Poland, and former Yugoslavia.   Also of interest for Russian literature, history, intellectual history, migration and ethnic studies are the three waves of Russian emigration -- after the Revolution, after WWII, and starting in the 1970s -- as are the resulting Russian communities established in Europe, the U.S., China, Australia, and New Zealand. Of similar interest is recent Russian emigration to all former Soviet republics.   Materials concerning Romania, Albania, Moldova, and Hungary are part of the European collection. Materials concerning events before 1917 and after 1991 in Armenia, Azerbaijan, and the Former South Eastern Republics (Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan), are part of the Middle Eastern Studies collection.       Chronological Periods   Emphasis is on all historical periods from the beginning of Slavic culture to the present, with particular emphases given to nineteenth- and twentieth century Russian and Soviet history, the period since the break-up of the Soviet Union, and literary history from nineteenth through twenty-first centuries. Resources concerning the pre-literate period before the Christianization of Russia are acquired more selectively.         Types of Materials       Included   Monographs, monographic series, serials, newspapers, proceedings, facsimiles, reprints, microforms, audio-visual and electronic media (including electronic texts). Acquired on a more selective basis: dissertations, exhibition catalogs, government documents, pamphlets, scores, textbooks, and working papers.       Excluded   Ephemera, realia.         Background, Strengths, and Weaknesses of the Collection   The Slavic collection at Bobst reflects the history of Slavic Studies at NYU. When NYU's Ph.D. program in Russian literature was discontinued in 1972, collecting in Russian and other East European languages virtually stopped. The acquisition of Western-language resources about Russia and Eastern Europe, however, continued. Collecting in Russian, and to some degree Czech and Polish resumed in 1995, but despite retrospective acquisitions, many lacunae from the 1970s, '80s, and early '90s remain.   The break-up of the Soviet Union, and the end to the government monopoly of the book trade led to a great deal of confusion in Russian book acquisition. Although Western vendors have tried to fill this niche, at present blanket order acquisitions or an approval plan for Russian materials are not practical, and materials are ordered individually to support curriculum and faculty research needs. Orders are based on vendor and publishers' catalogs, library acquisition lists, bibliographies and review media as well as faculty recommendations. Journals are acquired very selectively, principally through faculty request.   The strength of the Slavic Collection is in Russian materials; collecting has always been much stronger for Russia than for any other Slavic country. While historically, the collection was strongest in language, literature and history, in recent years the social sciences and cinema have become central as well, reflecting changes in faculty research and curriculum. At present, in addition to these subjects, collecting for Russia and the Soviet Union focuses primarily on cultural history, politics, international relations, social, and economic conditions. The collection coverage for individual authors, literary criticism, literary movements, philosophy, and folklore is very good, as is the Russian video collection. Steadily becoming noteworthy are Russian cultural history, post- Gorbachev politics, Russian women in society, literature, and the arts, and Russians in emigration (history and literature), as well as reference resources such as guides to Russian archives. Areas of relatively recent scholarly interest at NYU are currently being developed and strengthened: Czech language and cultural history, Russian journalism, Russian cultural studies, the Russian, Ukrainian and East European avant-garde, local and provincial Russian and Soviet history. Slavic topics in anthropology and ethnology are emerging areas of interest.   The library offers a wide range of electronic resources, including remote and in-library access to the American Bibliography of Slavic and East European Studies (ABSEES), the major electronic index in Slavic Studies, the Central East European Library Online (CEEOL), and the INION (Institut Nauchnoi Informatsii po Obshchestvennym Naukam) index. The library also offers numerous databases which contain Slavic material, including Historical Abstracts, PAIS, the MLA Bibliography, and Dissertation Abstracts. Online access is also available for Russian journals through BobCat in areas such as arts, literature, theater, science, politics, and economics. Many Slavic electronic resources are available through the Slavic Studies web page which also includes links to the online catalogs of major national and international Slavic libraries.   The Business and Social Science/Documents Center holds many publications and statistical sources important to social science research in Slavic Studies. The United Nations and International Governmental Organizations Collection receives on deposit or standing order, the publications of the U.N. Economic Commission for Europe (which covers Russia and Eastern Europe), The International Monetary Fund, the International Labor Organization and the International Council for Migration. NGO publications of interest include Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch. The Center also has extensive microform collections covering historical and current socio-economic statistics.   The Tamiment Institute Library in Bobst holds many rare materials concerning international communism, socialism, and anarchism before and during the Soviet period. In addition to the Communist Party USA collections, materials include books, pamphlets, posters, serials, archival and manuscript collections, photographs, films, and oral histories.   The Avery Fisher Center has a strong collection of Russian and East European videos from the silent era to the present.   News broadcasts in Bulgarian, Croatian, Czech, Polish, and Russian are available via satellite through SCOLA, in the Library's Avery Fisher Center as well as at other locations around the University which receive NYU-TV. SCOLA programs may be recorded off-air for use in classrooms or by individual researchers.   The Institute of Fine Arts collects selectively, and in European languages, in the following related subjects: archeology of Baltic countries, and the Caspian and Black Sea regions, Byzantine art and architecture, 19th and 20th century Russian art and architecture, Russian conservation, history of art, methods, and art historiography.   Some of the collection weaknesses are as follows:       Russian humanities and social science imprints from the 1970s to 1995. Some of these lacunae can be filled through out-of-print dealers, reprints, and microfilm. At present, many pre- Revolutionary historical and literary works and works by dissident and emigre writers are obtainable because they are being reprinted in Russia. However, Soviet-era social science, and works by official Soviet writers will be difficult or impossible to obtain.   Government publications except for population census materials and statistical abstracts.       Serials in general. Subscriptions to many Slavic journals were canceled in the 1980s. Since 1995 current subscriptions (including 23 Russian newspapers) have been added on a very selective basis due to budgetary constraints. The library relies on the larger Slavic serial and newspaper collections of Columbia University and the New York Public Library's Baltic and Slavic Collection.   Czech and Polish imprints. As Czech and Polish studies at NYU grow (e.g., at NYU's recently expanded program in Prague, which is expected to spark a greater interest in Czech studies on the main campus), it will become increasingly necessary for the collection to support curriculum and research needs in these areas.       Central European history. Recent trends in Slavic Studies suggest growing scholarly interest in the historical and cultural connections between Eastern and Central Europe -- a consequence of changes brought about by the fall of the Soviet Union and the break ups of Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia. A reconceptualized Eastern Europe will be reflected in NYU curriculum and faculty research, and require support by the Slavic collection.       Preservation problems contribute to gaps in the collection. Most Slavic materials from the 1950s and earlier are brittle because of the poor quality paper traditionally used in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. In addition, the use of acidic paper continues in the region, which will create preservation problems in the future. The library is addressing the problem by routinely binding new material and replacing brittle material with microfilm copies.       In addition, past neglect of the collection has resulted in lost, stolen, or misshelved books. The library-wide Holdings Inventory Cleanup Project (1996-2002) -- in which staff inventory books on the shelf in comparison with the online catalog -- has been very effective in finding lost books, identifying missing books, and helping selectors try to replace important works. However, many missing books cannot be replaced in any format as they are out of print and do not exist in microfilm copies.         Other Resources/Resource Sharing   New York City is a center for Slavic scholarship thanks to the rich Slavic collections at the New York Public Library's Slavic and Baltic Division, and at Columbia University. The NYPL Baltic and Slavic Division holds over 400,00 volumes and 1,200 current serials in regional languages. Columbia University's Butler and Lehman Libraries hold 700,000 volumes and 8,000 journals in regional languages. Columbia's Bakhmeteff Archive has over 900 collections of papers concerning the East European and Russian emigre communities, as well as American views of and relations with these areas and their people.   In addition, the Polish Institute of Arts and Sciences holds many documents, papers and manuscripts relating to Polish and Polish-American literature, and the Shevchenko Scientific Society Library and Archives collects materials on Ukrainian history, literature, art and language. Other local resources include NYU's Remarque Institute, which offers fellowships, conferences, workshops, and a forum for the study of Europe as a whole, including Eastern Europe. Also, The New School's East and Central European Program, now part of the Transregional Center for Democratic Studies, promotes studies of democracy in Eastern and Central Europe. At the Center's summer graduate institute in Cracow, Democracy and Diversity, seminars are team-taught by New School and leading East European professors, and focus on such issues as citizenship, political culture, policy studies and gender in Eastern and Central Europe.

At NYU more than 40 undergraduate and 40 graduate courses deal with Slavic Studies in the following disciplines: art, Central and East European literature, cinema studies, comparative literature, cultural studies, drama, economics and economic development, gender studies, history, immigration studies, international education, linguistics, music, politics, public administration, Russian language and literature, theater, and translation studies.   On the undergraduate level the department of Russian and Slavic Studies offers a major and a minor. On the graduate level, the department offers an interdisciplinary Master of Arts degree in Russian studies, with concentrations in literature and culture, area studies, and linguistics. A newly instituted Ph.D. program is now being offered with emphases on either History or Comparative Literature. In addition, the department participates in two dual Master's degree programs: a Master of Arts degree in Russian and Journalism, in association with the Arthur L. Carter Jounalism Institute; and a dual degree in Library Science and Russian, jointly sponsored and administered by Long Island University\"s Palmer School of Library and Information Science, and NYU's Graduate School of Arts and Sciences. The latter program allows library students to be trained as Slavic subject specialist librarians. In addition, the department is in the process of adding Czech language and cultural history in connection with the recently-opened program, New York University in Prague at Charles University. Finally, the Departments of Comparative Literature, History, and the Program in International Education grant doctorates on Slavic subjects.       Scope       Language   The majority of materials are acquired in Russian and English, and more selectively in Old Church Slavonic, French, German, and Italian. In the last few years core collections have been initiated in Polish and Czech on the subjects of Polish and Czech history, literature, and cultural studies. English translations of titles in non-collected Slavic languages are acquired when available and of scholarly interest. Materials on Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania are acquired in English only.       Geographical Areas   The Slavic collection covers the following areas: - For material concerning events before 1917: the Russian empire, all Slavic-speaking countries of Eastern Europe, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Georgia.   - For materials concerning events between 1917 and 1991: the 15 republics of the Former Soviet Union and all Slavic-speaking Eastern bloc countries.   - For materials concerning events since the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991: the Russian Federation, Ukraine, Belarus, Latvia, Estonia, Lithuania, Georgia, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Poland, and former Yugoslavia.   Also of interest for Russian literature, history, intellectual history, migration and ethnic studies are the three waves of Russian emigration -- after the Revolution, after WWII, and starting in the 1970s -- as are the resulting Russian communities established in Europe, the U.S., China, Australia, and New Zealand. Of similar interest is recent Russian emigration to all former Soviet republics.   Materials concerning Romania, Albania, Moldova, and Hungary are part of the European collection. Materials concerning events before 1917 and after 1991 in Armenia, Azerbaijan, and the Former South Eastern Republics (Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan), are part of the Middle Eastern Studies collection.       Chronological Periods   Emphasis is on all historical periods from the beginning of Slavic culture to the present, with particular emphases given to nineteenth- and twentieth century Russian and Soviet history, the period since the break-up of the Soviet Union, and literary history from nineteenth through twenty-first centuries. Resources concerning the pre-literate period before the Christianization of Russia are acquired more selectively.         Types of Materials       Included   Monographs, monographic series, serials, newspapers, proceedings, facsimiles, reprints, microforms, audio-visual and electronic media (including electronic texts). Acquired on a more selective basis: dissertations, exhibition catalogs, government documents, pamphlets, scores, textbooks, and working papers.       Excluded   Ephemera, realia.         Background, Strengths, and Weaknesses of the Collection   The Slavic collection at Bobst reflects the history of Slavic Studies at NYU. When NYU's Ph.D. program in Russian literature was discontinued in 1972, collecting in Russian and other East European languages virtually stopped. The acquisition of Western-language resources about Russia and Eastern Europe, however, continued. Collecting in Russian, and to some degree Czech and Polish resumed in 1995, but despite retrospective acquisitions, many lacunae from the 1970s, '80s, and early '90s remain.   The break-up of the Soviet Union, and the end to the government monopoly of the book trade led to a great deal of confusion in Russian book acquisition. Although Western vendors have tried to fill this niche, at present blanket order acquisitions or an approval plan for Russian materials are not practical, and materials are ordered individually to support curriculum and faculty research needs. Orders are based on vendor and publishers' catalogs, library acquisition lists, bibliographies and review media as well as faculty recommendations. Journals are acquired very selectively, principally through faculty request.   The strength of the Slavic Collection is in Russian materials; collecting has always been much stronger for Russia than for any other Slavic country. While historically, the collection was strongest in language, literature and history, in recent years the social sciences and cinema have become central as well, reflecting changes in faculty research and curriculum. At present, in addition to these subjects, collecting for Russia and the Soviet Union focuses primarily on cultural history, politics, international relations, social, and economic conditions. The collection coverage for individual authors, literary criticism, literary movements, philosophy, and folklore is very good, as is the Russian video collection. Steadily becoming noteworthy are Russian cultural history, post- Gorbachev politics, Russian women in society, literature, and the arts, and Russians in emigration (history and literature), as well as reference resources such as guides to Russian archives. Areas of relatively recent scholarly interest at NYU are currently being developed and strengthened: Czech language and cultural history, Russian journalism, Russian cultural studies, the Russian, Ukrainian and East European avant-garde, local and provincial Russian and Soviet history. Slavic topics in anthropology and ethnology are emerging areas of interest.   The library offers a wide range of electronic resources, including remote and in-library access to the American Bibliography of Slavic and East European Studies (ABSEES), the major electronic index in Slavic Studies, the Central East European Library Online (CEEOL), and the INION (Institut Nauchnoi Informatsii po Obshchestvennym Naukam) index. The library also offers numerous databases which contain Slavic material, including Historical Abstracts, PAIS, the MLA Bibliography, and Dissertation Abstracts. Online access is also available for Russian journals through BobCat in areas such as arts, literature, theater, science, politics, and economics. Many Slavic electronic resources are available through the Slavic Studies web page which also includes links to the online catalogs of major national and international Slavic libraries.   The Business and Social Science/Documents Center holds many publications and statistical sources important to social science research in Slavic Studies. The United Nations and International Governmental Organizations Collection receives on deposit or standing order, the publications of the U.N. Economic Commission for Europe (which covers Russia and Eastern Europe), The International Monetary Fund, the International Labor Organization and the International Council for Migration. NGO publications of interest include Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch. The Center also has extensive microform collections covering historical and current socio-economic statistics.   The Tamiment Institute Library in Bobst holds many rare materials concerning international communism, socialism, and anarchism before and during the Soviet period. In addition to the Communist Party USA collections, materials include books, pamphlets, posters, serials, archival and manuscript collections, photographs, films, and oral histories.   The Avery Fisher Center has a strong collection of Russian and East European videos from the silent era to the present.   News broadcasts in Bulgarian, Croatian, Czech, Polish, and Russian are available via satellite through SCOLA, in the Library's Avery Fisher Center as well as at other locations around the University which receive NYU-TV. SCOLA programs may be recorded off-air for use in classrooms or by individual researchers.   The Institute of Fine Arts collects selectively, and in European languages, in the following related subjects: archeology of Baltic countries, and the Caspian and Black Sea regions, Byzantine art and architecture, 19th and 20th century Russian art and architecture, Russian conservation, history of art, methods, and art historiography.   Some of the collection weaknesses are as follows:       Russian humanities and social science imprints from the 1970s to 1995. Some of these lacunae can be filled through out-of-print dealers, reprints, and microfilm. At present, many pre- Revolutionary historical and literary works and works by dissident and emigre writers are obtainable because they are being reprinted in Russia. However, Soviet-era social science, and works by official Soviet writers will be difficult or impossible to obtain.   Government publications except for population census materials and statistical abstracts.       Serials in general. Subscriptions to many Slavic journals were canceled in the 1980s. Since 1995 current subscriptions (including 23 Russian newspapers) have been added on a very selective basis due to budgetary constraints. The library relies on the larger Slavic serial and newspaper collections of Columbia University and the New York Public Library's Baltic and Slavic Collection.   Czech and Polish imprints. As Czech and Polish studies at NYU grow (e.g., at NYU's recently expanded program in Prague, which is expected to spark a greater interest in Czech studies on the main campus), it will become increasingly necessary for the collection to support curriculum and research needs in these areas.       Central European history. Recent trends in Slavic Studies suggest growing scholarly interest in the historical and cultural connections between Eastern and Central Europe -- a consequence of changes brought about by the fall of the Soviet Union and the break ups of Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia. A reconceptualized Eastern Europe will be reflected in NYU curriculum and faculty research, and require support by the Slavic collection.       Preservation problems contribute to gaps in the collection. Most Slavic materials from the 1950s and earlier are brittle because of the poor quality paper traditionally used in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. In addition, the use of acidic paper continues in the region, which will create preservation problems in the future. The library is addressing the problem by routinely binding new material and replacing brittle material with microfilm copies.       In addition, past neglect of the collection has resulted in lost, stolen, or misshelved books. The library-wide Holdings Inventory Cleanup Project (1996-2002) -- in which staff inventory books on the shelf in comparison with the online catalog -- has been very effective in finding lost books, identifying missing books, and helping selectors try to replace important works. However, many missing books cannot be replaced in any format as they are out of print and do not exist in microfilm copies.         Other Resources/Resource Sharing   New York City is a center for Slavic scholarship thanks to the rich Slavic collections at the New York Public Library's Slavic and Baltic Division, and at Columbia University. The NYPL Baltic and Slavic Division holds over 400,00 volumes and 1,200 current serials in regional languages. Columbia University's Butler and Lehman Libraries hold 700,000 volumes and 8,000 journals in regional languages. Columbia's Bakhmeteff Archive has over 900 collections of papers concerning the East European and Russian emigre communities, as well as American views of and relations with these areas and their people.   In addition, the Polish Institute of Arts and Sciences holds many documents, papers and manuscripts relating to Polish and Polish-American literature, and the Shevchenko Scientific Society Library and Archives collects materials on Ukrainian history, literature, art and language. Other local resources include NYU's Remarque Institute, which offers fellowships, conferences, workshops, and a forum for the study of Europe as a whole, including Eastern Europe. Also, The New School's East and Central European Program, now part of the Transregional Center for Democratic Studies, promotes studies of democracy in Eastern and Central Europe. At the Center's summer graduate institute in Cracow, Democracy and Diversity, seminars are team-taught by New School and leading East European professors, and focus on such issues as citizenship, political culture, policy studies and gender in Eastern and Central Europe.

These programs encompass the following degrees: Ph.D. in Middle Eastern    Studies (Dept. of Middle Eastern and Islamic Studies), Ph.D. in History and Middle Eastern    Studies (joint degree of the Dept. of Middle Eastern and Islamic Studies and the History    Dept.), M.A. and Ph.D. in Hebrew and Judaic Studies, M.A. in Near Eastern    Studies (offered through the Kevorkian Center for Near Eastern Studies),    M.A. in Near Eastern Studies and Journalism (KCNES), M.A. in Near Eastern    Studies with a concentration in Museum Studies (KCNES), and M.A. in Near    Eastern Studies with a Business Option (KCNES and the Graduate School    of Business). The Dept. of Middle East and Islamic Studies and Skirball Dept. of Hebrew    and Judaic Studies also offer majors and minors for the B.A. degree. The    Program in Near Eastern Studies is interdisciplinary, drawing its faculty    from a number of FAS and GSAS departments. Consequently, the collection    also supports research and curricular needs in the departments of Anthropology,    Economics, Sociology, Comparative Literature, Music, Cinema Studies, Fine    Arts, and Religious Studies.    Program emphases which affect this collection statement are the Middle    East since the rise of Islam, the Ancient Near East, and Biblical Studies.                 Scope        Language     Materials in modern and classical Arabic, Persian, Ottoman and modern     Turkish, and Biblical and modern Hebrew are collected most heavily.     Egyptian, Akkadian, Ugaritic, Assyrian, and Sumerian are acquired     actively, but selectively. Coptic, Pushtu, Urdu, other Iranian and     Turkic languages are collected very selectively. The Library does     not collect materials in Armenian and the languages of the Caucasus.     The Library also acquires very comprehensively materials in European     languages; in particular English, French, and German, and to a lesser     degree in Italian, Spanish, Russian, and other European languages.         Geographical Areas     Areas collected most intensively include all of North Africa and     the Middle East from Morocco through Afghanistan. Materials on or     from Central Asia, Muslim Europe, and the diaspora communities are     collected more selectively; those on or from Pakistan and Muslim India,     sub-Saharan Africa, and East Asia are acquired very selectively.         Chronological Periods and Subject Areas     The collection encompasses a broad chronological spectrum. For the     Ancient Near East, materials on the Syro-Palestinian region and Biblical     Studies are collected most heavily. Mesopotamia and Egypt are collected     more selectively. The Library is highly selective in the acquisition     of materials on other areas of the Ancient Near East. Emphasis is     on historical, linguistic, literary, and religious material. Archaeological     material is collected only if it encompasses these four areas.     For the classical and modern Middle East, the Library acquires materials     for all of the geographic areas detailed in IIB. Major emphasis is     on language, literature, history (including political and social history),     religion, culture, women's studies, and urbanism. Politics, sociology,     anthropology, economics, and the fine and performing arts are collected     somewhat more selectively, but actively.                        Types of Materials        Included     Monographs, monographic series, serials, newspapers, proceedings,     facsimiles, reprints, government documents, microforms, audio-visual     and electronic media. Exhibition catalogs, maps, textbooks for language     instruction and dissertations are acquired very selectively.         Excluded     Manuscripts (except in very rare circumstances), textbooks, ephemera,     translations from other languages into Near Eastern languages.                        Strengths &amp; Weaknesses of the Collection    Strengths    In general, Bobst Library is strong in Arabic and Islamic reference sources,    classical and modern Arabic literature, and the history of the Middle    East. The collection is moderately strong in materials dealing with Biblical    Studies (excluding the New Testament) and the modern political and social    history of the Arab world and Iran.    The stacks collection includes approximately 4,000 books and journals    from the library of the late Islamic scholar Gaston Wiet. The materials    are in Arabic and Western languages and emphasize classical Arabic belle-lettres.    The stacks also contain the library of the Toumlilene Monastery of Azrou,    Morocco. It includes 2,000 books and journals in Arabic and Western languages    with an emphasis on North Africa. Other important collections of smaller    dimensions, housed in the general stacks, include the following: parts    of the libraries of the Egyptian writer and publisher Muhammad Mas'ud,    Islamic numismatist George C. Miles, Islamic art historian Richard Ettinghausen,    Aramco, and Mobil Oil.    In addition, Bobst Special Collections contain the Hewitt collection    of approximately 300 volumes in Ottoman Turkish which was a gift of the    last Ottoman sultan, Abd al-Hamid II. The stacks collection is actively    expanded through a current acquisitions program which encompasses extensive    approval and blanket order plans for the U.S., Europe, the Arab World,    Iran, Israel, and Turkey; as well as current and retrospective purchase    of individual titles.    Weaknesses    Following are areas and types of materials in need of additional attention    for the acquisition of materials:        Research and Curricular Emphases          Turkish Studies      Islamic Law             Serials     Although the Library owns almost all of the major periodicals in     the field, particularly in European and Arabic languages, there are     additional titles covered by indexing sources, which the Library needs     to acquire.         Electronic Resources     Although previously there has not been much published in electronic     format in Middle East Studies, there are current and forthcoming titles     which we need to acquire.         Document Collections     The Library needs to acquire primary resource collections which have     been issued in microform or in reprint, such as the Ottoman provincial     and ministry yearbooks, and the Records series published by Archive     Editions.         Preservation Issues     Many of the items in the Wiet and Toumlilene collections have serious     preservation problems and will need to be replaced by filming or purchase.                        Other Resources        Other NYU Collections     The Library of the Institute of Fine Arts is strong in materials dealing     with Islamic and other Middle Eastern art and architecture; the art     and archaeology of the ancient Near East, particularly Egyptology.     The Law School Library is strong in constitutional law materials from     the Arab world and Israel.     The Ettinghausen Library in the Kevorkian Center for Near Eastern Studies     is actually an extension of the Bobst collection. Its collection consists     of reference materials which duplicate resources available in Bobst.        Other Area Libraries     Princeton and NYU are a joint National Resource Center in Middle     East Studies. Princeton libraries are a major resource for Middle     Eastern materials and are strong in manuscripts and printed texts     in Arabic, Persian, Hebrew, and Turkish. Subjects emphasized are:     Islam, Judaism, classical and modern Middle Eastern culture, history,     language, and literature.     Columbia University Libraries (Butler and Lehmann) also have a strong     Middle East collection. The collection is an area resource in Turkish,     Armenian, and Georgian materials.     The New York Public Library, through its general collection and the     Oriental Division and the Map Division, is a strong resource for filling     Bobst gaps in Arabic, Persian, and Hebrew language materials, Near     East travel literature, Near Eastern Christianity, and Islam. The     NYPL is an area resource for newspapers of the Middle East and diaspora     communities.                        Subject &amp; Collection Levels    Forthcoming.
