The course International Organizations: Focus on Geneva will provide an analytical overview of the functioning of such organizations in the contemporary world. The main focus will be on the United Nations and its affiliated organizations, the &quot;UN system&quot;. Attention will also be given to non-UN institutions and arrangements, such as the European Union (EU), Organization of African States (OAS), African Union (AU), Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) and Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). The effectiveness, strengths and limitations of all of these intergovernmental organizations will be critically examined, along with future challenges. Particular emphasis will be given to the impact of political forces on the realization of their goals.     Geneva is the European headquarters of the United Nations, the primary seat of several of its specialized and affiliated agencies, and the center of many of its global responsibilities. This unique study tour places you in the historic Palais des Nations, the original home of the League of Nations, now the hub of international activity, and the setting for hundreds of year-round meetings and conferences. There, you meet and are briefed by senior UN officials, diplomats, key representatives of governments, and non-governmental organizations on such topics as human rights, refugees, peace and security, world health, world trade, development, HIV/AIDS, women and children, international, labor issues, and humanitarian assistance.

This in-country field intensive course will feature senior academic and policy experts who will provide their keen analytical insights into both the public and private sectors and the challengers faced as the incessant march of globalization continues.     Ideological considerations aside, the advent of China&rsquo;s economic miracle, the development of a new model of assistance along with their increasing global economic influence has thrust China onto the world stage. Understanding this phenomenon from both an economic and political perspective is at the heart of the evolving new global order. China, along with their BRIC counterparts (Brazil, Russia, and India) is at the forefront in seeking greater involvement, to include governance, for the developing countries of the world. Program participants will spend time in Beijing, the nation&rsquo;s political capital, as well as Shanghai, the nation&rsquo;s financial capital, interacting with leaders from both the public and private sectors along with leading academics. The ability of the participants to interact, in person and on-site, with these subject matter experts will deepen their perspective and understanding of the new global order that is evolving on the world stage.     The program will address: (1) a brief history of China, with a particular emphasis on the time period since the founding of the People&rsquo;s Republic of China on October, 1, 1949; (2) China&rsquo;s continuing transition from a planned economy to a socialist market economy; (3) an analysis of China&rsquo;s new model of development assistance; and (4) China&rsquo;s political/economic role in the changing landscape of global governance and emerging regional and global issues.

This course aims to give students the opportunity to understand the determinants used by governments in making decisions regarding energy policy. Students will be encouraged to challenge the way they think about energy, specifically the costs and benefits of conventional and unconventional hydrocarbon sources and renewable energy sources, such as wind, hydropower, solar and biomass. Special emphasis will be given to the study of fossil fuels, specifically oil and natural gas and distinct differences between federal and provincial policies across Canada. More broadly, we aspire to foster engagement of the Center for Global Affairs and broader New York University community in a forward thinking dialogue about the future of U.S.-Canada relations in the energy sector.     The students selected for this seminar style course will undertake case studies to clinically analyze the inputs that states use to formulate their individual policies. A holistic approach will be used to examine differences in energy policy across Canada and the United States. Individual and sector demand, historical practices, markets, and the general rate of state consumption and openness to renewables will be explored as influential factors to external energy policy. Scenario work within the course will focus on future possibilities for a U.S. Canadian partnership in energy issues.     In addition to the course and the overall initiative, enrolled students will participate in a 1-week Study Tour (March 15-20) to Calgary, Alberta to gain an augmented perspective on energy policy development in Canada. The study tour will focus on provincial, federal and local perspectives with firsthand experience allowing students the opportunity to realize the enormity and complexity of the oil sands, oil and gas development and environmental policy. Students will be given the opportunity to meet with industry representatives, academics, local and national level policy makers and think tank representatives.

The world celebrated South Africa&rsquo;s swift transition from apartheid to democracy in the 1990s. Nelson Mandela brought wisdom and magnanimity to the office of president. The hearings before the Truth and Reconciliation Commission exposed the cruelty of racism and wrongdoings by all parties. But the fairytale ending collided with high expectations abroad and deep problems over poverty, inequality, AIDS and crime at home. In the years since apartheid&rsquo;s end, South Africans have struggled to transform their society. This course is designed to explore the political, justice, economic, regional and social challenges they face. We will look at the transformation of the political system, accountability when one party dominates and South Africa&rsquo;s role on the continent. We will discuss the continuing and sometimes clashing quests for justice and for reconciliation, as well as the country&rsquo;s current soaring rate of violent crime. We will examine the issues of widespread poverty, economic empowerment and regional economic dominance. And we will explore some of the major social concerns, including the HIV/AIDS epidemic, the role of women, education shortfalls, land reform and rising immigration.      Cuba: An Intercambio      Not offered in 2010     In 1959, an insurgency led by Fidel Castro overwhelmed the US-backed regime of Fulgencio Batista and the world has never  been the same. Since then, Cuba has undergone a socialist transformation of its polity and economy; changed the course of the  Cold War; galvanized both the socialist left and the counter-revolutionary right in Latin America and beyond; continually defied  its superpower neighbor; and survived the retirement of its iconic leader. In this course, we study the Cuban Revolution's  historical antecedents, its politics and economics, and its impact on Cubans' daily lives. In doing so, we seek to move past  comfortable, politically motivated judgments to carefully consider Cuba's unique path.  This course takes us from New York to Havana and back again. We begin in the classroom. Over the first eight weeks of this  semester, we will discuss primary and secondary documents that explore Cuba's history, political economy, and society. We  begin by considering the colonial origins of Cuba's first revolution and the neocolonial period that inspired Castro's socialist  revolution. We then turn to Cuba's present, debating its political system, economic successes and failures, and its international  relations. We then consider three social implications of the Cuban Revolution - health and education, gender roles, and culture.  We also use this time to explore Cuban culture as experienced in New York and in recorded media. We then travel to Havana  to observe Cuban life first-hand. In conjunction with our partners at the Ludwig Foundation, we will explore Cuban society,  politics, and culture. Far more than a mere spring break trip, we will use our time in Cuba to translate our academic  discussion into an in-depth field study of the Cuban Revolution at 50 years. Upon our return to New York, we will discuss our  impressions of the trip and discuss Cuba's future.      Ghana: A Case Study in Development        Not offered in 2010         Development in the world&rsquo;s poor countries is the subject of major policy debates, as well as being one of the great moral imperatives of our day. In this course, we will examine multiple dimensions of development &ndash; economic, political, environmental, social, cultural and regional &ndash; through the example of Ghana.          As the first country in sub-Saharan Africa to gain independence from colonial rule, Ghana played a major role in the transformation of the continent. Despite its early promise, the country has endured political upheaval, military rule and economic collapse, as have many in the region. Today, its market liberalization, democratic transition, and political leadership, put it in the forefront of what many hope will be an African renaissance. Yet more than a third of the Ghanaian people live in poverty, despite economic reform that began a quarter of a century ago and democracy that started more than a decade ago. These are among the reasons that a case study of Ghana will fortify a broader understanding of development in Africa.          The course will be organized in two segments: sessions in New York before departure for Accra, and sessions in Ghana. Pre-departure classes will provide students with an overview of development issues, a review of African history and political evolution, and an introduction to Ghana&rsquo;s history, politics, economy and culture. In New York, students will pursue their research projects and prepare for individual case studies in the field. In Ghana, sessions will focus in-depth on major dimensions of the country&rsquo;s development, including the political, social, environmental and economic dimensions. The class will visit development projects and organizations, and students will conduct their own field research for their case studies.
