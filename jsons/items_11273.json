The planning and design of parking facilities, and the planning of access and egress from these facilities, is critical to the economic success of a development. Terminals are inter-modal interface facilities involving the transfer of people and/or goods from one mode of transportation to another. This course covers essential elements of terminal planning and design, including transit stations and terminals, major goods terminals at ports and railheads and others. The design of pedestrian space and ways within terminal structures is also treated Prerequisite: Graduate status or permission of instructor.

C. wrote: &quot;Wynton [Marsalis] is a great  classicist, and to my mind he's been a tremendous influence for the better in  contemporary jazz. He's heavily influenced the move away from the more  masturbatory direction that jazz has taken for much of the last fifty years  [expect Dr Chris to disagree. :-) ]. His introductory comments to the PBS series  'Jazz' (over the strains of Duke Ellington) were tremendously powerful: &quot;Jazz  music celebrates life - human life! The range of it. The absurdity of it. The  ignorance of it The greatness of it. The intelligence of it. The sexuality of  it. The profundity of it. And it deals with it in all of its ... It deals with  it.&quot; - Wynton Marsalis-    Actually, I don't disagree that  Marsalis has had some very profound and wonderful things to say in support of an  art form that is very dear to my heart (and I do ~not~ like all of the  directions in which contemporary jazz has gone ... but I'm a bit more open to  ~some~ of the developments than a traditionalist like Marsalis). I was the one  who forwarded to Linz the Marsalis quote that was featured in FREE RADICAL #60:  &quot;I don't want my kids listening to music about pimps and bitches. Kids like rap  because it exploits their sexuality. When you educate your son and daughter, it  is incumbent upon you to take them to things you think should be part of their  lives. That is what a civilization is about, an effort to ascend.&quot;    My biggest problem with Marsalis is  that he has tended to be a bit of a racist in his discussion of the music as a  ~black~ art form. Coming from a man who has demonstrated his proficiency as a  classical trumpeter (as well as a jazz trumpeter), that's kind of ridiculous.  Some years ago, I wrote an essay in the NY DAILY NEWS, entitled &quot;Wrong to  Trumpet Musical Segregation&quot; (Sunday, May 3, 1992). In it, I said the following :    &quot;The beauty of music is that it has  the potential to integrate people of all races and nationalities. [It is wrong  to imply] that only people of a particular subculture have the right to perform  that culture's artistic forms. On this logic, are we to dismiss those genuinely  brilliant jazz artists of the 20th century who were not African-Americans, on  the grounds that they 'exploited' black music? ... But [these] premises cut both  ways, for we'd also have to dismiss the contributions of African-Americans like  Marian Anderson and Wynton Marsalis, who have performed in the classical music  field, a 'white' art form. [We'd have to] condemn whites who 'exploit' black  music, and would be forced to condemn blacks who 'sell out' to white music. ...  Celebrate the power of music as a genuine force of racial and cultural  integration.&quot;    Some additional thoughts on all this  racialism in music were published in JUST JAZZ GUITAR and in JAZZ TIMES .  See here .    ( Sun, 18  Apr 2004 10:24:29 -0400 )    M asks about Wynton's brother,  Branford Marsalis. I personally like Branford's playing on saxophone ~more~ than  I like Wynton's playing on trumpet. (Branford was lead instrumentalist in  Sting's group when Sting broke from The Police; I saw him in person with Sting,  after &quot;Dream of the Blue Turtles&quot; was released, and was blown away by the energy  of his improvisation...)    I've always found Wynton to be a bit  stiff, though I do appreciate his talent and his indefatigable energy in  bringing jazz to wider audiences.    I don't believe, btw, that all of  today's jazz is &quot;multitudinous musical masturbation,&quot; but even though P and I  have our differences in musical appreciation, we do share some likes and  dislikes and have explored these by trading recordings.    I do think that guys like Crouch,  Marsalis, Giddens, and others, are much too race conscious in their discussions  of jazz; I've ~never~ denied that many of the great innovators have been black.  I just don't like the collectivist presumption that one has to be &quot;black&quot; in  order to exhibit &quot;soul&quot; or &quot;feeling&quot; for the music. As Linz would say: That's  all crap.    Cheers,    Chris      MADRID MADNESS     (SOLO Forum,  Posted as &quot; Re: Terrorists are winning in Spain &quot;:   Mon, 15 Mar 2004 09:57:27 -0500 )      I hesitate to engage in any long discussion of points that I have  already made, but I will make them anyway, and refer to some of my posts on the  subject.    As most of you know, I am a staunch  supporter of the War on Al Qaeda. I think the US should have staged an all-out  campaign to destroy that group 11 years ago, when they first attacked the World  Trade Center on US soil in 1993. They have been an imminent threat to US  security and should have been squashed. (Of course, I do believe that the  history of ~how~ that group ~became~ an imminent threat is important: for  answers to that question, just take a look at the history of US interventionist  foreign policy, which is an &quot;incubator&quot; for anti-American terrorism---a history  of propping up regimes from the House of Sa'ud to the mujahideen in  Afghanistan...)    This said, I have ~not~ been a  supporter of the War in Iraq, because I believe that Iraq was (a) not an  imminent threat to the US; (b) not in possession of imminently-threatening  weapons of mass destruction; and (c) not in league with Al Qaeda. If it had been  proven to me that the Hussein regime was an imminent threat and in league with  Al Qaeda, I would have supported a war against Iraq. But I still would ~not~  have supported the Wilsonian &quot;nation-building&quot; campaign that the  neoconservatives in the Bush administration have been championing: a campaign to  build a political democracy, at the cost of many American lives, and billions of  US taxpayer dollars, on the shaky foundation of a culture steeped in internecine  tribalist conflict, which has no understanding of individualism or human  freedom.    I have expanded on these subjects in  at least two articles, and countless posts to the  Liberty &amp; Power Group blog . Check out  my &quot; Not a Blog &quot; and  also...      A Question of  Loyalty       Understanding the Global Crisis    All of this said: IF it should  happen that Al Qaeda was, indeed, involved in the bombings in Madrid, what did  the War in Iraq do to undermine that group?    Nothing.    Absolutely nothing.    If anything, the US toppled a  murderous &quot;secular&quot; regime in Iraq that even Osama Bin Laden condemned as a home  to &quot;infidels.&quot; If anything, the possibilities of an emerging theocratic movement  in Iraq have been multiplied. If anything, Al Qaeda is simply using this US  occupation as a pretext for recruiting more and more terrorists to its murderous  cause.    No, I'm not &quot;implicitly&quot; supporting  the return of Saddam Hussein---who, I believe, was being, and could have been  fully contained without a US invasion. But I live in the real world ~as it is~,  not as I would like it to be. Good riddance to him and his sons and to the  Ba'ath killers.    Nevertheless, for those of us who  are in support of the war against Al Qaeda, opposition to the Iraq war last  winter was not a vote of support for Hussein; it was a strategic decision by  some of us who believed that the Iraq war was a diversion from the true sources  of Al Qaeda terrorism, with its roots in Saudi Arabia and Pakistan, ironically:  two US &quot;allies.&quot;    I shudder to think that the Madrid  bombings, 2 1/2 years to the day after 9/11, are a prelude to a similar  multi-pronged attack on NYC subways in the coming months. If that were to happen  during rush hour, Al Qaeda would take out ~thousands~ of Americans. They could  conceivably cripple the city's underground transportation, destroy underwater  tunnels, and fracture the city's infrastructure.    And the Iraq war would have done  nothing to stop it.      ON RAND, MARX, AND MAO     (SOLO Forum,  Posted as &quot;Re: About TOC&quot;: Fri, 27 Feb 2004 08:22:10 -0500 )     Let me make a few general remarks  upon which I will be expanding in print at some point; these are points that I  have made to Diana Hsieh  in personal correspondence over the last couple of months.    I think there is a great parallel  between the evolution of &quot;Objectivism&quot; and the evolution of &quot;scientific  socialism.&quot;    Marx set out the basic principles of  his philosophy, which he called &quot;scientific socialism.&quot; Ironically, however, the  implications and applications of Marx's philosophy have not been known to  history as &quot;scientific socialism.&quot; They have been grouped under the general  title of &quot;Marxism.&quot; And in the history of thought, Marxism has undergone many  transformations over time: Combinations with Hegel, Aristotle, analytic  philosophy, Freud, Sartre, even Nietzsche. In essentials, though, among all the  permutations---the &quot;revisionist&quot; Marxists, the Marxist-Leninists, the  Trotskyites, the Maoists, the Frankfurt-school thinkers, the analytic Marxists,  and so forth---there is a &quot;core&quot; that makes ~all~ of them identifiably Marxist.     Thus, we are dealing with two  different levels of generality: Philosophy versus History of Thought (and in  ~my~ reading of David Kelley's TRUTH AND TOLERATION, I think he and I are in  sync on this, even if we use different language to describe it): In terms of  fundamentals, every &quot;philosophy&quot;---be it &quot;scientific socialism&quot; or  &quot;Objectivism&quot;---is, by necessity, &quot;closed&quot;: it must be something definite, or it  is not definable; it must have ~identity~ and it must have ~boundaries~ or there  will be no way of distinguishing one doctrine from another. But in terms of the  history of thought, every &quot;philosophy&quot; by necessity is ~open~ to  interpretation... and what forms around it is a much broader &quot;school of  thought,&quot; or &quot;tradition,&quot; wherein thinkers who accept the fundamentals (and  sometimes even among those who don't accept every last fundamental) work out  interesting implications, applications, and even ~combinations~ among different  doctrines. And the &quot;working out&quot; is then subject to critique, as we argue over  &quot;whose&quot; version is more in keeping not only with the &quot;philosophy&quot;... but, more  importantly, with reality. There is thus a tension between investigatory and  what might be called &quot;hermeneutical&quot; (or interpretive) aspects going on  throughout the history of philosophy; these aspects are both a part of the  broader process of the development of ideas over time.    Interestingly, not even ~Marx~ liked  what was being done to his ~system~ of &quot;scientific socialism.&quot; Told of some of  the &quot;innovations&quot; being made by others on the basis of his core system, Marx  replied: &quot;But I am not a Marxist.&quot; Rand expressed outright sympathy for Marx and  echoed his sentiments by saying, in essence, &quot;I am not a Randist&quot;... or &quot;I am  not a Randian&quot;---when she heard of some of the things being done in her &quot;name.&quot;     So, how might we understand these  dynamics in the context of Rand's philosophy? [As I suggested  here ,]  I think one can draw a distinction between being an &quot;Objectivist,&quot; which  might designate strict adherence to every last detail of Rand's philosophic  framework (and, honestly, if that's how we &quot;define&quot; Objectivism, there was only  one &quot;Objectivist&quot; who ever existed in the history of Planet Earth), and being a  &quot;Randian,&quot; which might designate &quot;of, relating to, or resembling&quot; Rand's  philosophic framework. In this instance, one can say that &quot;Randian&quot; is the  broader designation, within which &quot;Objectivism&quot; is one possibility. In a crucial  sense, however, we are all Randians now, since every act of personal  interpretation or application by anyone on any subject is a step removed from  Rand's formally enunciated framework.    On that basis, I am not an  Objectivist. Call me a Randian, or a post-Randian or a neo-Objectivist or an  advocate of Objectivism 2.0, or even the founder of Sciabarra-ism. But don't  call me an Objectivist. I agree with the core principles of Rand's philosophy.  But I don't believe that my own innovations (on subjects like &quot;dialectics&quot;) are  part of &quot;Objectivism&quot; as Rand defined it. ~Yes~: I do believe that my own view  of dialectics as &quot;the art of context-keeping&quot; is fully consistent with  Objectivism as Rand defined it. And even though I'd argue that Rand was a  dialectician as ~I~ define it, I would never argue that Rand embraced  &quot;dialectics&quot; as such, explicitly and by that name. I believe I'm carrying on  Rand's legacy in many substantive ways, but the burden is on ~me~ to ~prove~  that through my life's work.    In the end, whatever Diana's views  of TOC, the truth is that this is all in the nature of the development of ideas:  A doctrine is put forth by an innovator. Over time, that doctrine is adapted,  interpreted, and applied to various issues and experiences of which the original  innovator could never have dreamed. Some of the approaches will resonate with  us; others won't. Some will be more &quot;orthodox&quot; (like ARI), others will be more  open to the give-and-take (like TOC), and still others will stress the total  passion for the total height (like SOLO).    It was Chairman Mao, the  authoritarian, who said, ironically: &quot;Let a hundred flowers bloom: let a hundred  schools of thought contend&quot;---despite the fact that his Cultural Revolution was  geared toward crushing all the flowers and creating an ideological monolith. The  creation of a monolith, however, is the ~decadence~ and ~death~ of a tradition,  which is why the approach of orthodoxies has always gone against my grain. When  a tradition---like Randianism---sparks differentiation and specialization in the  intellectual marketplace, it is not a sign of the decay of that tradition; it is  a sign of its life, of its vibrance. As I see it, Diana is simply staking a  claim, through her critique, to yet one more differentiated color on the  broadening spectrum of Rand's legacy. And at the risk of sounding like Marx, let  me say: This intellectual diversification is inexorable. Don't fight the future.  It's already here.    This is a  postscript to the above post:    (SOLO-Forum,  Posted as: Re: Objectivism: A few thoughts :  Tue, 02 Mar 2004 07:20:59 -0500 )    I agree with J that the ARI position  on what constitutes Objectivism is ridiculous. Peikoff's position is, itself,  ridiculous. He actually says that his book OBJECTIVISM, is not an &quot;official&quot;  part of the philosophy. This means that Objectivism begins---and ends---with  Rand's words, and ~only~ Rand's words. In fact, Peikoff excludes any writings of  Rand's not approved by her for publication in her lifetime.    This way of &quot;doing philosophy&quot; is so  absurd on the face of it, that I'm baffled every time I read about it. It makes  Objectivism not even &quot;Rand scholarship&quot;... it becomes more like the study only  of ~approved~ books in the Medieval Church, viewing other writings as those as  the Apocrypha. And if you should ~dare~ to read some of the books by Nathaniel  Branden or David Kelley, you're consorting with the Anti-Christs... uh, sorry:  Anti-Rands.    I didn't sign on to the study of  Objectivism as a substitute for Sunday School Catechism. These people just don't  have a clue about the nature of ideas and their evolution over time.    (I should note that while I ~do~  study ideas in their historical context, I do ~not~ believe that this is the  only way to study ideas. My own approach blends  historical and theoretical aspects : the first  concentrates on the historical context within which Rand's ideas were developed;  the second concentrates on the dialectical aspects of Rand's work---and seeks to  develop that dialectical component in my analysis of current social problems.)     Cheers,    Chris      THE PERILS OF POSTHUMOUS RAND BOOKS     The following  includes several posts to the SOLO Yahoo  Forum, under the thread &quot;Re: New Book by Ayn Rand!&quot;    ( Tue, 03  Feb 2004 08:19:37 -0500 )    [Yes,]  there are ~many~ posthumous Rand titles that have been published, and scholars  like myself have benefited from these publications enormously.    My concerns about the posthumous  publication of these works is not that they are being published per se.  Posthumous publication of previously unpublished material is not unusual to the  Rand literature. Indeed, I ~salivate~ over publications like the letters, the  journals, the unpublished fiction, and so forth. Rather, my concern is about  what is being ~altered~ by the Guardians of Rand's Estate. For example, I've  already shown that the publication of Rand's JOURNALS led to various ~changes~  in the text of Rand's journal entries . See  here .    And, it is also true that the  &quot;Lectures on Fiction-Writing&quot; were ~severely~ edited when they were packaged as  THE ART OF FICTION . See here .     Add to this the fact that names such  as Barbara Branden, Nathaniel Branden, and so forth, have been airbrushed out of  existence, and we get to the heart of the matter. It's not that they are  republishing and repackaging the material---which is their right. It's that they  are ~altering~ the material, and making it very difficult for anyone (except  those with privileged access to their archives) to ascertain the accuracy or  authenticity of the material.    They don't even have the decency to  leave Ayn Rand's ~words~ alone. Rand made it very clear that she had broken from  Nathaniel Branden. But in all post-Branden printings of her books, she ~never~  cut Branden's &quot;approved&quot; essays ~or~ references to his work in ~her~ essays.  Take a look at Rand's article, &quot;Our Cultural Value-Deprivation&quot; in its original  form:    &gt;&gt;In his essay on &quot;The Psychology of  Pleasure,&quot; Nathaniel Branden writes: &quot;Pleasure, for man, is not a luxury, but a  profound psychological need. Pleasure (in the widest sense of the term) is a  metaphysical concomitant of life, the reward and consequence of successful  actionjust as pain is the insignia of failure, destruction, death ....&quot; [and  what follows is an extended excerpt from the Branden essay] &lt;&lt;    The extended excerpt from Branden  ~remains~ in the reprint of &quot;Our Cultural Value-Deprivation&quot; in the posthumously  published book, THE VOICE OF REASON, except something has changed (the  [bracketed] material is ~in~ THE VOICE OF REASON, an alteration by the editor):    &gt;&gt;[An essay from ~The Virtue of  Selfishness~ on &quot;The Psychology of Pleasure&quot; states,] &quot;Pleasure, for man, is not  a luxury, but a profound psychological need. Pleasure (in the widest sense of  the term) is a metaphysical concomitant of life, the reward and consequence of  successful actionjust as pain is the insignia of failure, destruction,  death....&lt;&lt;    Note: Branden has disappeared from  Rand's text. Now it is the &quot;essay&quot; that &quot;states,&quot; not &quot;Branden,&quot; who &quot;writes.&quot;  And this is ~typical~ of what ARI-affiliated scholars do. I've heard them speak  before The Ayn Rand Society and in audio lectures. Branden is quoted on topics  such as self-esteem and pleasure---but nowhere is his ~name~ uttered.    There is only one word for this  practice: DISGUSTING.    Utterly, absolutely, completely  DISGUSTING.    It is unprofessional, unscholarly,  and ... well... DISGUSTING.    ( Wed, 04  Feb 2004 12:19:27 -0500 )    A couple of points in response to  the various threads here on ARI:    1. K criticizes the use of Rand's  name on derivative works, saying: &gt;&gt;It's like bottling up a liquid and stamping  in red and white letters &quot;Coca-cola&quot;, when it is not Coca-cola.&lt;&lt;    That's not too far off, however.  They believe they own a ~trademark~ on Rand's name, which the Estate can use in  any manner it so chooses---and they try to block other people's use of the name  &quot;Ayn Rand&quot; on such grounds, which is, uh, &quot;beyond disgusting,&quot; indeed. :)    2. Schwartz ~does~ contribute essays  to THE RETURN OF THE PRIMITIVE, btw---just not to the original NEW LEFT volume.     3. L asks about veiled criticisms of  my book by ARI-affiliated scholars. They have launched into veiled and  not-so-veiled criticisms. Here's the explicit ones:       http://www.nyu.edu/projects/sciabarra/rad/PubRadReviews/tia.html   (John Ridpath)   http://www.nyu.edu/projects/sciabarra/fem/Femreviews/femrc.htm   (Robert Mayhew)    and my responses:       http://www.nyu.edu/projects/sciabarra/rad/PubRadReviews/tiar.html   http://www.nyu.edu/projects/sciabarra/rad/PubRadReviews/brad.html   http://www.nyu.edu/projects/sciabarra/fem/Femreviews/ferc.htm      Peikoff may have, indeed, mentioned  in his lectures on &quot;Integration as the Essence of Personal Identity,&quot; &quot;how  'absurd' it would be to try to understand Ayn Rand on the basis of her Russian  background.&quot; He's made similar statements in other contexts. He has an inscribed  copy of my book, which I sent him; he knows of its existence---because I  corresponded with him during my period of research into Rand's college  education. The story of ~that~ fiasco is told here:       http://www.nyu.edu/projects/sciabarra/essays/randt1.htm      and here:       http://www.nyu.edu/projects/sciabarra/essays/randt2.htm      Peikoff is not alone in taking  implicit swipes at my work; routinely the orthodox &quot;Objectivists&quot; at  humanities.philosophy.objectivism talk about how I've set back Rand scholarship  30 years, and how I'm not a &quot;reputable&quot; scholar or authority on Rand.    So they mix their attacks with  explicit references (see Andrew Bernstein's classic call for a boycott against  my work and THE JOURNAL OF AYN RAND STUDIES) ~and~ &quot;coded&quot; responses, such as  those written by Allan Gotthelf , whose book attacks the  view that Rand learned anything from her teachers or used a dialectical  method---without ever mentioning ~who~ might have even ~raised~ these issues to  begin with.    I really can't be too upset with  these people. Their demonization of my work has upped the controversy quotient  to the point where RUSSIAN RADICAL is one of Penn State's all-time best-sellers,  now in its seventh printing.

C. wrote: &quot;Wynton [Marsalis] is a great  classicist, and to my mind he's been a tremendous influence for the better in  contemporary jazz. He's heavily influenced the move away from the more  masturbatory direction that jazz has taken for much of the last fifty years  [expect Dr Chris to disagree. :-) ]. His introductory comments to the PBS series  'Jazz' (over the strains of Duke Ellington) were tremendously powerful: &quot;Jazz  music celebrates life - human life! The range of it. The absurdity of it. The  ignorance of it The greatness of it. The intelligence of it. The sexuality of  it. The profundity of it. And it deals with it in all of its ... It deals with  it.&quot; - Wynton Marsalis-    Actually, I don't disagree that  Marsalis has had some very profound and wonderful things to say in support of an  art form that is very dear to my heart (and I do ~not~ like all of the  directions in which contemporary jazz has gone ... but I'm a bit more open to  ~some~ of the developments than a traditionalist like Marsalis). I was the one  who forwarded to Linz the Marsalis quote that was featured in FREE RADICAL #60:  &quot;I don't want my kids listening to music about pimps and bitches. Kids like rap  because it exploits their sexuality. When you educate your son and daughter, it  is incumbent upon you to take them to things you think should be part of their  lives. That is what a civilization is about, an effort to ascend.&quot;    My biggest problem with Marsalis is  that he has tended to be a bit of a racist in his discussion of the music as a  ~black~ art form. Coming from a man who has demonstrated his proficiency as a  classical trumpeter (as well as a jazz trumpeter), that's kind of ridiculous.  Some years ago, I wrote an essay in the NY DAILY NEWS, entitled &quot;Wrong to  Trumpet Musical Segregation&quot; (Sunday, May 3, 1992). In it, I said the following :    &quot;The beauty of music is that it has  the potential to integrate people of all races and nationalities. [It is wrong  to imply] that only people of a particular subculture have the right to perform  that culture's artistic forms. On this logic, are we to dismiss those genuinely  brilliant jazz artists of the 20th century who were not African-Americans, on  the grounds that they 'exploited' black music? ... But [these] premises cut both  ways, for we'd also have to dismiss the contributions of African-Americans like  Marian Anderson and Wynton Marsalis, who have performed in the classical music  field, a 'white' art form. [We'd have to] condemn whites who 'exploit' black  music, and would be forced to condemn blacks who 'sell out' to white music. ...  Celebrate the power of music as a genuine force of racial and cultural  integration.&quot;    Some additional thoughts on all this  racialism in music were published in JUST JAZZ GUITAR and in JAZZ TIMES .  See here .    ( Sun, 18  Apr 2004 10:24:29 -0400 )    M asks about Wynton's brother,  Branford Marsalis. I personally like Branford's playing on saxophone ~more~ than  I like Wynton's playing on trumpet. (Branford was lead instrumentalist in  Sting's group when Sting broke from The Police; I saw him in person with Sting,  after &quot;Dream of the Blue Turtles&quot; was released, and was blown away by the energy  of his improvisation...)    I've always found Wynton to be a bit  stiff, though I do appreciate his talent and his indefatigable energy in  bringing jazz to wider audiences.    I don't believe, btw, that all of  today's jazz is &quot;multitudinous musical masturbation,&quot; but even though P and I  have our differences in musical appreciation, we do share some likes and  dislikes and have explored these by trading recordings.    I do think that guys like Crouch,  Marsalis, Giddens, and others, are much too race conscious in their discussions  of jazz; I've ~never~ denied that many of the great innovators have been black.  I just don't like the collectivist presumption that one has to be &quot;black&quot; in  order to exhibit &quot;soul&quot; or &quot;feeling&quot; for the music. As Linz would say: That's  all crap.    Cheers,    Chris      MADRID MADNESS     (SOLO Forum,  Posted as &quot; Re: Terrorists are winning in Spain &quot;:   Mon, 15 Mar 2004 09:57:27 -0500 )      I hesitate to engage in any long discussion of points that I have  already made, but I will make them anyway, and refer to some of my posts on the  subject.    As most of you know, I am a staunch  supporter of the War on Al Qaeda. I think the US should have staged an all-out  campaign to destroy that group 11 years ago, when they first attacked the World  Trade Center on US soil in 1993. They have been an imminent threat to US  security and should have been squashed. (Of course, I do believe that the  history of ~how~ that group ~became~ an imminent threat is important: for  answers to that question, just take a look at the history of US interventionist  foreign policy, which is an &quot;incubator&quot; for anti-American terrorism---a history  of propping up regimes from the House of Sa'ud to the mujahideen in  Afghanistan...)    This said, I have ~not~ been a  supporter of the War in Iraq, because I believe that Iraq was (a) not an  imminent threat to the US; (b) not in possession of imminently-threatening  weapons of mass destruction; and (c) not in league with Al Qaeda. If it had been  proven to me that the Hussein regime was an imminent threat and in league with  Al Qaeda, I would have supported a war against Iraq. But I still would ~not~  have supported the Wilsonian &quot;nation-building&quot; campaign that the  neoconservatives in the Bush administration have been championing: a campaign to  build a political democracy, at the cost of many American lives, and billions of  US taxpayer dollars, on the shaky foundation of a culture steeped in internecine  tribalist conflict, which has no understanding of individualism or human  freedom.    I have expanded on these subjects in  at least two articles, and countless posts to the  Liberty &amp; Power Group blog . Check out  my &quot; Not a Blog &quot; and  also...      A Question of  Loyalty       Understanding the Global Crisis    All of this said: IF it should  happen that Al Qaeda was, indeed, involved in the bombings in Madrid, what did  the War in Iraq do to undermine that group?    Nothing.    Absolutely nothing.    If anything, the US toppled a  murderous &quot;secular&quot; regime in Iraq that even Osama Bin Laden condemned as a home  to &quot;infidels.&quot; If anything, the possibilities of an emerging theocratic movement  in Iraq have been multiplied. If anything, Al Qaeda is simply using this US  occupation as a pretext for recruiting more and more terrorists to its murderous  cause.    No, I'm not &quot;implicitly&quot; supporting  the return of Saddam Hussein---who, I believe, was being, and could have been  fully contained without a US invasion. But I live in the real world ~as it is~,  not as I would like it to be. Good riddance to him and his sons and to the  Ba'ath killers.    Nevertheless, for those of us who  are in support of the war against Al Qaeda, opposition to the Iraq war last  winter was not a vote of support for Hussein; it was a strategic decision by  some of us who believed that the Iraq war was a diversion from the true sources  of Al Qaeda terrorism, with its roots in Saudi Arabia and Pakistan, ironically:  two US &quot;allies.&quot;    I shudder to think that the Madrid  bombings, 2 1/2 years to the day after 9/11, are a prelude to a similar  multi-pronged attack on NYC subways in the coming months. If that were to happen  during rush hour, Al Qaeda would take out ~thousands~ of Americans. They could  conceivably cripple the city's underground transportation, destroy underwater  tunnels, and fracture the city's infrastructure.    And the Iraq war would have done  nothing to stop it.      ON RAND, MARX, AND MAO     (SOLO Forum,  Posted as &quot;Re: About TOC&quot;: Fri, 27 Feb 2004 08:22:10 -0500 )     Let me make a few general remarks  upon which I will be expanding in print at some point; these are points that I  have made to Diana Hsieh  in personal correspondence over the last couple of months.    I think there is a great parallel  between the evolution of &quot;Objectivism&quot; and the evolution of &quot;scientific  socialism.&quot;    Marx set out the basic principles of  his philosophy, which he called &quot;scientific socialism.&quot; Ironically, however, the  implications and applications of Marx's philosophy have not been known to  history as &quot;scientific socialism.&quot; They have been grouped under the general  title of &quot;Marxism.&quot; And in the history of thought, Marxism has undergone many  transformations over time: Combinations with Hegel, Aristotle, analytic  philosophy, Freud, Sartre, even Nietzsche. In essentials, though, among all the  permutations---the &quot;revisionist&quot; Marxists, the Marxist-Leninists, the  Trotskyites, the Maoists, the Frankfurt-school thinkers, the analytic Marxists,  and so forth---there is a &quot;core&quot; that makes ~all~ of them identifiably Marxist.     Thus, we are dealing with two  different levels of generality: Philosophy versus History of Thought (and in  ~my~ reading of David Kelley's TRUTH AND TOLERATION, I think he and I are in  sync on this, even if we use different language to describe it): In terms of  fundamentals, every &quot;philosophy&quot;---be it &quot;scientific socialism&quot; or  &quot;Objectivism&quot;---is, by necessity, &quot;closed&quot;: it must be something definite, or it  is not definable; it must have ~identity~ and it must have ~boundaries~ or there  will be no way of distinguishing one doctrine from another. But in terms of the  history of thought, every &quot;philosophy&quot; by necessity is ~open~ to  interpretation... and what forms around it is a much broader &quot;school of  thought,&quot; or &quot;tradition,&quot; wherein thinkers who accept the fundamentals (and  sometimes even among those who don't accept every last fundamental) work out  interesting implications, applications, and even ~combinations~ among different  doctrines. And the &quot;working out&quot; is then subject to critique, as we argue over  &quot;whose&quot; version is more in keeping not only with the &quot;philosophy&quot;... but, more  importantly, with reality. There is thus a tension between investigatory and  what might be called &quot;hermeneutical&quot; (or interpretive) aspects going on  throughout the history of philosophy; these aspects are both a part of the  broader process of the development of ideas over time.    Interestingly, not even ~Marx~ liked  what was being done to his ~system~ of &quot;scientific socialism.&quot; Told of some of  the &quot;innovations&quot; being made by others on the basis of his core system, Marx  replied: &quot;But I am not a Marxist.&quot; Rand expressed outright sympathy for Marx and  echoed his sentiments by saying, in essence, &quot;I am not a Randist&quot;... or &quot;I am  not a Randian&quot;---when she heard of some of the things being done in her &quot;name.&quot;     So, how might we understand these  dynamics in the context of Rand's philosophy? [As I suggested  here ,]  I think one can draw a distinction between being an &quot;Objectivist,&quot; which  might designate strict adherence to every last detail of Rand's philosophic  framework (and, honestly, if that's how we &quot;define&quot; Objectivism, there was only  one &quot;Objectivist&quot; who ever existed in the history of Planet Earth), and being a  &quot;Randian,&quot; which might designate &quot;of, relating to, or resembling&quot; Rand's  philosophic framework. In this instance, one can say that &quot;Randian&quot; is the  broader designation, within which &quot;Objectivism&quot; is one possibility. In a crucial  sense, however, we are all Randians now, since every act of personal  interpretation or application by anyone on any subject is a step removed from  Rand's formally enunciated framework.    On that basis, I am not an  Objectivist. Call me a Randian, or a post-Randian or a neo-Objectivist or an  advocate of Objectivism 2.0, or even the founder of Sciabarra-ism. But don't  call me an Objectivist. I agree with the core principles of Rand's philosophy.  But I don't believe that my own innovations (on subjects like &quot;dialectics&quot;) are  part of &quot;Objectivism&quot; as Rand defined it. ~Yes~: I do believe that my own view  of dialectics as &quot;the art of context-keeping&quot; is fully consistent with  Objectivism as Rand defined it. And even though I'd argue that Rand was a  dialectician as ~I~ define it, I would never argue that Rand embraced  &quot;dialectics&quot; as such, explicitly and by that name. I believe I'm carrying on  Rand's legacy in many substantive ways, but the burden is on ~me~ to ~prove~  that through my life's work.    In the end, whatever Diana's views  of TOC, the truth is that this is all in the nature of the development of ideas:  A doctrine is put forth by an innovator. Over time, that doctrine is adapted,  interpreted, and applied to various issues and experiences of which the original  innovator could never have dreamed. Some of the approaches will resonate with  us; others won't. Some will be more &quot;orthodox&quot; (like ARI), others will be more  open to the give-and-take (like TOC), and still others will stress the total  passion for the total height (like SOLO).    It was Chairman Mao, the  authoritarian, who said, ironically: &quot;Let a hundred flowers bloom: let a hundred  schools of thought contend&quot;---despite the fact that his Cultural Revolution was  geared toward crushing all the flowers and creating an ideological monolith. The  creation of a monolith, however, is the ~decadence~ and ~death~ of a tradition,  which is why the approach of orthodoxies has always gone against my grain. When  a tradition---like Randianism---sparks differentiation and specialization in the  intellectual marketplace, it is not a sign of the decay of that tradition; it is  a sign of its life, of its vibrance. As I see it, Diana is simply staking a  claim, through her critique, to yet one more differentiated color on the  broadening spectrum of Rand's legacy. And at the risk of sounding like Marx, let  me say: This intellectual diversification is inexorable. Don't fight the future.  It's already here.    This is a  postscript to the above post:    (SOLO-Forum,  Posted as: Re: Objectivism: A few thoughts :  Tue, 02 Mar 2004 07:20:59 -0500 )    I agree with J that the ARI position  on what constitutes Objectivism is ridiculous. Peikoff's position is, itself,  ridiculous. He actually says that his book OBJECTIVISM, is not an &quot;official&quot;  part of the philosophy. This means that Objectivism begins---and ends---with  Rand's words, and ~only~ Rand's words. In fact, Peikoff excludes any writings of  Rand's not approved by her for publication in her lifetime.    This way of &quot;doing philosophy&quot; is so  absurd on the face of it, that I'm baffled every time I read about it. It makes  Objectivism not even &quot;Rand scholarship&quot;... it becomes more like the study only  of ~approved~ books in the Medieval Church, viewing other writings as those as  the Apocrypha. And if you should ~dare~ to read some of the books by Nathaniel  Branden or David Kelley, you're consorting with the Anti-Christs... uh, sorry:  Anti-Rands.    I didn't sign on to the study of  Objectivism as a substitute for Sunday School Catechism. These people just don't  have a clue about the nature of ideas and their evolution over time.    (I should note that while I ~do~  study ideas in their historical context, I do ~not~ believe that this is the  only way to study ideas. My own approach blends  historical and theoretical aspects : the first  concentrates on the historical context within which Rand's ideas were developed;  the second concentrates on the dialectical aspects of Rand's work---and seeks to  develop that dialectical component in my analysis of current social problems.)     Cheers,    Chris      THE PERILS OF POSTHUMOUS RAND BOOKS     The following  includes several posts to the SOLO Yahoo  Forum, under the thread &quot;Re: New Book by Ayn Rand!&quot;    ( Tue, 03  Feb 2004 08:19:37 -0500 )    [Yes,]  there are ~many~ posthumous Rand titles that have been published, and scholars  like myself have benefited from these publications enormously.    My concerns about the posthumous  publication of these works is not that they are being published per se.  Posthumous publication of previously unpublished material is not unusual to the  Rand literature. Indeed, I ~salivate~ over publications like the letters, the  journals, the unpublished fiction, and so forth. Rather, my concern is about  what is being ~altered~ by the Guardians of Rand's Estate. For example, I've  already shown that the publication of Rand's JOURNALS led to various ~changes~  in the text of Rand's journal entries . See  here .    And, it is also true that the  &quot;Lectures on Fiction-Writing&quot; were ~severely~ edited when they were packaged as  THE ART OF FICTION . See here .     Add to this the fact that names such  as Barbara Branden, Nathaniel Branden, and so forth, have been airbrushed out of  existence, and we get to the heart of the matter. It's not that they are  republishing and repackaging the material---which is their right. It's that they  are ~altering~ the material, and making it very difficult for anyone (except  those with privileged access to their archives) to ascertain the accuracy or  authenticity of the material.    They don't even have the decency to  leave Ayn Rand's ~words~ alone. Rand made it very clear that she had broken from  Nathaniel Branden. But in all post-Branden printings of her books, she ~never~  cut Branden's &quot;approved&quot; essays ~or~ references to his work in ~her~ essays.  Take a look at Rand's article, &quot;Our Cultural Value-Deprivation&quot; in its original  form:    &gt;&gt;In his essay on &quot;The Psychology of  Pleasure,&quot; Nathaniel Branden writes: &quot;Pleasure, for man, is not a luxury, but a  profound psychological need. Pleasure (in the widest sense of the term) is a  metaphysical concomitant of life, the reward and consequence of successful  actionjust as pain is the insignia of failure, destruction, death ....&quot; [and  what follows is an extended excerpt from the Branden essay] &lt;&lt;    The extended excerpt from Branden  ~remains~ in the reprint of &quot;Our Cultural Value-Deprivation&quot; in the posthumously  published book, THE VOICE OF REASON, except something has changed (the  [bracketed] material is ~in~ THE VOICE OF REASON, an alteration by the editor):    &gt;&gt;[An essay from ~The Virtue of  Selfishness~ on &quot;The Psychology of Pleasure&quot; states,] &quot;Pleasure, for man, is not  a luxury, but a profound psychological need. Pleasure (in the widest sense of  the term) is a metaphysical concomitant of life, the reward and consequence of  successful actionjust as pain is the insignia of failure, destruction,  death....&lt;&lt;    Note: Branden has disappeared from  Rand's text. Now it is the &quot;essay&quot; that &quot;states,&quot; not &quot;Branden,&quot; who &quot;writes.&quot;  And this is ~typical~ of what ARI-affiliated scholars do. I've heard them speak  before The Ayn Rand Society and in audio lectures. Branden is quoted on topics  such as self-esteem and pleasure---but nowhere is his ~name~ uttered.    There is only one word for this  practice: DISGUSTING.    Utterly, absolutely, completely  DISGUSTING.    It is unprofessional, unscholarly,  and ... well... DISGUSTING.    ( Wed, 04  Feb 2004 12:19:27 -0500 )    A couple of points in response to  the various threads here on ARI:    1. K criticizes the use of Rand's  name on derivative works, saying: &gt;&gt;It's like bottling up a liquid and stamping  in red and white letters &quot;Coca-cola&quot;, when it is not Coca-cola.&lt;&lt;    That's not too far off, however.  They believe they own a ~trademark~ on Rand's name, which the Estate can use in  any manner it so chooses---and they try to block other people's use of the name  &quot;Ayn Rand&quot; on such grounds, which is, uh, &quot;beyond disgusting,&quot; indeed. :)    2. Schwartz ~does~ contribute essays  to THE RETURN OF THE PRIMITIVE, btw---just not to the original NEW LEFT volume.     3. L asks about veiled criticisms of  my book by ARI-affiliated scholars. They have launched into veiled and  not-so-veiled criticisms. Here's the explicit ones:       http://www.nyu.edu/projects/sciabarra/rad/PubRadReviews/tia.html   (John Ridpath)   http://www.nyu.edu/projects/sciabarra/fem/Femreviews/femrc.htm   (Robert Mayhew)    and my responses:       http://www.nyu.edu/projects/sciabarra/rad/PubRadReviews/tiar.html   http://www.nyu.edu/projects/sciabarra/rad/PubRadReviews/brad.html   http://www.nyu.edu/projects/sciabarra/fem/Femreviews/ferc.htm      Peikoff may have, indeed, mentioned  in his lectures on &quot;Integration as the Essence of Personal Identity,&quot; &quot;how  'absurd' it would be to try to understand Ayn Rand on the basis of her Russian  background.&quot; He's made similar statements in other contexts. He has an inscribed  copy of my book, which I sent him; he knows of its existence---because I  corresponded with him during my period of research into Rand's college  education. The story of ~that~ fiasco is told here:       http://www.nyu.edu/projects/sciabarra/essays/randt1.htm      and here:       http://www.nyu.edu/projects/sciabarra/essays/randt2.htm      Peikoff is not alone in taking  implicit swipes at my work; routinely the orthodox &quot;Objectivists&quot; at  humanities.philosophy.objectivism talk about how I've set back Rand scholarship  30 years, and how I'm not a &quot;reputable&quot; scholar or authority on Rand.    So they mix their attacks with  explicit references (see Andrew Bernstein's classic call for a boycott against  my work and THE JOURNAL OF AYN RAND STUDIES) ~and~ &quot;coded&quot; responses, such as  those written by Allan Gotthelf , whose book attacks the  view that Rand learned anything from her teachers or used a dialectical  method---without ever mentioning ~who~ might have even ~raised~ these issues to  begin with.    I really can't be too upset with  these people. Their demonization of my work has upped the controversy quotient  to the point where RUSSIAN RADICAL is one of Penn State's all-time best-sellers,  now in its seventh printing.

Please note that this     process can take several weeks. We cannot guarantee a decision     date; you will be contacted by the Graduate School when an     admission decision has been made on your application. If you     have any questions and concerns regarding your application,     please contact the Math Department at admissions@math.nyu.edu .                The Program      The departments of mathematics and computer science at NYU's     Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences offer a master's     degree in scientific computing. The program provides broad yet     rigorous training in areas of mathematics and computer science     related to scientific computing. It aims to prepare people     with the right talents and background for a technical career     doing practical computing.      The program accommodates both full-time and part-time     students, with most courses meeting in the evening. The     program is self-contained and terminal, providing a complete     set of skills in a field where the need is greater than the     supply. The masters program focuses on computational science,     which includes modeling and numerical simulation as used in     engineering design, development, and optimization.           During the academic years of 2012 and 2013 a concentration in     data sciences existed within the scientific computing program;     this concentration has been discontinued as of 2014. Incoming     students interested in data sciences should consider the     recently-created Masters              of Science in Data Science within the NYU Center for Data     Science .           Starting Fall of 2014 the modified the program requirements     and guidelines listed below will apply to all incoming     students. The new list of required/approved courses includes     the previous list but gives additional flexibility for     students to tailor the list of courses to their background and     interests. Students presently enrolled in the Modeling and     Simulation track can choose to complete the program either     under the new or the old requirements. Students enrolled in     the Data Science concentration should consult the expanded     course options and modified requirements below since this     increases flexibility while maintaining consistency with the     previous requirements. These students should contact Professor     Esteban Tabak for help     in deciding on classes to take.                Scientific Computing:     Overview           Scientific computing is an indispensable part of almost all     scientific investigation and technological development at     universities, government laboratories, and within the private     sector. Typically a scientific computing team consists of     several people trained in some branch of mathematics, science,     statistics, or engineering. What is often lacking is expertise     in modern computing tools such as visualization, modern     programming paradigms, and high performance computing. The     master's program in scientific computing aims to satisfy these     needs, without omitting basic training in numerical analysis     and computer science. Many graduates of this program work at     technologically advanced institutions, especially in research     and development, where their skills and experience complement     those without interdisciplinary degrees. The program is also     open to students who will go on to pursue doctoral studies in     computer science, mathematics, or statistics.      The master's program in scientific computing focuses on the     mathematics and computer science related to advanced computer     modeling and simulation. The program is similar in structure     to terminal master's programs in engineering, combining     classroom training with practical experience. The coursework     ranges from foundational mathematics and fundamental     algorithms to such practical topics as data visualization and     software tools. Electives encourage the exploration of     specific application areas such as mathematical and     statistical finance, applications of machine learning, fluid     mechanics, finite element methods, and biomedical modeling.     The program culminates in a master's project, which serves to     integrate the classroom material.           Admission Requirements      The program requires least three semesters of Calculus     (including multivariate calculus), as well as linear algebra.     Experience with programming in a high-level language (e.g.,     Java, C, C++, Fortran. Python) as well as data structures,     equivalent to a first-year sequence in computer science,      is also required. It is highly desirable that applicants have     undergraduate major or significant experience in mathematics,     a quantitative science or engineering, or economics.      The deadline for application to the program is April 1st for     the fall semester. The program admits students both on a     full-time and on a part-time basis. The application process     takes place online via the Graduate School of Arts and     Sciences; please visit the Graduate     School Admissions site .

Students should consult these lists of course offerings to    determine the availability of desired courses.     Concentration in Data     Science     This section is meant only for students presently enrolled in    the Data Science concentration; this concentration is no longer    offered. To graduate, students enrolled in the old concentration    are required to take the following core courses     in mathematics for the concentration in data science:                One of           MATH-GA              2962 Mathematical Statistics (spring semester),      DS-GA-1001 Introduction to Data Science (fall), or           DS-GA-1002 Statistical and Mathematical Methods                and either            MATH-GA              2043 Scientific Computing (fall and spring     semesters)                or both            MATH-GA              2010 Numerical Methods I (fall semester) and            MATH-GA              2020 Numerical Methods II (spring semester)           The following are the three required core courses      in computer science for the concentration in data science:            CSCI-GA              1170 Fundamental Algorithms (fall, spring and     summer terms)       CSCI-GA              3033 Open Source Tools (fall term)          and one of           CSCI-GA              2565 Machine Learning (fall term), or      DS-GA-1003 Machine Learning and Computational Statistics     (spring)          Students in the concentration in data science must complete 33    points points of course credit (11 courses), including core and    elective courses. They must also obtain 3 points from a master's    capstone project.          The Capstone Project      The master's program culminates in a capstone project. The     capstone project course is usually taken during the final year     of study. During the project, students go through the entire     process of solving a real-world problem, from collecting and     processing data to designing and fully implementing a     solution. The problems and data sets come from settings     identical to those encountered in industry, academia, or     government.           The following is a list of courses approved to meet the     capstone requirement:             MATH-GA.2011/ CSCI-GA.2945      Advanced topics: Data Science      CSCI-GA Advanced Topics: High-Performance Computing      DS-GA-1006 Capstone Project in Data Science      CSCI-GA Advanced Computer Graphics      CSCI-GA Multicore Processors: Architecture     &amp;Programming      CSCI-GA Software Engineering           Advanced students can obtain permission from the director of     the program to do an individual capstone project under the     supervision of a faculty member.                Computing Facilities      The Courant Institute makes available for graduate training     and coursework a network of workstations maintained by systems     administrators. All graduate students have computer accounts     for the duration of their studies. NYU also runs a     high-performance computing center with both shared-memory and     distributed-memory computers.

Academic Standards      To register for courses, students must maintain good academic     standing, fulfilling the following requirements:           Students must maintain an average of B or better over     their first twelve credits. Students who fail to achieve     this cannot continue in the master's program.      Students cannot obtain a master's degree unless they have     maintained an overall average of B or better. Students at     risk of failing to meet this requirement receive a warning     letter from the department.      Students cannot obtain more than four no-credit grades,     withdrawals, or unresolved incomplete grades during their     academic tenure, and no more than two such grades in the     first six courses for which they have registered.          Up to two core courses taken elsewhere can earn transfer credit,    subject to the normal NYU graduate school restrictions on    transfer of credit and the approval of the program director. At    least 30 credits must be taken at NYU.
