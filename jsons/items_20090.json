Stern isn&rsquo;t a school where you learn things that you&rsquo;re never going to use on a day-to-day basis. At the height of the corporate governance scandals, I was taking a seminar in which the CEOs of major companies like American Express and Deloitte &amp; Touche came in to talk to us about what was going on. New York becomes an extension of the classroom at Stern. It has a lot to do with the professors. They&rsquo;re not just working in academia. They&rsquo;re out in the field doing the things we hope to do one day.&rdquo; -Lee Miller, BS 2005                                                              Academic Programs     Undergraduate   MBA   PhD                           News      NYU Stern Center for Business and Human Rights to Tackle Migrant Labor Rights in the Construction Industry    Foreign Policy Association Awards Medal to Dean Peter Henry    Follow @NYUStern on Twitter and like NYU Stern on Facebook         Basics      Directions &amp; Maps    Faculty Directory    Contact Us                                 FACULTY OPINIONS    Read Stern faculty opinions on  relevant business topics             Sitemap | Privacy | &copy; 2015 Leonard N.
