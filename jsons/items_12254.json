Introduction   The focus of this course is on mastering an approach to analysis of musical style as presented by Jan LaRue as well learning the approach of musical analysis as presented in Sonic Design by Cogan and Escot. The LaRue analysis will be a tool that will provide observations of 19th Century musical style. LaRue provides a systematic approach to SHMRG (Sound, Harmony, Melody, Rhythm, Growth) and a means of examining this musical factors in context of time, genre, and other components through a category identified as Evaluation. Cogan and Escot&#39;s Sonic Design provides a departure from conventional analytic categories: Musical Space, Musical Language, Time and Rhythm: Dimensions and Activity, and The Color of Sound. This approach will be used to examine 20th Century musical practices and will be applied in analyzing specific works.  Therefore the emphasis of the course is on developing analytical skills rather than covering a wide range of repertoire of 19th and 20th Century works. Students should have a mastery of undergraduate theory, since this course builds upon, as well as departs from, this knowledge base.   Another feature of the course is student publication of two analysis projects: one for 19th Century music and one for 20 Century music. Manuscripts will be typed and complete with musical examples, bibliography, and references, as needed.     Topics     Introduction to Music Analysis   General Overview of Music Analysis.

Textbooks:       Cogan, Robert and Pozzi Escot. Sonic Design: The Nature of Sound and Music.   Prentice- Hall, Inc., Englewood Cliffs, N.J., 1976. (Reissued by Publication  Contact International, Cambridge, Mass., 1984)    LaRue, Jan. Guidelines for Style Analysis. (2nd ed.) Harmonie Park Press, Michigan,   1992.           Introduction   The focus of this course is on mastering an approach to analysis of musical style as presented by Jan LaRue as well learning the approach of musical analysis as presented in Sonic Design by Cogan and Escot. The LaRue analysis will be a tool that will provide observations of 19th Century musical style. LaRue provides a systematic approach to SHMRG (Sound, Harmony, Melody, Rhythm, Growth) and a means of examining this musical factors in context of time, genre, and other components through a category identified as Evaluation. Cogan and Escot&#39;s Sonic Design provides a departure from conventional analytic categories: Musical Space, Musical Language, Time and Rhythm: Dimensions and Activity, and The Color of Sound. This approach will be used to examine 20th Century musical practices and will be applied in analyzing specific works.  Therefore the emphasis of the course is on developing analytical skills rather than covering a wide range of repertoire of 19th and 20th Century works. Students should have a mastery of undergraduate theory, since this course builds upon, as well as departs from, this knowledge base.   Another feature of the course is student publication of two analysis projects: one for 19th Century music and one for 20 Century music. Manuscripts will be typed and complete with musical examples, bibliography, and references, as needed.     Topics     Introduction to Music Analysis   General Overview of Music Analysis. Assignment of Texts. Assignment of Readings. Overview of Course: First half of course deals with stylistic tendencies of 19th Century Music, Using LaRue&#39;s Guidelines for Style Analysis as the &quot;method&quot;. Second half of the course deals with stylistic tendencies of 20th Century Music using Cogan and Escot&#39;s Sonic Design as the basis for analysis. Focus of the Course is on Analytic Technique using selected scores as source materials.
