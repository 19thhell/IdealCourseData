Eight credits will be awarded for participation in the compulsory Legal Theory Thesis Seminar and the completion of the thesis. Generally, students must register for at least two colloquia over the course of the year, but this requirement may be waived by the program director in appropriate cases. All students will design their course of study in close consultation with the program director. This is intended to ensure that students craft a program of study that is both relevant and valuable to the student\u2019s background, interests, and professional goals. Students are encouraged to enroll in courses designated as \u201cLegal Theory\u201d in the course schedule.   Thesis   Students will write an original scholarly work on a particular topic in legal theory. There is no required length; the requirement is rather that the student demonstrates mastery of a particular area of legal theory through mounting an original argument. Depending on the chosen field, such theses could range from 40 to 100 pages. Supervision of individual theses will be provided by a faculty member with expertise in the relevant field. Students are required to settle on a topic, and select a supervisor, by the midpoint of the fall semester.

NYU School of Law pioneered the colloquium model\u2014designed to engage scholars and students in the highest level of discussion in legal theory\u2014with colloquia in Legal History and Legal, Political, and Social Philosophy. Our colloquia now range widely over different areas of legal theory, such as constitutional theory and the economic analysis of law, and in all these areas our professors are producing trailblazing scholarship. We took this leadership role a step further, with the creation of the first graduate degree in legal theory.   At NYU we construe \"legal theory\" broadly to include scholarly reflection on domestic and international law and legal institutions that draws on philosophy, economic theory, psychology, anthropology, political theory, critical race theory, feminist theory, history and sociology. NYU has long been a leader in interdisciplinary legal theory, with special strengths in philosophical, economic and sociological approaches, as well as legal history. The program is for a select group of highly motivated students who wish to take full advantage of our unrivaled faculty resources in the area in order to establish a firm foundation for future scholarly or professional pursuits. This full-time program is especially suitable for those planning a career in legal academia and is open to students with a law degree from countries around the world.   Legal Theory Thesis Seminar   All students are required to write a substantial thesis in conjunction with the year-long Legal Theory Thesis Seminar , designed specifically for students in the program. The seminar integrates instruction on a variety of methodological approaches with assistance in choosing and refining the research project. It also offers students an opportunity to receive critical feedback on thesis drafts from both the instructor and other students in a workshop format. Guest lectures will supplement instruction during the early weeks of the Fall semester to ensure breadth of theoretical and methodological instruction. The Spring semester will be devoted primarily to the workshopping of draft theses.   An Interdisciplinary Education: Centers and Institutes   An interdisciplinary study of law involves integrating methodologies and perspectives from several disciplines to gain a multidimensional understanding of legal problems. The Law School is home to 29 interdisciplinary centers and institutes in which faculty and students collaborate on timely, often policy-pushing projects. As example, in just 15 years the Brennan Center for Justice has become one of the nation\u2019s preeminent legal institutions, promoting a nonpartisan agenda of research, public advocacy and legal action in its four issue areas: democracy, poverty, criminal justice and liberty and national security.

The Office of Career Services assists students with their job search process, offering services and training to prepare them for entry into positions in the private law market. A key part of this process is the annual International Student Interview Program , designed to bring students together with employers from around the globe.   The Public Interest Law Center is the focal point for public service at the Law School. Those who have an interest in pursuing positions in government, NGOs, international organizations, or other public interest employment attend the Public Interest Legal Career Fair , the largest of its kind in the nation. They may also apply for post-graduation funding from the Law School to pursue short-term fellowships, clerkships and internships worldwide through the following programs:     International Law and Human Rights Fellowship Program   International Court of Justice Clerkship   International Law &amp; Development Fellowship Programs                                           Facebook   Twitter   YouTube   Instagram   Visitor Information   Directories   Offices and Departments   Site Map   NYU School of Law                   Prospective Info   Admissions (JD) Admissions (LLM/JSD) Areas of Study Degrees Offered Faculty Profiles Campus Map  Academics   Academic Sitemap Course Descriptions Class Schedules NYU Classes Clinics Academic Calendars  Departments   Academic Services Career Services Financial Aid Graduate Affairs (LLM) Hospitality and Events Housing Human Resources Library Operations and Facilities Records and Registration Student Affairs  Tools and Resources   About the Law School Campus Map Directories Law School News Journals Picture Book                      \u00a9 2015 New York University School of Law. 40 Washington Sq.
