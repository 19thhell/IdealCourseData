As borders between media shift, contemporary sculpture and installation work may include new uses of video, ceramics, architecture, fabric, drawing, or performance, as well as classic skills such as woodworking, welding, or moldmaking.    The sculpture facility covers a full floor of the Barney building. It is divided into a wood and metal shop which includes a panel saw, Sawstop table saw, compound miter saw, vertical and horizontal bandsaws for both metal/woodworking, an air compressor system and downdraft table for sanding. In addition, we have a 800 sq/ft critique space for the presentation of student art work, as well as a plaster and moldmaking studio with a self contained spray booth room. Shop technicians are available for information and oversight of the studio. The sculpture faculty includes Area Director Sue De Beer, Beverly Semmes, Rico Gatson, Curtis Mitchell, Dave Hardy, Ian Cooper, and other innovative practitioners.    Craft Sculpture: Ceramics, Metalsmithing, Fabric, and Glass    The renewed connection between fine arts and craft media has become the focus of a new cross-disciplinary movement in contemporary art. Courses in ceramics, mixed media sculpture, metalsmithing, jewelry, and sewn fabrics allow artists to expand their ideas and practices through a wide range of materials and skills in the Art Department&rsquo;s studio facilities. Through a unique liaison with Urban Glass, the largest facility in the world dedicated to glass as an art form, students can expand their creative vocabulary in this medium, as well. Area Director Judith Schwartz is on of the world&rsquo;s leading authors and curators in ceramics. Faculty including Matt Nolen, Beverly Semmes, Klaus Burgel, Shida Kuo, and discuss work within a historical and contemporary framework, designed to help students gain both technical and critical skills.    Photography    Our darkroom, on the second floor of Barney Building, is complete with a 30&rdquo; Colex color processor, group black &amp; white and color darkrooms, as well as eight individual color darkrooms. There are two classrooms, equipped with iMacs, video and slide projectors, digital photo printers, flatbed scanners and negative scanners. Each classroom can also be converted into a photo studio, each with black, white and grey seamless backdrop rolls. We have a large selection of equipment for loan, which includes, but not limited to, 35mm cameras, medium and large format cameras, digital SLRs, HD video cameras, sound recorders, tungsten lighting kits, strobe lighting kits, tripods and a green screen kit. For MFAs, BFAs, and students registered in photo classes, all equipment can be checked out of the Darkroom for 72 hours at a time, free of charge. Classes offered include B&amp;W, Color, Digital, Documentary, and Photography &amp; Performance, as well as studio courses including lighting &amp; medium and large format cameras. Artists, critics, and historians share faculty duties in this challenging area, led by performance artist Gerald Pryor. Photography faculty include Lyle Ashton Harris, Hiroshi Sunairi, Adam Putnam, and Dan Torop.    Barney Darkroom Blog &amp; Hours . 212-998-5755    Design/Video Studio &amp; Digital Imaging    The Design Studio is an iMac computer lab equipped with a full range of software for design, photography, video and new media.

This studio provides students with powerful tools to learn, create and collaborate.    The Digital Imaging Studio is an iMac classroom equipped with large format archival printing.

Digital Fabrication Studio     The Digital Fabrication Studio is a multidisciplinary hackerspace equipped to explore new media and design. The studio houses iMac and PC computers, an Epilog Helix 24 Laser Engraver, Makerbot and Formlabs 3D printers, a full range of electronics prototyping equipment and hardware, a CNC plotter and access to a Shopbot Desktop CNC router. HD projection and HD television allow instructors and students to share, explore and adapt to the rapid cultural and technological innovation the world faces today.    Painting and Drawing    The skills of painting and drawing enable the artist-student to transform ideas, be they internal or external, to the planarity of a piece of paper or canvas. This process of converting thoughts and signs into visually accessible shapes is complex and, at times, very direct. For this reason, painting and drawing will always be considered by many to be at the heart and soul of the visual arts.    The recent resurgence of interest in traditional hand made media speaks to many issues in contemporary life, and the demand for courses in these areas is higher than ever. Our painting and drawing faculty, led by Area Director Maureen Gallace, with the support of John Torreano, Jesse Bransford, Ross Bleckner, Peter Rostovsky, and Jason Tomme reflects the broad range of acclaimed artists working in classical materials.    Print    Print provides contemporary artists with a extensive array of possibilities and working methods, from photocopy to etching to digital 3-D printing, from unique to multiple to installation. The NYU Print Studio is dedicated to an environment where this range is encouraged along with experimentation and personal exploration.    The print studio, with 14' high ceilings and northern light, is equipped to realize ideas in multiple techniques, including silkscreen (photo-process darkroom), etching (two Charles Brand etching presses), relief print, book arts and letterpress (Vandercook UNI-1 press), digital imaging/printing (Epson 4900 Archival Printer, Epson scanner, AccuRIP software, Xante PostScript large formate laser printer), as well as Departmental facilities for laser cutting and 3-D printing. New York City at large provides a unique context for the study of print, which includes numerous special print exhibitions, vast museum collections, the annual New York City Print Week, and a vibrant diy, zine, and street art scene. The print area faculty, led by Area Head Mark Johnson, includes Kiki Smith, Valerie Hammond, Noah Breuer, and Ruby Sky Stiler.    Environmental Activism    Faculty member Natalie Jeremijenko, one of the most visible and dynamic forces working at the intersection of art, technology, engineering, and environmental studies, has established the Environmental Health Clinic, a laboratory to diagnose environmental ills and create prescriptions for a greener tomorrow. Working with designers, gardeners, and computer scientists, Jeremikenko, who is herself an engineer as well as an artist, is establishing a cross-disciplinary team of artists and researchers to contribute to a slate of poetic and political project                        This site, and all its contents, are Copyright &copy;        by New York University.
