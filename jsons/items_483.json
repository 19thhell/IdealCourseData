AT . cs.nyu.edu     In this course, we introduce principles and applications of database design. We   begin by discussing data manipulation and use python to render clean datafiles. We will study database design for use with a relational database using &quot;real-world&quot; data and examples and then introduce and move on to web-based implementations of database   applications. One class project will use a MySQL database to manage your data along with PHP to present a coherent and attractive interface for the users. In addition, we will explore using Python and SQLite for smaller applications; and we will introduce NoSQL with our study of MongoDB. I encourage students to explore not only the principles of database design but also specific database issues and data complexities in their respective fields of study.
