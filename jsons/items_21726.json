Use quotes for titles of online articles and blog entries: Her article, &ldquo;A Guide to Climate Change,&rdquo; recently appeared in Salon.    Don&rsquo;t italicize the names of networks (CNN, ABC)    Capitalize &ldquo;the&rdquo; in a title: &ldquo;He subscribes to The New York Times .&rdquo;    Use &ldquo;the&rdquo; before the name of an institution, always lowercase in narrative text: &ldquo;Maria attended the City University of New York.&rdquo;    Write out the name of a company the way that the company does it (usually found at the bottom of the hompage on the company's website). Use an ampersand only if the company's official name includes one: &ldquo;AT&amp;T.&rdquo; There's no no need to include &ldquo;Inc.&rdquo; or &ldquo;LLC.&rdquo;          Numbers       Spell out numbers one through nine, except in the case of ages. Spell out any number that begins a sentence.    Use numerals for 10 and up, except when at the beginning of a sentence.    Numbers at the beginning of the sentence are spelled out, unless they are a percentage: &ldquo;Seventy-five academic majors are available for undergraduates.&rdquo; &ldquo;85 percent of graduates are now working in the field.&rdquo; Use numerals for percentages, and spell out the word \"percent\" in narrative text.    Ratios: use &ldquo;2-to-1&rdquo; and &ldquo;student-to-faculty ratio&rdquo; in narrative text, &ldquo;2:1&rdquo; or &ldquo;student-faculty ratio&rdquo; in display copy.    Use numerals for academic credits: &ldquo;This is a 3-credit course.&rdquo; &ldquo;The major requires 42 credits.&rdquo;    Use dollar symbols in text: &ldquo;The renovation cost $30 million.&rdquo;    Use comma after thousands in a numeral: 3,210    Use hyphens when numbers are used as an adjective (&ldquo;21st-century education,&rdquo; &ldquo;17-year-old girl&rdquo;); no hyphens when used as a noun (&ldquo;In the 20th century,&rdquo; &ldquo;She is 17 years old.&rdquo;)    When spelling out numbers under 100, use hyphens, even when they are used as a noun: &ldquo;One hundred and sixty-four years ago was the coldest winter in the city&rsquo;s history.&rdquo;    In phone numbers, use hyphens: 212-992-7650. Do not include the &ldquo;1&rdquo; that needs to be dialed before the area code.          Punctuation       PERIODS: There is only one space after a period. Not two.    COMMAS: Use the serial/Oxford comma before conjunctions (and, or).       &ldquo;Would you like a donut, a cookie, a muffin, or all three?&rdquo;    &ldquo;The Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development&rdquo;       N-DASH (&ndash;): For parenthetical remarks. Use one space before and after (MS Word will automatically make an N-dash when you type two dashes between two words, separated by spaces). Do not overuse.       &ldquo;We enroll nearly 6,400 students each year &ndash; 2,500 undergraduates and 3,900 master&rsquo;s &ndash; to create a highly diverse mix of students.&rdquo;       POSSESSIVES: The possessive of singular nouns, including ones that end in an s, is formed by the addition of an apostrophe and the letter s.      the School&rsquo;s faculty, Charles&rsquo;s research projects       The possessive of plural nouns, including ones that end in an s, is formed by the addition of an apostrophe only.      the puppies&rsquo; tails, the children&rsquo;s desks          &ldquo;Its&rdquo; shows ownership of something, means &ldquo;belonging to it&rdquo; or &ldquo;of it,&rdquo; and does not have an apostrophe. Like &ldquo;his,&rdquo; &lsquo;yours,&rdquo; and &ldquo;hers,&rdquo; &ldquo;its&rdquo; is a possessive pronoun.       &ldquo;The puppy wagged its tail.&rdquo;    &ldquo;The school is designing its website.&rdquo;       &ldquo;It&rsquo;s&rdquo; is not a possessive, but is a contraction, or a shortened version, of &ldquo;it is&rdquo; or &ldquo;it has.&rdquo;       &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been a pleasure to meet you.&rdquo;    &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been warm all month, but today it&rsquo;s getting cold.&rdquo;       QUOTATION MARKS: Commas and periods and other punctuation that are part of the citation, such as exclamation points and question marks, always go inside end quotes.       &ldquo;You&rsquo;re late!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I am?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Yes, you are,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Forty minutes late.&rdquo;       SEMICOLONS: In sentences featuring series with commas within the elements, use semicolons to separate elements before &ldquo;and.&rdquo;      &ldquo;Students come from Guangzhou, China; Houston, Texas; and Paris, France.&rdquo;       Semicolons can also be used to join two related, full sentences.      &ldquo;He was running late that morning; his friend was going to be angry about the muffins.&rdquo;          COLONS: Use one space after colons before continuing text. If what follows the colon is an independent clause (it could stand alone as a complete sentence), capitalize the first word.       &ldquo;It was obvious: The muffins would not be done on time.&rdquo;    &ldquo;There were three things that would not be done: the muffins, the donuts, and the cookies.&rdquo;             Students and Alumni       An alumnus or alumna is anyone who attended NYU for at least one semester. A graduate earned a degree from the school.       alumni: used for plural masculine or for a plural group of men and women    alumnus: male, singular    alumna: female, singular    alumnae: used for plural feminine    alum and alums: used only casually/informally       When referring to alumni and specifying the year of graduation and degree, put the degree first, followed by the year, in parentheses: &ldquo;John Doe (BS &rsquo;89) recently finished his first film.&rdquo; The person&rsquo;s program of study can be included in the parentheses if needed: &ldquo;Jane Doe (MA &rsquo;99, Early Childhood Education) is currently working at the Department of Education.&rdquo;    When only specifying the year, there&rsquo;s no need for parentheses: &ldquo;John Doe &rsquo;04 was elected co-chair.&rdquo;    If you are specifying a current student&rsquo;s program of study, you may choose not to mention the year: &ldquo;Jane Doe, an Instrumental Performance student, will perform next Monday.&rdquo;    When writing about alumni from multiple NYU schools, specify the year of graduation and the school of study: &ldquo;John Doe (Steinhardt &rsquo;07) lives in Oakland, California.&rdquo; &ldquo;The conference will be led by Jane Doe (GSAS &rsquo;11).&rdquo;    Capitalize &ldquo;class&rdquo; when referring to a specific graduating class: the Class of 2014.          Web-Related Guidelines    See Writing for the Web for additional guidelines.       email, internet, online: lowercase unless at start of sentence    website, webpage, homepage: one word, lowercase unless at start of sentence    eNews, email: no hyphen    Do not use ampersands (&amp;), instead, spell out &ldquo;and.\" (Only use an ampersand when it is part of an official name, such as \"AT&amp;T.\")    Spell out abbreviations and acronyms the first time you use them on each page, even if they&rsquo;ve already been spelled out on the homepage.    When linking to a website, use text that describes it: &ldquo;For information, visit Financial Aid .&rdquo; Avoid using non-descriptive text like &ldquo;For information, click here .&rdquo; (Do not include punctuation marks such as commas and periods in the hyperlink.) Avoid using the website address itself as the linked text: &ldquo;For information, go to http://steinhardt.nyu.edu/financialaid .&rdquo;    When writing for a print publication, underline or boldface website addresses and don&rsquo;t include the &ldquo;http://,&rdquo; as it&rsquo;s redundant. Example: &ldquo;For more information, go to steinhardt.nyu.edu .&rdquo; There is usually no need to include the &ldquo;www&rdquo; in the website address either, unless it isn&rsquo;t intuitively clear that it is a web link, such as &ldquo;last.fm&rdquo;.)       Note: On writing text for links: . See more tips regarding links .       When linking to a website, use text that describes it: &ldquo;For information, visit Financial Aid .&rdquo; Avoid using generic or non-descriptive text like &ldquo;For information, click to read .&rdquo; (Do not include punctuation marks such as commas and periods in the hyperlink.)    Using phrases like \" click here \" is:       redundant : as web users, we already know what to do when we see linked text    inaccessible : it doesn't visually stand out on a page, won't be scanned by screen readers for the visually impaired, and is not descriptive enough to be \"seen\" by search engines    outdated : these days, web readers are more likely to swipe or tap than click       Avoid using the website address itself as the linked text : &ldquo;For information, go to http://steinhardt.nyu.edu/financialaid .&rdquo;    Do This:       Visit Financial Aid    Apply Now    Find out more about Steinhardt's graduate programs       Don't Do This:       Visit Financial Aid at http://steinhardt.nyu.edu/financialaid    To apply now, click here    Find out more about Steinhardt's graduate programs                          This site, and all its contents, are Copyright &copy;        by New York University.
