Each team is expected to (a) make a  short presentation to the class reporting on their project (15 minutes including  Q&amp;A), and (b) submit a zip  file containing all of their project-related materials (e.g. Excel model files,  PowerPoint presentation files, Word descriptions, etc.)    This page contains links to the zip files submitted by  students in previous semesters, and may be useful in selecting a project idea or  seeing what past presentations have looked like.    The primary input for evaluating team  projects is input from the other students in the class, based on these criteria:       Did the team study an important and   realistic management problem?    Did the team do a good job of   identifying the key issues and choices faced in their project, and tying   these elements to the ideas learned in the course?    Was the team's project challenging, and   did it make good use of modeling skills and techniques from the   course?    Was the team well prepared, and did   they give an overall excellent presentation in terms of speaking style and   visual aids?    Is the team's model useful for   improving managerial decision making?

Each team is expected to (a) make a  short presentation to the class reporting on their project (15 minutes including  Q&amp;A), and (b) submit a zip  file containing all of their project-related materials (e.g. Excel model files,  PowerPoint presentation files, Word descriptions, etc.)    This page contains links to the zip files submitted by  students in previous semesters, and may be useful in selecting a project idea or  seeing what past presentations have looked like.    The primary input for evaluating team  projects is input from the other students in the class, based on these criteria:       Did the team study an important and   realistic management problem?    Did the team do a good job of   identifying the key issues and choices faced in their project, and tying   these elements to the ideas learned in the course?    Was the team's project challenging, and   did it make good use of modeling skills and techniques from the   course?    Was the team well prepared, and did   they give an overall excellent presentation in terms of speaking style and   visual aids?    Is the team's model useful for   improving managerial decision making?

Each team is expected to (a) make a  short presentation to the class reporting on their project (15 minutes including  Q&amp;A), and (b) submit a zip  file containing all of their project-related materials (e.g. Excel model files,  PowerPoint presentation files, Word descriptions, etc.)    This page contains links to the zip files submitted by  students in previous semesters, and may be useful in selecting a project idea or  seeing what past presentations have looked like.    The primary input for evaluating team  projects is input from the other students in the class, based on these criteria:       Did the team study an important and   realistic management problem?    Did the team do a good job of   identifying the key issues and choices faced in their project, and tying   these elements to the ideas learned in the course?    Was the team's project challenging, and   did it make good use of modeling skills and techniques from the   course?    Was the team well prepared, and did   they give an overall excellent presentation in terms of speaking style and   visual aids?    Is the team's model useful for   improving managerial decision making?
