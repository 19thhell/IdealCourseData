Our faculty use humanities and social science perspectives and methods to examine critical questions about the role of technology and science in ethics, art, city building, and other domains.   We offer interdisciplinary BS degree programs in Integrated Digital Media (IDM) , Science and Technology Studies (STS) , and Sustainable Urban Environments (SUE) . In addition, we offer a Master of Science degree in Integrated Digital Media . These programs give students the knowledge to understand and engage with the technological and scientific society and culture in which they live and the skills that will lead to successful and rewarding careers. This program combines high-end production classes in media with research-grade investigation of new tools, techniques, and practices.     The Department of Technology, Culture and Society offers elective courses in the humanities and social sciences to meet the General Education requirement for undergraduate students. The cluster curriculum helps today&rsquo;s engineers and scientists make thoughtful decisions about the values that are implicit in technological options, to understand how human see themselves and the natural and social worlds, to think critically, and to communicate effectively.   For high school students, the department is sponsoring three competitions :     &ldquo;Climate Change&quot; ( Sustainable Urban Environments )   &ldquo;Healthcare&quot; (related to our program in Science and Technology Studies )   &quot;Integrated Digital Media&quot; ( Integrated Digital Media program )       Department Chair: Professor Jonathan Soffer   Follow us on:                                  Technology, Culture and Society      Majors + Programs   Pre-law and Pre-med   Project-Based Curriculum   General Education Clusters   Internship Course Materials   Frequently Asked Questions   People   News   Events                                    Engineering is NYU  Follow Us:  Facebook Twitter Vimeo YouTube        Undergraduate   Admissions   How to Apply   Apply Now   admissions@nyu.edu   Graduate   Admissions   Requirements   Apply Now   engineering.gradinfo@nyu.edu   Site Links   Press   Directory   Directions   Event Calendar   Careers/HR   Support    Email/Network help@poly.edu Website Report a Problem Login (Faculty + Staff)  NYU School of Engineering 6 MetroTech Center, Brooklyn, NY 11201 Tel: 718.260.3600 Fax: 718.260.3136 &copy; NYU School of Engineering"}]},

Our faculty use humanities and social science perspectives and methods to examine critical questions about the role of technology and science in ethics, art, city building, and other domains.   We offer interdisciplinary BS degree programs in Integrated Digital Media (IDM) , Science and Technology Studies (STS) , and Sustainable Urban Environments (SUE) . In addition, we offer a Master of Science degree in Integrated Digital Media . These programs give students the knowledge to understand and engage with the technological and scientific society and culture in which they live and the skills that will lead to successful and rewarding careers. This program combines high-end production classes in media with research-grade investigation of new tools, techniques, and practices.     The Department of Technology, Culture and Society offers elective courses in the humanities and social sciences to meet the General Education requirement for undergraduate students. The cluster curriculum helps today&rsquo;s engineers and scientists make thoughtful decisions about the values that are implicit in technological options, to understand how human see themselves and the natural and social worlds, to think critically, and to communicate effectively.   For high school students, the department is sponsoring three competitions :     &ldquo;Climate Change&quot; ( Sustainable Urban Environments )   &ldquo;Healthcare&quot; (related to our program in Science and Technology Studies )   &quot;Integrated Digital Media&quot; ( Integrated Digital Media program )       Department Chair: Professor Jonathan Soffer   Follow us on:                                  Technology, Culture and Society      Majors + Programs   Pre-law and Pre-med   Project-Based Curriculum   General Education Clusters   Internship Course Materials   Frequently Asked Questions   People   News   Events                                    Engineering is NYU  Follow Us:  Facebook Twitter Vimeo YouTube        Undergraduate   Admissions   How to Apply   Apply Now   admissions@nyu.edu   Graduate   Admissions   Requirements   Apply Now   engineering.gradinfo@nyu.edu   Site Links   Press   Directory   Directions   Event Calendar   Careers/HR   Support    Email/Network help@poly.edu Website Report a Problem Login (Faculty + Staff)  NYU School of Engineering 6 MetroTech Center, Brooklyn, NY 11201 Tel: 718.260.3600 Fax: 718.260.3136 &copy; NYU School of Engineering"}, {"content": "Majors and Programs | Technology, Culture and Society | NYU Polytechnic School of Engineering                                                                                                   NYU Abu Dhabi | NYU Shanghai         QuickLinks Bulletin   Directory   Employment and Career Development   Events Calendar   Human Resources / Careers   Information Technology Systems   Library   Make a Gift   NYU Classes   NYUAlbert (PS DATA)   NYUHome   Records and Registration   Services and Resources   Students   Alumni   Faculty   Staff                          Admissions  Undergraduate Admissions Graduate Admissions Online Learning Financial Aid Accepted Undergraduates Accepted Graduates  Academics  Majors and Programs Departments Honors Program BS/MS Program Study Abroad Online Learning Support + Services Graduate School  Records and Registration Class Schedule Course Textbooks School Calendar Code of Conduct Bulletin Women in Engineering  Research  Message from the Associate Provost Sponsored Research Centers + Institutes Labs + Groups CITE Game Innovation Lab Cross-Institution \u201cSeed\u201d Research Undergraduate Summer Research Bern Dibner Library Institutional Research Bioengineering IT + Media Urban Systems  Outreach  Incubators NYC Media Lab NYC Seed Enterprise Learning Center for K12 STEM Education Employment and Career Development PowerBridgeNY  Student Life  Athletics Student Affairs Public Safety Graduate Student Life and Services International Students + Scholars Residence Life and Housing Services Student Activities and Resource Center Students with Disabilities Student Resources Student Orientation  About  Directions Manhattan Directions Hours Leadership and Administration Mission News and Publications Campus Transformation Middle States Self-Study NYU Merger Past, Present, Future Giving                                          Home / Academics / Departments / Technology, Culture and Society                         Technology, Culture and Society                                                             Majors and Programs                                                          Bachelor of Science      Integrated Digital Media, BS   Learn More       Science and Technology Studies, BS   Learn More       Sustainable Urban Environments, BS   Learn More    Master of Science      Integrated Digital Media, MS   Learn More                                                                        Technology, Culture and Society      Majors + Programs   Pre-law and Pre-med   Project-Based Curriculum   General Education Clusters   Internship Course Materials   Frequently Asked Questions   People   News   Events                                    Engineering is NYU  Follow Us:  Facebook Twitter Vimeo YouTube        Undergraduate   Admissions   How to Apply   Apply Now   admissions@nyu.edu   Graduate   Admissions   Requirements   Apply Now   engineering.gradinfo@nyu.edu   Site Links   Press   Directory   Directions   Event Calendar   Careers/HR   Support    Email/Network help@poly.edu Website Report a Problem Login (Faculty + Staff)  NYU School of Engineering 6 MetroTech Center, Brooklyn, NY 11201 Tel: 718.260.3600 Fax: 718.260.3136 &copy; NYU School of Engineering"}]}]
