This program is  designed to foster entry into a neuroscience research-centered career.  Students apply for positions in a 10-week summer program during which they  actively participate in research projects in the laboratories of New York  University science faculty. We match students to laboratories primarily on  the basis of their background preparation and areas of interest. They work  either directly with faculty or with graduate students or postdoctoral  fellows. Each student conducts a research project under the direction  of his or her mentor. The students are involved in all phases of the  research process from experimental design to data analysis and communication  of results. At the end of the program, the students each give a presentation  of their own work at a summer research conference. The primary goal of this  program is to extend the Center's robust neuroscience research opportunities  to non-NYU students and to diversity the scientific workforce in the field  of Neuroscience. Financial support is available to non-NYU students through  the NSF REU-Site Grant. The First week of SURP will include a \"bootcamp\"  to accelerate the learning of lab skills specific to neural science.

Students work full time in the lab with their faculty mentors on their research topics while also participating in weekly seminars presented by distinguished School of Engineering faculty and staff. In addition, lunches where students can present research to non-specialists and think across disciplines are held. At the end of the program, abstracts of the research are published and presented to incoming students during Undergraduate Orientation. Abstracts from previous years&#39; programs are available below .   The Summer Research Program was initiated in 2007 by the Office of the Provost. Its success has been made possible by the financial support from the School&rsquo;s most loyal and generous donors as well as supplements from the research grants of the mentoring faculty.   Application Process   The Undergraduate Summer Research program is open to all the School of Engineering, NYU Abu Dhabi and NYU 3+2 undergraduate students who have completed at least 32 credits of coursework at the commencement of the program with a GPA of 3.2 or above. During the spring semester, the Office of Undergraduate Academics will publish the faculty research projects and any special requirements their student researcher must have (i.e. lab experience or specific coursework). Students then fill out the application , including a short statement of intent, and may apply for up to three different projects, if they so choose. The faculty then review applications and select the student researcher that best fits their researching needs. Selected students will work full time (35 hours per week) on a paid basis on one project. Please note that students are not allowed to take courses or hold another job that will interfere with this full-time committment unless their faculty mentor allows them to do so.   Information on the 2015 program will be available during the 2015 spring semester and will be sent out to all School of Engineering students&#39; NYU email addresses.
