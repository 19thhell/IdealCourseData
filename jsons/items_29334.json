NYU excels at turning federal research dollars into patentable inventions. In recent years, it has converted intellectual property into more licensing income than Stanford, Columbia, MIT, Harvard, and the University of California system. In two decades, over 100 startups have been built on NYU discoveries and innovations. The Fund will bolster that strength.                                                         Investment Approach & Philosophy                                                                                         Portfolio Companies                                                                                         Submit Venture Profile                                         The Fund will consider proposals from startups founded by current students, faculty and researchers at any NYU school, college or institute .   NYU initially capitalized the Fund\u2014much of which came from the proceeds of the sale of a company previously spun out of NYU\u2014and anticipates this growing to $20 million, with tax-deductible donor contributions. The Fund makes approximately five to six investments per year, from $100,000 - $150,000 each, in partnership with other angel investors and/or venture capital firms . The Fund will recycle investment returns from the successful sale of portfolio companies back into the University to finance further research and spinout ventures. In time, recycling these proceeds could provide a self-financing means to enable NYU to continue these activities into the future.        The time is right at NYU today: The recent affiliation with the Polytechnic Institute, NYU\u2019s school of engineering, brings a raft of capabilities that are important to product commercialization. And New York City\u2019s burgeoning venture capital culture now offers tech startups an environment conducive to growth. But startups need early-stage support\u2014financial as well as management and marketing talent, and connections to the entrepreneurial and venture community. The Fund is designed to fill that role.

NYU excels at turning federal research dollars into patentable inventions. In recent years, it has converted intellectual property into more licensing income than Stanford, Columbia, MIT, Harvard, and the University of California system. In two decades, over 100 startups have been built on NYU discoveries and innovations. The Fund will bolster that strength.                                                         Investment Approach & Philosophy                                                                                         Portfolio Companies                                                                                         Submit Venture Profile                                         The Fund will consider proposals from startups founded by current students, faculty and researchers at any NYU school, college or institute .   NYU initially capitalized the Fund\u2014much of which came from the proceeds of the sale of a company previously spun out of NYU\u2014and anticipates this growing to $20 million, with tax-deductible donor contributions. The Fund makes approximately five to six investments per year, from $100,000 - $150,000 each, in partnership with other angel investors and/or venture capital firms . The Fund will recycle investment returns from the successful sale of portfolio companies back into the University to finance further research and spinout ventures. In time, recycling these proceeds could provide a self-financing means to enable NYU to continue these activities into the future.        The time is right at NYU today: The recent affiliation with the Polytechnic Institute, NYU\u2019s school of engineering, brings a raft of capabilities that are important to product commercialization. And New York City\u2019s burgeoning venture capital culture now offers tech startups an environment conducive to growth. But startups need early-stage support\u2014financial as well as management and marketing talent, and connections to the entrepreneurial and venture community. The Fund is designed to fill that role.
