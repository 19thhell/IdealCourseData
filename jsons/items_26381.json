We are guided by a key NYU tradition: being \u201ca private university in the public service.\u201d   The NYU Office of Civic Engagement (OCE) coordinates three types of programs to serve the community, outside of the many clinical and outreach programs conducted by NYU's leading professional schools.                                   Support for Nonprofit Organizations     OCE awards grants to local organizations, with programs that encourage civic participation amongst the NYU community and channel valuable support to our non-profit neighbors.
