Doctoral work in statistics combines theory and methodology to deal with the large quantity of statistical data. Here at Stern we use the theoretical and methodological orientation of a traditional statistics with a focus on the applications that are central to the concerns of a business school. The PhD thesis work at Stern is a mathematically sophisticated enterprise that never loses sight of the real and practical problems of business. Stern&rsquo;s curriculum in statistics prepares students for academic positions by preparing them to conduct independent research. The statistician must be knowledgeable of the basic issues of the intellectual areas in which his or her work will be applied. The most popular areas of student interest in the last few years have been mathematical finance, statistical modeling, data mining, stochastic processes, and econometrics. Students have rigorous course work and participate in special topics seminars. They work closely with the faculty and also present special PhD student seminars. Clifford Hurvich Coordinator, Statistics Doctoral Program  Mission Our mission is the education of scholars who will produce first-rate statistics research and who will succeed as faculty members at first-rate universities. Admissions and performance We enroll one or two students each year; these are chosen from approximately 100 highly qualified applicants. Advising and evaluation Each student will meet with a committee of faculty members yearly to assess progress through the program. Research and interaction with faculty  The Stern statistics faculty have a wide range of interests, but there is special emphasis on time series, statistical modeling, stochastic processes, and financial modeling. PhD students in statistics take courses in statistical inference, stochastic processes, time series, regression analysis, and multivariate analysis. In addition to course work, doctoral students also participate in research projects in conjunction with faculty members. The students attend seminars, present seminars on their own work, and submit their work for publication. The program culminates with the creation of the PhD thesis, through the stages of proposal, writing, and defense. Most students finish in four to five years.   Statistics Program of Study Statistics PhD students take their course work in the first two years of study. These courses are taken within the Statistics Group (both as formal courses and also as independent study), within other departments at the Stern School, at NYU's Courant Institute, and at Columbia University.  Program Requirements In addition to their statistics courses, doctoral students in Statistics often take courses in mathematics, finance, market research, and econometrics. The individual curriculum will be planned with the help of faculty advisers.

The program allows you to learn highly marketable skills in the current data science revolution and to use those skills to address important social issues.    Who is this program for?    This MS program is a good choice if you like to work with numbers and solve problems and want to learn valuable data-analysis and analytical skills. Advanced statistical methods can be used to answer pivotal research questions across many science and social science disciplines as well as to inform policy and do work that is socially important and significant. The program is designed to help you develop the ability to perform and understand complex quantitative research in the social, behavioral, and health sciences. Students admitted to our program have a variety of interests that fit well with our program, including education policy, child development, poverty, labor markets, evaluation, social policy, psychology, and public health.    What will I learn?    The A3SR curriculum provides you with a firm foundation in statistical modeling tools commonly used in the social, behavioral, and health science research. You will become proficient in use of methods such as:       linear models    multilevel modeling    multivariate analysis    measurement models    generalized linear models    causal inference    approaches to missing data       If you are entering the program with more advanced mathematical or statistical training, you will have the option of pursuing more advanced coursework which will provide opportunities to develop and evaluate the properties of statistical models.    Coursework and data analysis projects help you gain confidence in your skills to undertake data-analytic projects and research grounded in proven methodology and make strong data-based decisions and assessments. You will have opportunities to apply your skills to address critical policy issues and social problems through an internship and the consulting research seminar. The curriculum will prepare you for jobs in fields such as :       Psychology    Education    Political Science    Applied Economics    Public policy    Health and healthcare    Media research       By the time you graduate you will know how to :       Manipulate simple and complex data structures    Determine appropriate analyses needed to answer critical questions    Apply a wide range of statistical methods and understand the results at a sophisticated level    Evaluate the appropriateness and efficacy of statistical procedures    Communicate the role of and results from statistical analyses to colleagues or employers    Alter or extend existing techniques or develop new methods to address complicated data analysis problems for which routine statistical procedures are insufficient (exclusively open to students who enter with additional training)       What can I do with this degree?    The curriculum prepares you for a career as an applied statistician and data scientist in the private or public sector, as well as for further academic study in a variety of academic disciplines that require quantitative analysis.    Who will I study with?    This is an exciting time to study applied statistics and data science at NYU. The MS program is an initiative of the NYU Steinhardt Center for the Promotion of Research Involving Innovative Statistical Methodology (PRIISM) and is an integrated part of the larger university-wide initiative in Data Science and Statistics , which offers several new master&rsquo;s degrees, including this MS program.    A3SR faculty have particular strengths in:       causal inference    high-dimensional data    measurement    missing data    model selection    multivariate analysis    multilevel modeling    surveys and sampling       All the faculty are deeply committed to using data analysis methods and strategies for the social good. They have worked and consulted for a range of advocacy and policy organizations. They are applying these strategies to important questions in public health, politics, psychology and psychometrics, demography, sociology, labor markets, and education . This program seeks like-minded students who are eager to apply these tools to do good in the world.    Some of the important application-area questions they are exploring include:       What is the role of media in forming public opinions?    What is the effect of gifted and talented programs on student achievement?    What is the relationship between diet and certain forms of cancer?    Do student curricular pathways matter for degree attainment and subsequent labor market outcomes?    What are effective strategies for rehabilitation of stroke patients?       On the methodological front our faculty are working in diverse areas across statistics . Examples include research to:       Assess when observational studies can act as reasonable substitutes for randomized experiments    Develop better strategies to handle missing data    Develop variable selection methods for high dimensional data    Model the dependencies in categorical sequences of events       We encourage you and all our students to work closely with our faculty on research that ranges from applied statistical analysis to the development of customized statistical models.    What other options do I have to study statistics at NYU?    There are many graduate programs in the Steinhardt School and at NYU that you may wish to further explore. We encourage you to explore these options further to find the program that best matches your personal interests and career goals.

Doctoral work in statistics combines theory and methodology to deal with the large quantity of statistical data. Here at Stern we use the theoretical and methodological orientation of a traditional statistics with a focus on the applications that are central to the concerns of a business school. The PhD thesis work at Stern is a mathematically sophisticated enterprise that never loses sight of the real and practical problems of business. Stern&rsquo;s curriculum in statistics prepares students for academic positions by preparing them to conduct independent research. The statistician must be knowledgeable of the basic issues of the intellectual areas in which his or her work will be applied. The most popular areas of student interest in the last few years have been mathematical finance, statistical modeling, data mining, stochastic processes, and econometrics. Students have rigorous course work and participate in special topics seminars. They work closely with the faculty and also present special PhD student seminars. Clifford Hurvich Coordinator, Statistics Doctoral Program  Mission Our mission is the education of scholars who will produce first-rate statistics research and who will succeed as faculty members at first-rate universities. Admissions and performance We enroll one or two students each year; these are chosen from approximately 100 highly qualified applicants. Advising and evaluation Each student will meet with a committee of faculty members yearly to assess progress through the program. Research and interaction with faculty  The Stern statistics faculty have a wide range of interests, but there is special emphasis on time series, statistical modeling, stochastic processes, and financial modeling. PhD students in statistics take courses in statistical inference, stochastic processes, time series, regression analysis, and multivariate analysis. In addition to course work, doctoral students also participate in research projects in conjunction with faculty members. The students attend seminars, present seminars on their own work, and submit their work for publication. The program culminates with the creation of the PhD thesis, through the stages of proposal, writing, and defense. Most students finish in four to five years.   Statistics Program of Study Statistics PhD students take their course work in the first two years of study. These courses are taken within the Statistics Group (both as formal courses and also as independent study), within other departments at the Stern School, at NYU's Courant Institute, and at Columbia University.  Program Requirements In addition to their statistics courses, doctoral students in Statistics often take courses in mathematics, finance, market research, and econometrics. The individual curriculum will be planned with the help of faculty advisers.

The Program      The departments of mathematics and computer science at NYU's     Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences offer a master's     degree in scientific computing. The program provides broad yet     rigorous training in areas of mathematics and computer science     related to scientific computing. It aims to prepare people     with the right talents and background for a technical career     doing practical computing.      The program accommodates both full-time and part-time     students, with most courses meeting in the evening. The     program is self-contained and terminal, providing a complete     set of skills in a field where the need is greater than the     supply. The masters program focuses on computational science,     which includes modeling and numerical simulation as used in     engineering design, development, and optimization.           During the academic years of 2012 and 2013 a concentration in     data sciences existed within the scientific computing program;     this concentration has been discontinued as of 2014. Incoming     students interested in data sciences should consider the     recently-created Masters              of Science in Data Science within the NYU Center for Data     Science .           Starting Fall of 2014 the modified the program requirements     and guidelines listed below will apply to all incoming     students. The new list of required/approved courses includes     the previous list but gives additional flexibility for     students to tailor the list of courses to their background and     interests. Students presently enrolled in the Modeling and     Simulation track can choose to complete the program either     under the new or the old requirements. Students enrolled in     the Data Science concentration should consult the expanded     course options and modified requirements below since this     increases flexibility while maintaining consistency with the     previous requirements. These students should contact Professor     Esteban Tabak for help     in deciding on classes to take.                Scientific Computing:     Overview           Scientific computing is an indispensable part of almost all     scientific investigation and technological development at     universities, government laboratories, and within the private     sector. Typically a scientific computing team consists of     several people trained in some branch of mathematics, science,     statistics, or engineering. What is often lacking is expertise     in modern computing tools such as visualization, modern     programming paradigms, and high performance computing. The     master's program in scientific computing aims to satisfy these     needs, without omitting basic training in numerical analysis     and computer science. Many graduates of this program work at     technologically advanced institutions, especially in research     and development, where their skills and experience complement     those without interdisciplinary degrees. The program is also     open to students who will go on to pursue doctoral studies in     computer science, mathematics, or statistics.      The master's program in scientific computing focuses on the     mathematics and computer science related to advanced computer     modeling and simulation. The program is similar in structure     to terminal master's programs in engineering, combining     classroom training with practical experience. The coursework     ranges from foundational mathematics and fundamental     algorithms to such practical topics as data visualization and     software tools. Electives encourage the exploration of     specific application areas such as mathematical and     statistical finance, applications of machine learning, fluid     mechanics, finite element methods, and biomedical modeling.     The program culminates in a master's project, which serves to     integrate the classroom material.           Admission Requirements      The program requires least three semesters of Calculus     (including multivariate calculus), as well as linear algebra.     Experience with programming in a high-level language (e.g.,     Java, C, C++, Fortran. Python) as well as data structures,     equivalent to a first-year sequence in computer science,      is also required. It is highly desirable that applicants have     undergraduate major or significant experience in mathematics,     a quantitative science or engineering, or economics.      The deadline for application to the program is April 1st for     the fall semester. The program admits students both on a     full-time and on a part-time basis. The application process     takes place online via the Graduate School of Arts and     Sciences; please visit the Graduate     School Admissions site .

To graduate, students enrolled in the old concentration    are required to take the following core courses     in mathematics for the concentration in data science:                One of           MATH-GA              2962 Mathematical Statistics (spring semester),      DS-GA-1001 Introduction to Data Science (fall), or           DS-GA-1002 Statistical and Mathematical Methods                and either            MATH-GA              2043 Scientific Computing (fall and spring     semesters)                or both            MATH-GA              2010 Numerical Methods I (fall semester) and            MATH-GA              2020 Numerical Methods II (spring semester)           The following are the three required core courses      in computer science for the concentration in data science:            CSCI-GA              1170 Fundamental Algorithms (fall, spring and     summer terms)       CSCI-GA              3033 Open Source Tools (fall term)          and one of           CSCI-GA              2565 Machine Learning (fall term), or      DS-GA-1003 Machine Learning and Computational Statistics     (spring)          Students in the concentration in data science must complete 33    points points of course credit (11 courses), including core and    elective courses. They must also obtain 3 points from a master's    capstone project.          The Capstone Project      The master's program culminates in a capstone project. The     capstone project course is usually taken during the final year     of study. During the project, students go through the entire     process of solving a real-world problem, from collecting and     processing data to designing and fully implementing a     solution. The problems and data sets come from settings     identical to those encountered in industry, academia, or     government.           The following is a list of courses approved to meet the     capstone requirement:             MATH-GA.2011/ CSCI-GA.2945      Advanced topics: Data Science      CSCI-GA Advanced Topics: High-Performance Computing      DS-GA-1006 Capstone Project in Data Science      CSCI-GA Advanced Computer Graphics      CSCI-GA Multicore Processors: Architecture     &amp;Programming      CSCI-GA Software Engineering           Advanced students can obtain permission from the director of     the program to do an individual capstone project under the     supervision of a faculty member.                Computing Facilities      The Courant Institute makes available for graduate training     and coursework a network of workstations maintained by systems     administrators. All graduate students have computer accounts     for the duration of their studies. NYU also runs a     high-performance computing center with both shared-memory and     distributed-memory computers.

Academic Standards      To register for courses, students must maintain good academic     standing, fulfilling the following requirements:           Students must maintain an average of B or better over     their first twelve credits. Students who fail to achieve     this cannot continue in the master's program.      Students cannot obtain a master's degree unless they have     maintained an overall average of B or better. Students at     risk of failing to meet this requirement receive a warning     letter from the department.      Students cannot obtain more than four no-credit grades,     withdrawals, or unresolved incomplete grades during their     academic tenure, and no more than two such grades in the     first six courses for which they have registered.          Up to two core courses taken elsewhere can earn transfer credit,    subject to the normal NYU graduate school restrictions on    transfer of credit and the approval of the program director. At    least 30 credits must be taken at NYU.
