Together with biologists and doctors, they&rsquo;re developing artificial organs, prosthetics, and other medical devices, helping us live longer, healthier lives.   Our MS program in Biomedical Engineering proudly merges the best from our chemistry, engineering, and computer science divisions, with the biomedical science offerings from SUNY Downstate Medical Center. The partnership allows our students to take advantage of both facilities, faculties, and associated research programs, which share coextensive initiatives. Noteworthy areas of overlapping scientific investigation include neurorobotics, tissue engineering, and telemetry, among others.   It&rsquo;s an exciting alliance, and we ensure access for both full- and part-time students by scheduling many 3-credit courses as 2 &frac12;-hour nightly lectures held once per week. Evening research opportunities are also available.   The Biomedical Engineering MS program offers 3 tracks: Biomaterials Track, Medical Imaging Track, Bioinstrumentation Track.   Goals and Objectives   The goal of the MS in Biomedical Engineering program is to give you an in-depth, advanced education that provides you with the analytical tools to perform fundamental and applied research in biomedical engineering. Alternatively, you will gain the requisite technical knowledge to apply to management, marketing, sales and other entrepreneurial activities related to biomedical engineering. Specific objectives of the program include the following:      The program accommodates students with a BS or a more advanced degree in chemical engineering, mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, computer science, computer engineering, physics, chemistry, biology, premedical, bioengineering and biotechnology.    Students acquire the skills to engage in technological innovations that give people longer, healthier, and more productive lives.    Students choose courses in topics that include biomedical instrumentation, biomaterials, drug delivery, orthopedic biomechanics and devices, protein engineering, anatomy and physiology, biochemistry, immunology, bioinformatics, systems analysis and mathematics, medical imaging and material science.    Giving students the option of doing research in laboratories at the School of Engineering, NYU Medical and Dental Schools, NYU-affiliated hospitals or SUNY Downstate Medical Center. Students may also substitute research credits with course electives.     Admission Requirements   Applicants to the master&rsquo;s program should have BS or a more advanced degree in any engineering discipline, mathematics; or any of the natural sciences.   You should also have:      a minimum of 2 semesters of college-level calculus (see 4.00 Credits Calculus I MA-UY 1024 This course covers library of Functions: functions of one variable. Limits, derivatives of functions defined by graphs, tables and formulas, differentiation rules for power, polynomial, exponential and logarithmic functions, derivatives of trigonometric functions, the product and quotient rule, the chain rule, applications of the chain rule, maxima and minima, optimization. MA 1324 is for students who wish to take MA 1024 but need more review of precalculus. MA1324 covers the same material as MA1024 but with more contact hours a week, incorporating a full discussion of the required precalculus topics.

Numerical solution of initial value problems for ordinary differential equations. Prerequisite or Corequisite: MA-UY 2012. , 2.00 Credits Multivariable Calculus A MA-UY 2112 This course introduces Multivariable Calculus. Analysis of functions of several variables, vector valued functions, partial derivatives and multiple integrals. Prerequisite: MA-UY 2012. , and 2.00 Credits Multivariable Calculus B MA-UY 2122 This course continues Multivariable Calculus. Optimization techniques, parametric equations, line integrals, surface integrals and major theorems concerning their applications. Prerequisite: MA-UY 2112. ) are recommended. Students lacking undergraduate courses described above may be admitted contingent upon the student&rsquo;s satisfying the courses necessary for success in the program.   To help students raise their level of knowledge in chemical and biochemical concepts specific to advanced courses in the Medical Imaging or Bioinstrumentation tracks, the program developed 3.00 Credits Principles of Chemical and Biochemical Systems BE-GY 6653 This is an introductory course that is restricted for graduate students who have not had any undergraduate chemistry courses. It focuses on fundamental knowledge of chemical and biochemical reactions. Students learn structure and function of biological molecules such as proteins, carbohydrates and DNA. They master basic concepts of structure-property relationships of macromolecules. Chemistries critical to biosensor technologies such as linking biological molecules to various supports, is described. Students appreciate and understand the wide range of chemical and biological molecules critical to living systems. Prerequisite: Instructor\u2019s permission. . A program adviser reviews with successful applicants what undergraduate courses, if any, they must take. Such courses do not count toward the master&rsquo;s degree.                                            Academic Director        Gene R.
