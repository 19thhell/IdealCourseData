Designed for students with little or no prior musical training, the course will use the theme of song and dance to introduce the subject. We will cover numerous ways of making music, including amateur and professional, solitary and communal, religious and secular, commercial and non-commercial (\"art\"), live and recorded, improvised and notated. The course will explore primarily Western European and African-American traditions and music - classical, popular, and experimental - that join the two, but also some other traditions from around the world. Students will participate through reading, writing, singing, dancing, and even improvising. They will gain direct, hands-on experience with music grasp and internalize sophisticated concepts of musical style and form, and come to understand how different types of music evolved. Students will be evaluated based on class participation, presentations, and short writing assignments. The Art of Listening: Musical Tastes - Why Do We Like What We Like? - MUSIC-UA 3 (section 002) Tuesday &amp; Thursday 2:00 - 3:15 (Silver 320) Instructor: Michael Beckerman Anna the English major thinks Hip-Hop is the greatest music of its time while Rodney, studying physics, loathes it and prefers Electroclash. Jie, a professor of Anthropology adores Mahler's First Symphony while her colleague Cyrus thinks it is a little shallow and would rather hear that composer's Second Symphony. Peter, feeling a but down in his dorm, listens to Vampire Weekend while Isha, feeling the same way listens to Ella Fitzgerald and would rather get all her teeth drilled than hear \"Vampire.\" All over the world, all the time, all of us are making choices about what to listen to. But how do we do this, what makes us like one thing and not another? This course explores the history, science, philosophy and broad nature of musical taste across genres, styles, geographical areas and time periods. No prerequisite is required and no musical skills required.             Elements of Music - MUSIC-UA 20 Monday &amp; Wednesday 9:30 - 10:45 (Silver 320) Additional recitation section required Instructor: TBA Explores the underlying principles and inner workings of the tonal system, a system that has guided all of Western music from the years 1600 to 1900. It includes a discussion of historical background and evolution. The focus is on concepts and notation of key, scale, tonality, and rhythm. Related skills in sight-singing, dictation, and keyboard harmony are stressed in the recitation sections. Topics in 20th Century Music: Studies in Contemporary Opera - MUSIC-UA 111 (same as AHSEM-UA 224) Tuesday &amp; Thursday 3:30-4:45 (Room TBA) Instructor: Louis Karchin This course will delve into developments in opera over the timespan of the 20th and early 20th centuries. Works throughout this period will be explored in the context of their social and political milieu, and selected excerpts of operas will be analyzed in detail. Works from the earlier 20th century will include operas by Stravinsky (the Rake's Progress), Britten, and Berg. Later composers to be discussed will include Saariaho, Ligeti, and Lachenmann, among others. Prerequisite: ability to read music. Wagner - MUSIC-UA 136 Tuesday &amp; Thursday 2:00-3:15 (Silver 218) Instructor: Rena Mueller Richard Wagner's music, words, themes, images, gestures, and intent, were the stuff of nation-building and wrought havoc with the status-quo. The question remains, did his unorthodox private life reflect the works he created, the result of the fevered imaginations of his creative imaginations of his creative activities? While his musical influence is unmistakeable, the ramifications of his political, social, and private activities spread across the face of Europe from 1848 through, arguably, to 1914 -- and even to the present day, with the Wagner descendants front and center at the Bayreuth Festival. This course will examine the tumultuous musical, political, and social milieus surrounding Wagner -- musician, poet, lover, impresario, political activist, and lightening rod for the unification of Germany. Wagner himself wrapped up in the importance of German history, especially at this pivotal time in the 19th century. He paid dearly for his political activities during the 1849 Dresden uprising, with exile and isolation, and his uncompromising belief in the supremacy of everything German supported Bismarck as the newly-unified nation sought to establish itself as the equal, if not the better, of long-standing imperial regimes (Austria-Hungary, France, Great Britain, Spain). He was afforded by King Ludwig of Bavaria untold influence over major decisions in Munich concerning the appointment and function of ministers and other officials, until his actions stepped over the line. Anthropology of Music: History of Rock and Roll - MUSIC-UA 153 . 001 Monday &amp; Wednesday 12:30-1:45 (Silver 320) Instructor: Maureen Mahon This course provides an introduction to the history of the unruly music known as rock and roll. We will focus on the first four decades of the form, emphasizing key artists, styles, and events. We will discuss different rock and roll subgenres and the ways rock and roll incorporated stylistic features from other musical genres (e.g., rhythm and blues, blues, country, folk, gospel, and reggae). Throughout we will attend to the aesthetic, social, political, and economic factors that have shaped the production, dissemination, and reception of the music. We will explore the relationship between rock and roll music and the expression of identity for performers and fans (particularly generational identity, but also identities related to race, class, gender, and sexuality). We will pay special attention to the cross-racial collaborations that have produced the form and to the ways the political economy of the recording industry and changes in technology have influenced the genre. Area of study: Music, Histories, Cultures Anthropology of Music: The Search for Authenticity - MUSIC-UA 153 . 002 (same as AHSEM-UA 225) Tuesday &amp; Thursday 11:00-12:15 (Silver 218) Instructor: David Samuels How should human beings sound? This is a question that has linked ideas about music to ideas about ethics for 100 years or more. The social and ethical dilemmas of two world wars and the global spread of industrial modernity created a challenge: how can we maintain our true humanity in the face of these traumas and disruptions? In this course, we will explore three areas of musical life: folk music revivals, ethnomusicology, and historical performance movements. By attending to links between them, we will attempt to address questions about the role of \"authenticity\" in musical and ethical discourse, how concerns about authenticity have colored critical responses to various musical styles and performers, and whether, in the end, authenticity is really what people have been worried about at all. Seminar: Aural Perception - MUSIC-UA 193 Monday &amp; Wednesday 2:00-3:15 (Silver 320) Instructor: J. Martin Daughtry A broad interdisciplinary exploration of listening in musical and non-musical contexts, the course is designed to help students (a) deepen their understanding of the dynamics of listening, (b) gain an appreciation for modes of listening that have emerged around different musical styles, and (c) become more virtuosic and attentive listeners themselves. Students will learn how medical professionals, philosophers, composers, and laypeople conceptualize the act of listening. Live musicians will be invited into the classroom to make music and talk about what they heard in their own performances. During a weekly recitation, students will engage in regular listening experiments, and design experiments of their own. No prior knowledge of music is needed. This course is required for music majors, and recommended for other adventurous students with an interest in music and/or sound. Proseminar in Musical Research - MUSIC-UA 200 Monday &amp; Wednesday 2:00-3:15 (Silver 218) Instructor: Stanley Boorman This course is required of all Honors students in the department. It is a seminar discussing recent ideas and issues in all areas of musical research, musicology, ethnomusicology, and theory. Faculty members in the department will introduce different topics, discussing the ideas and their application, so that by the end of the semester students will be capable of undertaking the advanced research project required for an Honors degree.  Harmony &amp; Counterpoint I - MUSIC-UA 201 Monday &amp; Wednesday 11:00 - 12:15 (Silver 320) Additional recitation section required Instructors: TBA Please refer to Albert for lab sections General principles underlying tonal musical organization. Students learn concepts of 18th- and 19th- century harmonic, formal, and contrapuntal practices. Weekly lab sections are devoted to skills in musicianship and are required throughout the sequence. Music major introductory requirement Harmony &amp; Counterpoint II - MUSIC-UA 202 Monday &amp; Wednesday 9:30 - 10:45 (Silver 320) Additional recitation section required Instructors: TBA Please refer to Albert for lab sections General   principles underlying tonal musical organization. Students learn   concepts of 18th- and 19th- century harmonic, formal, and contrapuntal   practices. Weekly lab sections are devoted to skills in musicianship and   are required throughout the sequence. Principles of Musical Analysis: Data Sonification - history, practice, and artistic applications - MUSIC-UA 209 Wednesday 3:30-6:00 (Room TBA) Instructor: Elizabeth Hoffman This course will explore the history, into the present, of electroacoustic works which have utilized data sets from other fields, whether known or unknown artistic results. We will consider briefly how sonification is used by other fields of research, currently, to enable pattern identification that is hard to discern by eye. Finally, we will learn techniques of sonifying data directly for aesthetic motivations. This class will thus be a combination of research and creative application. There are no prerequisites for this class. Special Topics Seminar: The Study of 18th-19th Century Musical Scores - MUSIC-UA 901 (001) Tuesday &amp; Thursday 9:30-10:45 (Silver 218) Instructor: Rena Mueller This   course is concerned with specialized topics in musical scores and repertoires. It is designed to develop skills in independent research into manuscripts and editions, and the problems faced in interpreting the music they contain. The course will involve techniques for studying primary sources, and methods of examining and editing compositions by major composers of the period, from Mozart to the late 19th century. Special Topics Seminar: Music in Comic Modernity - MUSIC-UA 901 (section 003) Tuesday &amp; Thursday 11:00-12:15 (Silver 318) Instructor: Visiting Professor James Currie Starting with comic opera in the middle of the eighteenth century, and ending in the 1980s, this course will chronologically survey a series of pieces from the Western repertoire that are comic in orientation. Characterized by mistaken identities, farcical reversals of fortune, and strange transformations of the human into the animal and the world of machines, comedy will be shown to have been a powerful means of allowing music to register the complexities of the ongoing transformations of modernity. As well as music from the Western repertoire (including Haydn, Mozart, Offenbach, Verdi, Puccini, Poulenc, and Ligeti), the course will also draw on examples from film and cartoon animation (including Charlie Chaplin, the Marx Brothers, and Bugs Bunny), and non musical writings (including Marx, Freud, and Bergson).

(Reissued by Publication  Contact International, Cambridge, Mass., 1984)    LaRue, Jan. Guidelines for Style Analysis. (2nd ed.) Harmonie Park Press, Michigan,   1992.           Introduction   The focus of this course is on mastering an approach to analysis of musical style as presented by Jan LaRue as well learning the approach of musical analysis as presented in Sonic Design by Cogan and Escot. The LaRue analysis will be a tool that will provide observations of 19th Century musical style. LaRue provides a systematic approach to SHMRG (Sound, Harmony, Melody, Rhythm, Growth) and a means of examining this musical factors in context of time, genre, and other components through a category identified as Evaluation. Cogan and Escot&#39;s Sonic Design provides a departure from conventional analytic categories: Musical Space, Musical Language, Time and Rhythm: Dimensions and Activity, and The Color of Sound. This approach will be used to examine 20th Century musical practices and will be applied in analyzing specific works.  Therefore the emphasis of the course is on developing analytical skills rather than covering a wide range of repertoire of 19th and 20th Century works. Students should have a mastery of undergraduate theory, since this course builds upon, as well as departs from, this knowledge base.   Another feature of the course is student publication of two analysis projects: one for 19th Century music and one for 20 Century music. Manuscripts will be typed and complete with musical examples, bibliography, and references, as needed.     Topics     Introduction to Music Analysis   General Overview of Music Analysis. Assignment of Texts. Assignment of Readings. Overview of Course: First half of course deals with stylistic tendencies of 19th Century Music, Using LaRue&#39;s Guidelines for Style Analysis as the &quot;method&quot;. Second half of the course deals with stylistic tendencies of 20th Century Music using Cogan and Escot&#39;s Sonic Design as the basis for analysis. Focus of the Course is on Analytic Technique using selected scores as source materials. Students will select a 19th Century piece for analysis and a 20th Century Piece for analysis, in addition to completing class assignments in music analysis. General purposes of analysis of music.
