                                                The Silver School\u2019s MSW curriculum consists of a professional foundation level and an advanced concentration level. Both foundation and advanced concentration levels are organized according to five traditional areas: social work practice, human behavior in the social environment (HBSE), social welfare programs and policies (SWPP), social work research (SWR), and field instruction . In addition, each sequence area addresses social work values and ethics, diversity, social and economic justice, and populations at risk.   Grounded in a generalist perspective, the foundation level curriculum emphasizes the importance of working across a range of systems that includes individuals, couples, families, groups, agencies, and communities. The generalist perspective maintains a focus on the interaction between systems (person-in-environment perspective) and utilizes specific theories such as systems theory, empowerment theory, and a strengths perspective.   The advanced concentration curriculum strives to deepen knowledge and skills and add breadth, depth, and specificity to content learned in the foundation level. Students are expected to deepen and extend their assessment, intervention, and evaluation skills with diverse and at-risk populations, demonstrating an understanding of the major theories that inform practice with individuals, families, and larger systems. The links between practice and research and practice and policy are integrated throughout the curriculum as is the attention to social and economic justice and the importance of practicing competently with diverse and at-risk populations.

About LAUNCH      Highlights              LAUNCH is a two-week program that begins with an intellectual summit to explore the intersection of the World, Business and City. The intention: to inspire our students beginning on their first day at Stern to think of the major challenges facing the world, such as climate change, fiscal crises, energy and urbanization, and to expand their view of possibilities--what business can do, and what they can achieve--to create value.           Hear from student Jennie Morel: Lessons from Launch           A few activities from LAUNCH include:           NYC Harbor cruise &amp; dinner on Ellis Island       Global financial markets panel featuring Stern Professors Nouriel Roubini and William Silber       Innovative speaker series titled \"9\" (nine ideas, nine speakers, nine minutes each) conceived by Professor Scott Galloway       Reception at the Rubin Museum of Art                                 NYU Stern&#039;s MBA program is 60 credits; more than half are electives. To ensure that you have a solid foundation in all areas of business, the majority of your first year is comprised of Stern core courses.                Block Experience      Core Classes              Each class is divided into 6 blocks of 60-70.          Students run for block leadership positions in September. Blocks organize and participate in numerous events throughout their two years at Stern including:           Monday Block Lunches : On Mondays, block leaders facilitate discussions and hold meetings with special guests including the Dean and company CEOs.       The MBA Challenge : Designed to promote volunteerism, blocks earn points through service events and through donations to the annual Food Fight. The block earning the most points wins money towards their block social funds.       Block Olympics : Competing in events including basketball, speed relay, Taboo and volleyball, one block takes home the title of Block Olympic Champion each year.          Within your block, core course study groups of 5-6 students with diverse backgrounds are assigned. You may choose your own study groups for elective classes.      Required Core            Financial Accounting &amp; Reporting       Statistics &amp; Data Analysis           Menu Core - Choose at least 5             Firms &amp; Markets       Foundations of Finance       The Global Economy       Leadership in Organizations       Marketing       Operations Management       Strategy          All students are required to complete Professional Responsibility. The Professional Responsibility curriculum will be split into 6 sessions spanning the spring and fall of students' first and second years.          Students may be able to establish proficiency in a core course through prior degrees, a proficiency exam or a CPA.          The menu core allows you the flexibility to take elective courses as early as your first year.                       Hear a Stern student describe Stern's entire two-year curriculum                            During the summer between your first and second year, you will participate in a summer internship. The internship provides industry experience and vital networking connections that help you take your career to the next level.                  Ignite Program      Career Podcasts              On Fridays during your first year, Stern offers a comprehensive career development program called Ignite that empowers you with the tools to excel in your career search. The program includes mandatory workshops in:           Refining career goals       Creating a targeted resume       Networking effectively       Preparing for corporate presentations and interviews       Developing job search strategies                Hear from Pam Mittman, Assistant Dean of Career Services on:                Career Development at Stern           Recruiting for Specialized Paths           Traditional Recruiting Process                       Your second year is comprised almost entirely of elective courses.

                                                The Silver School\u2019s MSW curriculum consists of a professional foundation level and an advanced concentration level. Both foundation and advanced concentration levels are organized according to five traditional areas: social work practice, human behavior in the social environment (HBSE), social welfare programs and policies (SWPP), social work research (SWR), and field instruction . In addition, each sequence area addresses social work values and ethics, diversity, social and economic justice, and populations at risk.   Grounded in a generalist perspective, the foundation level curriculum emphasizes the importance of working across a range of systems that includes individuals, couples, families, groups, agencies, and communities. The generalist perspective maintains a focus on the interaction between systems (person-in-environment perspective) and utilizes specific theories such as systems theory, empowerment theory, and a strengths perspective.   The advanced concentration curriculum strives to deepen knowledge and skills and add breadth, depth, and specificity to content learned in the foundation level. Students are expected to deepen and extend their assessment, intervention, and evaluation skills with diverse and at-risk populations, demonstrating an understanding of the major theories that inform practice with individuals, families, and larger systems. The links between practice and research and practice and policy are integrated throughout the curriculum as is the attention to social and economic justice and the importance of practicing competently with diverse and at-risk populations.
