All courses in the program take an interdisciplinary and global approach to the study of primary works from around the world. Students may begin their studies in New York, or at NYU in Florence, London, or Paris. All classes emphasize discussion in small groups. Writing classes are capped at fifteen students, all other classes are capped at twenty-five. At each site, the cultural resources and contemporary life of the city are an important part of coursework. Students extend their education outside the classroom by exploring different ethnographic spaces, attending musical and theatrical presentations, visiting museums, and sites of historical and contemporary social interest. Curriculum Overview and Requirements The Core Program offers a comprehensive liberal arts background that serves as a strong foundation for further study. At the end of two years* students in the Core Program who successfully complete program requirements will enroll as juniors in one of NYU\u2019s liberal arts bachelor\u2019s degree programs: the College of Arts and Science (CAS); the Gallatin School of Individualized Study; Global Liberal Studies; or degree programs in the Preston Robert Tisch Center for Hospitality, Tourism and Sports Management; the Silver School of Social Work; and the College of Nursing, as well as select majors in the Tisch School of the Arts and the Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development. In order to transition, students must meet specific program requirements and be in good academic standing at the end of their sophomore year at NYU. Good academic standing is defined as a 2.0 semester and cumulative grade point average and making good academic progress. *The Core Program is a four-semester program. Freshman Curriculum Requirements All freshmen are required to complete a two-semester freshman writing sequence focusing on expository writing, the presentation of argument, and the elements of research. The freshman core courses Cultural Foundations I and II and Social Foundations I and II are based on the study of great works from antiquity to the beginning of the modern era. In the Cultural Foundations sequence, students study literature, the visual and performing arts, and music. In the Social Foundations sequence, students focus on philosophy, religion, political and social theory, and history. Taken together, the two sequences can be seen as a global cultural history. The sequences also provide an introduction to skills in critical analysis and synthetic thinking that students need for successful study in all academic disciplines. Depending on the requirements of their intended baccalaureate program, students may also take a course in the natural sciences and mathematics. Sophomore Curriculum Requirements During the sophomore year, students are required to complete Cultural Foundations III and Social Foundations III that bring the sequences begun in the first year up to the present day. In the sophomore year, students also complete a second science (if required by the school to which they will transition), explore possible majors, and begin the coursework toward those majors in the appropriate academic departments. Core Program students are expected to schedule meetings with their advisor during which they receive advice about choosing additional courses from NYU\u2019s extensive offerings. By the end of the sophomore year, a student should be able to declare a major. Other Requirements Residency Requirement The Core Program is a four-semester program. Students planning to transition to one of the baccalaureate programs at NYU normally must complete four semesters of full-time enrollment in the Core Program. Full-time enrollment is defined as the completion of a minimum of 12 credit hours in each of the four semesters. Summer session enrollment will not be counted toward the residency requirement. Note: Other NYU schools and colleges have specific residency requirements. Students should consult the Web sites and bulletins of those schools and colleges for up-to-date information about these requirements. Writing Proficiency Requirement Writing proficiency is required for the NYU bachelor\u2019s degree. The writing proficiency requirement is fulfilled by completing the Writing II course with a minimum grade of C. Quantitative Reasoning (Mathematics) Requirement Students in the Core Program must fulfill the mathematics and/or science requirements for the bachelor\u2019s degree to be conferred by an undergraduate school or college of NYU. The Core Program requires only one mathematics or one science course prior to transition; however, it is recommended that students transitioning to CAS take both science courses required by CAS while in Liberal Studies (LS). The choice of major often determines which mathematics class is required. LS does not offer mathematics courses; students take the appropriate courses offered at CAS. Students should consult the LS Advising Center staff and refer to the specific departmental Web sites and bulletins for information about the mathematics requirements for their bachelor\u2019s degree program. Core Program Electives While enrolled in the Core Program, students take courses at the NYU school or college where they will earn their bachelor\u2019s degree. While these courses are considered electives in the Core Program, they should be selected so that they fulfill either school, major, or minor requirements in the school to which students intend to transfer. Students in the Core Program may also take any of the electives open to Global Liberal Studies students, as well as Advanced Writing Studio, Global Topics, and Approaches courses\u2014space permitting. Core Program students may not register for the Junior Independent Research Seminar, Experiential Learning I and II, or the Senior Colloquium/Thesis. They may petition to take a Senior Seminar.

GLOBAL LIBERAL STUDIES B.A. The Global Liberal Studies (GLS) Bachelor of Arts is part of the family of Global Studies degrees offered at universities around the world. Global Studies examines the causes, consequences, and nature of globalization rom its beginnings in the ancient world to the present. GLS is distinguished by its humanistic emphasis; it focuses on understanding the political, social, and cultural ramifications of living in a world of intersecting local, national, and global forces. GLS students are trained in strategic thinking by engaging in interdisciplinary study of the entire world as an interconnected system, and they get practical experience living and working across cultures through a required junior year at an NYU global site. GLS students focus their work in a particular area of expertise during the junior and senior year, preparing them for more advanced studies or work in such fields as international finance, global media, and human rights. Curriculum Overview and Requirements GLS is an integrated, four-year curriculum. All students must complete a core curriculum, a concentration selected from among departmental offerings, the junior year at an NYU global site, a senior thesis, and additional requirements outlined below. All GLS classes are small, discussion-based, and writing-intensive. Students and their instructors chart their progress through use of an ePortfolio, building their portfolios and making new connections with other students and faculty members throughout all four years, and gathering resources to draw upon in composing their senior theses. Students have sufficient elective credits o complete a minor or a second major at NYU. The Core Curriculum The basis of the GLS curriculum is an eight-course core that equips students to write in numerous genres and contexts, acquaints them with foundational great works from around the world that remain influential today, introduces fundamental scientific concepts and methods, and involves them in close study of at least one non-Western region. Students read the foundational works of many world cultures in their material and intellectual contexts and independently make critical and imaginative connections across time and space. Students may begin GLS in New York or at NYU Florence, London, or Paris. The GLS programs in Florence, London, and Paris fit in seamlessly with the academic program at Washington Square so that course requirements are met on time for graduation in four years. The Upper Division Curriculum The GLS upper division curriculum centers on a student\u2019s concentration, which they declare in the fall of sophomore year. Students may begin taking upper division courses as early as the spring of freshman year and must take a minimum of four courses in their concentration: Approaches, Junior Independent Research Seminar, and the year-long Senior Colloquium/Thesis class; a sequence that provides instruction in the theories and methods of a particular area of the Global Studies field. Students take progressively greater responsibility for directing their own independent projects, culminating in the senior thesis. In addition to their concentration-specific classes, students take a variety of required seminars and electives on global topics, from economic and political issues to arts and media, from the growth of immense global networks to the nature of ethnicity in everyday local life. These seminars require the completion of a significant research project. Sophomores also normally complete an intensive language course in preparation for the junior year of international study. The Junior Year Curriculum All GLS juniors spend a full year studying at an NYU global academic center. The sites available in a given year are carefully selected to ensure that all required courses are available and to optimize access to experiential learning options. The locations for junior year study in a typical year include NYU global sites in Asia, Europe, Latin America, and the Middle East. (See Global Academic Centers for descriptions of every NYU global site.) Students do not just study at an international site\u2014the site itself becomes an important subject of study. Experiential learning, special topics, and language courses immerse students in the history and contemporary culture of the site and sets it in a global context, while students prepare for their senior theses by developing a substantial research essay in an online course that connects them with their classmates at other sites to create a global perspective on issues. The Experiential Learning component comprises two courses that involve students in a cycle of experience, reflection, and the formulation of concepts that, in turn, guide the understanding of place-based experiences. These experiences take the form both of group community excursions and individual community placements (such as internships, volunteer opportunities, and, on occasion, individual research projects). The goal is to involve students with the workplace culture and social practices of the site city so that they may reflect on and formulate concepts about the creation of the city\u2019s cultural and social milieu and its relation to global frameworks in a way that is informed by their concentration. The principal aim of Experiential Learning I is immersion in the current and historical character of the site. Classroom instruction provides an interdisciplinary perspective on the local, regional, national, and global forces that have shaped the character of life in the site city. Experiential Learning II focuses on the student\u2019s community placement; with the guidance of the instructor, students independently reflect on and formulate concepts relating directly to their community placement. The community placement, which the student actively participates in securing with guidance from relevant personnel, falls within the area defined by the student\u2019s GLS concentration and, as much as possible, relates to individual academic interests. The Senior Year Curriculum During senior year, students return to New York for a year of coursework and guided research that integrates their junior year of international study with the liberal arts foundation established in freshman and sophomore year. Two required Senior Seminars challenge students to engage at an equal level with the major scholarship and most advanced practices concerning any of an array of global issues and themes. Guided electives allow students to extend their studies on topics of personal interest or to complete a minor or second major. The full-year Senior Colloquium/Thesis course completes the student\u2019s progress toward full intellectual independence while allowing him or her to investigate in a global framework the particular experiences of the junior year site. Drawing on the insights from across their four years in the program, students master the precise aspect of global interchange on which they choose to focus, ensuring they graduate with genuine expertise on a topic important to them, potential future employers, and graduate or professional schools. Each section of the course unites students in the same concentration who have spent their junior year at various locations; thus helping students gain a global perspective on their topics. The Colloquium/Thesis course offers grounding in the theoretical texts relevant to advanced work in the concentration, close guidance in the composition of the thesis, and practice in the oral presentation of complex ideas. In addition to subject expertise, the skills the Colloquium/Thesis course teaches\u2014defining a major project\u2019s parameters, testing concepts against actual experience, interpreting evidence and integrating the interpretations of prior thinkers, and writing an extended argument\u2014are all germane to almost any future career. Other Requirements Writing Proficiency Requirement Writing proficiency is required for the NYU bachelor\u2019s degree. The writing proficiency requirement is fulfilled by completing the Global Writing Seminar with a minimum grade of C. Intensive Language Study Requirement Language study is a keystone of GLS, as one cannot understand global history and issues without extended study of a language besides English. All GLS students engage in advanced foreign language study, regardless of their initial level of proficiency. GLS has a language study requirement as well as a language proficiency requirement. Students must both attain proficiency through at least the intermediate level and study in the language of their junior year international site during each semester at the site; in addition, students must have proficiency through the beginning level (normally courses I/II in a sequence, which may be taught in a single intensive semester) before studying at an international site. Thus, a student who does not speak the language of the junior year site host country will be expected to take at least one semester of the appropriate intensive language course before the junior year or one year of the language if it is not offered in intensive format. But regardless of the level of prior fluency, study of the site language must continue in each semester of the junior year. Students who already have some level of proficiency in the language of the junior year site will take a placement test and either continue language study at a higher level (for example, in an advanced grammar class and one conversation class) or take one higher level language instruction class and one class taught in the language of the host country. Students who already have advanced or near-native proficiency will take two classes taught in the language of the host country during the junior year.
