Dr. Samuel Hanson Cox, a member of the University     Council. Because the phrase did not allude to the utilitarian as opposed     to classical aspects of NYU, Dr. Cox added &#8220;Utilati.&#8221; This     phrase appears along the top of the Silver Center on Washington Square     East. After the move to the University Heights     campus in the Bronx in 1895, Chancellor Henry MacCracken dropped the     last word of the motto and altered the construction, making it &#8220;Perstare     et Praestare&#8221; (to perservere and to excel). The motto has remained     the same ever since.               &lt;    Previous    Next    &gt;"}]}]
