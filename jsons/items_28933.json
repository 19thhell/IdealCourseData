Poets of the Harlem Renaissance will present classical art songs by black composers. These songs were inspired by the works of some of the most prolific poets of the 20\u2019s and 30\u2019s. Compositions by Howard Swanson, Florence Price, William Grant Still and others will embrace the texts of Countee Cullen, Arna Bontemps, Philippe Thoby-Marcelin and, most notably, Langston Hughes. Birthed in Harlem, NY, the influence of the Harlem Renaissance impacted the entire Nation. The aspirations, dreams, and realities of these historic figures still resonate for a people everywhere.

Poets of the Harlem Renaissance will present classical art songs by black composers. These songs were inspired by the works of some of the most prolific poets of the 20\u2019s and 30\u2019s. Compositions by Howard Swanson, Florence Price, William Grant Still and others will embrace the texts of Countee Cullen, Arna Bontemps, Philippe Thoby-Marcelin and, most notably, Langston Hughes. Birthed in Harlem, NY, the influence of the Harlem Renaissance impacted the entire Nation. The aspirations, dreams, and realities of these historic figures still resonate for a people everywhere.
