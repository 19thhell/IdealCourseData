Joyce\u2019s stylistic innovations are haunted by memory that slips its moorings in inner life, and circulates through the silences and shadows of a colonial counter-public sphere. Luke Gibbons is professor of Irish literary and cultural studies at Maynooth University, Ireland, and the author of several books. He is Visiting Professor at NYU for Spring 2015.      Introduction by Professor John P. Waters , Clinical Assistant Professor of Irish Studies, NYU.

Joyce\u2019s stylistic innovations are haunted by memory that slips its moorings in inner life, and circulates through the silences and shadows of a colonial counter-public sphere. Luke Gibbons is professor of Irish literary and cultural studies at Maynooth University, Ireland, and the author of several books. He is Visiting Professor at NYU for Spring 2015.

Her research and teaching interests focus on Irish literature and culture in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, with an approach often informed by religious and political history, as well as transnational, postcolonial, and cultural studies. Her book Israelites in Erin: Exodus, Revolution, and the Irish Revival , is published by Syracuse University Press (Fall 2015).      Professor Bender\u2019s other publications include essays on Irish-Mexican solidarity during the Mexican-American War (in Genre: Forms of Discourse and Culture ), Roger Casement\u2019s influence on James Joyce (in the James Joyce Quarterly ), the politics of Lady Gregory\u2019s biblical allusions (in The Princeton Library Chronicle ), and Joyce\u2019s use of Jewish collective memory, and specifically the Passover Haggadah, as a model for Irish national memory in Ulysses (in Memory Ireland Volume 4: Joyce and Cultural Memory ). Professor Bender\u2019s new book project is tentatively titled Nursing the Nation: Breastfeeding in Modern Irish Writing .       Professor Bender has been an invited speaker at The Columbia University Irish Studies Seminar, The James Joyce Summer School in Dublin, The New York Public Library, and the inaugural Memorial Lecture for Professor Barbara Gluck at the Baruch College Jewish Studies Center, CUNY. At NYU, she teaches courses on Irish Drama, James Joyce, Contemporary Irish Fiction, and Women\u2019s Writing in Ireland.      ***      \"As in my research, an interest in moments of cultural contact\u2014whether actual or imaginative\u2014motivates my teaching. I arrived in Irish Studies via Modernism, the Bible, and Jewish Studies, and I continue to focus on expressions of transcultural and transnational sympathy and connection. I love how the students and faculty at Glucksman Ireland House are similarly expanding the scope of Irish Studies as a field, through work that is interdisciplinary, cross-cultural, and dynamic.      \"I have prized the opportunity to mentor both undergraduates and graduate students on exciting research projects, and many of these projects have found audiences beyond our coursework, at conferences and as expanded M.A. theses, for example. Working individually with students to help them develop their original ideas is perhaps the most rewarding aspect of my job, and at GIH it\u2019s a mode that\u2019s fostered by the intimacy and intensity of seminar-style classes that typically meet in the wonderful space of the house itself.\"   Selected Works:   Israelites in Erin: Exodus, Revolution, and the Irish Revival (Syracuse: Syracuse University Press, 2015). \u201cThe Bloomsday Seder: Joyce and Jewish Memory,\u201d in Memory Ireland Volume 4: Joyce and Cultural Memory , eds.
