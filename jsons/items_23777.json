Students serve as Learning Partners in elementary and secondary schools, before they complete their corresponding Student Teaching placements, also in elementary and secondary contexts.    Students complete at least 100 hours as a Learning Partner and spend at least 2 full days per week (7 hours per day) OR 3 half days per week (5 hours per day) over the course of 2 full semesters as a Student Teacher. All fieldwork experiences are overseen and supported by a team of NYU faculty. School placements are made by NYU in collaboration with student interests and needs.    Serving as a Learning Partner    The learning partners fieldwork provides important experience in elementary and secondary schools before completing your student teaching. Depending on the requirements of each course and the opportunities provided by the school, these activities may include, but are not limited to, the following:       observations of one or more classrooms    collaborating with or co-teaching in the classroom    looking at, discussing, and planning curriculum    looking at students&rsquo; work samples and discussing them with students and/or teachers    visiting classrooms outside of your subject area    discovering additional resources and services schools offer: special education, auxiliary programs, etc.    observing a student in all or most of his or her classes throughout the school day    attending teacher professional development programs       While most of the time will be spent in the art classroom, students are also required to familiarize themselves with the school as a whole (e.g., by experiencing other subject areas, special needs services, non-curricular activities).    In visual art, the Elementary Learning Partner experience is fulfilled by being placed with a certified, NYC, elementary school visual art teacher. The Secondary Learning Partner experience in visual art is fulfilled by co-planning and co-teaching a Saturday Visionary Studio Workshop class with a partner teacher.    Serving as a Student Teacher:    All students must complete at least two semesters of student teaching, each in a different school at the elementary and secondary levels. Entry into the initial student teaching experience and continuation into a second experience is subject to faculty review. Student teaching is an important professional experience that builds not only practical experience in the field, but also professional contacts and networks.    Students are assigned to schools with which NYU has established relationships. Students spend at least 2 days a week (6.5 hours per day) for the full semester at their assigned school. We encourage student teachers to gain as much experience in their placements as possible, above and beyond the mandated days required. Student teachers are encouraged to spend both of their two semesters in a public school environment although private school placements are also possible with advisement.    Students assume increasing teaching responsibilities over time until taking over full control of one or more classroom periods per day. This includes teaching their own curriculum unit over a period of 8-10 classes. All student teaching placements are supervised by NYU faculty.    Please be advised that licensing agencies and fieldwork placement facilities require that you undergo a criminal background check, the results of which the agency or facility must find acceptable prior to placement or licensure.

Students serve as Learning Partners in elementary and secondary schools, before they complete their corresponding Student Teaching placements, also in elementary and secondary contexts.    Students complete at least 100 hours as a Learning Partner and spend at least 2 full days per week (7 hours per day) OR 3 half days per week (5 hours per day) over the course of 2 full semesters as a Student Teacher. All fieldwork experiences are overseen and supported by a team of NYU faculty. School placements are made by NYU in collaboration with student interests and needs.    Serving as a Learning Partner    The learning partners fieldwork provides important experience in elementary and secondary schools before completing your student teaching. Depending on the requirements of each course and the opportunities provided by the school, these activities may include, but are not limited to, the following:       observations of one or more classrooms    collaborating with or co-teaching in the classroom    looking at, discussing, and planning curriculum    looking at students&rsquo; work samples and discussing them with students and/or teachers    visiting classrooms outside of your subject area    discovering additional resources and services schools offer: special education, auxiliary programs, etc.    observing a student in all or most of his or her classes throughout the school day    attending teacher professional development programs       While most of the time will be spent in the art classroom, students are also required to familiarize themselves with the school as a whole (e.g., by experiencing other subject areas, special needs services, non-curricular activities).    In visual art, the Elementary Learning Partner experience is fulfilled by being placed with a certified, NYC, elementary school visual art teacher. The Secondary Learning Partner experience in visual art is fulfilled by co-planning and co-teaching a Saturday Visionary Studio Workshop class with a partner teacher.    Serving as a Student Teacher:    All students must complete at least two semesters of student teaching, each in a different school at the elementary and secondary levels. Entry into the initial student teaching experience and continuation into a second experience is subject to faculty review. Student teaching is an important professional experience that builds not only practical experience in the field, but also professional contacts and networks.    Students are assigned to schools with which NYU has established relationships. Students spend at least 2 days a week (6.5 hours per day) for the full semester at their assigned school. We encourage student teachers to gain as much experience in their placements as possible, above and beyond the mandated days required. Student teachers are encouraged to spend both of their two semesters in a public school environment although private school placements are also possible with advisement.    Students assume increasing teaching responsibilities over time until taking over full control of one or more classroom periods per day. This includes teaching their own curriculum unit over a period of 8-10 classes. All student teaching placements are supervised by NYU faculty.    Please be advised that licensing agencies and fieldwork placement facilities require that you undergo a criminal background check, the results of which the agency or facility must find acceptable prior to placement or licensure.
