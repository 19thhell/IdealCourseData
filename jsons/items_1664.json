Martin Luther King, Jr. Scholars are enrolled in full-time study and complete their degrees in one of NYU\u2019s undergraduate divisions. In addition, Scholars are awarded a merit and need-based financial aid package and participate in a rich combination of scholarly activities, domestic and international travel colloquia, research, leadership activities including community service, and educational and cultural activities.        Our Story          In 1986, the Association of Black Faculty and Administrators at New York University proposed to the then Chancellor L. Jay Oliva that an all-University honors program be named in memory of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and support his vision of a world free of racism, poverty, violence, and war. Martin Luther King, Jr. Scholars would not only be among the best and brightest, but they would also be asked to give back in the form of service to others. In 1987, the first group of 16 Martin Luther King, Jr. Scholars began their studies in the College of Arts and Science, the School of Education, the Tisch School of the Arts, the Stern School of Business and the Gallatin School. They were from California, Florida, Kentucky, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania and Texas.   Today, Martin Luther King, Jr. Scholars are enrolled in all undergraduate divisions of the University, hail from coast to coast, and in May 2015 the Martin Luther King, Jr. Scholars Program will graduate its 24th Class.

The understanding of the legacy that informs the Scholars Program includes the themes of \u201cthe beloved community\u201d and social justice - Dr. King\u2019s commitment to the proposition that inclusive and just communities are communities where individuals can grow and thrive. An all-University honors program, the MLK, Jr. Scholars Program     Promotes excellence in academic achievement and leadership   Builds Community   Helps to prepare and nurture the next generation of leadership for change     The Martin Luther King, Jr. Scholars Program is more than an academic scholarship and requires more of students than outstanding grades. Martin Luther King, Jr. Scholars are enrolled in full-time study and complete their degrees in one of NYU\u2019s undergraduate divisions. In addition, Scholars are awarded a merit and need-based financial aid package and participate in a rich combination of scholarly activities, domestic and international travel colloquia, research, leadership activities including community service, and educational and cultural activities.        Our Story          In 1986, the Association of Black Faculty and Administrators at New York University proposed to the then Chancellor L. Jay Oliva that an all-University honors program be named in memory of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and support his vision of a world free of racism, poverty, violence, and war. Martin Luther King, Jr. Scholars would not only be among the best and brightest, but they would also be asked to give back in the form of service to others. In 1987, the first group of 16 Martin Luther King, Jr. Scholars began their studies in the College of Arts and Science, the School of Education, the Tisch School of the Arts, the Stern School of Business and the Gallatin School. They were from California, Florida, Kentucky, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania and Texas.   Today, Martin Luther King, Jr. Scholars are enrolled in all undergraduate divisions of the University, hail from coast to coast, and in May 2015 the Martin Luther King, Jr. Scholars Program will graduate its 24th Class.

Dr. King's speech entitled, \u201cThe Future of Integration,&quot; advocated for civil rights and nonviolent protest for social change. He said, &quot;Human progress is neither automatic nor inevitable... Every step toward the goal of justice requires sacrifice, suffering, and struggle; the tireless exertions and passionate concern of dedicated individuals.&quot;   As we prepare to celebrate the 10th Annual NYU MLK Week, we are eager to continue the conversation around action and lead our community to live beyond the dream of Dr. King. The 2015 NYU MLK Week event theme &quot;Beyond A Dream\u201d will serve as a guiding force to commemorate Dr. King\u2019s honor and vision to make the world a better place. Three concepts - Reflect, Engage, Ignite - will be explored during this week of conversation and action. The highlight of the week will be the NYU MLK Week University-Wide Event on Thursday, February 5th.
