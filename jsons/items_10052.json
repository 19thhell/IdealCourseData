From the 8th century until the 17th century, Islam played a crucial role in the history of the Iberian Peninsula.

While we look at the history of Al-Andalus and assess the importance of the contributions of Al-Andalus to Europe and America, we evaluate the significance of its legacy in modern Spain. Furthermore, we will study the protagonist role that Spain has played in relations between Europe and the Mediterranean Islamic countries during the Modern Age. Students will gain further understanding and contextualization of current Arab-Muslim geopolitics. As a case study, we will address the Spanish Protectorate in Morocco, as well as its ensuing process of decolonization and the consequences that shape the current international relations between the two neighboring countries, Spain and Morocco.

Internship placements are made by EUSA, an internship placement organization partnering with NYU.     The seminar portion of the course explores many different aspects of your internship site. The goal is to finish the semester with an in-depth understanding of the company or organization, including its approach, its policies, and the context in which it operates. We will also discuss more generally the state of the contemporary workplace and ourselves as workers. Finally, you will use the seminar to reflect critically and analytically on the internship experience and as a way to refine your own personal and professional goals.     Sample Syllabus coming soon                                                                          The Politics of Climate Change - POL-UA 9994 - 4 points                               This course examines the interaction between two coupled systems, the Earth system and humanity\u2019s political systems. Beginning with an analysis of the effects of anthropogenic industrial carbon dioxide gas emissions on the Earth system as derived from the scientific evidence this course attempts to understand the reaction of the global, European and Spanish political governance systems to these transformations. In order to understand something as apparently specific as the impact of climate change in the Iberian peninsula and the Spanish state\u2019s response to it we must first understand, therefore, how the United Nations and the European Union are responding to climate change since the Spanish political system\u2019s control and mitigation policies are largely determined by these two larger governance systems\u2019 responses.     Sample Syllabus                                                                    Political Economy of Developing Countries - POL-UA 9994 - 4 points                               Millions of lives around the world are impacted by natural disaster, war and other crises every year. Men, women and children are left homeless and vulnerable, and domestic infrastructure and institutions are often completely destroyed. Frequently, the people affected tend to live in countries that lack the autonomous capacities to pursue development without the assistance of international development agencies, foreign governments and NGOs. The development of a country requires a multi-layered approach, taking into account the diversity of failures caused by the crisis, the particularities of country related issues and, in most cases, the lack of development that already existed in the period preceding the crisis.International Development in Post Crisis Countries explores how countries develop in post-crisis periods and looks at the role of the international community in contributing to development. This course introduces students to a cross section of academic topics relevant to development, including, but not limited to, economic development, international relations, law and rule of law, human rights and gender studies. The majority of the course will focus on exploring each of these topic areas in depth, examining them from a wide array of theoretical perspectives and methodologies.   Sample Syllabus                                                                    Modern Spanish Poetry in Context - SPAN-UA 9951 - 4 points                               Course description coming soon.                                                                    Madrid Symphonies: Engaging with the City Through Documentary Film - SPAN-UA 9951 - 2 points                               Through the process of making short (3-5 minute) \u201ccity symphony\u201d documentary films, this course offers an exciting opportunity for students to explore, engage with, and represent aspects of life in Madrid that are not often seen in mainstream media.   \u201cCity Symphony\u201d takes its name from the \u201cCity Symphony\u201d documentary subgenre, in which a filmmaker attempts to capture the rhythm, dynamism and texture of a city or neighborhood. The form emerged in the 1920\u2019s and often celebrated modernism and the triumph of the city as an urban form. Classic examples include William Ruttmann\u2019s Berlin: Symphony of a Metropolis, Joris Ivens\u2019 Rain and Paul Strand and Charles Sheeler\u2019s Manhatta. More recent examples such as Huang Weikai\u2019s Disorder have turned the form on its head.   In this intensive hands-on production workshop, students will make their own \u201cMadrid symphonies\u201d. They will be encouraged to look, listen and explore Madrid with a documentarian\u2019s gaze, to represent the city from new perspectives, and to seek out places, images and stories that deepen, contextualize or counterpose pre-existing notions of Spain and its peoples.   This course offers a special opportunity to get to know a new place and new peoples, produce a meaningful and lasting creative work, learn to \u201clook\u201d at the world as a documentarian, increase one\u2019s sensitivity to stories that we encounter every day, and appreciate the myriad of subtleties in how to tell those stories.

This course offers an introduction to the construction of modern Spain through the study of a variety of cultural texts\u2014literature, film, the visual arts, advertising and pop music--from the 19th century to the end of the 1980s.

From the 8th century until the 17th century, Islam played a crucial role in the history of the Iberian Peninsula. Today this period is often portrayed as one of inter-religious harmony, while al-Andalus is simultaneously mourned in contemporary Islamist discourse as a lost paradise. While we look at the history of Al-Andalus and assess the importance of the contributions of Al-Andalus to Europe and America, we evaluate the significance of its legacy in modern Spain. Furthermore, we will study the protagonist role that Spain has played in relations between Europe and the Mediterranean Islamic countries during the Modern Age. Students will gain further understanding and contextualization of current Arab-Muslim geopolitics. As a case study, we will address the Spanish Protectorate in Morocco, as well as its ensuing process of decolonization and the consequences that shape the current international relations between the two neighboring countries, Spain and Morocco.

Spain will be presented in its diversity, richness, and uniqueness with the help of supporting materials such as newspaper articles, TV and radio programs, commercials, short films, chats, etc. Finally, our goal is that the students gain an understanding of the new culture and that they be able to create new intercultural spaces by means of the comparisons to their own culture. This course is based on culture, language and training in oral communication.

Concentrates on epistemological constructions of Spain\u2014the idea of Spain\u2014that emerge from competing external and internal perspectives. Students examine how this national culture is constructed, first analyzing Spain from North African perspectives through Sephardic nostalgic poetry and the Hispano-Arabic literary traditions. The American perspective pits notions of Spanish imperial power and grandeur against the Black Legend, a term that Protestant circles in Europe and the United States promoted to attack the legitimacy of Spain\u2019s New World empire. A final focus on European views analyzes the depiction of Spain as the embodiment of German and French Romantic ideals beginning at the end of the 17th century and the reemergence of the same notion during the Spanish Civil War (1933\u201336). Throughout, students examine principal textual and visual images that contribute to the historical and contemporary construction of a national culture that emerged at geographic and cultural crossroads.

Sample Syllabus coming soon                                                                          The Politics of Climate Change - POL-UA 9994 - 4 points                               This course examines the interaction between two coupled systems, the Earth system and humanity\u2019s political systems. Beginning with an analysis of the effects of anthropogenic industrial carbon dioxide gas emissions on the Earth system as derived from the scientific evidence this course attempts to understand the reaction of the global, European and Spanish political governance systems to these transformations. In order to understand something as apparently specific as the impact of climate change in the Iberian peninsula and the Spanish state\u2019s response to it we must first understand, therefore, how the United Nations and the European Union are responding to climate change since the Spanish political system\u2019s control and mitigation policies are largely determined by these two larger governance systems\u2019 responses.     Sample Syllabus                                                                    Political Economy of Developing Countries - POL-UA 9994 - 4 points                               Millions of lives around the world are impacted by natural disaster, war and other crises every year. Men, women and children are left homeless and vulnerable, and domestic infrastructure and institutions are often completely destroyed. Frequently, the people affected tend to live in countries that lack the autonomous capacities to pursue development without the assistance of international development agencies, foreign governments and NGOs. The development of a country requires a multi-layered approach, taking into account the diversity of failures caused by the crisis, the particularities of country related issues and, in most cases, the lack of development that already existed in the period preceding the crisis.International Development in Post Crisis Countries explores how countries develop in post-crisis periods and looks at the role of the international community in contributing to development. This course introduces students to a cross section of academic topics relevant to development, including, but not limited to, economic development, international relations, law and rule of law, human rights and gender studies. The majority of the course will focus on exploring each of these topic areas in depth, examining them from a wide array of theoretical perspectives and methodologies.   Sample Syllabus                                                                    Modern Spanish Poetry in Context - SPAN-UA 9951 - 4 points                               Course description coming soon.                                                                    Madrid Symphonies: Engaging with the City Through Documentary Film - SPAN-UA 9951 - 2 points                               Through the process of making short (3-5 minute) \u201ccity symphony\u201d documentary films, this course offers an exciting opportunity for students to explore, engage with, and represent aspects of life in Madrid that are not often seen in mainstream media.   \u201cCity Symphony\u201d takes its name from the \u201cCity Symphony\u201d documentary subgenre, in which a filmmaker attempts to capture the rhythm, dynamism and texture of a city or neighborhood. The form emerged in the 1920\u2019s and often celebrated modernism and the triumph of the city as an urban form. Classic examples include William Ruttmann\u2019s Berlin: Symphony of a Metropolis, Joris Ivens\u2019 Rain and Paul Strand and Charles Sheeler\u2019s Manhatta. More recent examples such as Huang Weikai\u2019s Disorder have turned the form on its head.   In this intensive hands-on production workshop, students will make their own \u201cMadrid symphonies\u201d. They will be encouraged to look, listen and explore Madrid with a documentarian\u2019s gaze, to represent the city from new perspectives, and to seek out places, images and stories that deepen, contextualize or counterpose pre-existing notions of Spain and its peoples.   This course offers a special opportunity to get to know a new place and new peoples, produce a meaningful and lasting creative work, learn to \u201clook\u201d at the world as a documentarian, increase one\u2019s sensitivity to stories that we encounter every day, and appreciate the myriad of subtleties in how to tell those stories.

In recent years, the idea of \u201cthe three cultures\u201d of medieval Spain \u2014 Christianity, Islam and Judaism \u2014 has become a popular ideal and model for modernity among a wide variety of thinkers and writers; and both utopian and distopian visions of Sefarad and Andalus (the Hebrew and Arabic terms that refer to the Iberian Peninsula) permeate discourses on politics, religion and even education. This course will examine the ways in which that nostalgia for a lost Andalus or Sefarad is both explored as a theme and used as a device in a wide variety of modern novels and short stories (as well as some poetry), and the ways in which modern authors deploy this trope to comment on the worlds they inhabit. Reading medieval Spanish texts alongside the writing they inspired in modernity will provide a diachronic framework for better understanding medieval Iberian literature and will also raise questions about the salience of the past for the present.

Concentrates on epistemological constructions of Spain\u2014the idea of Spain\u2014that emerge from competing external and internal perspectives. Students examine how this national culture is constructed, first analyzing Spain from North African perspectives through Sephardic nostalgic poetry and the Hispano-Arabic literary traditions. The American perspective pits notions of Spanish imperial power and grandeur against the Black Legend, a term that Protestant circles in Europe and the United States promoted to attack the legitimacy of Spain\u2019s New World empire. A final focus on European views analyzes the depiction of Spain as the embodiment of German and French Romantic ideals beginning at the end of the 17th century and the reemergence of the same notion during the Spanish Civil War (1933\u201336). Throughout, students examine principal textual and visual images that contribute to the historical and contemporary construction of a national culture that emerged at geographic and cultural crossroads.

Beginning with an analysis of the effects of anthropogenic industrial carbon dioxide gas emissions on the Earth system as derived from the scientific evidence this course attempts to understand the reaction of the global, European and Spanish political governance systems to these transformations. In order to understand something as apparently specific as the impact of climate change in the Iberian peninsula and the Spanish state\u2019s response to it we must first understand, therefore, how the United Nations and the European Union are responding to climate change since the Spanish political system\u2019s control and mitigation policies are largely determined by these two larger governance systems\u2019 responses.

Basic concepts of return and risk are explored in detail with a view to understanding how financial markets work and how different kinds of financial instruments are valued. These instruments, including equities, fixed income securities, options, and other derivative securities become vehicles for exploring various financial markets and the utilization of these markets by managers in different kinds of financial institutions to enhance return and manage risk. The course includes a segment on the use and application of computer-based quantitative technology for financial modeling purposes.

College Core Curriculum                                                  Cultures and Contexts: Spain \u0097At the Crossroads of Europe, North Africa, and America - CORE-UA 9544 - 4 points                               Analyzes the ways in which historical, geopolitical, cultural, artistic, and popular views function to constitute and continuously transform a national culture. Concentrates on epistemological constructions of Spain\u2014the idea of Spain\u2014that emerge from competing external and internal perspectives. Students examine how this national culture is constructed, first analyzing Spain from North African perspectives through Sephardic nostalgic poetry and the Hispano-Arabic literary traditions. The American perspective pits notions of Spanish imperial power and grandeur against the Black Legend, a term that Protestant circles in Europe and the United States promoted to attack the legitimacy of Spain\u2019s New World empire. A final focus on European views analyzes the depiction of Spain as the embodiment of German and French Romantic ideals beginning at the end of the 17th century and the reemergence of the same notion during the Spanish Civil War (1933\u201336). Throughout, students examine principal textual and visual images that contribute to the historical and contemporary construction of a national culture that emerged at geographic and cultural crossroads.

Application required.     This 4 credit course includes a weekly seminar and a minimum of 16 hours of fieldwork per week (two full days). Internship placements are made by EUSA, an internship placement organization partnering with NYU.     The seminar portion of the course explores many different aspects of your internship site. The goal is to finish the semester with an in-depth understanding of the company or organization, including its approach, its policies, and the context in which it operates. We will also discuss more generally the state of the contemporary workplace and ourselves as workers. Finally, you will use the seminar to reflect critically and analytically on the internship experience and as a way to refine your own personal and professional goals.

This course has a strong emphasis on place-based learning methods. This course consists of two components during the fall semester. The first part will be an introduction to Spanish society and the second will focus on research methods to facilitate the experiential learning process in both the fall and spring semesters.   Sample Syllabus                                History                                                  Transatlantic Empire - HIST-UA 9175 or SPAN-UA 9951 - 4 points                               For 400 years, Spain was at the center of a vast tricontinental empire that stretched from Spain to the Caribbean islands, across the Andes to the Pacific coast and the Phillipines. As has often been noted, Spanish colonialism was significantly different from the later colonial endeavours of Northern European nations. Taking full advantage of our location in Madrid, this seminar will introduce students to key texts, debates, and events in the cultural and political history of Spain in its relationship to Spanish America and the Caribbean. The readings are organized around some of the key events and issues that emerged in this long and complex history: the moment of \u201cdiscovery,\u201d the debates about conquest and the rights of indigenous populations in the 16th century, the emergence of new forms of racialization in the context of Atlantic slavery, anticolonial insurgencies in the 18th and 19th centuries, and the collapse of empire in 1898. We will also ask how our understanding of the Spanish Empire and its politics relates to some more contemporary preocupations and polemics. How was the moment of \u201cdiscovery\u201d remembered in Spain and in the Americas? What is the \u201cblack legend\u201d of Spanish history and what are the objections to it? Are there alternative visions of Spanish history? Can we trace modern forms of racialization to the Spanish Empire? Were the core concepts of political debate during Spanish colonial rule significantly different from those we deploy today, or can we, to the contrary, traces these concepts back to debates that first took place in the Spanish empire?   Most of the discussion will be based on primary sources, though we will also read some of the canonical historiography. Depending on logistics and availability of funds, we will schedule visits to local museums (i.e. Museo de las Am\u00e9ricas), collections, and archives in Madrid, Simancas, or, if possible, Sevilla. Students are encouraged to do the reading of primary sources in Spanish, but translations will be made available to those who do not read Spanish.

Through readings, film viewings, walking tours, and the production of their own documentary shorts, students will have an opportunity to explore, engage with, and document aspects of this protean city. The course, moreover, will provide an introduction to documentary theory, tradition and practice, will encourage students to look, listen and explore Madrid with a documentarian\u2019s gaze, to represent the city from new perspectives, and to seek out stories that deepen their understanding of Madrid and Spain.

Beginning with an analysis of the effects of anthropogenic industrial carbon dioxide gas emissions on the Earth system as derived from the scientific evidence this course attempts to understand the reaction of the global, European and Spanish political governance systems to these transformations. In order to understand something as apparently specific as the impact of climate change in the Iberian peninsula and the Spanish state\u2019s response to it we must first understand, therefore, how the United Nations and the European Union are responding to climate change since the Spanish political system\u2019s control and mitigation policies are largely determined by these two larger governance systems\u2019 responses.

Men, women and children are left homeless and vulnerable, and domestic infrastructure and institutions are often completely destroyed. Frequently, the people affected tend to live in countries that lack the autonomous capacities to pursue development without the assistance of international development agencies, foreign governments and NGOs. The development of a country requires a multi-layered approach, taking into account the diversity of failures caused by the crisis, the particularities of country related issues and, in most cases, the lack of development that already existed in the period preceding the crisis.International Development in Post Crisis Countries explores how countries develop in post-crisis periods and looks at the role of the international community in contributing to development. This course introduces students to a cross section of academic topics relevant to development, including, but not limited to, economic development, international relations, law and rule of law, human rights and gender studies. The majority of the course will focus on exploring each of these topic areas in depth, examining them from a wide array of theoretical perspectives and methodologies.

A study of Spain and its integration into the European Common Market. The historical background examines Europe in the aftermath of World War II, Spain under Franco's dictatorship and its relationship to other European countries, as well as the events leading up to the actual foundation of the European Economic Community (EEC). Emphasis is on the negotiations leading to Spain's incorporation into the EEC, and a detailed analysis is given of the present-day European Common Market and its goals for the future.

From the 8th century until the 17th century, Islam played a crucial role in the history of the Iberian Peninsula. Today this period is often portrayed as one of inter-religious harmony, while al-Andalus is simultaneously mourned in contemporary Islamist discourse as a lost paradise. While we look at the history of Al-Andalus and assess the importance of the contributions of Al-Andalus to Europe and America, we evaluate the significance of its legacy in modern Spain. Furthermore, we will study the protagonist role that Spain has played in relations between Europe and the Mediterranean Islamic countries during the Modern Age. Students will gain further understanding and contextualization of current Arab-Muslim geopolitics. As a case study, we will address the Spanish Protectorate in Morocco, as well as its ensuing process of decolonization and the consequences that shape the current international relations between the two neighboring countries, Spain and Morocco.

Students examine how this national culture is constructed, first analyzing Spain from North African perspectives through Sephardic nostalgic poetry and the Hispano-Arabic literary traditions. The American perspective pits notions of Spanish imperial power and grandeur against the Black Legend, a term that Protestant circles in Europe and the United States promoted to attack the legitimacy of Spain\u2019s New World empire. A final focus on European views analyzes the depiction of Spain as the embodiment of German and French Romantic ideals beginning at the end of the 17th century and the reemergence of the same notion during the Spanish Civil War (1933\u201336). Throughout, students examine principal textual and visual images that contribute to the historical and contemporary construction of a national culture that emerged at geographic and cultural crossroads.

Beginning with an analysis of the effects of anthropogenic industrial carbon dioxide gas emissions on the Earth system as derived from the scientific evidence this course attempts to understand the reaction of the global, European and Spanish political governance systems to these transformations. In order to understand something as apparently specific as the impact of climate change in the Iberian peninsula and the Spanish state\u2019s response to it we must first understand, therefore, how the United Nations and the European Union are responding to climate change since the Spanish political system\u2019s control and mitigation policies are largely determined by these two larger governance systems\u2019 responses.     Sample Syllabus                                                                    Political Economy of Developing Countries - POL-UA 9994 - 4 points                               Millions of lives around the world are impacted by natural disaster, war and other crises every year. Men, women and children are left homeless and vulnerable, and domestic infrastructure and institutions are often completely destroyed. Frequently, the people affected tend to live in countries that lack the autonomous capacities to pursue development without the assistance of international development agencies, foreign governments and NGOs. The development of a country requires a multi-layered approach, taking into account the diversity of failures caused by the crisis, the particularities of country related issues and, in most cases, the lack of development that already existed in the period preceding the crisis.International Development in Post Crisis Countries explores how countries develop in post-crisis periods and looks at the role of the international community in contributing to development. This course introduces students to a cross section of academic topics relevant to development, including, but not limited to, economic development, international relations, law and rule of law, human rights and gender studies. The majority of the course will focus on exploring each of these topic areas in depth, examining them from a wide array of theoretical perspectives and methodologies.

Madrid Symphonies: Engaging with the City Through Documentary Film - SPAN-UA 9951 - 2 points                               Through the process of making short (3-5 minute) \u201ccity symphony\u201d documentary films, this course offers an exciting opportunity for students to explore, engage with, and represent aspects of life in Madrid that are not often seen in mainstream media.   \u201cCity Symphony\u201d takes its name from the \u201cCity Symphony\u201d documentary subgenre, in which a filmmaker attempts to capture the rhythm, dynamism and texture of a city or neighborhood. The form emerged in the 1920\u2019s and often celebrated modernism and the triumph of the city as an urban form. Classic examples include William Ruttmann\u2019s Berlin: Symphony of a Metropolis, Joris Ivens\u2019 Rain and Paul Strand and Charles Sheeler\u2019s Manhatta. More recent examples such as Huang Weikai\u2019s Disorder have turned the form on its head.   In this intensive hands-on production workshop, students will make their own \u201cMadrid symphonies\u201d. They will be encouraged to look, listen and explore Madrid with a documentarian\u2019s gaze, to represent the city from new perspectives, and to seek out places, images and stories that deepen, contextualize or counterpose pre-existing notions of Spain and its peoples.   This course offers a special opportunity to get to know a new place and new peoples, produce a meaningful and lasting creative work, learn to \u201clook\u201d at the world as a documentarian, increase one\u2019s sensitivity to stories that we encounter every day, and appreciate the myriad of subtleties in how to tell those stories.

While we look at the history of Al-Andalus and assess the importance of the contributions of Al-Andalus to Europe and America, we evaluate the significance of its legacy in modern Spain. Furthermore, we will study the protagonist role that Spain has played in relations between Europe and the Mediterranean Islamic countries during the Modern Age.

In recent years, the idea of \u201cthe three cultures\u201d of medieval Spain \u2014 Christianity, Islam and Judaism \u2014 has become a popular ideal and model for modernity among a wide variety of thinkers and writers; and both utopian and distopian visions of Sefarad and Andalus (the Hebrew and Arabic terms that refer to the Iberian Peninsula) permeate discourses on politics, religion and even education. This course will examine the ways in which that nostalgia for a lost Andalus or Sefarad is both explored as a theme and used as a device in a wide variety of modern novels and short stories (as well as some poetry), and the ways in which modern authors deploy this trope to comment on the worlds they inhabit. Reading medieval Spanish texts alongside the writing they inspired in modernity will provide a diachronic framework for better understanding medieval Iberian literature and will also raise questions about the salience of the past for the present.

Cultures and Contexts: Spain \u0097At the Crossroads of Europe, North Africa, and America - CORE-UA 9544 - 4 points                               Analyzes the ways in which historical, geopolitical, cultural, artistic, and popular views function to constitute and continuously transform a national culture. Concentrates on epistemological constructions of Spain\u2014the idea of Spain\u2014that emerge from competing external and internal perspectives. Students examine how this national culture is constructed, first analyzing Spain from North African perspectives through Sephardic nostalgic poetry and the Hispano-Arabic literary traditions. The American perspective pits notions of Spanish imperial power and grandeur against the Black Legend, a term that Protestant circles in Europe and the United States promoted to attack the legitimacy of Spain\u2019s New World empire. A final focus on European views analyzes the depiction of Spain as the embodiment of German and French Romantic ideals beginning at the end of the 17th century and the reemergence of the same notion during the Spanish Civil War (1933\u201336). Throughout, students examine principal textual and visual images that contribute to the historical and contemporary construction of a national culture that emerged at geographic and cultural crossroads.

Beginning with an analysis of the effects of anthropogenic industrial carbon dioxide gas emissions on the Earth system as derived from the scientific evidence this course attempts to understand the reaction of the global, European and Spanish political governance systems to these transformations. In order to understand something as apparently specific as the impact of climate change in the Iberian peninsula and the Spanish state\u2019s response to it we must first understand, therefore, how the United Nations and the European Union are responding to climate change since the Spanish political system\u2019s control and mitigation policies are largely determined by these two larger governance systems\u2019 responses.     Sample Syllabus                                                                    Current Social, Political and Urban Challenges to European Cities - SCA-UA 9680 & SOC-UA 9970 - 4 points                               This course is an introduction to urban politics in Europe. It is designed to provide the student with practical and theoretical tools to understand and critically analyze European cities. We will take a close look at the social, political and urban challenges these cities are currently facing.                                                                      Islam and Spain: Past and Present - MEIS-UA 9707 or SPAN-UA 9334 - 4 points                               Both English &amp; Spanish Taught sections will be offered in Spring 2015   From the 8th century until the 17th century, Islam played a crucial role in the history of the Iberian Peninsula. Today this period is often portrayed as one of inter-religious harmony, while al-Andalus is simultaneously mourned in contemporary Islamist discourse as a lost paradise. While we look at the history of Al-Andalus and assess the importance of the contributions of Al-Andalus to Europe and America, we evaluate the significance of its legacy in modern Spain. Furthermore, we will study the protagonist role that Spain has played in relations between Europe and the Mediterranean Islamic countries during the Modern Age. Students will gain further understanding and contextualization of current Arab-Muslim geopolitics. As a case study, we will address the Spanish Protectorate in Morocco, as well as its ensuing process of decolonization and the consequences that shape the current international relations between the two neighboring countries, Spain and Morocco.   Note: This Class does NOT currently include a trip to Morocco as in past semesters.   Sample Syllabus                                                                    Comparative U.S. and European Human Rights - POL-UA 9994 or SOC-UA 9970 - 4 points                               This course is a study of comparative human rights between European countries, including  Spain, and the United States of America. International human rights legislation imposes  the same obligations on all signatory countries. Despite this, however, interpretation and  application of these rights vary considerably between countries. Students will explore a set  of controversial issues in order to understand the complex differences between the United  States and European countries\u2019 interpretation of human rights obligations, and will also look  at how these differences are portrayed in society by comparing international and national  media coverage of the issues.

From the 8th century until the 17th century, Islam played a crucial role in the history of the Iberian Peninsula. Today this period is often portrayed as one of inter-religious harmony, while al-Andalus is simultaneously mourned in contemporary Islamist discourse as a lost paradise. While we look at the history of Al-Andalus and assess the importance of the contributions of Al-Andalus to Europe and America, we evaluate the significance of its legacy in modern Spain. Furthermore, we will study the protagonist role that Spain has played in relations between Europe and the Mediterranean Islamic countries during the Modern Age. Students will gain further understanding and contextualization of current Arab-Muslim geopolitics. As a case study, we will address the Spanish Protectorate in Morocco, as well as its ensuing process of decolonization and the consequences that shape the current international relations between the two neighboring countries, Spain and Morocco.

Concentrates on epistemological constructions of Spain\u2014the idea of Spain\u2014that emerge from competing external and internal perspectives. Students examine how this national culture is constructed, first analyzing Spain from North African perspectives through Sephardic nostalgic poetry and the Hispano-Arabic literary traditions. The American perspective pits notions of Spanish imperial power and grandeur against the Black Legend, a term that Protestant circles in Europe and the United States promoted to attack the legitimacy of Spain\u2019s New World empire. A final focus on European views analyzes the depiction of Spain as the embodiment of German and French Romantic ideals beginning at the end of the 17th century and the reemergence of the same notion during the Spanish Civil War (1933\u201336). Throughout, students examine principal textual and visual images that contribute to the historical and contemporary construction of a national culture that emerged at geographic and cultural crossroads.

Sample Syllabus                                History                                                  Transatlantic Empire - HIST-UA 9175 or SPAN-UA 9951 - 4 points                               For 400 years, Spain was at the center of a vast tricontinental empire that stretched from Spain to the Caribbean islands, across the Andes to the Pacific coast and the Phillipines. As has often been noted, Spanish colonialism was significantly different from the later colonial endeavours of Northern European nations. Taking full advantage of our location in Madrid, this seminar will introduce students to key texts, debates, and events in the cultural and political history of Spain in its relationship to Spanish America and the Caribbean. The readings are organized around some of the key events and issues that emerged in this long and complex history: the moment of \u201cdiscovery,\u201d the debates about conquest and the rights of indigenous populations in the 16th century, the emergence of new forms of racialization in the context of Atlantic slavery, anticolonial insurgencies in the 18th and 19th centuries, and the collapse of empire in 1898. We will also ask how our understanding of the Spanish Empire and its politics relates to some more contemporary preocupations and polemics. How was the moment of \u201cdiscovery\u201d remembered in Spain and in the Americas? What is the \u201cblack legend\u201d of Spanish history and what are the objections to it? Are there alternative visions of Spanish history? Can we trace modern forms of racialization to the Spanish Empire? Were the core concepts of political debate during Spanish colonial rule significantly different from those we deploy today, or can we, to the contrary, traces these concepts back to debates that first took place in the Spanish empire?   Most of the discussion will be based on primary sources, though we will also read some of the canonical historiography. Depending on logistics and availability of funds, we will schedule visits to local museums (i.e. Museo de las Am\u00e9ricas), collections, and archives in Madrid, Simancas, or, if possible, Sevilla. Students are encouraged to do the reading of primary sources in Spanish, but translations will be made available to those who do not read Spanish.

Through readings, film viewings, walking tours, and the production of their own documentary shorts, students will have an opportunity to explore, engage with, and document aspects of this protean city. The course, moreover, will provide an introduction to documentary theory, tradition and practice, will encourage students to look, listen and explore Madrid with a documentarian\u2019s gaze, to represent the city from new perspectives, and to seek out stories that deepen their understanding of Madrid and Spain.

Beginning with an analysis of the effects of anthropogenic industrial carbon dioxide gas emissions on the Earth system as derived from the scientific evidence this course attempts to understand the reaction of the global, European and Spanish political governance systems to these transformations. In order to understand something as apparently specific as the impact of climate change in the Iberian peninsula and the Spanish state\u2019s response to it we must first understand, therefore, how the United Nations and the European Union are responding to climate change since the Spanish political system\u2019s control and mitigation policies are largely determined by these two larger governance systems\u2019 responses.

Men, women and children are left homeless and vulnerable, and domestic infrastructure and institutions are often completely destroyed. Frequently, the people affected tend to live in countries that lack the autonomous capacities to pursue development without the assistance of international development agencies, foreign governments and NGOs. The development of a country requires a multi-layered approach, taking into account the diversity of failures caused by the crisis, the particularities of country related issues and, in most cases, the lack of development that already existed in the period preceding the crisis.International Development in Post Crisis Countries explores how countries develop in post-crisis periods and looks at the role of the international community in contributing to development. This course introduces students to a cross section of academic topics relevant to development, including, but not limited to, economic development, international relations, law and rule of law, human rights and gender studies. The majority of the course will focus on exploring each of these topic areas in depth, examining them from a wide array of theoretical perspectives and methodologies.

Students are encouraged to do the reading of primary sources in Spanish, but translations will be made available to those who do not read Spanish.
