The X-Ray Diffraction Facility (XDF) is dedicated to materials identification and characterization through Single-crystal and Powder X-Ray Diffraction (SXRD and PXRD) analysis. Researchers may have analysis done by the facility specialist or perform the work by themselves after training (certain restrictions may apply to external users).    The Bruker AXS SMART APEXII Single Crystal Diffractometer was acquired through the support of the Molecular Design Institute in the Department of Chemistry at New York University. The Bruker AXS D8 DISCOVER GADDS X-Ray Microdiffractometer was acquired through the support of the National Science Foundation CRIF Program under Award Number CHE-0840277 and the NSF MRSEC Program under Award Number DMR-0820341 .      Highlights          Congratulations to Qi Jiang! He won the award for the best oral presentation in the NYU Diffraction Workshop 2014.      NYU Diffraction Workshop 2014    Congratulations to Shane Nichols! He won the poster prize in the Bruker/MIT Symposium 2014. Dr. Yuzhou Liu, who graduated in 2012, won the same prize in 2010.
