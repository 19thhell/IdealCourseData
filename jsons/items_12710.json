Research    A principal area of research in our group is the design and synthesis of crystalline molecular materials in which the constituents are held together in a lattice by weak, and typically unpredictable, intermolecular interactions. Our goal is to develop and use design principles, based on these interactions, which can be used to direct molecular assembly of molecules into solid-state structures endowed with unique properties, ranging from electronic conductivity to second harmonic generation to high-selectivity enantioselective separations. Our approach relies on the rational adjustment of solid-state structure and properties by deploying the versatility of organic synthesis, sometimes described as \u201ccrystal engineering.\u201d For example, recent efforts in our group have led to the discovery of a novel class of porous molecular frameworks, held together by hydrogen bonding, which are capable of organizing guest molecules in their pores in unusual ways, or trapping molecules selectively to enable otherwise difficult separations. Our group also is synthesizing new organic materials designed for use as materials in field effect transistors.    We also seek to understand the nucleation and growth processes that lead to the formation of molecular crystals such as conducting solids, dyes and pharmaceutical reagents, and proteins. This understanding is crucial for control of crystal characteristics such as polymorphism, size, growth orientation, morphology and defect density, which ultimately affect the properties of these materials. These efforts include (i) the study of surface templates for selective growth of desirable crystalline polymorphs; (ii) elucidating the fundamental principles of epitaxy that govern nucleation of thin films and crystals; (iii) crystallization of organic compounds in nanometer-scale reactors, aimed at understanding the thermodynamic properties of organic nano-sized crystals, control of polymorphism, and discovery of new polymorphs. Our group also employs real-time in situ atomic force microscopy (AFM) for direct visualization of crystal growth at the near-molecular level. These efforts include the study of disease pathways associated with pathological biomineralization, such as the formation of kidney stones, which in most cases are aggregates of calcium-containing crystalline minerals such as calcium oxalate and calcium phosphate. AFM is used to study the effect of macromolecules and proteins on crystal growth, and its force measurement capability is used to probe the molecular-level adhesion properties of the various crystal surfaces, properties that are directly related to the formation of kidney stones.

Research Description   Crystalline polyhedra are prototypical material objects; light is ethereal. Yet, there has been a surprising reciprocity between crystals and light. Polarization and photon entanglement are crystal-optical discoveries while light scattering has been unsurpassed in the characterization of crystals. We engage this dialogue through investigations of unusual crystalline materials that have informed crystal growth mechanisms and led to the design of new optical materials. Recently, we have focused on the interactions of light with organized polycrystals that occur in biopathological structures, high-polymers, molecular crystals, and simple salts; pattern formation is one of the great organizing principles common to all of the sciences. We develop polarization imaging methodologies for the study of complex aggregates and are especially interested in defining heterogeneities and anisotropies of chiroptical properties.

Research    A principal area of research in our group is the design and synthesis of crystalline molecular materials in which the constituents are held together in a lattice by weak, and typically unpredictable, intermolecular interactions. Our goal is to develop and use design principles, based on these interactions, which can be used to direct molecular assembly of molecules into solid-state structures endowed with unique properties, ranging from electronic conductivity to second harmonic generation to high-selectivity enantioselective separations. Our approach relies on the rational adjustment of solid-state structure and properties by deploying the versatility of organic synthesis, sometimes described as \u201ccrystal engineering.\u201d For example, recent efforts in our group have led to the discovery of a novel class of porous molecular frameworks, held together by hydrogen bonding, which are capable of organizing guest molecules in their pores in unusual ways, or trapping molecules selectively to enable otherwise difficult separations. Our group also is synthesizing new organic materials designed for use as materials in field effect transistors.    We also seek to understand the nucleation and growth processes that lead to the formation of molecular crystals such as conducting solids, dyes and pharmaceutical reagents, and proteins. This understanding is crucial for control of crystal characteristics such as polymorphism, size, growth orientation, morphology and defect density, which ultimately affect the properties of these materials. These efforts include (i) the study of surface templates for selective growth of desirable crystalline polymorphs; (ii) elucidating the fundamental principles of epitaxy that govern nucleation of thin films and crystals; (iii) crystallization of organic compounds in nanometer-scale reactors, aimed at understanding the thermodynamic properties of organic nano-sized crystals, control of polymorphism, and discovery of new polymorphs. Our group also employs real-time in situ atomic force microscopy (AFM) for direct visualization of crystal growth at the near-molecular level. These efforts include the study of disease pathways associated with pathological biomineralization, such as the formation of kidney stones, which in most cases are aggregates of calcium-containing crystalline minerals such as calcium oxalate and calcium phosphate. AFM is used to study the effect of macromolecules and proteins on crystal growth, and its force measurement capability is used to probe the molecular-level adhesion properties of the various crystal surfaces, properties that are directly related to the formation of kidney stones.

Research Description   Crystalline polyhedra are prototypical material objects; light is ethereal. Yet, there has been a surprising reciprocity between crystals and light. Polarization and photon entanglement are crystal-optical discoveries while light scattering has been unsurpassed in the characterization of crystals. We engage this dialogue through investigations of unusual crystalline materials that have informed crystal growth mechanisms and led to the design of new optical materials. Recently, we have focused on the interactions of light with organized polycrystals that occur in biopathological structures, high-polymers, molecular crystals, and simple salts; pattern formation is one of the great organizing principles common to all of the sciences. We develop polarization imaging methodologies for the study of complex aggregates and are especially interested in defining heterogeneities and anisotropies of chiroptical properties.
