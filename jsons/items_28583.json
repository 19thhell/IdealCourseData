Babycastles gallery, the NYU Game Center, and the Death By Audio arcade are all showcasing games in public spaces. Many of these galleries are starting to display custom arcade cabinets that are impressive manifestations of these games.\u00a0 In this class, students will use Unity to create a simple multiplayer game that can run on a Windows, Mac, or Linux computer. They will learn to use scripts that will launch this game on startup, and interface with hardware like buttons and joysticks using microcontrollers.\u00a0 In the second half of the class, they will learn how to construct an arcade cabinet with digital fabrication tools like laser cutters, 3D printers, and CNC cutters. The class will culminate in a finished arcade cabinet that displays the game and can run uninterrupted for months in a public venue.     Mechanisms: If It Moves It Breaks   This class is designed to teach the students the joy of making things that move, the pain of watching them fail, and the knowledge they will need to ensure that what they design won\u2019t fail when it\u2019s most important. The students will be introduced to the delightful possibilities of simple machines and fundamental mechanical concepts through examples from the history of kinetic sculpture and interactive art\u2013and quickly encouraged to make their own initial projects. We will share the challenges professional engineers and artists face when making something move and begin to identify and address those challenges. Best practices in designing mechanical systems, determining requirements, prototyping, specifying, resourcing and manufacturing components, and testing will be introduced. We will take apart things. We will put them back together. We will find examples of things that work, and things that have failed. Visiting lecturers and site visits to shops where things are made will put these concepts into a real-world context. Students will also be required to design and build a final project that meets a basic set of requirements determined beforehand in light of what we have learned.   Piecing It Together   Designing and building physical objects can feel like putting together a puzzle without the box top. Even if you have all the pieces, an extra challenge lies in figuring out how they fit together. Digital fabrication tools make it possible to newly imagine and produce pieces that allow us to recreate or modify the \u201cpuzzle\u201d as we see fit. Utilizing historic mechanical equipment (e.g. windmills, clocks, speed governors) as design inspiration, we will explore the possibilities of digital fabrication tools to solve issues of fastening, synchronicity, replaceable parts, repeatability, and modification of existing designs. A central goal of this class is to come to terms, and work productively, with the limitations of these otherwise revolutionary digital fabrication tools\u2014particularly in regards to materials, scale, and aesthetics. By the end of the semester, students will be familiar with Adobe Illustrator, 2D and 3D CAD software, laser cutting, CNC routing, and 3D printing. No prior fabrication or design background is required for this course.   Subtraction   Subtractive fabrication is a common manufacturing process that produces durable and functional objects. This class will cover multiple techniques on machining and milling raw material into custom parts. We will focus on both traditional and digital fabrication tools: lathe, CNC router, 4 axis mill, etc. We will cover CAD, CAM, and machine setups as well as research affordable desktop milling solutions for personal shops. \u00a0The class will be hands on and fabrication heavy, paying close attention to precision, accuracy, and craftsmanship. \u00a0There will be weekly fabrication exercises, assignments, and a final project. It\u2019s mill-er time.     Fall 2014   Circuit Design and Prototyping   This two credit course is designed to teach students the design and fabrication of through-hole and surface mount printed circuit boards. Taking control over the design and fabrication of your circuit can take a project to a whole new level. Students learn to design circuits to optimize the form factor of their projects using EagleCAD, the software used for the mass production of printed circuit boards in engineering standards. The course demonstrates best practices soldering techniques, acid etching, and 3D milling. Students will learn to read and produce schematic diagrams, source components and time manage a prototyping process in order to produce a robust project ready to be reproduced. This course is extremely hands-on and includes weekly assignments, lectures, demos and labs.     Designing for Digital Fabrication   The ability to digitally fabricate parts and whole pieces directly from our computers or design files used to be an exotic and expensive option not really suitable for student or designer projects, but changes in this field in the past 5 years have brought these capabilities much closer to our means, especially as ITP students. ITP and NYU now offer us access to laser cutting, CNC routing, and 3D stereolithography. In this class we will learn how to design for and operate these machines. Emphasis will be put on designing functional parts that can fit into a larger project or support other components as well as being successful on a conceptual and aesthetic level. In this class we will discover methods to design projects on CAD applications for total control of the result, and we will develop algorithmic ways to create designs from software (Processing) to take advantage of the ability to make parts and projects that are unique, customizable, dependent on external data or random. The class will include 3 assignments to create projects using the three machines (laser, router, 3D) and the opportunity to work on a final project.     Introduction to Fabrication   Time to get your hands dirty. Prototypes need to be created, motors have to be mounted, enclosures must be built. Understanding how things are fabricated makes you a better maker. But hardware is hard. You can\u2019t simply copy and paste an object or working device (not yet anyway), fabrication skills and techniques need to be developed and practiced in order to create quality work. You learn to make by doing. In this class you will become familiar and comfortable with all the ITP shop has to offer. We will cover everything from basic hand tools to the beginnings of digital fabrication. You will learn to use the right tool for the job. There will be weekly assignments created to develop your fabrication techniques. There will be in class lectures, demos, and building assignments. Emphasis will be put on good design practices, material choice, and craftsmanship.     Materials and Making Things by Hand   This class helps you to break out of 2-d screen and keyboard thinking and take advantage of the discoveries that inevitably occur when you\u2019re thinking in 3-d by manipulating materials with your hands, observing the results, and refining successive iterations of your idea. From techniques for prototyping and making small objects to fabrication methods for kiosks, you\u2019ll get hands-on experience with a variety of materials and methods. You have an idea for a wearable device? Mock it up with the sewing machine. You\u2019re thinking about a squeezable children\u2019s toy with sensors? Make a mold and cast some sensors inside soft rubber. You want to build an installation? Make a foam core model of the space and get a valuable preview of your project installed. During the course you\u2019ll be introduced to building in a variety of materials. You\u2019ll make objects of wood, foam, plastic, metal, clay, plaster, rubber, paper and fabric. You\u2019ll move a project from sketch to prototype to presentation and learn to incorporate the lessons of the process into your final product. By taking notice of the unexpected your original concept will evolve, and amplified by those revelations it will surprise you and delight your audience.
