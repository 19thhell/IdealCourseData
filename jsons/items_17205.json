The Program      The departments of mathematics and computer science at NYU's     Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences offer a master's     degree in scientific computing. The program provides broad yet     rigorous training in areas of mathematics and computer science     related to scientific computing. It aims to prepare people     with the right talents and background for a technical career     doing practical computing.      The program accommodates both full-time and part-time     students, with most courses meeting in the evening. The     program is self-contained and terminal, providing a complete     set of skills in a field where the need is greater than the     supply. The masters program focuses on computational science,     which includes modeling and numerical simulation as used in     engineering design, development, and optimization.           During the academic years of 2012 and 2013 a concentration in     data sciences existed within the scientific computing program;     this concentration has been discontinued as of 2014. Incoming     students interested in data sciences should consider the     recently-created Masters              of Science in Data Science within the NYU Center for Data     Science .           Starting Fall of 2014 the modified the program requirements     and guidelines listed below will apply to all incoming     students. The new list of required/approved courses includes     the previous list but gives additional flexibility for     students to tailor the list of courses to their background and     interests.

Scientific Computing:     Overview           Scientific computing is an indispensable part of almost all     scientific investigation and technological development at     universities, government laboratories, and within the private     sector. Typically a scientific computing team consists of     several people trained in some branch of mathematics, science,     statistics, or engineering. What is often lacking is expertise     in modern computing tools such as visualization, modern     programming paradigms, and high performance computing. The     master's program in scientific computing aims to satisfy these     needs, without omitting basic training in numerical analysis     and computer science. Many graduates of this program work at     technologically advanced institutions, especially in research     and development, where their skills and experience complement     those without interdisciplinary degrees. The program is also     open to students who will go on to pursue doctoral studies in     computer science, mathematics, or statistics.      The master's program in scientific computing focuses on the     mathematics and computer science related to advanced computer     modeling and simulation. The program is similar in structure     to terminal master's programs in engineering, combining     classroom training with practical experience. The coursework     ranges from foundational mathematics and fundamental     algorithms to such practical topics as data visualization and     software tools. Electives encourage the exploration of     specific application areas such as mathematical and     statistical finance, applications of machine learning, fluid     mechanics, finite element methods, and biomedical modeling.     The program culminates in a master's project, which serves to     integrate the classroom material.           Admission Requirements      The program requires least three semesters of Calculus     (including multivariate calculus), as well as linear algebra.     Experience with programming in a high-level language (e.g.,     Java, C, C++, Fortran. Python) as well as data structures,     equivalent to a first-year sequence in computer science,      is also required. It is highly desirable that applicants have     undergraduate major or significant experience in mathematics,     a quantitative science or engineering, or economics.      The deadline for application to the program is April 1st for     the fall semester. The program admits students both on a     full-time and on a part-time basis.

They must also obtain 3 points from a master's    capstone project.          The Capstone Project      The master's program culminates in a capstone project. The     capstone project course is usually taken during the final year     of study. During the project, students go through the entire     process of solving a real-world problem, from collecting and     processing data to designing and fully implementing a     solution. The problems and data sets come from settings     identical to those encountered in industry, academia, or     government.           The following is a list of courses approved to meet the     capstone requirement:             MATH-GA.2011/ CSCI-GA.2945      Advanced topics: Data Science      CSCI-GA Advanced Topics: High-Performance Computing      DS-GA-1006 Capstone Project in Data Science      CSCI-GA Advanced Computer Graphics      CSCI-GA Multicore Processors: Architecture     &amp;Programming      CSCI-GA Software Engineering           Advanced students can obtain permission from the director of     the program to do an individual capstone project under the     supervision of a faculty member.

Concentration in Data     Science     This section is meant only for students presently enrolled in    the Data Science concentration; this concentration is no longer    offered. To graduate, students enrolled in the old concentration    are required to take the following core courses     in mathematics for the concentration in data science:                One of           MATH-GA              2962 Mathematical Statistics (spring semester),      DS-GA-1001 Introduction to Data Science (fall), or           DS-GA-1002 Statistical and Mathematical Methods                and either            MATH-GA              2043 Scientific Computing (fall and spring     semesters)                or both            MATH-GA              2010 Numerical Methods I (fall semester) and            MATH-GA              2020 Numerical Methods II (spring semester)           The following are the three required core courses      in computer science for the concentration in data science:            CSCI-GA              1170 Fundamental Algorithms (fall, spring and     summer terms)       CSCI-GA              3033 Open Source Tools (fall term)          and one of           CSCI-GA              2565 Machine Learning (fall term), or      DS-GA-1003 Machine Learning and Computational Statistics     (spring)          Students in the concentration in data science must complete 33    points points of course credit (11 courses), including core and    elective courses. They must also obtain 3 points from a master's    capstone project.          The Capstone Project      The master's program culminates in a capstone project. The     capstone project course is usually taken during the final year     of study. During the project, students go through the entire     process of solving a real-world problem, from collecting and     processing data to designing and fully implementing a     solution. The problems and data sets come from settings     identical to those encountered in industry, academia, or     government.           The following is a list of courses approved to meet the     capstone requirement:             MATH-GA.2011/ CSCI-GA.2945      Advanced topics: Data Science      CSCI-GA Advanced Topics: High-Performance Computing      DS-GA-1006 Capstone Project in Data Science      CSCI-GA Advanced Computer Graphics      CSCI-GA Multicore Processors: Architecture     &amp;Programming      CSCI-GA Software Engineering           Advanced students can obtain permission from the director of     the program to do an individual capstone project under the     supervision of a faculty member.                Computing Facilities      The Courant Institute makes available for graduate training     and coursework a network of workstations maintained by systems     administrators. All graduate students have computer accounts     for the duration of their studies. NYU also runs a     high-performance computing center with both shared-memory and     distributed-memory computers.

Yap  Denis Zorin     Researchers in Computer Graphics work on computational and mathematical techniques for creating and manipulating computer representations of real and virtual objects and making images of such objects. The main directions of computer graphics research at NYU include animation, geometric modeling, physically-based simulation and computational photography.    The area of Computer Vision is concerned with algorithms and theory necessary to extract information from visual data (images, video, range scans, stereo images, 3D MRI and CAT scan data etc). There is a growing overlap between computer vision and vision research, as the data acquired from images and video is increasingly used in computer graphics applications.    Rob Fergus works in computer vision, machine learning and computer graphics. His goal is to build statistical models of images both at the high level of objects and scenes as well as at the low level of pixels and edges. Such models may then be used for a variety of applications including object recognition, image search and computational photography.    Davi Geiger works in computer vision and on related problems in cognitive science. His current research includes understanding stereo vision, human tracking, shape analysis, and memory structure of vision objects. Much of recent is based on applying Bayesian belief propagation networks (graphical models).    Yann LeCun 's research interests include the fundamental and practical aspects of machine learning. The main goal of his research is to devise methods through which computers can extract knowledge and automatically acquire \"skills\" from massive datasets or from experience. Application of learning to perception is a central theme of his work: how can we teach machines to detect and recognize everyday objects in images, how to teach robots to navigate and avoid obstacles solely from visual input. LeCun's group works on a number of fundamental techniques (energy-based models, \"deep learning\", relational graphical models, and others) which are applied solve problems in computer vision, robotics, image and signal processing, bioinformatics, medical informatics, and economics. LeCun's group also works with the Center for Neural Science on computational models of biological learning.    Ken Perlin 's research spans computer graphics rendering, modeling and animation, user interface software and hardware, surface reflectance measurement devices, and novel display devices. His recent research projects include a collaboration with the New York Hall of Science on creating large scale collaborative educational interfaces for kids, uses of novel interfaces (camera-tracked LED pointers and the Nintendo WiiMote game interface) for collaboration and instruction, and a kaleidoscope-based reflectance measuring device for rapid acquisition of surface reflection functions.    Chee Yap works in the areas of computational geometry, algebraic computation and visualization. His current research focuses on two themes: exact arithmetic computation and large-scale visualization. Numerical nonrobustness has been called \"computer scientists' dirty secret\" --everyone knows that our numerical software can break, but we rarely talk about it. The most successful approach to solving the robustness problem in geometry is based on exact geometric computation. Chee Yap and his group are developing techniques for this type of computation based on algebraic zero bounds. Exact geometric computation provides considerable insight into the theory of real computation. The other direction of Chee Yap's work is large-scale visualization, dynamic visualization of geospatial data in particular.    Denis Zorin 's interests span two areas: geometric modeling, with applications in computer graphics and computer-aided geometric design, and scientific computing and numerical algorithms. In geometric modeling, he works on efficient and accurate discretizations of various types of surface optimization problems, high-order representations for surfaces, including manifold-based and subdivision surfaces and applications to interactive surface and mesh manipulation. In numeral algorithms, he is interested in fast algorithms for solving boundary integral equations, arising from linear PDEs and their applications. Current efforts include a a general fast multipole-based solver for 3D nonhomogeneous PDEs and arbitrary geometries, and on fluid-deformable surface interactions for Stokes fluid.

Please note that this     process can take several weeks. We cannot guarantee a decision     date; you will be contacted by the Graduate School when an     admission decision has been made on your application. If you     have any questions and concerns regarding your application,     please contact the Math Department at admissions@math.nyu.edu .                The Program      The departments of mathematics and computer science at NYU's     Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences offer a master's     degree in scientific computing. The program provides broad yet     rigorous training in areas of mathematics and computer science     related to scientific computing. It aims to prepare people     with the right talents and background for a technical career     doing practical computing.      The program accommodates both full-time and part-time     students, with most courses meeting in the evening. The     program is self-contained and terminal, providing a complete     set of skills in a field where the need is greater than the     supply. The masters program focuses on computational science,     which includes modeling and numerical simulation as used in     engineering design, development, and optimization.           During the academic years of 2012 and 2013 a concentration in     data sciences existed within the scientific computing program;     this concentration has been discontinued as of 2014. Incoming     students interested in data sciences should consider the     recently-created Masters              of Science in Data Science within the NYU Center for Data     Science .           Starting Fall of 2014 the modified the program requirements     and guidelines listed below will apply to all incoming     students. The new list of required/approved courses includes     the previous list but gives additional flexibility for     students to tailor the list of courses to their background and     interests. Students presently enrolled in the Modeling and     Simulation track can choose to complete the program either     under the new or the old requirements. Students enrolled in     the Data Science concentration should consult the expanded     course options and modified requirements below since this     increases flexibility while maintaining consistency with the     previous requirements. These students should contact Professor     Esteban Tabak for help     in deciding on classes to take.                Scientific Computing:     Overview           Scientific computing is an indispensable part of almost all     scientific investigation and technological development at     universities, government laboratories, and within the private     sector. Typically a scientific computing team consists of     several people trained in some branch of mathematics, science,     statistics, or engineering. What is often lacking is expertise     in modern computing tools such as visualization, modern     programming paradigms, and high performance computing. The     master's program in scientific computing aims to satisfy these     needs, without omitting basic training in numerical analysis     and computer science. Many graduates of this program work at     technologically advanced institutions, especially in research     and development, where their skills and experience complement     those without interdisciplinary degrees. The program is also     open to students who will go on to pursue doctoral studies in     computer science, mathematics, or statistics.      The master's program in scientific computing focuses on the     mathematics and computer science related to advanced computer     modeling and simulation. The program is similar in structure     to terminal master's programs in engineering, combining     classroom training with practical experience. The coursework     ranges from foundational mathematics and fundamental     algorithms to such practical topics as data visualization and     software tools. Electives encourage the exploration of     specific application areas such as mathematical and     statistical finance, applications of machine learning, fluid     mechanics, finite element methods, and biomedical modeling.     The program culminates in a master's project, which serves to     integrate the classroom material.           Admission Requirements      The program requires least three semesters of Calculus     (including multivariate calculus), as well as linear algebra.     Experience with programming in a high-level language (e.g.,     Java, C, C++, Fortran. Python) as well as data structures,     equivalent to a first-year sequence in computer science,      is also required. It is highly desirable that applicants have     undergraduate major or significant experience in mathematics,     a quantitative science or engineering, or economics.      The deadline for application to the program is April 1st for     the fall semester. The program admits students both on a     full-time and on a part-time basis.

Students should consult these lists of course offerings to    determine the availability of desired courses.     Concentration in Data     Science     This section is meant only for students presently enrolled in    the Data Science concentration; this concentration is no longer    offered. To graduate, students enrolled in the old concentration    are required to take the following core courses     in mathematics for the concentration in data science:                One of           MATH-GA              2962 Mathematical Statistics (spring semester),      DS-GA-1001 Introduction to Data Science (fall), or           DS-GA-1002 Statistical and Mathematical Methods                and either            MATH-GA              2043 Scientific Computing (fall and spring     semesters)                or both            MATH-GA              2010 Numerical Methods I (fall semester) and            MATH-GA              2020 Numerical Methods II (spring semester)           The following are the three required core courses      in computer science for the concentration in data science:            CSCI-GA              1170 Fundamental Algorithms (fall, spring and     summer terms)       CSCI-GA              3033 Open Source Tools (fall term)          and one of           CSCI-GA              2565 Machine Learning (fall term), or      DS-GA-1003 Machine Learning and Computational Statistics     (spring)          Students in the concentration in data science must complete 33    points points of course credit (11 courses), including core and    elective courses. They must also obtain 3 points from a master's    capstone project.          The Capstone Project      The master's program culminates in a capstone project. The     capstone project course is usually taken during the final year     of study. During the project, students go through the entire     process of solving a real-world problem, from collecting and     processing data to designing and fully implementing a     solution. The problems and data sets come from settings     identical to those encountered in industry, academia, or     government.           The following is a list of courses approved to meet the     capstone requirement:             MATH-GA.2011/ CSCI-GA.2945      Advanced topics: Data Science      CSCI-GA Advanced Topics: High-Performance Computing      DS-GA-1006 Capstone Project in Data Science      CSCI-GA Advanced Computer Graphics      CSCI-GA Multicore Processors: Architecture     &amp;Programming      CSCI-GA Software Engineering           Advanced students can obtain permission from the director of     the program to do an individual capstone project under the     supervision of a faculty member.                Computing Facilities      The Courant Institute makes available for graduate training     and coursework a network of workstations maintained by systems     administrators. All graduate students have computer accounts     for the duration of their studies. NYU also runs a     high-performance computing center with both shared-memory and     distributed-memory computers.

Academic Standards      To register for courses, students must maintain good academic     standing, fulfilling the following requirements:           Students must maintain an average of B or better over     their first twelve credits. Students who fail to achieve     this cannot continue in the master's program.      Students cannot obtain a master's degree unless they have     maintained an overall average of B or better. Students at     risk of failing to meet this requirement receive a warning     letter from the department.      Students cannot obtain more than four no-credit grades,     withdrawals, or unresolved incomplete grades during their     academic tenure, and no more than two such grades in the     first six courses for which they have registered.          Up to two core courses taken elsewhere can earn transfer credit,    subject to the normal NYU graduate school restrictions on    transfer of credit and the approval of the program director. At    least 30 credits must be taken at NYU.

Yap  Denis Zorin     Researchers in Computer Graphics work on computational and mathematical techniques for creating and manipulating computer representations of real and virtual objects and making images of such objects. The main directions of computer graphics research at NYU include animation, geometric modeling, physically-based simulation and computational photography.    The area of Computer Vision is concerned with algorithms and theory necessary to extract information from visual data (images, video, range scans, stereo images, 3D MRI and CAT scan data etc). There is a growing overlap between computer vision and vision research, as the data acquired from images and video is increasingly used in computer graphics applications.    Rob Fergus works in computer vision, machine learning and computer graphics. His goal is to build statistical models of images both at the high level of objects and scenes as well as at the low level of pixels and edges. Such models may then be used for a variety of applications including object recognition, image search and computational photography.    Davi Geiger works in computer vision and on related problems in cognitive science. His current research includes understanding stereo vision, human tracking, shape analysis, and memory structure of vision objects. Much of recent is based on applying Bayesian belief propagation networks (graphical models).    Yann LeCun 's research interests include the fundamental and practical aspects of machine learning. The main goal of his research is to devise methods through which computers can extract knowledge and automatically acquire \"skills\" from massive datasets or from experience. Application of learning to perception is a central theme of his work: how can we teach machines to detect and recognize everyday objects in images, how to teach robots to navigate and avoid obstacles solely from visual input. LeCun's group works on a number of fundamental techniques (energy-based models, \"deep learning\", relational graphical models, and others) which are applied solve problems in computer vision, robotics, image and signal processing, bioinformatics, medical informatics, and economics. LeCun's group also works with the Center for Neural Science on computational models of biological learning.    Ken Perlin 's research spans computer graphics rendering, modeling and animation, user interface software and hardware, surface reflectance measurement devices, and novel display devices. His recent research projects include a collaboration with the New York Hall of Science on creating large scale collaborative educational interfaces for kids, uses of novel interfaces (camera-tracked LED pointers and the Nintendo WiiMote game interface) for collaboration and instruction, and a kaleidoscope-based reflectance measuring device for rapid acquisition of surface reflection functions.    Chee Yap works in the areas of computational geometry, algebraic computation and visualization. His current research focuses on two themes: exact arithmetic computation and large-scale visualization. Numerical nonrobustness has been called \"computer scientists' dirty secret\" --everyone knows that our numerical software can break, but we rarely talk about it. The most successful approach to solving the robustness problem in geometry is based on exact geometric computation. Chee Yap and his group are developing techniques for this type of computation based on algebraic zero bounds. Exact geometric computation provides considerable insight into the theory of real computation. The other direction of Chee Yap's work is large-scale visualization, dynamic visualization of geospatial data in particular.    Denis Zorin 's interests span two areas: geometric modeling, with applications in computer graphics and computer-aided geometric design, and scientific computing and numerical algorithms. In geometric modeling, he works on efficient and accurate discretizations of various types of surface optimization problems, high-order representations for surfaces, including manifold-based and subdivision surfaces and applications to interactive surface and mesh manipulation. In numeral algorithms, he is interested in fast algorithms for solving boundary integral equations, arising from linear PDEs and their applications. Current efforts include a a general fast multipole-based solver for 3D nonhomogeneous PDEs and arbitrary geometries, and on fluid-deformable surface interactions for Stokes fluid.
