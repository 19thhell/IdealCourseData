With response by Elizabeth Castelli (Barnard).          In this evocative ethnography, Omri Elisha examines the hopes, frustrations, and activist strategies of American evangelical Christians as they engage socially with local communities. Focusing on two Tennessee megachurches, Moral Ambition reaches beyond political controversies over issues such as abortion, same-sex marriage, and public prayer to highlight the ways that evangelicals at the grassroots of the Christian Right promote faith-based causes intended to improve the state of social welfare. The book shows how these ministries both help churchgoers embody religious virtues and create provocative new opportunities for evangelism on a public scale.

With response by Elizabeth Castelli (Barnard).          In this evocative ethnography, Omri Elisha examines the hopes, frustrations, and activist strategies of American evangelical Christians as they engage socially with local communities. Focusing on two Tennessee megachurches, Moral Ambition reaches beyond political controversies over issues such as abortion, same-sex marriage, and public prayer to highlight the ways that evangelicals at the grassroots of the Christian Right promote faith-based causes intended to improve the state of social welfare. The book shows how these ministries both help churchgoers embody religious virtues and create provocative new opportunities for evangelism on a public scale.

With response by Elizabeth Castelli (Barnard).          In this evocative ethnography, Omri Elisha examines the hopes, frustrations, and activist strategies of American evangelical Christians as they engage socially with local communities. Focusing on two Tennessee megachurches, Moral Ambition reaches beyond political controversies over issues such as abortion, same-sex marriage, and public prayer to highlight the ways that evangelicals at the grassroots of the Christian Right promote faith-based causes intended to improve the state of social welfare. The book shows how these ministries both help churchgoers embody religious virtues and create provocative new opportunities for evangelism on a public scale.

Thursday, Oct. 27th 6:30pm - 8pm          Amy Alexander          Author of Uncovering Race: A Black Journalist Story of Reporting and Reinvention                  &ldquo;Amy Alexander writes with the precision of the seasoned journalist she is and the expansiveness of the wise cultural critic she has become. Her book is at once a trenchant look at the competitive world of the highest reaches of journalism and an on-the-ground narrative of the transformations in the ways we understand race, identity, and work. Her experience is unique, but her perspective is universal.&rdquo;&#9472;Henry Louis Gates Jr.          Co Sponsored by -- The Nation Institute                                                            Monday, Oct. 31st 6:30 - 8:30pm          Literary New York Halloween Party         Free refreshments, surprises, signing and spooks!
