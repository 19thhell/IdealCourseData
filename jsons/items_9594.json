You can also subscribe to Rimasun via iTunes , via another service , and via email . CLACS is excited to collaborate with Quechua and Kichwa speakers in the NYC area to produce Rimasun , a free audio series featuring conversations and interviews entirely in the Quechua and Kichwa languages. In these audio recordings and podcasts, participants are invited to share personal narratives about their families, homes, childhood, hobbies and interests. Our presenters are Quechua language teachers, students, native speakers, heritage speakers and second-language speakers. This series is supported by the Center for Latin American and Caribbean Studies (CLACS) at NYU, and made available through the CLACS blog . While Rimasun relies primarily on Cuzque\u00f1an Quechua, as this is the Quechua presently taught in language courses at NYU, we welcome speakers of all Quechua/Kichwa dialects and languages to enjoy and participate in this inclusive series.    Rimasun is shaped by several goals. The main purpose of this project is to engage speakers and learners of the NYC area in using the Quechua and Kichwa languages. We hope that this series brings people together to celebrate Quechua/Kichwa languages and cultures. We also aim to create a network of Quechua speakers and learners that extends outside the NYU campus and engages with the greater New York City area and beyond. It is our hope that Rimasun joins the many other global initiatives seeking to foster a greater understanding of and respect for these languages and cultures. Rimasun is part of the CLACS Quechua Program, which also includes Quechua classes at the university level, free, online Quechua lessons, and Quechua Conversation Nights, which are free and open to the public. There is no use of English or Spanish in Rimasun podcasts. This series provides intermediate to advanced Quechua speakers the opportunity to expand their listening and comprehension skills as well as learn about various topics through presentations in Quechua. If you are new to the language and would like more basic instruction, please utilize the online Quechua Lessons developed by CLACS and hosted on our website.    Rimasun Production Team Producer   Collaborative media projects have long been a source of interest for Rimasun producer Christine Mladic Janney. After earning degrees in studio photography and literature from the University of Illinois, Christine moved to Santiago de Chile to work with VEGlobal. There she developed OJOS nuevos, a participatory photography program for women living in youth shelters. It was this experience that inspired her to begin studying how photography enters and affects daily life. While pursuing an MA in Latin American and Caribbean Studies at CLACS at NYU, Christine researched everyday photographic practices in Cusco, Peru, and studied the Quechua language supported by FLAS fellowships. From 2010-2012, as Program Coordinator at CLACS, she managed communications and helped support the Quechua language program. Christine began collaborating with NYC-area Quechua speakers, and published the first Rimasun podcast in September 2011. In the Fall 2012, she entered the PhD program in Anthropology at NYU, as well as the Program in Culture and Media, where she continues to investigate how Quechua-speakers incorporate photographic technologies into social and personal projects. Christine is also directing two short films about Quechua language speakers in New York City. Assistant Producer (2014 - 2015) Gladys Camacho is an MA student at CLACS, focusing on linguistics and social aspects of Quechua and other indigenous groups in the Andes. She is also interested in creating new materials for teaching Quechua language. She is a native Quechua speaker from the Anzaldo region in Cochabamba, Bolivia. She has a BA in Applied Linguistics from the Unviersity of San Sim\u00f3n in Bolivia. After pursuing two professional courses she wrote the novella \u201cPhuyup Yawar Waqaynin,\u201d which can be translated as \u201cThe Cloud\u2019s Blood Red Tear.\u201d In 2011, she taught Spanish in Lille, France. In Fall 2013, Gladys was a Visiting Scholar to the NYU Department of Linguistics, and became active with NYU Quechua outreach activities. Before coming back to New York for her MA, she taught Quechua at the \u201cQuechua Indigenous University\u201d in Chimor\u00e9, Bolivia. As a member of the Quechua Outreach Committee, she helps to produce and promote Quechua Night events and other initiatives.    Assistant Producer (2013 - 2014) Charlie is a native of New York City and earned a BA in Latin American Studies at New York University where he also minored in Social and Public Policy in 2013. As the recipient of a 2012 Summer FLAS Charlie traveled to Cusco, Peru where he studied Intensive Quechua. As an undergraduate, Charlie completed all levels of Quechua language study offered at NYU. Currently, as the recipient of a 2013-2014 Academic Year FLAS, he is pursuing a Master's degree at CLACS and is the only student enrolled in an Advanced level Quechua course under Professor Odi Gonzales. In the summer of 2014 Charlie plans to travel to Ecuador and learn the northern variant of Quechua, Kichwa. He plans to utilize Kichwa to identify the needs and create resources for the local Kichwa speaking migrant community in New York City. He has been a member of the Runa Simi Outreach Committee (ROC) since its inception in 2011 and is currently an Assistant Producer for Rimasun, CLACS\u2019s Quechua podcast series. He also currently works at CLACS as a Quechua Associate.      Assistant Producer (2013 - 2014) Doris Loayza is a second year student in MA at CLACS, focusing on Andean and Quechua culture. She speaks Quechua from her native Ancash region in Peru, and is now studying Quechua Cuzque\u00f1o with Odi Gonzalez. She was a recipient of a Tinker Field Research Grant for her thesis research about radio programs in Quechua in the Ayacucho region of Peru, where young Quechua speakers are producing radio shows in their native language. Doris is a contributor editor to Peripheria, a multimedia magazine about Andean culture in Ancash, where she is expecting to start a digital archive of Quechua ancashino. As a member of the Quechua Outreach Committe, she helps produce and promote Quechua Night events. Doris also works as a freelance court interpreter of Quechua for Queens County Court. Doris also plays zampo\u00f1a with the New York-based Andean music group Hijos de la Gran Puna!      Assistant Producer (2012 - 2013) Emily Thompson graduated with a BA in Latin American and Latino/a Studies from Vassar College in 2009 with concentrations on social movements and visual anthropology. After graduating, Emily enrolled in an intensive digital video production program at UC Berkeley before traveling to Huancayo, Peru to study Quechua on the Cornelisen Fellowship for 10 months. Before returning to New York to pursue her Masters at the Center for Latin American and Caribbean Studies, Emily worked for a non profit focused on promoting community engagement in the Bay Area, where she continued collaborative work through social media, digital video and photography initiatives. As a FLAS funded Quechua fellow at NYU Emily is researching the use of photography in memory projects in Peru as well as the rise of hip hop to reinvigorate the Quechua language across generations. Emily is excited about learning new media to explore and promote the Quechua language and culture here in the New York area as Rimasun celebrates its first anniversary this fall.       Call for Participants    We are always looking for volunteers who would like to use their Quechua language skills and knowledge to contribute to the series and become a part of our network. We also welcome comments and suggestions. Please contact us if you know of a topic or person who we might be able to feature in our project.
