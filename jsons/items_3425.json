We work with two premises: (1) race must be understood in relation to other identity categories: gender, class, sexuality, ethnicity, and so on, and (2) race is expressed in both obvious and subtle ways; thus, racial identity is implicit as well as explicitly expressed. We also consider whether race must necessarily be understood as stigma; discuss nonfiction, fiction, and films; and may visit public exhibitions.    Reimagining Community: Race, Nation, and the Politics of Belonging    ANTH-UA 325 Identical to SCA-UA 200. Prerequisite: Human Society and Culture (ANTH-UA 1) or permission of the instructor. D\u00e1vila. 4 points.   Critically examines and evaluates the various approaches to studying and interpreting different community formations. Examines different notions of \"community\" through a variety of disciplinary lenses. Readings are drawn from anthropology, history, feminist studies, cultural studies, ethnic studies, and philosophy.

Bilingual students are encouraged to focus on cases that use interpreters.    Gender, Violence, and the Law    ANTH-UA 330 Prerequisite: Human Society and Culture (ANTH-UA 1) or permission of the instructor. Merry. 4 points.   Examines the global prevalence of gender violence and the varied meanings of violence against women and changes in terminology over time. Examines ways of theorizing gender and violence, including performative ideas of gender. The creation of gender violence as a social problem is a product of social movements in the United States, Europe, India, and many other parts of the world. It is now understood globally as an important human rights violation. Also examines the forms of intervention that have been developed in the United States and globally for diminishing violence against women, including policing, prosecution, and punishment.    Human Rights and Culture    ANTH-UA 331 Prerequisite: Human Society and Culture (ANTH-UA 1) or permission of the instructor. Merry. 4 points.   Offers an overview of the human rights system, looking at its basic elements and studying how it works. Focuses on the relationships between human rights and culture. Human rights campaigns frequently encounter resistance in the name of protecting cultural differences. This is particularly common with issues concerning women, children, and the family. Explores several issues that raise questions of human rights and culture, such as female genital cutting, honor killing, trafficking of persons, and indigenous peoples' rights to culture. Using these examples, considers how the human rights system deals with tensions between global standards and local ways of life. Examines the meanings of rights and of culture in these debates and shows the implications of adopting an anthropological analysis of these situations. The goal of the course is developing an understanding of human rights in practice.    Body, Gender, and Belief in China    ANTH-UA 350 Identical to RELST-UA 350.

Discusses changing roles of nation-states and the growing significance of transnational, diasporic, and globalized social relations and cultural forms.    Culture Through Food    ANTH-UA 410 Prerequisite: Human Society and Culture (ANTH-UA 1) or permission of the instructor. Abercrombie, Rogers. 4 points.   Explores some of the ways that people use food, cuisines, and eating to organize and engage with social worlds. This focus provides a concrete means for deepening our understanding of alternative models of social explanation. Drawing on ethnographic material from a wide range of cultures, as well as feature films and our own observations and interviews, we consider topics such as the material dimensions of food production, distribution, and consumption (e.g., how food scarcity or abundance shapes collective possibilities, expectations, and values; the causes, consequences, forms, and myths of globalization) and the cultural meanings and social distinctions encoded in food practices (e.g., how food is used cross-culturally as a marker of social identity\u2014class, gender, and ethnicity\u2014and as a source of meaning\u2014nostalgia, anxiety, and so on). Formations of Indigeneity ANTH-UA 605 Formerly ANTH-UA 320. Prerequisite: Human Society and Culture (ANTH-UA 1) or equivalent. Offered every other year. 4 points. Through a case study of materials concerning indigenous people in Australia and North America, this course will investigate the consequences (cultural, sociological, policy) of a development that has taken place throughout the world. Many of the peoples in whom anthropologists have long been interested\u2013those organized into small-scale societies, kinship based\u2013have been encapsulated as indigenous minorities within nation states dominated by other cultural traditions. In this context, the capacity and practices of these peoples, who some have characterized as \u201cFourth World peoples,\u201d to reproduce themselves and their traditions in their own terms has been limited, undermined, co-opted and, on occasion, ironically reinforced.      Roma in East Central Europe   ANTH-UA 9200 Offered at NYU Prague. 4 points.   Introduces students to the development of Romany politics and culture from a persecuted minority to the emergence of Romany organizations, with an emphasis on Central and Eastern Europe.

Barbarian Europe    ANTH-UA 217 Prerequisite: Archaeology: Early Societies and Cultures (ANTH-UA 3) or permission of the instructor. Crabtree. 4 points.   Between the end of the Ice Age and the expansion of the Roman Empire, temperate Europe witnessed a series of social and economic transformations that represented a transition from a hunting and gathering way of life to urban chiefdoms. Along the way, these hunter-gatherers became agriculturalists and stockherders, learned to use metals, and developed social structures as complex as any found in Old World civilizations. Examines changes in later prehistoric Europe from about 8000 B.C.E. to the arrival of the Romans.    African Archaeology    ANTH-UA 218 Prerequisite: Archaeology: Early Societies and Cultures (ANTH-UA 3). Tryon. 4 points.   With the longest record of human occupation in the world and a landmass that represents more than one-fifth the habitable area of the globe, Africa plays a central role in our understanding of human evolution, the prehistory of our species, and the development of complex societies. Explores the experiences of ancient human populations in Africa using evidence drawn from archaeology as well as history, ethnography, linguistics, art history, geography, geology, paleontology, biology, and other disciplines. Focuses not only on the material evidence from across the continent and its interpretation, but also an understanding of the major questions, developing methods of inquiry and problem solving, and situating the African data in the broader context of the archaeological evidence for the evolution of human behavioral diversity. The scope of the course spans hominin origins, the study of Stone Age foragers of the first 2.5 million years of human prehistory, and more recent periods characterized by food production, metallurgy, sedentism, and the development of complex societies (e.g., in Egypt, Mali, Zimbabwe, and the East African coast) with influence and contacts across and outside the continent.    Discovering Archaeology in New York City    ANTH-UA 225 Wright. 4 points.   In this course, New York City is our archaeological site. The period covered is from 10,000 years ago to the beginning of the 20th century and is based on archaeological remains. Its history is both fascinating and mind-expanding as a different perspective on the city emerges in time and space from what is learned. Walking around its various boroughs, students learn that our modern landscape is vastly different from that of earlier eras. Along with our gains as a major cultural center, we will assess some losses brought about by the destruction of aspects of the city\u2019s past. In particular, students come to understand the meaning of stewardship in the context of urban development. At the same time, viewing our place in the city\u2019s 10,000 years of history gives us a deeper sense of time and place and a unity in its shared heritage. Last Hunters-First Farmers ANTH-UA 608 Prerequisite: Archaeology: Early Societies and Cultures (ANTH-UA 3) or instructor permission. Offered every two years. 4 points. Last   Hunters-First Farmers explores the transition from foraging to   agriculture throughout the Eastern Hemisphere and the Americas. The   course begins with a review of the theories that have been proposed to   explain the transition from hunting to gathering to farming and the   archaeological methods that have been used to explore this question. The   archaeological evidence for the beginnings of farming in various   regions of the world is then explored in greater detail in order to   understand the specific reasons for the transition from foraging to   farming and the consequences of the adoption of agriculture.

Primate Behavior and Ecology    ANTH-UA 54 Prerequisite: Human Evolution (ANTH-UA 2) or permission of the instructor. Higham. 4 points.   Why do some primates live in large social groups while others are solitary and yet others live in pairs or cooperatively breeding families? Why are strong social hierarchies seen in some primate taxa but not in others? How do multiple species of primates often manage to coexist in the same habitat? Why are social relationships in some primate species characterized by strong bonds among females while such bonds are absent in other primate societies? Why do some species of primates show marked geographic variability in behavior and social structure? The answers to these and other questions lie in understanding the relationships between each species and its ecological and social setting and in understanding each species' phylogenetic history. Explores the diversity of primate social systems and the evolutionary relationships among the primates and discusses many of the general ecological laws that have been proposed by evolutionary biologists as the keys to understanding important features of primate behavior and ecology.    Health and Disease in Human Evolution    ANTH-UA 55 Prerequisite: Human Evolution (ANTH-UA 2) or permission of the instructor. Ant\u00f3n, Disotell. 4 points.    Examines human health and disease within an ecological framework, exploring the interactions  of environmental, genetic, physiological, and cultural factors in the expression and distribution of human diseases. Develops pathology profiles for nonhuman primates; prehistoric human populations; and hunting and gathering, agricultural, and industrial groups, with emphasis on the expression of infectious disease in human history and newly (re)emerging diseases.    Comparative Biology of the Living Primates    ANTH-UA 56 Prerequisite: Human Evolution (ANTH-UA 2) or permission of the instructor. Harrison, Williams. 4 points.   Study of the comparative biology of the primates, our closest living relatives, is fundamental to a sound understanding of human biology and evolution. Surveys the comparative anatomy of the living primates from a structural, functional, and evolutionary perspective. Different anatomical systems and behaviors are explored, including external features, the cranium, dentition and dietary behavior, postcranial anatomy and locomotor behavior, sensory and nervous systems, and reproductive anatomy. The role of comparative anatomy in taxonomy, behavioral studies, and phylogenetic analyses is emphasized. Primate Communication ANTH-UA 57 Identical to ANST-UA 257. Prerequisite: Human Evolution (ANTH-UA 2). Offered periodically. 4 points. Increased   social and communicative complexity is one of the defining features of   humans compared to other mammals. Key insights into the evolution of   human communication can come from studying our most closely related   extant relatives, our fellow members of the Primate order. The present   course features a mixture of lectures and discussion classes to consider   contemporary topics in primate (including human) communication. Topics   covered include definitions of communication and consideration of its   major theoretical issues such as the difference between signals and   cues, signal honesty, and concepts of signal information content and   evolutionary signal design. Sections of the class focus on communication   in different sensory modalities\u2014olfactory, auditory, and visual, as   well as multimodal communication\u2014before discussing theories and issues   related to the evolution of language. The class finishes by considering   some of the most contemporary topics in primate communication.    Emerging Diseases    ANTH-UA 80 Disotell, Harrison. 4 points.   Integrates evolutionary biology, genetics, immunology, ecology, and behavioral ecology, along with sociocultural anthropology, politics, and economics, to better understand newly emerging and reemerging diseases as they affect human health.

But they are just as strongly encouraged to complement this work with courses offering other approaches to their study abroad setting: its language, history, literature, politics, art, etc. Students should seriously take account of these offerings in cognate fields when making their study abroad choices. When Should I Go? There is no general rule about the best semester for anthropology majors to study abroad, but individual circumstances--aiming to participate in the Honors Program in Anthropology, for example--may affect optimal timing. Students are encouraged to consult with the Anthropology Department Director of Undergraduate Studies early in their planning.  Biological Anthropology and Archaeology At present, no courses in these subfields are offered at NYU study abroad sites. Students specializing in biological anthropology have often taken advantage of the general science offerings at NYU in London (especially during sophomore year) to advance in their major. Students most interested in archaeology have generally found it useful to enroll in summer field schools outside of NYU offerings. They are strongly advised to consult well in advance with their archaeology professors and the Anthropology Department Director of Undergraduate Studies for advice on recommended programs, course credits, and funding possibilities.  Applying to Study Abroad To learn more about Study Abroad, students are encouraged to attend one of  NYU Global Programs' weekly information sessions held every Friday during the  school year.

Race, \"Difference,\" and Social Inequality      ANTH-UA 323 Identical to SCA-UA 323. Prerequisite: Human Society and Culture (ANTH-UA 1) or permission of the instructor. Khan. 4 points.   Human beings have always grappled with some notion of identity, asking questions about who they are, about who others distinguished from themselves are, and about the ways that perceived similarities and differences are meaningful and important (or not) in social relationships. Examines how historical, social, and cultural contexts shape the forms that identities take, looking in particular at ideas about race and racial identity. We work with two premises: (1) race must be understood in relation to other identity categories: gender, class, sexuality, ethnicity, and so on, and (2) race is expressed in both obvious and subtle ways; thus, racial identity is implicit as well as explicitly expressed. We also consider whether race must necessarily be understood as stigma; discuss nonfiction, fiction, and films; and may visit public exhibitions.

Culture Through Food    ANTH-UA 410 Prerequisite: Human Society and Culture (ANTH-UA 1) or permission of the instructor. Abercrombie, Rogers. 4 points.   Explores some of the ways that people use food, cuisines, and eating to organize and engage with social worlds. This focus provides a concrete means for deepening our understanding of alternative models of social explanation. Drawing on ethnographic material from a wide range of cultures, as well as feature films and our own observations and interviews, we consider topics such as the material dimensions of food production, distribution, and consumption (e.g., how food scarcity or abundance shapes collective possibilities, expectations, and values; the causes, consequences, forms, and myths of globalization) and the cultural meanings and social distinctions encoded in food practices (e.g., how food is used cross-culturally as a marker of social identity\u2014class, gender, and ethnicity\u2014and as a source of meaning\u2014nostalgia, anxiety, and so on). Formations of Indigeneity ANTH-UA 605 Formerly ANTH-UA 320. Prerequisite: Human Society and Culture (ANTH-UA 1) or equivalent. Offered every other year. 4 points. Through a case study of materials concerning indigenous people in Australia and North America, this course will investigate the consequences (cultural, sociological, policy) of a development that has taken place throughout the world. Many of the peoples in whom anthropologists have long been interested\u2013those organized into small-scale societies, kinship based\u2013have been encapsulated as indigenous minorities within nation states dominated by other cultural traditions. In this context, the capacity and practices of these peoples, who some have characterized as \u201cFourth World peoples,\u201d to reproduce themselves and their traditions in their own terms has been limited, undermined, co-opted and, on occasion, ironically reinforced.

Between the end of the Ice Age and the expansion of the Roman Empire, temperate Europe witnessed a series of social and economic transformations that represented a transition from a hunting and gathering way of life to urban chiefdoms. Along the way, these hunter-gatherers became agriculturalists and stockherders, learned to use metals, and developed social structures as complex as any found in Old World civilizations. Examines changes in later prehistoric Europe from about 8000 B.C.E. to the arrival of the Romans.    African Archaeology    ANTH-UA 218 Prerequisite: Archaeology: Early Societies and Cultures (ANTH-UA 3). Tryon. 4 points.   With the longest record of human occupation in the world and a landmass that represents more than one-fifth the habitable area of the globe, Africa plays a central role in our understanding of human evolution, the prehistory of our species, and the development of complex societies. Explores the experiences of ancient human populations in Africa using evidence drawn from archaeology as well as history, ethnography, linguistics, art history, geography, geology, paleontology, biology, and other disciplines. Focuses not only on the material evidence from across the continent and its interpretation, but also an understanding of the major questions, developing methods of inquiry and problem solving, and situating the African data in the broader context of the archaeological evidence for the evolution of human behavioral diversity. The scope of the course spans hominin origins, the study of Stone Age foragers of the first 2.5 million years of human prehistory, and more recent periods characterized by food production, metallurgy, sedentism, and the development of complex societies (e.g., in Egypt, Mali, Zimbabwe, and the East African coast) with influence and contacts across and outside the continent.    Discovering Archaeology in New York City    ANTH-UA 225 Wright. 4 points.   In this course, New York City is our archaeological site. The period covered is from 10,000 years ago to the beginning of the 20th century and is based on archaeological remains. Its history is both fascinating and mind-expanding as a different perspective on the city emerges in time and space from what is learned. Walking around its various boroughs, students learn that our modern landscape is vastly different from that of earlier eras. Along with our gains as a major cultural center, we will assess some losses brought about by the destruction of aspects of the city\u2019s past. In particular, students come to understand the meaning of stewardship in the context of urban development. At the same time, viewing our place in the city\u2019s 10,000 years of history gives us a deeper sense of time and place and a unity in its shared heritage.

Traces the evolutionary history of the human lineage from its origin in the late Miocene of Africa up to the initial differentiation and diversification of anatomically modern humans. Explores debates about phylogenetic relationships, taxonomy, paleobiological interpretations, and models for the origin of human behavior.    Human Variation    ANTH-UA 51 Prerequisite: Human Evolution (ANTH-UA 2) or permission of the instructor. Ant\u00f3n, Bailey, Disotell. 4 points.   Humans are the most wide-ranging of all of the species on earth. Our evolutionary history and our ability to adapt to such a broad range of environments result in the patterns of human variability we see today. New techniques have been developed that allow us to explore the different levels of human variation. Focuses on new data and methodologies, including molecular genetic techniques, and the hypotheses and controversies generated by these new perspectives.    Evolution and Biology of Human Behavior    ANTH-UA 52 Prerequisite: Human Evolution (ANTH-UA 2). Ant\u00f3n, Bailey, Harrison, Higham, Williams. 4 points.   Introductory survey presenting a synthetic approach to the biological, behavioral, and cultural origins of humans. Explores data and theories from paleoanthropology, archaeology, nonhuman primate behavioral studies, brain research, and sociobiology for their contributions to the study of human behavior.    Human Genetics    ANTH-UA 53 Prerequisite: Human Evolution (ANTH-UA 2) or permission of the instructor. Disotell. 4 points.   In-depth analysis of the genetic component of human variability. Discusses mechanisms of inheritance, gene expression in individuals and populations, and alternative explanations for genetic variability. Explores the implications of modern advances in genetics, such as genetic engineering and gene therapy.    Primate Behavior and Ecology    ANTH-UA 54 Prerequisite: Human Evolution (ANTH-UA 2) or permission of the instructor. Higham. 4 points.   Why do some primates live in large social groups while others are solitary and yet others live in pairs or cooperatively breeding families? Why are strong social hierarchies seen in some primate taxa but not in others? How do multiple species of primates often manage to coexist in the same habitat? Why are social relationships in some primate species characterized by strong bonds among females while such bonds are absent in other primate societies? Why do some species of primates show marked geographic variability in behavior and social structure? The answers to these and other questions lie in understanding the relationships between each species and its ecological and social setting and in understanding each species' phylogenetic history. Explores the diversity of primate social systems and the evolutionary relationships among the primates and discusses many of the general ecological laws that have been proposed by evolutionary biologists as the keys to understanding important features of primate behavior and ecology.    Health and Disease in Human Evolution    ANTH-UA 55 Prerequisite: Human Evolution (ANTH-UA 2) or permission of the instructor. Ant\u00f3n, Disotell. 4 points.    Examines human health and disease within an ecological framework, exploring the interactions  of environmental, genetic, physiological, and cultural factors in the expression and distribution of human diseases. Develops pathology profiles for nonhuman primates; prehistoric human populations; and hunting and gathering, agricultural, and industrial groups, with emphasis on the expression of infectious disease in human history and newly (re)emerging diseases.    Comparative Biology of the Living Primates    ANTH-UA 56 Prerequisite: Human Evolution (ANTH-UA 2) or permission of the instructor. Harrison, Williams. 4 points.   Study of the comparative biology of the primates, our closest living relatives, is fundamental to a sound understanding of human biology and evolution. Surveys the comparative anatomy of the living primates from a structural, functional, and evolutionary perspective. Different anatomical systems and behaviors are explored, including external features, the cranium, dentition and dietary behavior, postcranial anatomy and locomotor behavior, sensory and nervous systems, and reproductive anatomy. The role of comparative anatomy in taxonomy, behavioral studies, and phylogenetic analyses is emphasized. Primate Communication ANTH-UA 57 Identical to ANST-UA 257. Prerequisite: Human Evolution (ANTH-UA 2). Offered periodically. 4 points. Increased   social and communicative complexity is one of the defining features of   humans compared to other mammals. Key insights into the evolution of   human communication can come from studying our most closely related   extant relatives, our fellow members of the Primate order. The present   course features a mixture of lectures and discussion classes to consider   contemporary topics in primate (including human) communication. Topics   covered include definitions of communication and consideration of its   major theoretical issues such as the difference between signals and   cues, signal honesty, and concepts of signal information content and   evolutionary signal design. Sections of the class focus on communication   in different sensory modalities\u2014olfactory, auditory, and visual, as   well as multimodal communication\u2014before discussing theories and issues   related to the evolution of language. The class finishes by considering   some of the most contemporary topics in primate communication.    Emerging Diseases    ANTH-UA 80 Disotell, Harrison. 4 points.   Integrates evolutionary biology, genetics, immunology, ecology, and behavioral ecology, along with sociocultural anthropology, politics, and economics, to better understand newly emerging and reemerging diseases as they affect human health. General evolutionary theory and an introduction to Darwinian medicine are provided before the course examines viral, bacterial, parasitic, and prion-based diseases along with their hosts, vectors, and other organisms. Particular attention is paid to how humans have purposely and inadvertently created both biological and cultural environments for the transmission of different diseases. Media representations and misrepresentations are examined throughout the course.    Human Ecology    ANTH-UA 90 Prerequisite: Human Evolution (ANTH-UA 2) or permission of the instructor. Crabtree. 4 points.   Investigates the degree to which variation in human biology and culture can be understood as adaptations to varying external conditions. Examines the relationship of human systems of action and the natural world to understand the various forms of human adaptation. Case studies of several living peoples, contemporary and past biological communities, and prehistoric cultures provide the material for interpretation and evaluation of theoretical positions.    Evolution of Language    ANTH-UA 240 Prerequisite: Human Evolution (ANTH-UA 2) or permission of the instructor. 4 points.   Explores the various hypotheses offered for the evolution of language. Perspectives from different disciplines are discussed. Topics include human evolution and the study of fossil humans, animal and primate behavior and communication, anatomy of the vocal tract, neuroanatomy, language acquisition, language universals, the origins and diversification of modern languages, and the origins of writing.    Introduction to Forensic Anthropology    ANTH-UA 326 Ant\u00f3n, Williams. 4 points.   Biological anthropology examines the evolutionary history and adaptability of humans and our ancestors. Forensic anthropology is an applied subfield of biological anthropology that provides expert analysis of the skeleton in a medicolegal setting by utilizing methods developed in skeletal biology, archaeology, and the forensic sciences. Forensic anthropologists play critical roles in identifying victims of mass fatalities (such as the World Trade Center and Oklahoma City bombings), in investigating homicides (such as identifying the Russian tsar's family), and in distinguishing cause of death. The course examines how forensic anthropologists approach modern and historic crimes in the laboratory and the field. Students are introduced to the underlying theory and the applied techniques that forensic anthropologists use to recover and identify individuals and assess cause of death.

The Kevorkian Center's activities focus on the histories, politics, economies, religions, cultures and languages of the area stretching from North Africa to Central Asia, and on the historical processes that have shaped the present. The Kevorkian Center organizes research workshops, luncheon seminars and other forums to encourage new perspectives on the Middle East and foster exploration of interactions and parallels with other world regions.            M.A. in Human Skeletal Biology     This two year program prepares graduates to apply the principles and techniques of skeletal biology and genetic research in Physical Anthropology to a variety of contexts, including those in the Forensic Sciences (i.e., Medical Examiner\u2019s office, Coroner\u2019s office, Armed Forces, Criminal Justice, Law Enforcement, Mass Disasters). The program can also be useful training for students who are preparing for admission to doctoral programs in skeletal biology and human evolution. Program includes 36 points of coursework, a laboratory or field internship, and a research-based M.A. thesis.         Museum Studies     Museum Studies. For more than thirty years, the Program in Museum Studies at New York University has offered an innovative course of study in the contemporary theory and practice of museum work. Emphasizing both the interdisciplinary study of museums and courses of practical training, the program has prepared more than three hundred graduates for positions of increasing responsibility in museums throughout the world. Our graduates are working in museums of fine art, history, anthropology, technology, and natural history; in arboretums, national parks, and science centers; with private and corporate collections; and in government agencies, historical societies, and art galleries. And their careers cover the full range of museum activity, working as directors, curators, educators, registrars, collection managers, and development, media and public relations specialists.         The NYCEP Program     New York University participates in the New York Consortium for Evolutionary Primatology (NYCEP), a graduate training program in evolutionary primatology that includes New York University, City University of New York, Columbia University, Wildlife Conservation Society at the Bronx Zoo, and the American Museum of Natural History. The consortium provides an integrated training program that allows student to take courses, seminars, and internships at any of these institutions offered by more than thirty biological anthropologists, primatologists, and vertebrae paleontologists participating in the program.         Psyences Project     The Psyences Project is a regional seminar, launched by Elizabeth Lunbeck (History, Vanderbilt), Emily Martin (Anthropology, NYU), and Louis Sass (Clinical Psychology, Rutgers), that provides a venue for scholars--from graduate students to professors to practitioners -- concerned with the emergence and social influence of such disciplines as psychiatry, psychology, psychoanalysis, and psychopharmacology. The Psyences Project fosters communication and scholarly exchange among researchers in this increasingly culturally potent area by holding workshops several times each year. The project receives support from the NYU Department of Anthropology and the Institute for the History of Production of Knowledge. Speakers from the last few years have included Fernando Vidal, Andreas Mayer, Alison Winter, Jonathan Metzl, Janis Jenkins, and Don Kulick. In the fall of 2012, the project is co-sponsoring a visit from Alison Bechdel, author of Are You My Mother? and Fun Home.
