We are part of a great research university with an exceptional global presence. The department is located in the heart of Greenwich Village in Manhattan, a vibrant and multicultural part of New York City. Our programs offer a comprehensive education in both the theoretical and clinical aspects of Communicative Sciences and Disorders. The programs are fully accredited by the New York State Department of Education and the Council on Academic Accreditation (CAA) in Speech-Language Pathology.    At the undergraduate level, students take stimulating courses, conduct clinical observations and experience ample opportunities to engage with faculty in research. In addition, through the Global Network University students may elect to study abroad at one of the many NYU sites. In the two-year Master of Science program students take part in course work and clinical placements designed to achieve the integration of academic theoretical knowledge with clinical experiences. Graduate students are offered the opportunity to take two of their required courses during a summer Study Abroad Program at Lund University in Sweden. We also grant a PhD in Communicative Sciences and Disorders. The doctoral program is individually tailored and provides students with training as academic researchers and scholars. This five-year full-time program includes several academic research milestones and comes with a competitive funding package.    The Department offers world-class faculty with expertise in a wide span of areas, an active, campus-based clinic facility and affiliation with more than 100 hospital, rehabilitation, developmental, and educational facilities across the New York area. We welcome you to be part of this challenging and exciting environment as you seek opportunities to learn and grow as a future clinician and/or researcher.    --Christina Reuterski&ouml;ld, PhD, CCC-SLP, Chair/Associate Professor    Department Mission Statement           Our mission is to provide a strong foundation in communication sciences and disorders at undergraduate and graduate levels of education, leading to lifelong learning in the profession.

We are part of a great research university with an exceptional global presence. The department is located in the heart of Greenwich Village in Manhattan, a vibrant and multicultural part of New York City. Our programs offer a comprehensive education in both the theoretical and clinical aspects of Communicative Sciences and Disorders. The programs are fully accredited by the New York State Department of Education and the Council on Academic Accreditation (CAA) in Speech-Language Pathology.    At the undergraduate level, students take stimulating courses, conduct clinical observations and experience ample opportunities to engage with faculty in research. In addition, through the Global Network University students may elect to study abroad at one of the many NYU sites. In the two-year Master of Science program students take part in course work and clinical placements designed to achieve the integration of academic theoretical knowledge with clinical experiences. Graduate students are offered the opportunity to take two of their required courses during a summer Study Abroad Program at Lund University in Sweden. We also grant a PhD in Communicative Sciences and Disorders. The doctoral program is individually tailored and provides students with training as academic researchers and scholars. This five-year full-time program includes several academic research milestones and comes with a competitive funding package.    The Department offers world-class faculty with expertise in a wide span of areas, an active, campus-based clinic facility and affiliation with more than 100 hospital, rehabilitation, developmental, and educational facilities across the New York area. We welcome you to be part of this challenging and exciting environment as you seek opportunities to learn and grow as a future clinician and/or researcher.    --Christina Reuterski&ouml;ld, PhD, CCC-SLP, Chair/Associate Professor    Department Mission Statement           Our mission is to provide a strong foundation in communication sciences and disorders at undergraduate and graduate levels of education, leading to lifelong learning in the profession. This foundation incorporates the pursuit of academic knowledge through research, dissemination of knowledge through teaching, and application of knowledge through clinical service. The basic and clinical research efforts of our faculty and students constitute a cornerstone of pedagogy and clinical practice. We prepare our students to become active contributors to the diverse local and global communities in which they serve, facilitating growth and progress in the profession.

We are part of a great research university with an exceptional global presence. The department is located in the heart of Greenwich Village in Manhattan, a vibrant and multicultural part of New York City. Our programs offer a comprehensive education in both the theoretical and clinical aspects of Communicative Sciences and Disorders. The programs are fully accredited by the New York State Department of Education and the Council on Academic Accreditation (CAA) in Speech-Language Pathology.    At the undergraduate level, students take stimulating courses, conduct clinical observations and experience ample opportunities to engage with faculty in research. In addition, through the Global Network University students may elect to study abroad at one of the many NYU sites. In the two-year Master of Science program students take part in course work and clinical placements designed to achieve the integration of academic theoretical knowledge with clinical experiences. Graduate students are offered the opportunity to take two of their required courses during a summer Study Abroad Program at Lund University in Sweden. We also grant a PhD in Communicative Sciences and Disorders. The doctoral program is individually tailored and provides students with training as academic researchers and scholars. This five-year full-time program includes several academic research milestones and comes with a competitive funding package.    The Department offers world-class faculty with expertise in a wide span of areas, an active, campus-based clinic facility and affiliation with more than 100 hospital, rehabilitation, developmental, and educational facilities across the New York area. We welcome you to be part of this challenging and exciting environment as you seek opportunities to learn and grow as a future clinician and/or researcher.    --Christina Reuterski&ouml;ld, PhD, CCC-SLP, Chair/Associate Professor    Department Mission Statement           Our mission is to provide a strong foundation in communication sciences and disorders at undergraduate and graduate levels of education, leading to lifelong learning in the profession.
