Description       Some critics refer to television as a \u201cstory machine.\u201d Whether that label is fair or not (can a machine produce real art?), it seems clear that television providers can barely keep up with the audience\u2019s insatiable demand for more and more stories. Most television narrative comes to us in the form of a \u201cseries,\u201d a dramatic structure that is our basic focus in this class. How has that format assisted or limited TV storytelling? Are the storytelling structures we associate with TV unique to that medium or simple modifications of novelistic and cinematic conventions? In this class we will consider some of the basic Aristotelian components of \u201cgood\u201d drama in relation to American television history\u2014genre, character, plotting, and spectacle\u2014and also in relation to questions about how a given program represents life and provides pleasure. We will also examine TV in the light of theories about the cultural and political consequences of its dominance of the American cultural scene in the latter half of the twentieth century and (it might be said) current decline. Readings will be chosen to accompany the close study of several television shows including a season or two of Mad Men and The Wire.
