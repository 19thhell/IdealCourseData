Description       Although\u00a0 On the Origin of Species \u00a0was published more than 150 years ago, evolution remains science\u2019s most controversial theory: inspiring to some, disturbing to others, and provocative to many. This class is about how people have used writing to argue over evolution, to understand it, and to imagine its implications\u2014a topic that students will investigate in seminar discussions and through their own writing. We begin with the\u00a0 Origin \u00a0, examining how Darwin\u2019s argument for evolution by natural selection was shaped by scientific and non-scientific texts that were important to him, including the Bible, John Milton\u2019s\u00a0 Paradise Lost \u00a0, and William Paley\u2019s\u00a0 Natural History. \u00a0Next, we turn to imaginative literature, reading\u00a0 Inherit the Wind \u00a0and\u00a0 Trumpery \u00a0, two plays that dramatize some of the questions and issues that swirl around evolution. The class culminates with a research paper for which students investigate a piece of writing, of their choice, that engages with evolution and related issues: possibilities include Darwin\u2019s\u00a0 Expression of the Emotions \u00a0, Richard Dawkins\u2019s\u00a0 The Selfish Gene \u00a0, Bram Stoker\u2019s\u00a0 Dracula \u00a0, and neo-Victorian fiction by John Fowles and A. S. Byatt. In a final reflective essay, students consider their own evolution as writers over the course of the semester.

Students in New York and Buenos Aires meet simultaneously via video conference and work from the same syllabus. Before spring break Prof. Velasco will lead the Washington Square section in New York, and Prof. Malbran the Buenos Aires section in Argentina. After spring break, the instructors will switch locations, so students in both sites will have personal contact with Profs. Velasco and Malbran. No prior GIS experience is necessary. Students will receive training on mapping software and portable mapping devices, which will be provided. Due to enrollment limits, only students who intend to stay in the class are asked to register. Please direct any questions to Alejandro Velasco (av48@nyu.edu) before registration.

Description       Although\u00a0 On the Origin of Species \u00a0was published more than 150 years ago, evolution remains science\u2019s most controversial theory: inspiring to some, disturbing to others, and provocative to many. This class is about how people have used writing to argue over evolution, to understand it, and to imagine its implications\u2014a topic that students will investigate in seminar discussions and through their own writing. We begin with the\u00a0 Origin \u00a0, examining how Darwin\u2019s argument for evolution by natural selection was shaped by scientific and non-scientific texts that were important to him, including the Bible, John Milton\u2019s\u00a0 Paradise Lost \u00a0, and William Paley\u2019s\u00a0 Natural History. \u00a0Next, we turn to imaginative literature, reading\u00a0 Inherit the Wind \u00a0and\u00a0 Trumpery \u00a0, two plays that dramatize some of the questions and issues that swirl around evolution. The class culminates with a research paper for which students investigate a piece of writing, of their choice, that engages with evolution and related issues: possibilities include Darwin\u2019s\u00a0 Expression of the Emotions \u00a0, Richard Dawkins\u2019s\u00a0 The Selfish Gene \u00a0, Bram Stoker\u2019s\u00a0 Dracula \u00a0, and neo-Victorian fiction by John Fowles and A. S. Byatt. In a final reflective essay, students consider their own evolution as writers over the course of the semester.

Students in New York and Buenos Aires meet simultaneously via video conference and work from the same syllabus. Before spring break Prof. Velasco will lead the Washington Square section in New York, and Prof. Malbran the Buenos Aires section in Argentina. After spring break, the instructors will switch locations, so students in both sites will have personal contact with Profs. Velasco and Malbran. No prior GIS experience is necessary. Students will receive training on mapping software and portable mapping devices, which will be provided. Due to enrollment limits, only students who intend to stay in the class are asked to register. Please direct any questions to Alejandro Velasco (av48@nyu.edu) before registration.

Description       Although\u00a0 On the Origin of Species \u00a0was published more than 150 years ago, evolution remains a controversial theory: inspiring to some, disturbing to others, and provocative to many. This class is about how people have used writing to argue over evolution, to understand it, and to imagine its implications\u2014a topic that students will investigate in seminar discussions and through their own writing. We begin with the\u00a0 Origin \u00a0, asking how Darwin\u2019s prose seeks to persuade his readers. Next, we consider how Darwin\u2019s ideas are taken up and transformed by writers of narrative fiction, reading H. G. Wells\u2019s\u00a0 War of the Worlds \u00a0(1897) and Ian McEwan\u2019s\u00a0 Enduring Love \u00a0(1997) alongside texts about social Darwinism and evolutionary psychology. The second half of the course builds towards students\u2019 independent research papers by surveying the impact of evolutionary ideas in a wide range of disciplines: we may consider the response of visual artists to evolution; Richard Dawkins\u2019s concept of the cultural meme; Franco Moretti\u2019s claim that literary history unfolds according to an evolutionary trajectory; and work by recent historians debating Darwin\u2019s initial impact.
