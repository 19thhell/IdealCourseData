This course is designed to provide students with an introduction to the language and culture of acting and to the nature of the relationship between director and performance. It is intended as a complementary class with Storytelling Strategies.    By the end of the semester, students should understand something of the history and culture of schools of acting, comprehend a basic vocabulary of the actor and feel confident with the casting and rehearsal process (including 'organic blocking' leading to 'coverage'). They should have attained a basic working knowledge of all areas of creative intent -- script interpretation, performance, visual and aural environments. They should be equipped to talk to actors using accepted language and be able to stimulate the creation of vital, memorable performances on the screen.
