Classification  of Courses           This  Bulletin contains descriptions of the College's  departments, programs, and courses. The first part of every course number identifies the department or program  offering or cross-listing the course (for example, ARTH for art history).  This is always followed by a two-letter suffix. The suffix \"UA\" indicates  undergraduate courses offered in the College; \"GA\" indicates a graduate course  offered by the Graduate School of Arts and Science. The numeric identifier  comes last (for example, a complete course rubric would be ARTH-UA 677).      Graduate courses open to qualified undergraduates are designated by the departments. The  departmental policy in this matter may be indicated either in this Bulletin or  in the Graduate School of Arts and Science Bulletin; interested students are  also advised to check directly with the relevant departments.              *HEGIS:  Higher Education General Information Survey Degree and Certificate Programs as registered by the New York State Education  Department.
