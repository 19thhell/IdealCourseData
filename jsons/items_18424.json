Electricity and Magnetism II PHYS-UA 132 Prerequisite: Electricity and Magnetism I (PHYS-UA 131). Offered every year. 3 points. Continuation of Electricity and Magnetism I (PHYS-UA 131), with greater depth and emphasis on more complex phenomena and applications. Topics include solutions to the Laplace and Poisson equations, dielectrics and magnetic materials, gauge invariance, plasmas, Fresnel equations, transmission lines, wave guides, and antennas. Optics PHYS-UA 133 Prerequisite: Classical and Quantum Waves (PHYS-UA 105) or permission of the instructor. 3 points. Introduction to physical and geometrical optics. Wave phenomena including diffraction, interference, first-order and higher-order coherence. Holography, phase contrast and atomic force microscopy, and limits of resolution are some of the subjects included. Topics include atomic energy levels and radiative transitions, and detectors from photon counting to bolometers for infrared radiation. Condensed Matter Physics PHYS-UA 135 Prerequisite: Classical and Quantum Waves (PHYS-UA 105) or permission of the instructor. Offered every other year. 3 points. Designed as an introduction to condensed matter physics for students with knowledge of elementary quantum mechanics. Topics include crystal structure, lattice vibrations, and the energy band theory of metals and semiconductors; the electronic, magnetic, and optical properties of solids; and some modern research topics, such as the physics of nano-structures, soft condensed matter physics, and superconductivity. Readings in Particle Physics PHYS-UA 136 Prerequisite: Classical and Quantum Waves (PHYS-UA 105). Offered every other year. 3 points. Particle physics is the study of the very fundamental constituents of matter and of the forces between them. By its nature it is microscopic, but it also connects with astrophysics and cosmology on the largest scales. This course introduces the most important advances in elementary particle physics. It centers on journal articles in which these advances were first published, with overview lectures, original reading, discussion, and student presentations. Topics include the discovery of elementary particles in cosmic rays, antimatter, symmetries found in nature, and the invention of the Quark model of elementary particles and its experimental verification. Thermal and Statistical Physics PHYS-UA 140 Prerequisites: Classical and Quantum Waves (PHYS-UA 105) and Mathematical Physics (PHYS-UA 106). Offered every year. 3 points. Topics include relation of entropy to probability and energy to temperature; the laws of thermodynamics; Maxwell-Boltzmann, Bose-Einstein, and Fermi-Dirac statistics; equations of state for simple gases and chemical and magnetic systems; and elementary theory of phase transitions. Astrophysics PHYS-UA 150 Prerequisite: Physics III (PHYS-UA 95) or permission of the instructor. Offered every other year. 4 points. Introduction to modern astrophysical problems with an emphasis on the physical concepts involved: radio, optical, and X-ray astronomy; stellar structure and evolution; white dwarfs, pulsars, and black holes; and galaxies, quasars, and cosmology. Physics of Biology PHYS-UA 160 Prerequisite: Physics III (PHYS-UA 95). Offered every other year. 3 points. Using basic physical concepts such as energy, entropy, and force, explores biology from a different perspective. Presents a survey of basic biological processes at all levels of organization (molecular, cellular, organismal, and population) in the light of simple ideas from physics. To illustrate this approach, examines a few contemporary research topics, including self-assembly, molecular motors, low Reynolds fluid dynamics, optical imaging, and single-molecule manipulation. Attempts to construct links between fundamental concepts of biology and physics and to expose enormous open questions in the life sciences from the point of view of a physicist. Geared toward students with a background in mathematics and the physical sciences. General Relativity PHYS-UA 170 Prerequisite: Dynamics (PHYS-UA 120) or permission of the instructor. Offered in the spring. 3 points. Provides an introduction to general relativity, stressing physical phenomena and their connection to experiments and observations. Topics include special relativity, gravity as geometry, black holes, gravitational waves, cosmology, Einstein equations. Introduction to Fluid Dynamics PHYS-UA 180 Identical to MATH-UA 230. Prerequisites: Calculus III (MATH-UA 123); Mathematical Physics (PHYS-UA 106) is suggested. Offered every year. 4 points. Fluid dynamics is the branch of physics that describes motions of fluids as varied as the flow of blood in the human body, the flight of an insect or the motions of weather systems on Earth. The course introduces the key concepts of fluid dynamics: the formalism of continuum mechanics, the conservation of mass, energy and momentum in a fluid, the Euler and Navier-Stokes equations, viscosity and vorticity. These concepts are applied to study classic problems in fluid dynamics, such as potential flow around a cylinder, the Stokes flow, the propagation of sound and gravity waves and the onset of instability in shear flow. Computational Physics PHYS-UA 210 Prerequisites: Mathematical Physics (PHYS-UA 106) or permission of the instructor, and knowledge of a scientific programming language (such as C, C++, Fortran, or Python). Offered every year. 4 points. Introduction to computational physics, with an emphasis on fields of current research interest in which numerical techniques provide unique physical insight. Topics are chosen from various branches of physics, including numerical solution of ordinary and partial differential equations, eigenvalue problems, Monte Carlo methods in statistical mechanics, field theory, dynamical systems, and chaos. Special Topics in Physics PHYS-UA 800 Prerequisites vary with the topic. Offered occasionally. 3 points. Covers advanced topics or recent developments in physics. Detailed course descriptions are made available when topics are announced. Independent Study PHYS-UA 997, 998 Prerequisite: permission of the director of undergraduate studies. Offered in the fall and spring respectively. 2 to 4 points per term.               Contact Us | &copy; New York University , Arts and Science"}]}]
