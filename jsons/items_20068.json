CORE COURSES (15 CREDITS)   3.00 Credits Financial Accounting FRE-GY 6003 This course provides a solid foundation in the construction and interpretation of financial statements. Topics include accounting terminology; financial statement preparation and analysis; liquidity and credit risk ratios; depreciation calculations; revenue recognition; and accrued liabilities and asset valuation. Also covered are the effects of equity transactions; cash flows; and various accounting methods on financial statements. Prerequisite: Graduate Standing. Co-Requisite: None. Notes: None. 3.00 Credits Economic Foundations in Finance FRE-GY 6023 This course studies the interactions between money, the financial system and the economy. Topics include supply and demand; consumer theory; theory of the firm; production costs and other subject areas such as interest rates and asset returns. This course summarizes key insights from financial economics as the methodological and conceptual basis of financial engineering. Prerequisite: Graduate Standing 3.00 Credits Quantitative Methods in Finance FRE-GY 6083 This course focuses on quantitative methods and financial modeling. Probability theory, stochastic processes and optimization are studied and applied to a broad variety of financial problems and their derivatives. Topics include probability spaces; conditional probability; densities; distributions; density estimators; multivariate probability; moment-generating functions; random walks; Markov processes; Poisson processes; and the Brownian-motion process. Prerequisite: Students are expected to know calculus and elementary probability and Graduate Standing 3.00 Credits Corporate Finance FRE-GY 6103 The modern corporation, as issuer of financial securities and end-user of financial risk-management products, is a major participant in financial markets and the economic counterpart to investors and financial intermediaries. The mechanism of financial markets and the valuation of instruments are studied in further detail in other courses. However, this course applies the tools of the trade of financial economics and corporate finance to the financial decision-making process of firms. Upon successful completion of this course, students know how to contribute to optimal financial decisions in a corporation: valuation; capital budgeting; risk; capital structure; dividend policy; long-term financing; risk management; and mergers and acquisitions. Increasingly important international factors that affect corporate finance are stressed throughout. Prerequisite: Graduate Standing 3.00 Credits Financial Risk Management and Asset Pricing FRE-GY 6123 This course introduces the techniques and problems of Financial Risk Management and Asset Pricing. It emphasizes risk finance and attitudes; Value at Risk; risk measurement principles; valuation and expected utility and their relevance in the valuation and the pricing of financial investments; insurance; management of derivatives; and risk management. Throughout, risk-management application problems are explored., The course introduces and focuses on the fundamental principles of the Arrow-Debreu state preference theory used to price derivatives and other assets in complete markets. Risk neutral-Binomial models in option pricing; essential elements of Ito calculus; and the Black-Scholes model for pricing options are introduced and applied to practical financial decision making and risk management problems. Prerequisite: Graduate Standing   Watch videos to learn more about these courses:     Financial Accounting - Professor Ingrid Marshall   Economic Foundations in Finance - Professor Barry Blecherman   Quantitative Methods - Professor Agnes Tourin   Corporate Finance - Professor Xu   Risk Management and Asset Pricing - Professor Phil Maymin     TRACK-REQUIRED COURSES (7.5 CREDITS)   Financial Markets and Corporate Finance Track   Required   3.00 Credits Valuations & Corporate Finance FRE-GY 6273 This course provides students with corporate finance theory and analytical skills essential to financial decision-making. It helps students develop a framework that is useful for understanding a broad range of major corporate financial policies and equips students with tools and techniques useful for evaluationg firms and assessing a business&#039; investment and financial policies. Topics will include: discount cash flow models, financial statement analysis, valuations, capital budgeting analysis, capital structure, cost of capital, dividend policies, initial public offerings, and corporate governance.  Prerequisites: FRE-GY 6103 and FRE-GY 6003     3 of the Following Courses:    1.50 Credits Financial Econometrics FRE-GY 6091 This course focuses on the art and science of statistical modeling of processes applied to business, finance and economics. These may include models of aggregate economic activity, economic behavior of firm or behavior of financial assets. Topics include statistical inference; maximum likelihood estimation; method of moments; Bayesian estimation; least-squares estimation; robust estimation; kernel estimation; copula estimation; analysis of variance; linear regression models; multiple regression; logistic regression; quantile regression; time series estimation; unit root tests; bootstrapping. Prerequisite: FRE-GY 6083. Students are expected to know basic statistics. Prerequisite FRE-GY 6083 and Graduate Standing 1.50 Credits Econometrics and Time Series Analysis FRE-GY 6351 Financial econometrics has matured into a necessary and essential part of financial engineering that provides opportunities to deal with real and practical problems in finance. For example, techniques such as ARCH and GARCH and their subsequent development are used to estimate the volatility of underlying financial processes; the analysis of intra-day trading data that requires particular models and techniques; memory-based and fractal stochastic processes to study complex markets behaviors and copulas applied routinely to model- and estimate-dependent risks. These financial and risk problems require the application of advanced financial-econometric techniques, which the course provides from both theoretical and empirical-applied viewpoints. Selected cases provide a real-world sense of financial engineering when it is faced with financial-market reality and complexity. Prerequisite: FRE-GY 6083 and Graduate Standing 1.50 Credits Corporate and Financial Strategy FRE-GY 6361 This is an introduction to financial strategy for MS Financial Engineering students. The course focuses on the role of financial engineers and financial officers in developing and sustaining competitive advantage through the use of financial engineering analyses. Prerequisites: Matriculation into a graduate program sponsored by the Department of Finance &amp; Risk Engineering, or permission of the Department &amp; FRE-GY 6023 and FRE-GY 6103. 1.50 Credits Mergers & Acquisitions FRE-GY 6391 This course examines the theories and empirical evidence related to mergers and acquisitions and other corporate transactions and reorganizations.
