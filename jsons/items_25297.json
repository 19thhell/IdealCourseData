Those political and ethical concerns\u2014about privacy, about exploitation, about user agency\u2014go unaddressed,&quot; Portwood-Stacer notes. &quot;The problem is compounded by media coverage that talks about quitting Facebook as a consumer 'trend' rather than a form of protest.&quot;    Portwood-Stacer's study about Facebook abstention and its coverage in media outlets, titled &quot;Media Refusal and Conspicuous Non-Consumption: The Performative and Political Dimensions of Facebook Abstention,\u201d was published in New Media and Society. It features personal interviews with Facebook abstainers, as well as analysis of blogs, newspaper articles, and complaints posted in other social media venues like Twitter.
