John Cage, Alvin Lucier, Pierre Schaeffer, Max Neuhaus, Pauline Oliveros and Iannis Xenakis are some historical touchpoints; Bruce Nauman, Marina Rosenfeld, Christian Marclay, Kaffe Matthews, Steven Vitiello, Chris Kubick and Anne Walsh are examples of contemporary artists for whom sound is central. Students will work both collaboratively and individually using simple sound-editing software. After basic technical instruction in recording, editing and mixing, students will undertake a series of production assignments that will require the use of found sound, appropriated sound as well as field recordings. The course will culminate in an assignment that explores the site-specific uses of sound. There will be visits to various venues in New York, such as The Dream House (La Monte Young/Marian Zazeela), and guest lectures by contemporary artists working with sound. Readings include selections from Audio Culture (Cox/Warner), listening selections from UbuWeb, and a variety of contemporary reviews, criticism and artists\u2019 statements. The emphasis of this class will fall more on expanding conceptual skills rather than on technical development, and experience in sound or video editing is helpful but not required. There will be a very strong emphasis placed on group critique and discussion.

How does our experience and understanding change when our engagement is primarily through our ears? This arts workshop investigates sound as it comes into play in contemporary visual art practice, installation art, experimental music, and various confluences of these. We will study historical examples of early recording technologies, and explore experimental sound works that provide the intellectual and conceptual antecedents for sound art today. We will also think analytically and historically about the concepts of \u201cnoise\u201d and \u201csilence.\u201d Students will explore the potential of sound as an artistic medium by creating sound-based works as well as studying the work of other artists (John Cage, Pierre Schaeffer, Max Neuhaus, Pauline Oliveros and Iannis Xenakis are some historical touchpoints; Marina Rosenfeld, Christian Marclay, Steven Vitiello, Christina Kubisch, and Susan Philipsz are some contemporary examples). This is not a music or composition class, and the emphasis of this class falls strongly on expanding conceptual skills rather than on technical development. Although experience editing sound is helpful, it is not required. Production assignments are assigned in tandem with with readings of contemporary and historical writing, critical essays and artist\u2019s statements. There will be a strong emphasis placed on discussion, group critique, and student presentations. Guest speakers are a regular part of the course and include artists, curators/critics, and producers of sound who engage the subject from a variety of viewpoints. Ultimately, students in this course will arrive at an enhanced experience of listening such that their knowledge, awareness, and creative engagement with sound is significantly altered.

We will ground the course by looking at examples from early and mid-twentieth century experimental and electronic music that have provided the intellectual and conceptual antecedents for sound art today. John Cage, Alvin Lucier, Pierre Schaeffer, Max Neuhaus, Pauline Oliveros and Iannis Xenakis are some historical touchpoints; Bruce Nauman, Marina Rosenfeld, Christian Marclay, Kaffe Matthews, Steven Vitiello, Chris Kubick and Anne Walsh are examples of contemporary artists for whom sound is central. Students will work both collaboratively and individually using simple sound-editing software. After basic technical instruction in recording, editing and mixing, students will undertake a series of production assignments that will require the use of found sound, appropriated sound as well as field recordings. The course will culminate in an assignment that explores the site-specific uses of sound. There will be visits to various venues in New York, such as The Dream House (La Monte Young/Marian Zazeela), and guest lectures by contemporary artists working with sound. Readings include selections from Audio Culture (Cox/Warner), listening selections from UbuWeb, and a variety of contemporary reviews, criticism and artists\u2019 statements. The emphasis of this class will fall more on expanding conceptual skills rather than on technical development, and experience in sound or video editing is helpful but not required. There will be a very strong emphasis placed on group critique and discussion.

How does our experience and understanding change when our engagement is primarily through our ears? This arts workshop investigates sound as it comes into play in contemporary visual art practice, installation art, experimental music, and various confluences of these. We will study historical examples of early recording technologies, and explore experimental sound works that provide the intellectual and conceptual antecedents for sound art today. We will also think analytically and historically about the concepts of \u201cnoise\u201d and \u201csilence.\u201d Students will explore the potential of sound as an artistic medium by creating sound-based works as well as studying the work of other artists (John Cage, Pierre Schaeffer, Max Neuhaus, Pauline Oliveros and Iannis Xenakis are some historical touchpoints; Marina Rosenfeld, Christian Marclay, Steven Vitiello, Christina Kubisch, and Susan Philipsz are some contemporary examples). This is not a music or composition class, and the emphasis of this class falls strongly on expanding conceptual skills rather than on technical development. Although experience editing sound is helpful, it is not required. Production assignments are assigned in tandem with with readings of contemporary and historical writing, critical essays and artist\u2019s statements. There will be a strong emphasis placed on discussion, group critique, and student presentations. Guest speakers are a regular part of the course and include artists, curators/critics, and producers of sound who engage the subject from a variety of viewpoints. Ultimately, students in this course will arrive at an enhanced experience of listening such that their knowledge, awareness, and creative engagement with sound is significantly altered.

This course examines the meaning and character of the soundscape (the acoustic environment) and the ways it has technically and aesthetically evolved throughout film history from the Kinetophone to the iPhone. The course includes reading in the theory of sound, and listening to examples of sound work by composers and sound designers. In previous semesters we have looked at the soundtrack in such films as: Playtime; Apocalypse Now, The Conversation, Aliens, The Evil Dead II, Saving Private Ryan, and Monty Python\u2019s Holy Grail . Class meetings will be devoted to: 1) lecture and discussion based on assigned readings and listening and viewing assignments; and 2) screening of selected audio and video works. Students are graded on class participation, journals, a paper and exams.
