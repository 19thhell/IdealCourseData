The topic is particularly timely because of renewed interest in the often controversial relationship between law and culture. The classic claim that legal systems must be congruent with the broader political and cultural climate of the societies in which they operate no longer goes unchallenged. Even the concept of culture has become controversial, particularly in its relation to law. The Colloquium will focus this year on dispute resolution. The first several weeks will be in the form of a seminar devoted to a selection of canonical readings that will provide a common grounding on law and culture. After that, Colloquium meetings will alternate between reports by and discussions with an invited visiting scholar and meetings devoted to discussing the previous visitor and preparing for the next one.

The topic is particularly timely because of renewed interest in the often controversial relationship between law and culture. The classic claim that legal systems must be congruent with the broader political and cultural climate of the societies in which they operate no longer goes unchallenged. Even the concept of culture has become controversial, particularly in its relation to law. The Colloquium will focus this year on dispute resolution. The first several weeks will be in the form of a seminar devoted to a selection of canonical readings that will provide a common grounding on law and culture. After that, Colloquium meetings will alternate between reports by and discussions with an invited visiting scholar and meetings devoted to discussing the previous visitor and preparing for the next one.

Founded in 2005 at Fordham University Law School by Thane Rosenbaum , FOLCS has built a reputation as an ideas-driven cultural organization that focuses on the relationship between law and society. In the past nine years, it has hosted conversations with a range of notable guests, including former President Bill Clinton, former Florida governor Jeb Bush, Justice Sonia Sotomayor, film director Oliver Stone, and numerous other government officials, actors, writers, and legal experts.     FOLCS adds to the already enormously rich intellectual life of the Law School, where offerings range from lectures, colloquia, and conferences to the Wednesday lunchtime discussions of the Milbank Tweed Forum. Rosenbaum joins NYU Law as a senior fellow and will continue his role as director of FOLCS.   \u201cI am very pleased to welcome the Forum on Law, Culture &amp; Society to the Law School,\u201d said Dean Trevor Morrison. \u201cOur curriculum emphasizes the interdisciplinary nature of law, and Thane\u2019s programs, with their broad array of people and topics, will amplify that theme, both for members of the NYU Law community and for the public.\u201d   In addition to its Conversations series, FOLCS hosts Trials &amp; Error, which examines high-profile legal cases from the past, and an annual film festival, which combines a well-known film about the law and human rights with commentary by a post-screening guest (on Oct. 21, the lead-off film for the 2014 festival will be The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance , with Justice Stephen Breyer as the commentator). Future FOLCS guests include actress Julianna Margulies, author John Grisham, and actor Tom Cruise.   FOLCS will eventually schedule most of its programs at the Law School, and they will be free of charge to members of the NYU Law community. However, many FOLCS events during this academic year will take place at the 92nd Street Y or at the Time-Warner Center and are open to the public. Those interested in attending can visit the upcoming events page of the FOLCS website to see the schedule of events. (Members of the NYU Law community can obtain a 30% discount on tickets on FOLCS events at the 92 nd Street Y by using the discount code \u201cNYU\u201d.)
