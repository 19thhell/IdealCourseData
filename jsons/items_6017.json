These two programs were brought together in the Bellevue Hospital Geriatric Clinic when a new Section of Geriatrics was established in 1979 within the Department of Medicine.   Over the next twenty years, Geriatrics clinical and educational programs developed rapidly. The Bellevue Geriatrics clinic grew, and was followed by a Geriatrics clinic at the VA, as well as the Home Based Primary Care Program at the Manhattan VA Hospital. A Tisch Hospital Geriatrics Service has evolved into an active inpatient multidisciplinary Geriatrics Consult Service at the Tisch University Hospital. Over the years, several nursing homes have been part of the Geriatrics Program at NYULMC. Currently, Gouverneur Health Center is the site of sub-acute and long-term care clinical and educational activities for the Division.   A Geriatric Fellowship Program was started in 1981, and was one of the first ten geriatric fellowships in the United States. Our fellowship has six fellows for the accredited 1-year Fellowship, with an optional 2nd year for a research concentration. Geriatric fellows rotate through all three medical centers, NYULMC Tisch Hospital, Bellevue Hospital Center and the Manhattan VA, and through the Gouverneur Health Center.   The NYULMC Division of Geriatric Medicine and Palliative Care has long-standing and close relationships with NYULMC Neurosciences and Alzheimer\u2019s Programs, Geriatric Psychiatry, Geriatric Nursing and the new Department of Population Health at NYULMC. With such strengths and collaborations, the NYU Geriatric Fellowship Program is becoming recognized as one of the best Geriatric Fellowships in the nation.
