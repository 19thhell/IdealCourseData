Choreographers\u2019, Composers\u2019 and Designers\u2019 Workshop, is a collaborative performance project of Tisch Dance, utilizing design teams (lighting, costumes and sets) drawn from the Graduate Department of Design for Stage and Film and composers drawn from Graduate Musical Theatre Writing Program, who work with the choreographers to produce dance/theater works which are then fully produced and performed. Each choreographic project has a text source, although its ultimate use within the work can vary greatly. The choreographers meet on a weekly basis with the designers and composers to discuss and decide on set, costume, lighting and musical choices and the design and composing teams also attend rehearsals to continue the collaborative process. The class has a choreographing mentor who attends weekly rehearsals, as well as design and composing mentors. The pieces are presented in a rather elaborate concert with live music at the end of the semester.
