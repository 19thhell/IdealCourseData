Research explores the ways artistic projects informed by oral history have impacted popular culture. Readings, listening to public radio documentaries, and viewing films will be used to address the balance in accurately reflecting the realities and integrity of the people represented while staying true to the vision of the artist. Readings include (but are not limited to): Art Spiegelman\u2019s\u00a0 Maus I &amp; II \u00a0; Works by Studs Terkel including\u00a0 Working \u00a0and\u00a0 Will the Circle Be Unbroken \u00a0; Greg Halpern\u2019s\u00a0 Harvard Works Because We Do \u00a0, listening to audio and reading\u00a0 Slave Narratives \u00a0from\u00a0 Remember Slavery \u00a0project, Smithsonian; Anna Deveare Smith, and Dave Isay. For final projects students create collaborative or solo work in the discipline of their own training; theatre, artist books, photography, poetry, music, radio, audio art, film or video.

Description       Modern nations and peoples frequently seek their origin and inspiration in societies that came before. They often gain from their predecessors a sense of history and cultural identity and use that past to shape contemporary relationships with other peoples, institutions, or landscapes. Ancient cultures, too, established intimate\u2014and often highly politicized\u2014connections to their own cultural history through monuments, literature, histories, and mythologies, often with seemingly little regard for what we think of as \u201cthe truth.\u201d This course investigates the idea of the past (mythological and historical) in the shaping of Greek and Roman identities, the influence that existing monuments and landscapes had on classical ideas of what came before, and the use of oral, written, and visual material to communicate and perpetuate certain legacies. In addition to looking at the ways that ancient cultures used their own past to shape a cultural identity, we will also look at the ways in which ancient texts and archaeological remains have been employed in the shaping of modern national identities in Europe, Turkey, and Egypt. For their semester projects, students are invited to apply the questions we encounter in class to a historical period, political context, or geographical region that interests them. Course readings and central monuments may include the following: Stuart Hall, Anthony Smith, Jan Assmann, Andreas Huyssen, Homer, Herodotus, Pindar, the Temple of Zeus at Olympia, the Parthenon, the Great Altar at Pergamon, Virgil, the Ara Pacis.

These dances, from the secular tradition of American social dance, include those performed in ballrooms, cabarets, nightclubs, cabarets, discotheques, and the street. The seminar will explore various social and popular dance styles developed as a result of the rich fusions of West African, African American, Euro-American, and Latin American forms of dance within the U.S., Canada, and the Caribbean. Topics may include the colonial era and the dances of George Washington; ragtime couple dance and the New Woman; the lindy-hop and the crossing racial boundaries; and teen dances and youth rebellion of the 1950s. In all cases, we will explore social and popular dance forms as experiences of movement that both respond and give shape to social, cultural, and political issues of the day. In addition to extensive viewing of dance, readings will include Ellis,\u00a0 The Dance of Life \u00a0, Dickens,\u00a0 American Notes \u00a0:\u00a0 and The Uncommercial Traveler \u00a0: Fitzgerald, Flappers and Philosophers; Sante, Low\u00a0 Life: Lures and Snares of Old New York \u00a0; Malnig,\u00a0 Ballroom, Boogie, Shimmy Sham, Shake: A Social and Popular Dance Reader; \u00a0Linda Tomko,\u00a0 Dancing Class: Gender, Ethnicity, and Social Divides in American \u00a0\u00a0 Dance; \u00a0Peiss,\u00a0 Cheap Amusements: Working Women and Leisure in Turn of the Century New Yor \u00a0k; Jacqui Malone,\u00a0 Steppin\u2019 on the Blues: The Visible Rhythms of African American Dance \u00a0; Dinerstein,\u00a0 Swinging the Machine: Modernity, Technology, and African American Culture Between the World Wars \u00a0; Hine,\u00a0 The Rise and Fall of the American Teenager \u00a0.
