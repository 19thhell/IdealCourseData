A collaboration between NYU Schack and Fountainhead Transmedia , the film will be screened on Wednesday, March 13 at 6 p.m. at the NYU Kimmel Center, 60 Washington Square South. Admission is free and open to the public.     Haiti Redux illustrates how social entrepreneurs, non-governmental organizations, governments, and community leaders are collaborating to help restore and construct sustainable communities primed for growth and prosperity. The film also documents James Barry, Tiffany Dang, Benjamin D. Loney, Thomas Long, and Philip Stasulli \u2013 graduate students in NYU Schack\u2019s Post-Catastrophe Reconstruction program \u2013 as they assist with the rebuilding efforts and work alongside the community to try to find creative short-term and long-term housing and infrastructure solutions.    \u201cOver the last several years, the world has seen many natural disasters that have made us question and reformulate our ideas about what the initial steps should be immediately following tragedies with such widespread damage in order to get the local communities back on their feet again,\u201d said Rosemary Scanlon, divisional dean of the NYU Schack Institute of Real Estate. \u201cAfter the 2010 earthquake, the situation in Haiti was dire. As Fredric points out in the film, the earthquake didn\u2019t just cause a disaster; it revealed one. NYU Schack\u2019s Post-Catastrophe Reconstruction curriculum is designed to specifically address questions about how communities facing such devastation can rebuild their homes and businesses as quickly as possible. Our programming along with filmmaker Fredric King\u2019s desire to raise visibility of the struggles in Haiti made the collaboration a worthwhile project for us at NYU Schack.\u201d    A discussion with NYU Schack Institute Clinical Assistant Professor Corinne Packard, a post-catastrophe reconstruction expert who is featured in the film, and filmmaker Fredric King will follow the screening. The discussion will focus on the lessons learned and the steps left to take in the wake of devastating natural disasters, including local examples following Hurricane Sandy.    Packard\u2019s seminar in Post-Catastrophe Reconstruction at NYU Schack offers students an opportunity to explore, in detail, the variety of complex issues surrounding global post-catastrophe reconstruction situations in real estate development, and planning and construction-related activities. The seminar includes studying PCR situations in Haiti after the earthquake, New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina, and New York after Hurricane Sandy.    In the process of making Haiti Redux , King traveled through various parts of Haiti during the height of the outbreak of cholera. His stops included the Central Plateau, Delmas 32, and the rural village of Bigones. King\u2019s hope is that the film will inspire others to get involved with disadvantaged communities both at home and abroad.

A collaboration between NYU Schack and Fountainhead Transmedia , the film will be screened on Wednesday, March 13 at 6 p.m. at the NYU Kimmel Center, 60 Washington Square South. Admission is free and open to the public.     Haiti Redux illustrates how social entrepreneurs, non-governmental organizations, governments, and community leaders are collaborating to help restore and construct sustainable communities primed for growth and prosperity. The film also documents James Barry, Tiffany Dang, Benjamin D. Loney, Thomas Long, and Philip Stasulli \u2013 graduate students in NYU Schack\u2019s Post-Catastrophe Reconstruction program \u2013 as they assist with the rebuilding efforts and work alongside the community to try to find creative short-term and long-term housing and infrastructure solutions.    \u201cOver the last several years, the world has seen many natural disasters that have made us question and reformulate our ideas about what the initial steps should be immediately following tragedies with such widespread damage in order to get the local communities back on their feet again,\u201d said Rosemary Scanlon, divisional dean of the NYU Schack Institute of Real Estate. \u201cAfter the 2010 earthquake, the situation in Haiti was dire. As Fredric points out in the film, the earthquake didn\u2019t just cause a disaster; it revealed one. NYU Schack\u2019s Post-Catastrophe Reconstruction curriculum is designed to specifically address questions about how communities facing such devastation can rebuild their homes and businesses as quickly as possible. Our programming along with filmmaker Fredric King\u2019s desire to raise visibility of the struggles in Haiti made the collaboration a worthwhile project for us at NYU Schack.\u201d    A discussion with NYU Schack Institute Clinical Assistant Professor Corinne Packard, a post-catastrophe reconstruction expert who is featured in the film, and filmmaker Fredric King will follow the screening. The discussion will focus on the lessons learned and the steps left to take in the wake of devastating natural disasters, including local examples following Hurricane Sandy.    Packard\u2019s seminar in Post-Catastrophe Reconstruction at NYU Schack offers students an opportunity to explore, in detail, the variety of complex issues surrounding global post-catastrophe reconstruction situations in real estate development, and planning and construction-related activities. The seminar includes studying PCR situations in Haiti after the earthquake, New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina, and New York after Hurricane Sandy.    In the process of making Haiti Redux , King traveled through various parts of Haiti during the height of the outbreak of cholera. His stops included the Central Plateau, Delmas 32, and the rural village of Bigones. King\u2019s hope is that the film will inspire others to get involved with disadvantaged communities both at home and abroad.
