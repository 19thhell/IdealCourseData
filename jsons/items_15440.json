Doctoral work in statistics combines theory and methodology to deal with the large quantity of statistical data. Here at Stern we use the theoretical and methodological orientation of a traditional statistics with a focus on the applications that are central to the concerns of a business school. The PhD thesis work at Stern is a mathematically sophisticated enterprise that never loses sight of the real and practical problems of business. Stern&rsquo;s curriculum in statistics prepares students for academic positions by preparing them to conduct independent research. The statistician must be knowledgeable of the basic issues of the intellectual areas in which his or her work will be applied. The most popular areas of student interest in the last few years have been mathematical finance, statistical modeling, data mining, stochastic processes, and econometrics. Students have rigorous course work and participate in special topics seminars. They work closely with the faculty and also present special PhD student seminars. Clifford Hurvich Coordinator, Statistics Doctoral Program  Mission Our mission is the education of scholars who will produce first-rate statistics research and who will succeed as faculty members at first-rate universities. Admissions and performance We enroll one or two students each year; these are chosen from approximately 100 highly qualified applicants. Advising and evaluation Each student will meet with a committee of faculty members yearly to assess progress through the program. Research and interaction with faculty  The Stern statistics faculty have a wide range of interests, but there is special emphasis on time series, statistical modeling, stochastic processes, and financial modeling. PhD students in statistics take courses in statistical inference, stochastic processes, time series, regression analysis, and multivariate analysis. In addition to course work, doctoral students also participate in research projects in conjunction with faculty members. The students attend seminars, present seminars on their own work, and submit their work for publication. The program culminates with the creation of the PhD thesis, through the stages of proposal, writing, and defense. Most students finish in four to five years.   Statistics Program of Study Statistics PhD students take their course work in the first two years of study. These courses are taken within the Statistics Group (both as formal courses and also as independent study), within other departments at the Stern School, at NYU's Courant Institute, and at Columbia University.  Program Requirements In addition to their statistics courses, doctoral students in Statistics often take courses in mathematics, finance, market research, and econometrics. The individual curriculum will be planned with the help of faculty advisers.

The program allows you to learn highly marketable skills in the current data science revolution and to use those skills to address important social issues.    Who is this program for?    This MS program is a good choice if you like to work with numbers and solve problems and want to learn valuable data-analysis and analytical skills. Advanced statistical methods can be used to answer pivotal research questions across many science and social science disciplines as well as to inform policy and do work that is socially important and significant. The program is designed to help you develop the ability to perform and understand complex quantitative research in the social, behavioral, and health sciences. Students admitted to our program have a variety of interests that fit well with our program, including education policy, child development, poverty, labor markets, evaluation, social policy, psychology, and public health.    What will I learn?    The A3SR curriculum provides you with a firm foundation in statistical modeling tools commonly used in the social, behavioral, and health science research. You will become proficient in use of methods such as:       linear models    multilevel modeling    multivariate analysis    measurement models    generalized linear models    causal inference    approaches to missing data       If you are entering the program with more advanced mathematical or statistical training, you will have the option of pursuing more advanced coursework which will provide opportunities to develop and evaluate the properties of statistical models.    Coursework and data analysis projects help you gain confidence in your skills to undertake data-analytic projects and research grounded in proven methodology and make strong data-based decisions and assessments. You will have opportunities to apply your skills to address critical policy issues and social problems through an internship and the consulting research seminar. The curriculum will prepare you for jobs in fields such as :       Psychology    Education    Political Science    Applied Economics    Public policy    Health and healthcare    Media research       By the time you graduate you will know how to :       Manipulate simple and complex data structures    Determine appropriate analyses needed to answer critical questions    Apply a wide range of statistical methods and understand the results at a sophisticated level    Evaluate the appropriateness and efficacy of statistical procedures    Communicate the role of and results from statistical analyses to colleagues or employers    Alter or extend existing techniques or develop new methods to address complicated data analysis problems for which routine statistical procedures are insufficient (exclusively open to students who enter with additional training)       What can I do with this degree?    The curriculum prepares you for a career as an applied statistician and data scientist in the private or public sector, as well as for further academic study in a variety of academic disciplines that require quantitative analysis.    Who will I study with?    This is an exciting time to study applied statistics and data science at NYU. The MS program is an initiative of the NYU Steinhardt Center for the Promotion of Research Involving Innovative Statistical Methodology (PRIISM) and is an integrated part of the larger university-wide initiative in Data Science and Statistics , which offers several new master&rsquo;s degrees, including this MS program.    A3SR faculty have particular strengths in:       causal inference    high-dimensional data    measurement    missing data    model selection    multivariate analysis    multilevel modeling    surveys and sampling       All the faculty are deeply committed to using data analysis methods and strategies for the social good. They have worked and consulted for a range of advocacy and policy organizations. They are applying these strategies to important questions in public health, politics, psychology and psychometrics, demography, sociology, labor markets, and education . This program seeks like-minded students who are eager to apply these tools to do good in the world.    Some of the important application-area questions they are exploring include:       What is the role of media in forming public opinions?    What is the effect of gifted and talented programs on student achievement?    What is the relationship between diet and certain forms of cancer?    Do student curricular pathways matter for degree attainment and subsequent labor market outcomes?    What are effective strategies for rehabilitation of stroke patients?       On the methodological front our faculty are working in diverse areas across statistics . Examples include research to:       Assess when observational studies can act as reasonable substitutes for randomized experiments    Develop better strategies to handle missing data    Develop variable selection methods for high dimensional data    Model the dependencies in categorical sequences of events       We encourage you and all our students to work closely with our faculty on research that ranges from applied statistical analysis to the development of customized statistical models.    What other options do I have to study statistics at NYU?    There are many graduate programs in the Steinhardt School and at NYU that you may wish to further explore. We encourage you to explore these options further to find the program that best matches your personal interests and career goals.
