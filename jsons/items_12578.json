Her 1982 dissertation, subsequently published as Chaucer and the Text in 1988, explored the relevance of new critical modes for older literature, while in her 1989 book, Chaucer's Sexual Poetics , she investigated the connection of past and present via the Western discursive tradition of gender. In Getting Medieval: Sexualities and Communities, Pre- and Postmodern (1999), she traced a queer desire for history. In her most recent book, How Soon is Now? Medieval Texts, Amateur Readers, and the Queerness of Time (2012), she looks directly at the experience of time itself, as it is represented in medieval works and as it is experienced in readers of those works. In the classroom, she regularly teaches materials past and present, in courses ranging from Medieval Misogyny to Queer New York City.     In graduate courses such as \u201cTime and Temporality in Medieval Literature,\u201d she has explored expanded notions of history and time\u2014affective history, embodied history, and the feeling of being a body in time\u2014in texts ranging from Boethius\u2019s Consolation of Philosophy to Chaucer\u2019s Troilus and Criseyde to Washington Irving\u2019s \u201cRip van Winkle,\u201d Derrida\u2019s Specters of Marx and Henri Bergson\u2019s Matter and Memory . Dinshaw has recently taught \"Ecological Approaches to Medieval Literature,\" in which students read medieval texts (especially those featuring a figure of Nature) in relation to theoretical materials by, among many others, Timothy Morton, Martin Heidegger, Bruno Latour, Catriona Sandilands and Bruce Erickson, and Dipesh Chakrabarty. Her work in the Department of Social and Cultural Analysis (where she is jointly appointed with the English Department) has provided a rich context in which to develop these ideas theoretically and cross culturally.     Dinshaw\u2019s current research projects extend her interests into the visual field. It\u2019s Not Easy Being Green focuses on the eerie figure of the foliate head \u2013 a decorative motif well nigh ubiquitous in medieval church sculpture in Western Europe that became known in the 20th century as the Green Man. This imagined mixture of human and vegetable (a head sprouting leaves or made up of vegetation) is the point of departure for her research on human/non-human relations, queerness and queer sexual subcultures now, \"the ecological thought\" (as Timothy Morton puts it), and what medieval literature can tell us about it all.     The second project, Exploring Nowhere: Mirages, Digital Maps, and the Historical Problem of Location , is undertaken with visual artist Marget Long. It is a project that explores paradoxical places where time and space operate differently from all other places on earth \u2013 \u201cnowheres that are somewhere\u201d (to adapt Alessandro Scafi\u2019s resonant phrase for medieval representations of Paradise). Long and Dinshaw look to the optical phenomenon of the mirage\u2014a strange and elusive \"nowhere\"\u2014to explore the broad concepts of location and locatability. They investigate the mirage\u2019s visual and cultural history through a wide array of materials: medieval maps and legends of Paradise (which was in at least one instance thought to be a mirage), early 20th-century Arctic exploration, and photographs and video works from Long\u2019s project on mirages. Long and Dinshaw take a long view of the mirage\u2014an illusion that prompts an irrational experience of time and space\u2014in order to imagine (among other things) how to work and play with current digital mapping technologies intended to work us.
