Truly an inter- and trans-disciplinary approach is a hallmark of education at New York University.   The spirit of transcending academic boundaries is present even on a systemic level. Indeed, two of our graduate programs \u2013 the Draper Interdisciplinary Masters in Humanities and Social Thought and the Masters of Arts in the Gallatin School for Individualized Study \u2013 offer tailor-made degrees based on broad academic perspectives. The wealth of dual and joint degrees between NYU\u2019s schools, combining fields from law and social work to medicine and the humanities, allows students educational experiences that would not be possible within the bounds of single disciplines.   In the absence of traditional disciplinary methods or even traditional subjects of study, NYU has also forged exciting paths in scholarship. Research centers such as our Institute of Human Development and Social Change and the Electronic Gaming Center in the Skirball Center for New Media are unique in the country for their authoritative treatment of studies that would be ill served by regimented departmentalization. NYU\u2019s renowned Cancer Institute is a comprehensive clinical treatment and research center that draws its success from its multidisciplinary staff, experts in various fields of medicine, social work, and the sciences.   On a smaller level, the flexibility to inquire beyond departmental borders is welcomed in all corners of the University. Though ultimately subject to internal approval, many programs encourage taking courses outside their own concentrations, and a number of advanced certificates are available to complement single degrees. Outside the classroom, students are invited to participate in NYU\u2019s thrilling array of research and cultural initiatives, such as the Medieval and Renaissance Center , the arts-based colloquium Forms of Seeing, and the ongoing conversations of the Graduate Forum , each of which crucially benefit from the heterogeneous expertise of their members.   As you begin exploring all that we have to offer, consider the benefits of a program that promotes its students\u2019 innovative and ambitious approaches to the increasingly complex issues that concern the modern world. At New York University, the potentials are limitless.
