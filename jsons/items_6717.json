Szapka, a 24-year-old secretary working for the State Department in New York City, had been picked up by limo, taken to Newark Penn Station, and led aboard a berth with several other young women all hired for &ldquo;The Project.&rdquo; She had not been told where the job was, whom she&rsquo;d be working for, what she&rsquo;d be doing, or how long it would last&mdash;only that it paid well and was in service to ending the war.               Inside a uranium-enrichment plant, young women were trained to operate these calutron monitors without ever knowing their purpose.         What waited at the end of this journey was Oak Ridge, a top-secret town raised almost overnight in the mountains of eastern Tennessee as part of the Manhattan Project. Its singular purpose was to enrich as much uranium as quickly as possible for use in the War  Department&rsquo;s quest to develop a nuclear bomb.   It was an arduous task, and as chronicled in journalist Denise Kiernan&rsquo;s book, The Girls of Atomic City: The Untold Story of the Women Who Helped Win World War II (Touchstone), much of this labor fell to women like Szapka. Kiernan (WSUC &rsquo;91, STEINHARDT &rsquo;02) presents her story, as a secretary at the town&rsquo;s administrative headquarters, along with the narratives of women at all levels of this  undertaking&mdash;including Dorothy Jones, a calutron cubicle operator in one of the processing plants, and Leona Woods, a physicist who helped to create the first sustained nuclear reaction. &ldquo;The most ambitious war project in military history rested squarely on the shoulders of tens of thousands of ordinary people, many of them young women,&rdquo; she writes.   Kiernan resurrects this moment in history through hundreds of interviews with former workers, many now in their nineties, and extensive archival research. Since its release last spring, the book has landed on The New York Times best-seller list and has won the attention of critics. The Washington Post called it &ldquo;fascinating,&rdquo; noting that &ldquo;Rosie, it turns out, did much more than drive rivets.&rdquo; The author was approached by Hollywood when the book was merely in proposal form, and continues to ride a wave of lectures, interviews, and book events, from Raleigh to Milwaukee&mdash;including a party in Nashville thrown by one of her subjects, Colleen Rowan, where all the ladies dressed in 1940s  military garb and passed around atomic-themed cocktails.   The Project sought out young women like Rowan and Jones, from rural Tennessee and fresh out of high school, because it was thought that they were easier to instruct and asked fewer questions. These were important traits because there was no end to the secrecy once recruits arrived in Oak Ridge. Each was given just the sliver of information necessary to do her job. The word uranium was never spoken or written. Instead, it was referred to as &ldquo;tubealloy&rdquo; and &ldquo;product&rdquo;&mdash;not that anyone but, say, the chemists even knew what uranium was or how its power might be harnessed for this newly discovered thing called fission.    Lest anyone start blabbing about work, residents were bombarded with warnings. There were billboards, editorials, missives, and the occasional, sudden disappearance of a loose-lipped colleague, and these reminders mostly worked. &ldquo;Nobody wanted to be responsible for derailing the war effort,&rdquo; Kiernan explains. &ldquo;If they said, &lsquo;Keep your mouth shut or you&rsquo;re going to screw things up,&rsquo; then it was like, &lsquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll keep my mouth shut.&rsquo; &rdquo;    By 1945, Oak Ridge was home to 75,000 workers and their families. The days were long, and the work never stopped for holidays. Housing was scarce and shoddy. Single women were generally assigned to dormitories, while families scrunched into prefab houses and trailers. There were lines for everything&mdash;food, cigarettes, books. The mud was ubiquitous and calf-deep. Despite the discomforts, these years marked a formative period for many of the young workers. It was the first time they were on their own, pockets flush with cash, and a lively social scene sprouted instantly. There were dances, religious services, a movie theater, and all manner of clubs, from basketball to Girl Scouts.        Billboards were a ubiquitous reminder to keep mum about the work happening at Oak Ridge.         You only had to be white to partake in the fun. African-Americans, who were primarily hired to build or clean the town and plants, faced all the indignities of segregation and more. When Kattie Strickland and her husband arrived from Alabama, they discovered that they were not allowed to live together (and unlike white workers, they were barred from bringing their children to Oak Ridge). There was one camp for black men and another for black women, separated by a high fence, barbed wire, and guards. They had a 10 pm curfew and little privacy, with four people squeezed into a one-room hut heated by a coal stove. Cooking in the huts was forbidden. Instead, there was a special blacks-only cafeteria, renowned for serving up mystery meat and &ldquo;rocks, glass, or some dangerous piece of harmful trash.&rdquo; After a particularly harrowing bout of food poisoning, Strickland started to surreptitiously bake corn bread, biscuits, and other comfort foods in the huts on rumpled pans fashioned from scrap metal.    Life turned truly horrific for some African-Americans, such as Ebb Cade, a healthy 53-year-old construction worker. When both of his legs were broken in a car accident, doctors at Oak Ridge were ordered not to set them immediately and to give him injections of plutonium to study its effect. Thereafter he was known as HP-12. Staff collected urine, feces, and tissue samples, and removed 15 of his teeth. He died eight years  later, reportedly from heart failure. In 1994, President Bill Clinton appointed a special committee to investigate this and thousands  of other human radiation experiments that were conducted from 1944 to 1974.   Though Kiernan found many letters of complaint addressed to everyone from construction bosses to President Roosevelt, many black workers stayed on. The simple truth was that African-Americans&rsquo; experience in Oak Ridge was not so different from elsewhere in the South and beyond, but the wages could not be matched.    On the morning of August 6, 1945, the United States dropped a bomb armed with uranium processed at Oak Ridge on Hiroshima, and another three days later on Nagasaki. Just like that, the world ventured into a new age, the war ended, and a veil was lifted on the true purpose of The Project. It would take some time to understand the full scale of destruction in Japan.    In Oak Ridge, there was jubilation. Everyone could return to faraway homes and know that their brothers, husbands, and sons would soon join them. But a surprising number also settled in right there, taking new jobs in the burgeoning field of atomic energy. Today, the town has only 28,000 residents but is home to the Department of Energy&rsquo;s largest national laboratory and celebrates its unusual origins each June with the Secret City Festival. &ldquo;[Oak Ridge] may have been constructed by the government,&rdquo; Kiernan says, &ldquo;but they had built that community by staying there, eating there, marrying there, having babies there.&rdquo;       Photos &copy; James Edward Westcott, courtesy of the National Archives"}]},

Although the end of the Cold War relaxed the tensions somewhat, the combined arsenals of existing nuclear powers are still sufficient to destroy most of life on this planet many times over, and controversies continue over nuclear weapons programs in Iran and North Korea. How did this extraordinary state of affairs come about? Why were the bombs made when and where they were made? Why were they used? Did the individuals involved understand the destructive potential of these new weapons and ponder moral questions involving their manufacture and use? Did they anticipate the nuclear arms race that has resulted. How does this episode fit into the longer history of the relationship between science and warfare? How were both hopes and fears transferred to the debates over nuclear power? Readings will likely include Rhodes,\u00a0 The Making of the Atomic Bomb \u00a0, Hachiya,\u00a0 Hiroshima Diary \u00a0, Gordin,\u00a0 Red Cloud at Dawn \u00a0, and a variety of selections concerning nuclear proliferation, the disarmament movement, and nuclear power.

Szapka, a 24-year-old secretary working for the State Department in New York City, had been picked up by limo, taken to Newark Penn Station, and led aboard a berth with several other young women all hired for &ldquo;The Project.&rdquo; She had not been told where the job was, whom she&rsquo;d be working for, what she&rsquo;d be doing, or how long it would last&mdash;only that it paid well and was in service to ending the war.               Inside a uranium-enrichment plant, young women were trained to operate these calutron monitors without ever knowing their purpose.         What waited at the end of this journey was Oak Ridge, a top-secret town raised almost overnight in the mountains of eastern Tennessee as part of the Manhattan Project. Its singular purpose was to enrich as much uranium as quickly as possible for use in the War  Department&rsquo;s quest to develop a nuclear bomb.   It was an arduous task, and as chronicled in journalist Denise Kiernan&rsquo;s book, The Girls of Atomic City: The Untold Story of the Women Who Helped Win World War II (Touchstone), much of this labor fell to women like Szapka. Kiernan (WSUC &rsquo;91, STEINHARDT &rsquo;02) presents her story, as a secretary at the town&rsquo;s administrative headquarters, along with the narratives of women at all levels of this  undertaking&mdash;including Dorothy Jones, a calutron cubicle operator in one of the processing plants, and Leona Woods, a physicist who helped to create the first sustained nuclear reaction. &ldquo;The most ambitious war project in military history rested squarely on the shoulders of tens of thousands of ordinary people, many of them young women,&rdquo; she writes.   Kiernan resurrects this moment in history through hundreds of interviews with former workers, many now in their nineties, and extensive archival research. Since its release last spring, the book has landed on The New York Times best-seller list and has won the attention of critics. The Washington Post called it &ldquo;fascinating,&rdquo; noting that &ldquo;Rosie, it turns out, did much more than drive rivets.&rdquo; The author was approached by Hollywood when the book was merely in proposal form, and continues to ride a wave of lectures, interviews, and book events, from Raleigh to Milwaukee&mdash;including a party in Nashville thrown by one of her subjects, Colleen Rowan, where all the ladies dressed in 1940s  military garb and passed around atomic-themed cocktails.   The Project sought out young women like Rowan and Jones, from rural Tennessee and fresh out of high school, because it was thought that they were easier to instruct and asked fewer questions. These were important traits because there was no end to the secrecy once recruits arrived in Oak Ridge. Each was given just the sliver of information necessary to do her job. The word uranium was never spoken or written. Instead, it was referred to as &ldquo;tubealloy&rdquo; and &ldquo;product&rdquo;&mdash;not that anyone but, say, the chemists even knew what uranium was or how its power might be harnessed for this newly discovered thing called fission.    Lest anyone start blabbing about work, residents were bombarded with warnings. There were billboards, editorials, missives, and the occasional, sudden disappearance of a loose-lipped colleague, and these reminders mostly worked. &ldquo;Nobody wanted to be responsible for derailing the war effort,&rdquo; Kiernan explains. &ldquo;If they said, &lsquo;Keep your mouth shut or you&rsquo;re going to screw things up,&rsquo; then it was like, &lsquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll keep my mouth shut.&rsquo; &rdquo;    By 1945, Oak Ridge was home to 75,000 workers and their families. The days were long, and the work never stopped for holidays. Housing was scarce and shoddy. Single women were generally assigned to dormitories, while families scrunched into prefab houses and trailers. There were lines for everything&mdash;food, cigarettes, books. The mud was ubiquitous and calf-deep. Despite the discomforts, these years marked a formative period for many of the young workers. It was the first time they were on their own, pockets flush with cash, and a lively social scene sprouted instantly. There were dances, religious services, a movie theater, and all manner of clubs, from basketball to Girl Scouts.        Billboards were a ubiquitous reminder to keep mum about the work happening at Oak Ridge.         You only had to be white to partake in the fun. African-Americans, who were primarily hired to build or clean the town and plants, faced all the indignities of segregation and more. When Kattie Strickland and her husband arrived from Alabama, they discovered that they were not allowed to live together (and unlike white workers, they were barred from bringing their children to Oak Ridge). There was one camp for black men and another for black women, separated by a high fence, barbed wire, and guards. They had a 10 pm curfew and little privacy, with four people squeezed into a one-room hut heated by a coal stove. Cooking in the huts was forbidden. Instead, there was a special blacks-only cafeteria, renowned for serving up mystery meat and &ldquo;rocks, glass, or some dangerous piece of harmful trash.&rdquo; After a particularly harrowing bout of food poisoning, Strickland started to surreptitiously bake corn bread, biscuits, and other comfort foods in the huts on rumpled pans fashioned from scrap metal.    Life turned truly horrific for some African-Americans, such as Ebb Cade, a healthy 53-year-old construction worker. When both of his legs were broken in a car accident, doctors at Oak Ridge were ordered not to set them immediately and to give him injections of plutonium to study its effect. Thereafter he was known as HP-12. Staff collected urine, feces, and tissue samples, and removed 15 of his teeth. He died eight years  later, reportedly from heart failure. In 1994, President Bill Clinton appointed a special committee to investigate this and thousands  of other human radiation experiments that were conducted from 1944 to 1974.   Though Kiernan found many letters of complaint addressed to everyone from construction bosses to President Roosevelt, many black workers stayed on. The simple truth was that African-Americans&rsquo; experience in Oak Ridge was not so different from elsewhere in the South and beyond, but the wages could not be matched.    On the morning of August 6, 1945, the United States dropped a bomb armed with uranium processed at Oak Ridge on Hiroshima, and another three days later on Nagasaki. Just like that, the world ventured into a new age, the war ended, and a veil was lifted on the true purpose of The Project. It would take some time to understand the full scale of destruction in Japan.    In Oak Ridge, there was jubilation. Everyone could return to faraway homes and know that their brothers, husbands, and sons would soon join them. But a surprising number also settled in right there, taking new jobs in the burgeoning field of atomic energy. Today, the town has only 28,000 residents but is home to the Department of Energy&rsquo;s largest national laboratory and celebrates its unusual origins each June with the Secret City Festival. &ldquo;[Oak Ridge] may have been constructed by the government,&rdquo; Kiernan says, &ldquo;but they had built that community by staying there, eating there, marrying there, having babies there.&rdquo;       Photos &copy; James Edward Westcott, courtesy of the National Archives"}, {"content": "Minor in Science and Society                                                                                                               NYU.edu requires JavaScript be enabled in your browser in order to use important features of the site.

The minor analyzes how the techniques and methodologies of the humanities and social sciences can be used to illuminate both the context and content of science, technology, and medicine. Drawing upon history, philosophy, anthropology, and sociology, students investigate how culture and society frame\u2014and, indeed, are themselves framed by\u2014science, technology, and medicine.   The current influence of scientific, technological, and medical issues on our lives is unprecedented, altering our notions of race, health, responsibility, ownership, ethics, esthetics, and indeed self. We are therefore obliged to understand these critical interactions with a view to understand, and intervene in, the world. The types of questions this minor poses include: How has gene patenting affected both the content and conduct of molecular biology, as well as intellectual property law? What is the relationship between the mathematical descriptions that physicists employ and the nature of physical phenomena? What are the ethical and political issues involved in human embryonic stem cell research? How do machines shape esthetics? What, if anything, is the difference between a machine and a human? How does nature have a history?   This minor serves as an enlightening complement to pre-health studies, pre-law studies relevant to intellectual property, biotechnology, and environmental and healthcare studies. It also provides a potent training to those interested in pursuing advanced degrees in the history, philosophy, sociology, or anthropology of science, technology, or medicine.            Program of Study          The minor in Science and Society requires four 4-point courses (16 points). All minors take the core course, Introduction to Science and Society (HIST-UA 94), and then choose three other courses from an approved list. Many courses in the minor fall into one of the following four clusters: technology, physics, biology/prehealth, and environmental sciences. Students are strongly encouraged, however, to be creative and challenge themselves to think in ways other than those that are strictly categorical. For example, a student interested in understanding the difference between the natural and the artificial might take the following three elective courses in addition to the required Introduction to Science and Society course: Philosophy of Biology ; Humans, Machines, and Aesthetics ; and Nature and Technology in Modern America .   Students are also strongly encouraged to take courses in the various schools throughout NYU contributing to the minor. This will expose them to a plethora of diverse pedagogical experiences and greatly enhance co-learning. CAS students may apply 16 points taken in the other schools of NYU toward their degree. Students seeking to raise this limit so as to accommodate the course work of the Minor in Science and Society must file a petition in the Office of the Associate Dean for Students, Silver Center, Room 909; 212-998-8140.    NYU students from outside of CAS are welcome to declare a minor in Science and Society. Students should consult their home-school advisor for policies on their cross-school credit limit.            Required Course in CAS          HIST-UA 94 (4 points)   Introduction to Science &amp; Society  Introduces techniques and approaches used by the humanities and social sciences in studying science, technology, and medicine. Investigates how historians, philosophers, sociologists, and anthropologists apply their methodological toolkit in investigating scientific, technological, and medical knowledge.
