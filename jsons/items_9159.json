Bio   Griffiths's work to date has focused on the intersection of gender, spirituality, and intellectual engagement, especially as these relate to the education of medieval women within the monastic life. Her book, The \u2018Garden of Delights\u2019: Reform and Renaissance for Women in the Twelfth Century (The University of Pennsylvania Press, 2007) explores the involvement of monastic women in the intellectual renaissance and spiritual reform of twelfth-century Europe. The book focuses on the late twelfth-century Hortus deliciarum (Garden of Delights), an illuminated encyclopedia of theology, biblical history, and canon law that was produced at the monastery of Hohenbourg in Alsace by the community\u2019s abbess, Herrad (d. after 1196). This manuscript, one of the very few medieval Latin works to have been created both by and for women, offers a new vantage point from which to consider the culture of female monasticism during this period: it presents decisive evidence of women\u2019s interest and engagement in the spiritual and intellectual vitality by which the twelfth century is now predominantly defined, but from which scholars have often assumed that women were wholly excluded. Griffiths's current project reconsiders the roles played by religious women, and their relationships with male supporters, within the contexts of medieval religious reform movements. From the eleventh century on, church reformers waged a campaign against clerical marriage which historians have suggested carried serious consequences for religious women. As reformers urged priests to avoid not only marriage, but women in general, nuns were often left without sacramental services (the cura monialium, or care of nuns). Yet even in this climate of increasing clerical misogyny, certain men remained willing to involve themselves in spiritual relationships with women; these men saw service to women as a central part of the Christian life. Why such men were drawn to women, and how they defended their involvement with them are the subjects of her present study.
