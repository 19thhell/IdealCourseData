Ideally, students in this Combined Program can complete both degrees in five years. The Department of Comparative Literature is a participant in this program.    A College of Arts and Science brochure outlining general curriculum, admissions, scholarship and financial aid, and advisement of this combined degree program can be obtained from the College Advising Center , Silver 905. This information can also be found on the CAS Accelerate Bachelor's/Master's Program website . As noted in the brochure, students may apply to the program \u201conce they have completed a minimum of 48 credits toward the bachelor\u2019s degree, but not more than 96 credits or six semesters, whichever comes first.\u201d    Steps    Students who are interested in Comparative Literature\u2019s Combined Bachelor\u2019s/Master\u2019s Program and fall within this credit/term range for application should first carefully review the BA/MA CAS Advising Center brochure, the Comp Lit specific BA/MA program requirements noted below, and the Comp Lit M.A. Degree requirements section at the end of this page. If you\u2019re still interested and meet the requirements for eligibility as noted in the above sources , make an appointment to consult with Comp Lit\u2019s Director of Graduate Studies; take a copy of your transcript from ALBERT to that meeting. If the DGS agrees that you have things well underway toward satisfying the requirements specific to the Comp Lit BA/MA (as noted below), the next step is to apply formally at the CAS Advising Center . If your application is approved there, it will be sent to Comp Lit\u2019s DGS for his/her final approval.       Comp Lit Specific BA/MA Program Requirements    To be eligible to apply for the program, applicants for the Comp Lit Combined Bachelor\u2019s/Master\u2019s Program must satisfy admissions criteria outlined in the College of Arts and Science brochure and fulfill the following requirements specific to Comp Lit:           A minimum 3.5 GPA is necessary for admission to and continuation in the program.       Must have completed two graduate level courses that will apply toward the M.A. in Comparative Literature by the time of graduation from CAS. Importantly: 1) these courses must be approved by the Director of Graduate Studies and 2) these courses must be in addition to the courses counted toward the bachelor\u2019s degree       Language proficiency in at least one non-English language must be demonstrated by the time of graduation from CAS. Study in the second non-English language should be underway before graduation from CAS and fulfilled in the full year of Master\u2019s coursework following CAS graduation. See attached \u201cThe M.A. Degree\u201d for various ways of demonstrating non-English language proficiency.    Students earning the M.A. in the Combined Bachelor\u2019s/Master\u2019s Program must satisfy the same requirements as those earning the M.A. in the Combined Master\u2019s/Ph.D Program. These rigorous requirements are outlined below.                                               THE M.A. DEGREE        A. COURSE WORK    \u00b7  8 courses (32 points ) TOTAL , of which:    \u00b7  5 courses (20 points) are in the department.    \u00b7  3 courses (12 points) are outside the department (and relevant to the student\u2019s teaching and research goals).    The student must include the three following requirements within the first 32 points:    1.  \u201cSeminar in Literature: Research Methods and Techniques - Practice and Theory\u201d to be taken FIRST MA term at NYU.     2.  Literary Criticism/Theory before 1800* ( NOTE FOR BA/MA STUDENTS: This course is          normally offered every other year. Students in the BA/MA Program should enroll in the \u201cpre-       1800\u201d course in their senior undergraduate year or their MA year.)     3.  Contemporary (20th Century) Literary Criticism/theory    * Both theory courses may be satisfied in or out of the department; they need not be survey courses; advisor\u2019s approval required. If you take a course outside the department to satisfy one of the above requirements, you have the option of having it count for one of the three required \u201coutside\u201d courses, but it need not preclude your taking additional courses outside the department. Consult your advisor.    The student may transfer up to 2 courses (8 points of credit for GRADUATE classes taken at another institution and not already credited towards a degree (including B.A.). With an advisor\u2019s approval, the student may count transferred courses towards part of the year-long criticism/theory requirement or as part of distribution requirements.    B. LANGUAGES    For the M.A. degree, the students must demonstrate proficiency in two non-English languages. You may do this in one of the following ways:    1.  Foreign Language Proficiency Exams are administered (for a fee) each March, August, and November by the Office of Academic and Student Life. Register online at: http://gsas.nyu.edu/page/grad. life.flpe . Note that registration deadlines are usually a month in advance of the exam.    2.  Native proficiency demonstrated by a degree from a non-Anglophone foreign university. **    3.  A graduate level literature course, taught in the language, (grade of \u2018B\u2019 or better) in any of the language departments at NYU. **    4.  An upper level, undergraduate LITERATURE class, taught in the language, taken within two years of your fist registration at NYU for which you received a \u2018B\u2019 or better. **    **Note: if you choose to satisfy your language requirements using any of the last three methods, you must apply for \u201clanguage equivalency.\u201d This means that even if you take 3 courses, for example in the Spanish department, or you are from Austria, or you had an undergraduate major in French, and so forth, you will not have proven any proficiency until you have applied for such with the departmental Graduate Administrative Aide. You are strongly encouraged to apply for language equivalency as soon as you are able -- in the cases of undergraduate equivalency and native speakers, for example, you should apply your first semester. Similarly, after you have finished a graduate course in a national language, apply immediately. Failure to do so may result in extremely tedious complications which can interfere with obtaining your degree in a timely manner.    C. QUALIFYING PAPER (aka Master\u2019s Thesis)    The qualifying paper must be written and approved by the end of your MA year . The paper is meant to be one which you have already submitted for a seminar and to which you would like to return in order to polish the argument to a \u201cpublishable\u201d standard. In this instance, \u201cpublishable\u201d means: that the paper should be grammatically and stylistically beyond reproach; that the issues and arguments of the essay are presented in a comprehensive and knowledgeable way; and that the essay makes a genuine contribution to scholarship and enters into current debates and issues in the field. Ultimately, the paper should be one which could or will be presented at a conference or published in a journal. This includes review essays, which often provide excellent opportunity for your first publication.    Guidelines for the Qualifying Paper:    \u00b7  It must be typed and legible.     \u00b7  Length is variable, but often ranges from 20-35 pages.     The final version must be preceded by a title sheet.     \u00b7  The Qualifying Paper is read and approved by TWO readers, each of whom MUST SIGN BOTH THE TITLE PAGE AND A \u201cMASTER THESIS READER SHEET\u201d (available from the Graduate Administrative Aide).    \u00b7  The readers are to be chosen by the student in consultation with the department. The first reader is generally the faculty member for whom the paper was originally written. Students should meet with The Chair or DGS to initiate this process. At least one of the two readers must be a member of the Comparative Literature Faculty.    Qualifying papers should be submitted to both readers at least two weeks before graduation deadlines (in January, May, and September). Consult the Graduate Administrative Aide each semester to find out about these deadlines.

Requirements: Two 8 page papers and a presentation on a  class reading.   Unless otherwise noted, readings will  be posted on NYU Classes course site.  Revisiting the Western Classics: Ancient Materialisms: Matter &amp; Gender in Classical Antiquity Bianchi      In the face of the rising popularity of \u201cnew materialisms\u201d it  is important to remember that the notion of \u201cmatter\u201d itself arose in a specific  historical and philosophical context in classical antiquity. Matter, from the  Latin \u2018 materia \u2019 (related to mater, mother) itself emerged from  Aristotle\u2019s Greek innovation hul\u00ea (literally,  wood). In this class we will undertake close readings of key ancient works on  the origin and constitution of the natural world and its intersections with the  human world, including prephilosophical cosmogonies, Presocratic philosophies  of nature, Aeschylus\u2019 Oresteia, Greek  atomism, Plato\u2019s Timaeus , Aristotle\u2019s   Physics, Metaphysics, and Generation of Animals , and Lucretius\u2019 De Rerum Natura, tracing the emergence  of discourses of materiality alongside and in concert with tropes of sex and  gender. To assist us in this endeavor we will draw on contemporary readings including  Heidegger, Kristeva, Irigaray, Loraux, Butler, and Grosz, as well as critically  engaging Bachofen\u2019s 19 th century conception of Mutterrecht . Some background knowledge of psychoanalytic theory is  advised as is knowledge of Greek, however all readings will be in translation. Topics in Caribbean Literature: Comparatism, Contigency, and the Caribbean Dopico  \u201c The Caribbean,\u201d as David Scott has  argued, \u201cis not merely modern\u2026. it is modern in a fundamentally inaugural way.\u201d  What does it mean to think of the Caribbean as an inaugural imaginary? And what does the Caribbean mean in a  post-colonial, post-socialist, post-revolutionary age? A long host of thinkers, writers and artists  of the nineteenth and twentieth century have insisted on the centrality of the  Caribbean as root and rhizome in our understanding of modernity and its  elements: enlightenment and capital, race and empire, sovereignty and  simulation, culture and nation, and, most romantically, or tragically,  revolution. But to think the Caribbean adequately one has to think beyond the  dialectics of roots and rhizome, beyond the poetics of relation, archipelago  and diaspora. This demands too that we read  beyond the tragic and monumental tropes of the Caribbean and read instead minor  forms and minor keys. Thinking and reading the Caribbean requires not only linguistic  and theoretical fluencies, but a capacity to read deep contexts and  contingencies within apparent economies of cultural and material scarcity. It  requires the capacity to engage the master paradigms of modernity and  simultaneously engage the more slippery problems of temporality, contingency,  misunderstanding, as well as the violent and demoralizing mechanisms of  domination, transaction and subordination.  This course considers  key texts and works of the Caribbean archipelago and reads them comparatively  and sometimes against the grain of their national, regional and postcolonial  inscriptions. We will read major cultural works and lesser-known expressions,  major literary works and alongside minor or forgotten forms. We will consider how the cultural monuments  of the Caribbean have occluded collective politics, aesthetic experiments,  insurgent movements and ephemeral forms. We counter pose the monumentality of  literature to the epistemologies and historical consciousness of other cultural  practices, aiming both for the contrapuntal and the counterintuitive. How, for example, have we come to understand  the Haitian Revolution or the Cuban Revolution within grand narratives and what  would it mean to read in them not epic, tragic destinies but more banal  parables about modernity \u2014destinies consonant with other forms of communal  politics, other orders of transaction and betrayal, from Paris, to Prague, from  Berlin to Grenada? Comparative questions abound: What does it mean to read a history of  revolution and civil rights in the Caribbean nineteenth century? What is the  specificity of Caribbean race theory? What is the distance between a history of  literature and a history of print culture in the Caribbean? How does literature  compete with visual aesthetics? How do  we \u201cread\u201d Aponte\u2019s lost book or desacralize Walcott\u2019s Omeros? How does Patrick Chamoiseau destroy the  postcolonial novel? How does Dulce Mar\u00eda Loynaz precede Sebald by half a  century? Why is Virgilio Pi\u00f1era like  Franz Kafka?  We will also ask  about discursive notions of the Caribbean: what and whether the reparative  poetics of relation and antillanit\u00e9 hold . We will engage the divisions between  Francophone, Anglophone, and Hispanophone Caribbean studies and trace cultural  and theoretical genealogies and segregations, asking if the Caribbean has a  common culture beyond the major tropic/al conceits that artists and scholars  have used to bind literary production. We will ask, in the tradition of Edward  Said, whether, like the East, \u201cCaribbeanism\u201d  becomes a career, what the field might mean, and how it exists. What is the place of the Caribbean in the  conceptions and political destinies of the American hemisphere or the Global  South? The syllabus is still  in progress but will include selections from major canonical Caribbean texts  (Casal, Hostos, James, M\u00e9traux, C\u00e9saire, Price Mars, Ma\u00f1ach, Marinello, Ortiz,  Cabrera, Walcott, Brathwaite, Lamming),    theorists and historians of the Caribbean (James, Cesaire, Glissant,  Moreno Fraginals, Ben\u00edtez Rojo, Trouillot, Scott), twentieth century literature (Carpentier,  Burgos, Loynaz, Lezama, Rodr\u00edguez Juli\u00e1, Pi\u00f1era, Walcott) through to the post-colonial Caribbean  Anglophone corpus and onto contemporary writers from Rita Indiana Hern\u00e1ndez to  Marlon James. We will pay special  attention to breaking postcolonial linguistic segregations, but also be mindful  of the operations and problem of genre, print culture, journal, performance,  and the pedagogies of civil society. We  will consider the formation of Caribbean Studies as a field and think of the  ways that journals from Or\u00edgenes and Tropiques , to Callaloo and Small Axe transform critical, artistic  and activist interventions on the Caribbean, and translate to intellectual  practices in the academy.          Comparative Poetics/Proseminar in Poetics &amp; Theory: Prose and Cons: Poetics in the Age of Prose Gadberry The long eighteenth-century has accrued a long   series of appellations, the Age of Reason, the Enlightenment, the   Augustan Age, and the Age of Prose among them. At the end of the   seventeenth century, the famous poet and critic Boileau is said to have   announced that Descartes himself had \u201ccut poetry\u2019s throat\u201d while Matthew   Arnold looked back and deemed even the great poets of the eighteenth   century to be writing prose in their verse. Our course attempts to   uncover the fate of poetics in this \u201cage of prose and reason.\u201d How and   where do we find poetics at a moment at which poetry appears to be dead?   Our inquiry will pursue the longstanding antagonism between philosophy   and poetry as we plumb texts central to the conceptual legacy of the   period before the revival of poetics and poetry with Romanticism. Is   there a poetics of reason, of toleration, of common sense, of   laissez-faire? Just where does poetry go, and what might this have to do   with the birth of criticism? How does a poetics undergird the   subjectivities and, indeed, the systems that authors of the period   imagine? As we read texts of the period, we will engage twentieth- and   twenty-first-century interlocutors who will help us puzzle over what and   where poetry is in the moments of its apparent defeat or disappearance. Early   modern texts may include works by Hobbes, Milton, Locke, Corneille,   Boileau, Pope, Defoe, Baumgarten, Kant, Shaftesbury, Rousseau, and Vico.   Our modern texts may include works by Benjamin, Badiou, Derrida,   Peirce, Wittgenstein, Richards, among others. All texts will be   available in translation, but reading knowledge of French and/or German a   plus.      Culture and Critique: Transnational America Garcia This  seminar examines the transnational turn in U.S. literary studies and the  resulting reconfiguration of the relationship between American Studies and  Comparative Literature. We explore aesthetic renderings of \u201cAmerica\u201d during  different historical junctures and devote special attention to  re-conceptualizations of \u201cAmerica\u201d that create new objects of analysis, both  smaller and larger than the nation-form. If \u201ctrans\u201d is from the Latin for  \u201cover, across or beyond,\u201d we ask what it means to think about American  literature as \u201cover,\u201d \u201cacross,\u201d or \u201cbeyond\u201d the nation form. Along the way, we  examine divergent practices of comparative cultural studies, including theories  of the Black Atlantic, and more recent efforts to globally re-map American  literary cultures and theorize American literature through concepts of the  planetary. Alongside works by such writers as Henry James, W. E. B. Du Bois, Jean  Toomer and Eric Walrond, and more recent contributions by such authors as  Joseph O\u2019Neill and Mohsin Hamid, we consider past and present social theory and  cultural criticism that impinge upon twenty-first century comparative literary  studies and American studies alike. Tropics in Translation: Translation and Comparatism  Halim In various ways, translation has always played a signal role  in comparatism. Aiming to shed light on both issues within translation theory  and the changing nature of Comparative Literature, this course will address the  topic in relation to: World Literature, travelling theory, Translation Studies vis-\u00e0-vis  Comparative Literature, and South-South comparatism, among others. Readings by:  Amal Amireh, Emily Apter, Talal Asad, Susan Bassnett, David Damrosch, Ferial  Ghazoul, Richard Jacquemond, Mohja Kahf, Andr\u00e9 Lefevere, Edward Said, Gayatri  Spivak, Haun Saussy, Harish Trivedi, Lawrence Venuti, and others. Biopolitics and Culture in Contemporary Spain Matos-Martin     The notion of biopolitics is widely used today in many  disciplines and discourses to reflect on issues as diverse as neoliberalism,  globalization, fascism, demographic changes, global security, or health  problems. This notion, however, has been relatively little used in Spain. In  this course students will be introduced to different theories of biopolitics  --with an emphasis on violence and exclusion practices-- as articulated in  Spanish contemporary culture. As such, we will mostly analyze films and literary  texts that address experiences of social and political exclusion, marginality,  precariousness, abandonment or poverty within the modern Spanish context\u2014from  the Spanish Civil War to the current moment of economic crisis. Theoretical  readings will include, among others, Foucault, Agamben, Esposito, Lemke,  Mbembe, Bauman, Lazzarato, Balibar, Butler, Negri and Ranci\u00e8re. Topics in African Literature: Africa--In Theory Sanders     Recently there has been an  explosion in \u201ctheory from the South.\u201d Some of the most exciting interventions  have come from African theorists such as Ato Quayson, Achille Mbembe, Jean and  John Comaroff, and Mahmood Mamdani. Taking recent works by these theorists as  our starting point, we will explore the application and adaptation of  metropolitan thinkers such as Foucault, Derrida, and Schmitt, in order to  theorize \u201cnecropolitics,\u201d genocide, and xenophobia, among other burning issues.  We will also take stock of earlier endeavors by Africanist and Afro-Americanist  thinkers such as Du Bois, Senghor, Mudimbe, Soyinka, and Ngugi to define  critically Africa\u2019s specific contributions to the making (and making sense of)  the world that all of us inhabit. Since a number of these thinkers are also  writers and/or literary theorists, we shall also be analyzing key recent texts  by Ahmadou Kourouma, Phaswane Mpe, and Antjie Krog.

Students in the BA/MA Program should enroll in the \u201cpre-       1800\u201d course in their senior undergraduate year or their MA year.)     3.  Contemporary (20th Century) Literary Criticism/theory    * Both theory courses may be satisfied in or out of the department; they need not be survey courses; advisor\u2019s approval required. If you take a course outside the department to satisfy one of the above requirements, you have the option of having it count for one of the three required \u201coutside\u201d courses, but it need not preclude your taking additional courses outside the department. Consult your advisor.    The student may transfer up to 2 courses (8 points of credit for GRADUATE classes taken at another institution and not already credited towards a degree (including B.A.). With an advisor\u2019s approval, the student may count transferred courses towards part of the year-long criticism/theory requirement or as part of distribution requirements.    B. LANGUAGES    For the M.A. degree, the students must demonstrate proficiency in two non-English languages. You may do this in one of the following ways:    1.  Foreign Language Proficiency Exams are administered (for a fee) each March, August, and November by the Office of Academic and Student Life. Register online at: http://gsas.nyu.edu/page/grad. life.flpe . Note that registration deadlines are usually a month in advance of the exam.    2.  Native proficiency demonstrated by a degree from a non-Anglophone foreign university. **    3.  A graduate level literature course, taught in the language, (grade of \u2018B\u2019 or better) in any of the language departments at NYU. **    4.  An upper level, undergraduate LITERATURE class, taught in the language, taken within two years of your fist registration at NYU for which you received a \u2018B\u2019 or better. **    **Note: if you choose to satisfy your language requirements using any of the last three methods, you must apply for \u201clanguage equivalency.\u201d This means that even if you take 3 courses, for example in the Spanish department, or you are from Austria, or you had an undergraduate major in French, and so forth, you will not have proven any proficiency until you have applied for such with the departmental Graduate Administrative Aide. You are strongly encouraged to apply for language equivalency as soon as you are able -- in the cases of undergraduate equivalency and native speakers, for example, you should apply your first semester. Similarly, after you have finished a graduate course in a national language, apply immediately. Failure to do so may result in extremely tedious complications which can interfere with obtaining your degree in a timely manner.    C. QUALIFYING PAPER (aka Master\u2019s Thesis)    The qualifying paper must be written and approved by the end of your MA year . The paper is meant to be one which you have already submitted for a seminar and to which you would like to return in order to polish the argument to a \u201cpublishable\u201d standard. In this instance, \u201cpublishable\u201d means: that the paper should be grammatically and stylistically beyond reproach; that the issues and arguments of the essay are presented in a comprehensive and knowledgeable way; and that the essay makes a genuine contribution to scholarship and enters into current debates and issues in the field. Ultimately, the paper should be one which could or will be presented at a conference or published in a journal. This includes review essays, which often provide excellent opportunity for your first publication.    Guidelines for the Qualifying Paper:    \u00b7  It must be typed and legible.     \u00b7  Length is variable, but often ranges from 20-35 pages.     The final version must be preceded by a title sheet.     \u00b7  The Qualifying Paper is read and approved by TWO readers, each of whom MUST SIGN BOTH THE TITLE PAGE AND A \u201cMASTER THESIS READER SHEET\u201d (available from the Graduate Administrative Aide).    \u00b7  The readers are to be chosen by the student in consultation with the department. The first reader is generally the faculty member for whom the paper was originally written. Students should meet with The Chair or DGS to initiate this process. At least one of the two readers must be a member of the Comparative Literature Faculty.    Qualifying papers should be submitted to both readers at least two weeks before graduation deadlines (in January, May, and September). Consult the Graduate Administrative Aide each semester to find out about these deadlines.

Requirements: Two 8 page papers and a presentation on a  class reading.   Unless otherwise noted, readings will  be posted on NYU Classes course site.  Revisiting the Western Classics: Ancient Materialisms: Matter &amp; Gender in Classical Antiquity Bianchi      In the face of the rising popularity of \u201cnew materialisms\u201d it  is important to remember that the notion of \u201cmatter\u201d itself arose in a specific  historical and philosophical context in classical antiquity. Matter, from the  Latin \u2018 materia \u2019 (related to mater, mother) itself emerged from  Aristotle\u2019s Greek innovation hul\u00ea (literally,  wood). In this class we will undertake close readings of key ancient works on  the origin and constitution of the natural world and its intersections with the  human world, including prephilosophical cosmogonies, Presocratic philosophies  of nature, Aeschylus\u2019 Oresteia, Greek  atomism, Plato\u2019s Timaeus , Aristotle\u2019s   Physics, Metaphysics, and Generation of Animals , and Lucretius\u2019 De Rerum Natura, tracing the emergence  of discourses of materiality alongside and in concert with tropes of sex and  gender. To assist us in this endeavor we will draw on contemporary readings including  Heidegger, Kristeva, Irigaray, Loraux, Butler, and Grosz, as well as critically  engaging Bachofen\u2019s 19 th century conception of Mutterrecht . Some background knowledge of psychoanalytic theory is  advised as is knowledge of Greek, however all readings will be in translation. Topics in Caribbean Literature: Comparatism, Contigency, and the Caribbean Dopico  \u201c The Caribbean,\u201d as David Scott has  argued, \u201cis not merely modern\u2026. it is modern in a fundamentally inaugural way.\u201d  What does it mean to think of the Caribbean as an inaugural imaginary? And what does the Caribbean mean in a  post-colonial, post-socialist, post-revolutionary age? A long host of thinkers, writers and artists  of the nineteenth and twentieth century have insisted on the centrality of the  Caribbean as root and rhizome in our understanding of modernity and its  elements: enlightenment and capital, race and empire, sovereignty and  simulation, culture and nation, and, most romantically, or tragically,  revolution. But to think the Caribbean adequately one has to think beyond the  dialectics of roots and rhizome, beyond the poetics of relation, archipelago  and diaspora. This demands too that we read  beyond the tragic and monumental tropes of the Caribbean and read instead minor  forms and minor keys. Thinking and reading the Caribbean requires not only linguistic  and theoretical fluencies, but a capacity to read deep contexts and  contingencies within apparent economies of cultural and material scarcity. It  requires the capacity to engage the master paradigms of modernity and  simultaneously engage the more slippery problems of temporality, contingency,  misunderstanding, as well as the violent and demoralizing mechanisms of  domination, transaction and subordination.  This course considers  key texts and works of the Caribbean archipelago and reads them comparatively  and sometimes against the grain of their national, regional and postcolonial  inscriptions. We will read major cultural works and lesser-known expressions,  major literary works and alongside minor or forgotten forms. We will consider how the cultural monuments  of the Caribbean have occluded collective politics, aesthetic experiments,  insurgent movements and ephemeral forms. We counter pose the monumentality of  literature to the epistemologies and historical consciousness of other cultural  practices, aiming both for the contrapuntal and the counterintuitive. How, for example, have we come to understand  the Haitian Revolution or the Cuban Revolution within grand narratives and what  would it mean to read in them not epic, tragic destinies but more banal  parables about modernity \u2014destinies consonant with other forms of communal  politics, other orders of transaction and betrayal, from Paris, to Prague, from  Berlin to Grenada? Comparative questions abound: What does it mean to read a history of  revolution and civil rights in the Caribbean nineteenth century? What is the  specificity of Caribbean race theory? What is the distance between a history of  literature and a history of print culture in the Caribbean? How does literature  compete with visual aesthetics? How do  we \u201cread\u201d Aponte\u2019s lost book or desacralize Walcott\u2019s Omeros? How does Patrick Chamoiseau destroy the  postcolonial novel? How does Dulce Mar\u00eda Loynaz precede Sebald by half a  century? Why is Virgilio Pi\u00f1era like  Franz Kafka?  We will also ask  about discursive notions of the Caribbean: what and whether the reparative  poetics of relation and antillanit\u00e9 hold . We will engage the divisions between  Francophone, Anglophone, and Hispanophone Caribbean studies and trace cultural  and theoretical genealogies and segregations, asking if the Caribbean has a  common culture beyond the major tropic/al conceits that artists and scholars  have used to bind literary production. We will ask, in the tradition of Edward  Said, whether, like the East, \u201cCaribbeanism\u201d  becomes a career, what the field might mean, and how it exists. What is the place of the Caribbean in the  conceptions and political destinies of the American hemisphere or the Global  South? The syllabus is still  in progress but will include selections from major canonical Caribbean texts  (Casal, Hostos, James, M\u00e9traux, C\u00e9saire, Price Mars, Ma\u00f1ach, Marinello, Ortiz,  Cabrera, Walcott, Brathwaite, Lamming),    theorists and historians of the Caribbean (James, Cesaire, Glissant,  Moreno Fraginals, Ben\u00edtez Rojo, Trouillot, Scott), twentieth century literature (Carpentier,  Burgos, Loynaz, Lezama, Rodr\u00edguez Juli\u00e1, Pi\u00f1era, Walcott) through to the post-colonial Caribbean  Anglophone corpus and onto contemporary writers from Rita Indiana Hern\u00e1ndez to  Marlon James. We will pay special  attention to breaking postcolonial linguistic segregations, but also be mindful  of the operations and problem of genre, print culture, journal, performance,  and the pedagogies of civil society. We  will consider the formation of Caribbean Studies as a field and think of the  ways that journals from Or\u00edgenes and Tropiques , to Callaloo and Small Axe transform critical, artistic  and activist interventions on the Caribbean, and translate to intellectual  practices in the academy.          Comparative Poetics/Proseminar in Poetics &amp; Theory: Prose and Cons: Poetics in the Age of Prose Gadberry The long eighteenth-century has accrued a long   series of appellations, the Age of Reason, the Enlightenment, the   Augustan Age, and the Age of Prose among them. At the end of the   seventeenth century, the famous poet and critic Boileau is said to have   announced that Descartes himself had \u201ccut poetry\u2019s throat\u201d while Matthew   Arnold looked back and deemed even the great poets of the eighteenth   century to be writing prose in their verse. Our course attempts to   uncover the fate of poetics in this \u201cage of prose and reason.\u201d How and   where do we find poetics at a moment at which poetry appears to be dead?   Our inquiry will pursue the longstanding antagonism between philosophy   and poetry as we plumb texts central to the conceptual legacy of the   period before the revival of poetics and poetry with Romanticism. Is   there a poetics of reason, of toleration, of common sense, of   laissez-faire? Just where does poetry go, and what might this have to do   with the birth of criticism? How does a poetics undergird the   subjectivities and, indeed, the systems that authors of the period   imagine? As we read texts of the period, we will engage twentieth- and   twenty-first-century interlocutors who will help us puzzle over what and   where poetry is in the moments of its apparent defeat or disappearance. Early   modern texts may include works by Hobbes, Milton, Locke, Corneille,   Boileau, Pope, Defoe, Baumgarten, Kant, Shaftesbury, Rousseau, and Vico.   Our modern texts may include works by Benjamin, Badiou, Derrida,   Peirce, Wittgenstein, Richards, among others. All texts will be   available in translation, but reading knowledge of French and/or German a   plus.      Culture and Critique: Transnational America Garcia This  seminar examines the transnational turn in U.S. literary studies and the  resulting reconfiguration of the relationship between American Studies and  Comparative Literature. We explore aesthetic renderings of \u201cAmerica\u201d during  different historical junctures and devote special attention to  re-conceptualizations of \u201cAmerica\u201d that create new objects of analysis, both  smaller and larger than the nation-form. If \u201ctrans\u201d is from the Latin for  \u201cover, across or beyond,\u201d we ask what it means to think about American  literature as \u201cover,\u201d \u201cacross,\u201d or \u201cbeyond\u201d the nation form. Along the way, we  examine divergent practices of comparative cultural studies, including theories  of the Black Atlantic, and more recent efforts to globally re-map American  literary cultures and theorize American literature through concepts of the  planetary. Alongside works by such writers as Henry James, W. E. B. Du Bois, Jean  Toomer and Eric Walrond, and more recent contributions by such authors as  Joseph O\u2019Neill and Mohsin Hamid, we consider past and present social theory and  cultural criticism that impinge upon twenty-first century comparative literary  studies and American studies alike. Tropics in Translation: Translation and Comparatism  Halim In various ways, translation has always played a signal role  in comparatism. Aiming to shed light on both issues within translation theory  and the changing nature of Comparative Literature, this course will address the  topic in relation to: World Literature, travelling theory, Translation Studies vis-\u00e0-vis  Comparative Literature, and South-South comparatism, among others. Readings by:  Amal Amireh, Emily Apter, Talal Asad, Susan Bassnett, David Damrosch, Ferial  Ghazoul, Richard Jacquemond, Mohja Kahf, Andr\u00e9 Lefevere, Edward Said, Gayatri  Spivak, Haun Saussy, Harish Trivedi, Lawrence Venuti, and others. Biopolitics and Culture in Contemporary Spain Matos-Martin     The notion of biopolitics is widely used today in many  disciplines and discourses to reflect on issues as diverse as neoliberalism,  globalization, fascism, demographic changes, global security, or health  problems. This notion, however, has been relatively little used in Spain. In  this course students will be introduced to different theories of biopolitics  --with an emphasis on violence and exclusion practices-- as articulated in  Spanish contemporary culture. As such, we will mostly analyze films and literary  texts that address experiences of social and political exclusion, marginality,  precariousness, abandonment or poverty within the modern Spanish context\u2014from  the Spanish Civil War to the current moment of economic crisis. Theoretical  readings will include, among others, Foucault, Agamben, Esposito, Lemke,  Mbembe, Bauman, Lazzarato, Balibar, Butler, Negri and Ranci\u00e8re. Topics in African Literature: Africa--In Theory Sanders     Recently there has been an  explosion in \u201ctheory from the South.\u201d Some of the most exciting interventions  have come from African theorists such as Ato Quayson, Achille Mbembe, Jean and  John Comaroff, and Mahmood Mamdani. Taking recent works by these theorists as  our starting point, we will explore the application and adaptation of  metropolitan thinkers such as Foucault, Derrida, and Schmitt, in order to  theorize \u201cnecropolitics,\u201d genocide, and xenophobia, among other burning issues.  We will also take stock of earlier endeavors by Africanist and Afro-Americanist  thinkers such as Du Bois, Senghor, Mudimbe, Soyinka, and Ngugi to define  critically Africa\u2019s specific contributions to the making (and making sense of)  the world that all of us inhabit. Since a number of these thinkers are also  writers and/or literary theorists, we shall also be analyzing key recent texts  by Ahmadou Kourouma, Phaswane Mpe, and Antjie Krog.

Ideally, students in this Combined Program can complete both degrees in five years. The Department of Comparative Literature is a participant in this program.    A College of Arts and Science brochure outlining general curriculum, admissions, scholarship and financial aid, and advisement of this combined degree program can be obtained from the College Advising Center , Silver 905. This information can also be found on the CAS Accelerate Bachelor's/Master's Program website . As noted in the brochure, students may apply to the program \u201conce they have completed a minimum of 48 credits toward the bachelor\u2019s degree, but not more than 96 credits or six semesters, whichever comes first.\u201d    Steps    Students who are interested in Comparative Literature\u2019s Combined Bachelor\u2019s/Master\u2019s Program and fall within this credit/term range for application should first carefully review the BA/MA CAS Advising Center brochure, the Comp Lit specific BA/MA program requirements noted below, and the Comp Lit M.A. Degree requirements section at the end of this page. If you\u2019re still interested and meet the requirements for eligibility as noted in the above sources , make an appointment to consult with Comp Lit\u2019s Director of Graduate Studies; take a copy of your transcript from ALBERT to that meeting. If the DGS agrees that you have things well underway toward satisfying the requirements specific to the Comp Lit BA/MA (as noted below), the next step is to apply formally at the CAS Advising Center . If your application is approved there, it will be sent to Comp Lit\u2019s DGS for his/her final approval.       Comp Lit Specific BA/MA Program Requirements    To be eligible to apply for the program, applicants for the Comp Lit Combined Bachelor\u2019s/Master\u2019s Program must satisfy admissions criteria outlined in the College of Arts and Science brochure and fulfill the following requirements specific to Comp Lit:           A minimum 3.5 GPA is necessary for admission to and continuation in the program.       Must have completed two graduate level courses that will apply toward the M.A. in Comparative Literature by the time of graduation from CAS. Importantly: 1) these courses must be approved by the Director of Graduate Studies and 2) these courses must be in addition to the courses counted toward the bachelor\u2019s degree       Language proficiency in at least one non-English language must be demonstrated by the time of graduation from CAS. Study in the second non-English language should be underway before graduation from CAS and fulfilled in the full year of Master\u2019s coursework following CAS graduation. See attached \u201cThe M.A. Degree\u201d for various ways of demonstrating non-English language proficiency.    Students earning the M.A. in the Combined Bachelor\u2019s/Master\u2019s Program must satisfy the same requirements as those earning the M.A. in the Combined Master\u2019s/Ph.D Program. These rigorous requirements are outlined below.                                               THE M.A. DEGREE        A.

The student must include the three following requirements within the first 32 points:    1.  \u201cSeminar in Literature: Research Methods and Techniques - Practice and Theory\u201d to be taken FIRST MA term at NYU.     2.  Literary Criticism/Theory before 1800* ( NOTE FOR BA/MA STUDENTS: This course is          normally offered every other year. Students in the BA/MA Program should enroll in the \u201cpre-       1800\u201d course in their senior undergraduate year or their MA year.)     3.  Contemporary (20th Century) Literary Criticism/theory    * Both theory courses may be satisfied in or out of the department; they need not be survey courses; advisor\u2019s approval required. If you take a course outside the department to satisfy one of the above requirements, you have the option of having it count for one of the three required \u201coutside\u201d courses, but it need not preclude your taking additional courses outside the department. Consult your advisor.    The student may transfer up to 2 courses (8 points of credit for GRADUATE classes taken at another institution and not already credited towards a degree (including B.A.). With an advisor\u2019s approval, the student may count transferred courses towards part of the year-long criticism/theory requirement or as part of distribution requirements.    B. LANGUAGES    For the M.A. degree, the students must demonstrate proficiency in two non-English languages. You may do this in one of the following ways:    1.  Foreign Language Proficiency Exams are administered (for a fee) each March, August, and November by the Office of Academic and Student Life. Register online at: http://gsas.nyu.edu/page/grad. life.flpe . Note that registration deadlines are usually a month in advance of the exam.    2.

You are strongly encouraged to apply for language equivalency as soon as you are able -- in the cases of undergraduate equivalency and native speakers, for example, you should apply your first semester. Similarly, after you have finished a graduate course in a national language, apply immediately. Failure to do so may result in extremely tedious complications which can interfere with obtaining your degree in a timely manner.    C. QUALIFYING PAPER (aka Master\u2019s Thesis)    The qualifying paper must be written and approved by the end of your MA year . The paper is meant to be one which you have already submitted for a seminar and to which you would like to return in order to polish the argument to a \u201cpublishable\u201d standard. In this instance, \u201cpublishable\u201d means: that the paper should be grammatically and stylistically beyond reproach; that the issues and arguments of the essay are presented in a comprehensive and knowledgeable way; and that the essay makes a genuine contribution to scholarship and enters into current debates and issues in the field. Ultimately, the paper should be one which could or will be presented at a conference or published in a journal. This includes review essays, which often provide excellent opportunity for your first publication.    Guidelines for the Qualifying Paper:    \u00b7  It must be typed and legible.     \u00b7  Length is variable, but often ranges from 20-35 pages.     The final version must be preceded by a title sheet.     \u00b7  The Qualifying Paper is read and approved by TWO readers, each of whom MUST SIGN BOTH THE TITLE PAGE AND A \u201cMASTER THESIS READER SHEET\u201d (available from the Graduate Administrative Aide).    \u00b7  The readers are to be chosen by the student in consultation with the department. The first reader is generally the faculty member for whom the paper was originally written. Students should meet with The Chair or DGS to initiate this process. At least one of the two readers must be a member of the Comparative Literature Faculty.

Requirements: Two 8 page papers and a presentation on a  class reading.   Unless otherwise noted, readings will  be posted on NYU Classes course site.  Revisiting the Western Classics: Ancient Materialisms: Matter &amp; Gender in Classical Antiquity Bianchi      In the face of the rising popularity of \u201cnew materialisms\u201d it  is important to remember that the notion of \u201cmatter\u201d itself arose in a specific  historical and philosophical context in classical antiquity. Matter, from the  Latin \u2018 materia \u2019 (related to mater, mother) itself emerged from  Aristotle\u2019s Greek innovation hul\u00ea (literally,  wood). In this class we will undertake close readings of key ancient works on  the origin and constitution of the natural world and its intersections with the  human world, including prephilosophical cosmogonies, Presocratic philosophies  of nature, Aeschylus\u2019 Oresteia, Greek  atomism, Plato\u2019s Timaeus , Aristotle\u2019s   Physics, Metaphysics, and Generation of Animals , and Lucretius\u2019 De Rerum Natura, tracing the emergence  of discourses of materiality alongside and in concert with tropes of sex and  gender. To assist us in this endeavor we will draw on contemporary readings including  Heidegger, Kristeva, Irigaray, Loraux, Butler, and Grosz, as well as critically  engaging Bachofen\u2019s 19 th century conception of Mutterrecht . Some background knowledge of psychoanalytic theory is  advised as is knowledge of Greek, however all readings will be in translation. Topics in Caribbean Literature: Comparatism, Contigency, and the Caribbean Dopico  \u201c The Caribbean,\u201d as David Scott has  argued, \u201cis not merely modern\u2026. it is modern in a fundamentally inaugural way.\u201d  What does it mean to think of the Caribbean as an inaugural imaginary? And what does the Caribbean mean in a  post-colonial, post-socialist, post-revolutionary age? A long host of thinkers, writers and artists  of the nineteenth and twentieth century have insisted on the centrality of the  Caribbean as root and rhizome in our understanding of modernity and its  elements: enlightenment and capital, race and empire, sovereignty and  simulation, culture and nation, and, most romantically, or tragically,  revolution. But to think the Caribbean adequately one has to think beyond the  dialectics of roots and rhizome, beyond the poetics of relation, archipelago  and diaspora. This demands too that we read  beyond the tragic and monumental tropes of the Caribbean and read instead minor  forms and minor keys. Thinking and reading the Caribbean requires not only linguistic  and theoretical fluencies, but a capacity to read deep contexts and  contingencies within apparent economies of cultural and material scarcity. It  requires the capacity to engage the master paradigms of modernity and  simultaneously engage the more slippery problems of temporality, contingency,  misunderstanding, as well as the violent and demoralizing mechanisms of  domination, transaction and subordination.  This course considers  key texts and works of the Caribbean archipelago and reads them comparatively  and sometimes against the grain of their national, regional and postcolonial  inscriptions. We will read major cultural works and lesser-known expressions,  major literary works and alongside minor or forgotten forms. We will consider how the cultural monuments  of the Caribbean have occluded collective politics, aesthetic experiments,  insurgent movements and ephemeral forms. We counter pose the monumentality of  literature to the epistemologies and historical consciousness of other cultural  practices, aiming both for the contrapuntal and the counterintuitive. How, for example, have we come to understand  the Haitian Revolution or the Cuban Revolution within grand narratives and what  would it mean to read in them not epic, tragic destinies but more banal  parables about modernity \u2014destinies consonant with other forms of communal  politics, other orders of transaction and betrayal, from Paris, to Prague, from  Berlin to Grenada? Comparative questions abound: What does it mean to read a history of  revolution and civil rights in the Caribbean nineteenth century? What is the  specificity of Caribbean race theory? What is the distance between a history of  literature and a history of print culture in the Caribbean? How does literature  compete with visual aesthetics? How do  we \u201cread\u201d Aponte\u2019s lost book or desacralize Walcott\u2019s Omeros? How does Patrick Chamoiseau destroy the  postcolonial novel? How does Dulce Mar\u00eda Loynaz precede Sebald by half a  century? Why is Virgilio Pi\u00f1era like  Franz Kafka?  We will also ask  about discursive notions of the Caribbean: what and whether the reparative  poetics of relation and antillanit\u00e9 hold . We will engage the divisions between  Francophone, Anglophone, and Hispanophone Caribbean studies and trace cultural  and theoretical genealogies and segregations, asking if the Caribbean has a  common culture beyond the major tropic/al conceits that artists and scholars  have used to bind literary production. We will ask, in the tradition of Edward  Said, whether, like the East, \u201cCaribbeanism\u201d  becomes a career, what the field might mean, and how it exists. What is the place of the Caribbean in the  conceptions and political destinies of the American hemisphere or the Global  South? The syllabus is still  in progress but will include selections from major canonical Caribbean texts  (Casal, Hostos, James, M\u00e9traux, C\u00e9saire, Price Mars, Ma\u00f1ach, Marinello, Ortiz,  Cabrera, Walcott, Brathwaite, Lamming),    theorists and historians of the Caribbean (James, Cesaire, Glissant,  Moreno Fraginals, Ben\u00edtez Rojo, Trouillot, Scott), twentieth century literature (Carpentier,  Burgos, Loynaz, Lezama, Rodr\u00edguez Juli\u00e1, Pi\u00f1era, Walcott) through to the post-colonial Caribbean  Anglophone corpus and onto contemporary writers from Rita Indiana Hern\u00e1ndez to  Marlon James. We will pay special  attention to breaking postcolonial linguistic segregations, but also be mindful  of the operations and problem of genre, print culture, journal, performance,  and the pedagogies of civil society. We  will consider the formation of Caribbean Studies as a field and think of the  ways that journals from Or\u00edgenes and Tropiques , to Callaloo and Small Axe transform critical, artistic  and activist interventions on the Caribbean, and translate to intellectual  practices in the academy.          Comparative Poetics/Proseminar in Poetics &amp; Theory: Prose and Cons: Poetics in the Age of Prose Gadberry The long eighteenth-century has accrued a long   series of appellations, the Age of Reason, the Enlightenment, the   Augustan Age, and the Age of Prose among them. At the end of the   seventeenth century, the famous poet and critic Boileau is said to have   announced that Descartes himself had \u201ccut poetry\u2019s throat\u201d while Matthew   Arnold looked back and deemed even the great poets of the eighteenth   century to be writing prose in their verse. Our course attempts to   uncover the fate of poetics in this \u201cage of prose and reason.\u201d How and   where do we find poetics at a moment at which poetry appears to be dead?   Our inquiry will pursue the longstanding antagonism between philosophy   and poetry as we plumb texts central to the conceptual legacy of the   period before the revival of poetics and poetry with Romanticism. Is   there a poetics of reason, of toleration, of common sense, of   laissez-faire? Just where does poetry go, and what might this have to do   with the birth of criticism? How does a poetics undergird the   subjectivities and, indeed, the systems that authors of the period   imagine? As we read texts of the period, we will engage twentieth- and   twenty-first-century interlocutors who will help us puzzle over what and   where poetry is in the moments of its apparent defeat or disappearance. Early   modern texts may include works by Hobbes, Milton, Locke, Corneille,   Boileau, Pope, Defoe, Baumgarten, Kant, Shaftesbury, Rousseau, and Vico.   Our modern texts may include works by Benjamin, Badiou, Derrida,   Peirce, Wittgenstein, Richards, among others. All texts will be   available in translation, but reading knowledge of French and/or German a   plus.      Culture and Critique: Transnational America Garcia This  seminar examines the transnational turn in U.S. literary studies and the  resulting reconfiguration of the relationship between American Studies and  Comparative Literature. We explore aesthetic renderings of \u201cAmerica\u201d during  different historical junctures and devote special attention to  re-conceptualizations of \u201cAmerica\u201d that create new objects of analysis, both  smaller and larger than the nation-form. If \u201ctrans\u201d is from the Latin for  \u201cover, across or beyond,\u201d we ask what it means to think about American  literature as \u201cover,\u201d \u201cacross,\u201d or \u201cbeyond\u201d the nation form. Along the way, we  examine divergent practices of comparative cultural studies, including theories  of the Black Atlantic, and more recent efforts to globally re-map American  literary cultures and theorize American literature through concepts of the  planetary. Alongside works by such writers as Henry James, W. E. B. Du Bois, Jean  Toomer and Eric Walrond, and more recent contributions by such authors as  Joseph O\u2019Neill and Mohsin Hamid, we consider past and present social theory and  cultural criticism that impinge upon twenty-first century comparative literary  studies and American studies alike. Tropics in Translation: Translation and Comparatism  Halim In various ways, translation has always played a signal role  in comparatism. Aiming to shed light on both issues within translation theory  and the changing nature of Comparative Literature, this course will address the  topic in relation to: World Literature, travelling theory, Translation Studies vis-\u00e0-vis  Comparative Literature, and South-South comparatism, among others. Readings by:  Amal Amireh, Emily Apter, Talal Asad, Susan Bassnett, David Damrosch, Ferial  Ghazoul, Richard Jacquemond, Mohja Kahf, Andr\u00e9 Lefevere, Edward Said, Gayatri  Spivak, Haun Saussy, Harish Trivedi, Lawrence Venuti, and others. Biopolitics and Culture in Contemporary Spain Matos-Martin     The notion of biopolitics is widely used today in many  disciplines and discourses to reflect on issues as diverse as neoliberalism,  globalization, fascism, demographic changes, global security, or health  problems. This notion, however, has been relatively little used in Spain. In  this course students will be introduced to different theories of biopolitics  --with an emphasis on violence and exclusion practices-- as articulated in  Spanish contemporary culture. As such, we will mostly analyze films and literary  texts that address experiences of social and political exclusion, marginality,  precariousness, abandonment or poverty within the modern Spanish context\u2014from  the Spanish Civil War to the current moment of economic crisis. Theoretical  readings will include, among others, Foucault, Agamben, Esposito, Lemke,  Mbembe, Bauman, Lazzarato, Balibar, Butler, Negri and Ranci\u00e8re. Topics in African Literature: Africa--In Theory Sanders     Recently there has been an  explosion in \u201ctheory from the South.\u201d Some of the most exciting interventions  have come from African theorists such as Ato Quayson, Achille Mbembe, Jean and  John Comaroff, and Mahmood Mamdani. Taking recent works by these theorists as  our starting point, we will explore the application and adaptation of  metropolitan thinkers such as Foucault, Derrida, and Schmitt, in order to  theorize \u201cnecropolitics,\u201d genocide, and xenophobia, among other burning issues.  We will also take stock of earlier endeavors by Africanist and Afro-Americanist  thinkers such as Du Bois, Senghor, Mudimbe, Soyinka, and Ngugi to define  critically Africa\u2019s specific contributions to the making (and making sense of)  the world that all of us inhabit. Since a number of these thinkers are also  writers and/or literary theorists, we shall also be analyzing key recent texts  by Ahmadou Kourouma, Phaswane Mpe, and Antjie Krog.

We will read literary works by Disraeli, Stendhal, Trollope, Zola, Mallarm\u00e9 and Proust that explore the microphenomenology of political life; the diffusion and dilution of \"the Political\" in the social; the elusiveness and formlessness of the political event; the role of contingency in A central question will be: How is politics as a scene of maneuvers and application of cunning (is Machiavellianism) mapped on (or not) to formal, abstract models of political aesthetics (capitalist epic, democracy in language, the \"revolutionary\" dimension of avant-gardism, comic forms of class struggle, tragic forms of communitas)? The final section of the course will examine politics as a popular, contemporary genre, especially in film and epic television serials. Examples studied will be Roberto Saviano's hit TV series Come Away With Me (read with Paolo Flores d'Arcais,'s \"Anatomy of Berlusconismo), Armando Iannucci's film In the Loop, and the recent TV series House of Cards.  Revisiting the Western Classics: Ancient Materialisms: Matter &amp; Gender in Classical Antiquity  Bianchi This is the first part of a two-course sequence on the history of materialisms in Western philosophy and literature. The second will be taught by Jacques Lezra in Spring 2014. Each class may be taken independently. In the face of the rising popularity of \u201cnew materialisms\u201d it is important to remember that the notion of \u201cmatter\u201d itself arose in a specific historical context in classical antiquity. Matter, from the Latin \u2018materia\u2019 (related to mater, mother) itself emerged from Aristotle\u2019s Greek innovation hul\u00ea (literally, wood). In this class we will undertake close readings of key ancient texts, including prephilosophical cosmogonies, Presocratic philosophies of nature, Greek atomism, Plato\u2019s Timaeus, Aristotle\u2019s Physics, Metaphysics, and Generation of Animals, and Lucretius\u2019 De Rerum Natura, tracing the emergence of discourses of materiality alongside and in concert with tropes of sex and gender. To assist us in this endeavor we will draw on contemporary readings including those of Kristeva, Irigaray, Butler, and Grosz, as well as critically engaging Bachofen\u2019s 19th century conception of Mutterrecht. Some background knowledge of psychoanalytic theory is advised as is knowledge of Greek, however all readings will be in translation.  Topics in Black Literature: Fanon &amp; Glissant as Post Negritude Thinkers  Diawara The idea is to take the 1956 Congress of Black Writers and Artists, organized by Presence Africaine in Paris (at the Sorbonne), as a seminal moment, not only for the theories of decolonization, but also for ways of imagining Black and African modernities beyond Negritude. For the first time at this, writers, writers were proposing alternative ideas--Metissage, creolization and national culture--instead of the all encompassing theory of Negritude and its variances of Africanism. The course will first focus on the significance of this Congress to what we call Black Cultural Studies, today, and then attempt to situate and read the texts of Fanon and Glissant in relation to Senghor and Cesaire.  Special Topics in Theory: Edward Said, Comparative Genealogies, and Intellectual Practice Dopico Ten years after his death, we reflect on the intellectual and political legacies, the critical genealogies, and the web of affiliations and interlocutors that Edward Said inscribed for comparative literature. We consider his works from Beginnings on and engage alongside his texts those of his chief influences and interlocutors, including Vico, Gramsci, Arendt, Auerbach, de Man, Derrida, Foucault, Williams and Hall. We will think about his work, his negotiations with various genealogies and intellectual formations, and his role in redefining disciplinary boundaries, historical disciplines like comparatism and emergent fields like postcolonial studies. We will think about his practices as an academic and public intellectual, consider how Said reflected on genre, medium, vocation, and worldliness, and how the essay served as the paradigmatic heuristic practice for his critical engagements.  Culture and Critique: Transnational America   Garcia This seminar examines the transnational turn in U.S. literary studies and the resulting reconfiguration of the relationship between American Studies and Comparative Literature. We explore aesthetic accounts of \u201cAmerica\u201d during different historical junctures and devote special attention to re-conceptualizations of \u201cAmerica\u201d that create new objects of analysis, both smaller and larger than the nation-form. If \u201ctrans\u201d is from the Latin for \u201cover, across or beyond,\u201d we ask what it means to think about American literature as \u201cover,\u201d \u201cacross,\u201d or \u201cbeyond\u201d the nation form. We examine longstanding varieties of comparative cultural studies, including theories of the Black Atlantic, and more recent efforts to globally re-map American literary cultures and theorize American literature through concepts of the planetary. Among our recurrent themes will be the anti-colonial imagination nurtured by transnational intellectual cultures. Alongside works by such writers as Henry James, Claude McKay, Sherwood Anderson, Nella Larsen, and Jean Toomer, we consider the implications of recent social theory (Spivak, Laclau, Zizek, among others) for twenty-first century comparative American studies.  Discourse and Society: Third Worldism: Bandung, Afro-Asianness, Non-Alignment, &amp; the Middle East  Halim This course addresses a series of overlapping Third-Worldist internationalist movements starting from Bandung (1955) with a focus on the Middle East. Through theoretical texts, journals of the period, and conference statements, accompanied by some literary texts, we will interrogate the prehistory of postcolonial theory, which is generally dated to the publication in 1978 of Edward W. Said\u2019s Orientalism and ask what political purchase may still attach to the term \u201cThird World,\u201d for example in the Arab Spring. Readings by, among others, Anouar Abdel Malek; Aijaz Ahmad; Samir Amin; Mohamed El-Bisatie; Rachid al-Daif; Arif Dirlik; Frantz Fanon; Amitav Ghosh; Alex LaGuma; Roel Meijer; Kwame Nkrumah; Edward Said; Helmy Sharawy; Richard Wright; and Robert Young.  Literature, History, and Politics: Comparative Internationalisms  Ross Internationalism is a central political and cultural force of the modern era. Yet unlike the vast literature on empire and nationalism, the study of radical internationalism has been comparatively meager. This seminar will study the cultural politics of late 19th century Europe in the wake of the Paris Commune of 1871, paying particular attention to the poetry of Arthur Rimbaud, Kropotkin\u2019s political theory, the multifarious writing and activities of William Morris, as well as other figures including Elisee Reclus and Paul Lafargue. Topics to include internationalism, anti-productivism, anarchism.   Contemporary Critical Theories: Freud\u2019s Case Histories  Sanders Psychoanalysis has played a crucial part in the evolution of the critical theories that inform our practice in literary studies. From the efforts of the Frankfurt School to come to terms with the terrifying conjuncture represented by the rise of Fascism in Europe, to the emergence of postcolonial critique in Frantz Fanon and others, to deconstruction, and feminist and queer theory, psychoanalysis has been widely appropriated\u2014often critically, but almost always productively. In this seminar, we shall immerse ourselves in what are the key classical demonstrations of the setting to work of psychoanalysis\u2014namely, Freud\u2019s major case histories: from the Studies on Hysteria, to the cases of Dora, Little Hans, the Rat Man, Senatspr\u00e4sident Schreber, and the Wolf Man. Attention will also be devoted to Freud\u2019s papers on technique. In order to link Freud\u2019s texts to more recent developments in theory and cultural studies, we shall be considering them through the lens of the commentaries devoted to them by Jacques Lacan, as well as important subsequent interventions by Jacqueline Rose, Juliet Mitchell, Nicolas Abraham &amp; Maria Torok, Jacques Derrida, Friedrich Kittler, Avital Ronell, and Eric Santner.
