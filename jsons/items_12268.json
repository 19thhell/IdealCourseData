In the 1850s, Franz Xaver von Sch\u00f6nwerth traversed the forests, lowlands, and mountains of northern Bavaria to record fairy tales, gaining the admiration of even the Brothers Grimm. Most of Sch\u00f6nwerth's work was lost\u2014until a few years ago, when thirty boxes of manu\u00adscripts were uncovered in a German municipal archive. Now, for the first time, Sch\u00f6nwerth's lost fairy tales are available in English. Violent, dark, and full of action, and upending the relationship between damsels in distress and their dragon-slaying heroes, these more than seventy stories bring us closer than ever to the unadorned oral tradition in which fairy tales are rooted, revolutionizing our understanding of a hallowed genre.   Gods, heroes, and monsters: a sourcebook of Greek, Roman, and Near Eastern myths in translation - Carolina L\u00f3pez-Ruiz Call Number: BL312 .L66 2014 Setting itself apart from typical anthologies in classical mythology, Gods, Heroes, and Monsters: A Sourcebook of Greek, Roman, and Near Eastern Myths in Translation presents essential Greek and Roman sources--including work from Homer, Hesiod, Virgil, and Ovid--alongside analogous narratives from the ancient Near East--Mesopotamia, Egypt, the Hittite kingdom, Ugarit, Phoenicia, and the Hebrew Bible. Some of the sources appear here in English translations for the first time.   Folklore, horror stories, and the slender man: the development of an internet mythology - Shira Chess Call Number: GR44.E43 C44 2015 Since 2009, the Slender Man had been growing in popularity as an emergent, groundbreaking Internet horror myth. It entered the broader popular consciousness in May 2014, when two twelve year old girls led a third girl into a wooded area and stabbed her numerous times. The Slender Man takes on important cultural meanings in the age of the Internet - meanings often neglected when the crime version of the story went reported in the media. The revisions that they made to it helps to suggest an iterative folk telling tradition. Because the Slender Man storytelling process has become both crowd sourced and participatory - taking place at what we identify as a \"digital campfire\" - the interpretations and analyses are not meant to be static, but to provide an explanation of how Internet mythologies develop and prosper. This book introduces unique attributes of digital culture and establishes a needed framework for studies of other Internet memes and mythologies.   Fairy tales, natural history and Victorian culture - aurence Talairach-Vielmas Call Number: PR585.S33 T35 2014 Fairy Tales, Natural History and Victorian Culture deals with the way in which natural history was connected to the world of fairies and highlights how shifts in the understanding of natural history, especially after 1859, had a significant impact on fairy stories and Victorian experiments with the literary fairy tale.   Fairy tales, myth, and psychoanalytic theory : feminism and retelling the tale - Veronica L. Schanoes Call Number: GR550 .S29 2014 Schanoes's book posits a new model for understanding both feminist psychoanalytic theory and feminist retellings, one that emphasizes the interdependence of theory and art and challenges the notion that literary revision involves a masculinist struggle with the writer's artistic forbearers.

Now, in the new, expanded third edition, renowned scholar and folklorist Jack Zipes has translated all 250 tales collected and published by Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm, plus twenty-nine rare tales omitted from the original German edition, as well as narratives uncovered in the brothers\u2019 letters and papers.

The superb translation by Christopher Betts exactly captures the tone and flavor of Perrault's world, and the delightful spirit of the originals. Bett's introduction deftly illuminates why in Perrault's hands these humble fairy tales have such great imaginative power, showing how they transmute into vivid fantasies the hidden fears and conflicts by which children are affected--fears of abandonment, conflicts with siblings and parents--and resolve so satisfactorily the problems experienced by children while growing up. The volume also includes appendices on related tales and selected variants, a bibliography, chronology, and notes.

If you are looking for criticism of a theme or literary or artistic movement, you can attach the phrase history and criticism . For example:         Carter, Angela, 1940--Criticism and interpretation    Carroll , Lewis , 1832-1898 -- Criticism and interpretation    You could also do a keyword search, combining the terms fairy tales and criticism , both as subject heading terms.

The Witch Must Die: How Fairy Tales Shape Our Lives - Sheldon Cashdan Call Number: GR550 .C39 1999 What accounts for the enduring charm of fairy tales?

The Impact of Germany on English Children's Books 1780-1918 - David Blamires Call Number: PR129.G3 B59 2009 Germany has had a profound influence on English stories for children. The Brothers Grimm, The Swiss Family Robinson and Johanna Spyri's Heidi quickly became classics but, as David Blamires clearly articulates in this volume, many other works have been fundamental in the development of English chilren's stories during the 19th Centuary and beyond. Telling Tales is the first comprehensive study of the impact of Germany on English children's books, covering the period from 1780 to the First World War.

Offering brilliant rereadings of classics from the \"Golden Age of Children's Literature\" as well as literature commonly considered \"grown-up,\" U. C. Knoepflmacher illuminates this debate, probing deeply into the relations between adults and children, adults and their own childhood selves, and the lives of beloved Victorian authors and their \"children's tales.\"   Women at the beginning: origin myths from the Amazons to the Virgin Mary - Patrick J.

There are a number of Graphic Novel series and stand alones that reinterpret classic fairy tales and give them a modern twist. Two of the most notable are Bill Willingham's Fables and it's spinoff series, Jack of Fables . If mermaids are your area of interest, Sailor Twain is for you.

Jack of Fables: the new adventures of Jack and Jack - Bill Willingham Call Number: PN6727.W52 J33 A new story line further develops Jack Horner's escapades in Hollywood and establishes him as the most dangerous Fable loose in the \"mundy\"\u2014short for \"mundane\"\u2014world.

Enlisting the support of Goldilocks and a cage full of fairies, Jack plans the entire retirement community's escape.   Sailor Twain: Or: The Mermaid in the Hudson - Mark Siegel Call Number: PN6727.S51549 S25 2012 One hundred years ago.

There are three types of sources:   1) Primary Sources        Materials that contain direct evidence, first-hand testimony, or an eyewitness account of a topic or event under investigation   Primary sources provide the raw data for your research   Examples: In addition to diaries, correspondence, photographs, and many other types of sources typically considered to be primary sources, you may add just about anything to the list. The way you interpret or use a source determines whether it is a primary source or not.     2) Secondary Sources       Use primary data to solve research problems   Examples: scholarly books and articles   Secondary sources can be interpreted as primary sources when the artifactual characteristics of the item are of research value.     3) Tertiary Sources       Books or articles that synthesize and report on secondary sources for general readers   Examples: textbooks, encyclopedia articles, Wikipedia       Adapted from The Craft of Research by Wayne C.

Analyzing a wide range of traditional stories, from the tales of Sindbad to \u201cThe Three Little Pigs,\u201d \u201cHansel and Gretel,\u201d and \u201cThe Sleeping Beauty,\u201d Bettelheim shows how the fantastical, sometimes cruel, but always deeply significant narrative strands of the classic fairy tales can aid in our greatest human task, that of finding meaning for one\u2019s life.   Man and his symbols - Carl Jung Call Number: BF173 .J944 Illustrated throughout with revealing images, this is the first and only work in which the world-famous Swiss psychologist explains to the layperson his enormously influential theory of symbolism as revealed in dreams.   Amor and Psyche : the psychic development of the feminine: a commentary on the tale by Apuleius - Erich Neumann Call Number: PA6209.M5 N4 1999 The renowned tale of Amor and Psyche, from Apuleius's second-century Latin novel The Golden Ass, is one of the most charming fragments of classical literature. Neumann chose it as the exemplar of an unusual study of feminine psychology. Unfolding the spiritual and mythical background of the pagan narrative, he shows how the contest between the mortal maid Psyche and the great goddess Aphrodite over the god Amor--Aphrodite's son, Psyche's husband--yields surprising and valuable insights into the psychic life of women.   The Interpretation of Fairy Tales - Marie Franz Call Number: GR550 .F714 1996 Of the various types of mythological literature, fairy tales are the simplest and purest expressions of the collective unconscious and thus offer the clearest understanding of the basic patterns of the human psyche. Every people or nation has its own way of experiencing this psychic reality, and so a study of the world's fairy tales yields a wealth of insights into the archetypal experiences of humankind. Perhaps the foremost authority on the psychological interpretation of fairy tales is Marie-Louise von Franz. In this book\u2014originally published as An Introduction to the Interpretation of Fairy Tales \u2014she describes the steps involved in analyzing and illustrates them with a variety of European tales, from \"Beauty and the Beast\" to \"The Robber Bridegroom.\" Dr. von Franz begins with a history of the study of fairy tales and the various theories of interpretation. By way of illustration she presents a detailed examination of a simple Grimm's tale, \"The Three Feathers,\" followed by a comprehensive discussion of motifs related to Jung's concept of the shadow, the anima, and the animus.            Comments (0)                                         Thematic Studies                   Off with their heads!: fairy tales and the culture of childhood - Maria Tatar Call Number: GR550 .T38 1992 When Hansel and Gretel try to eat the witch's gingerbread house in the woods, are they indulging their \"uncontrolled cravings\" and \"destructive desires\" or are they simply responding normally to the hunger pangs they feel after being abandoned by their parents? Challenging Bruno Bettelheim and other critics who read fairy tales as enactments of children's untamed urges, Maria Tatar argues that it is time to stop casting the children as villians. In this provocative book she explores how adults mistreat children, focusing on adults not only as hostile characters in fairy tales themselves but also as real people who use frightening stories to discipline young listeners.   The Brothers Grimm and folktale - James M. McGlathery Call Number: PT921 .B76 1988 ISBN: 0252061918 Some of the best folklore and Grimm scholars from Europe and the U.S. combined to give an excellent overview of the scholarly research and current critical thought regarding Jakob and Wilhelm Grimm and their hugely popular Grimm's Fairy Tales... The book is directed to the general educated public and is very readable.   Ariadne's thread: a guide to international tales found in classical literature - William F. Hansen Call Number: GR74.6 .H35 2002 From Cinderella to The Boy Who Cried Wolf to The Dragon Slayer to the Judgment of Solomon, certain legends, myths, and folktales are part of the oral tradition in countries around the world. In addition to their pervasiveness, these stories show an astonishing longevity; many such tales are found in classical antiquity. Ariadne's Thread is an encyclopedia of more than a hundred such international oral tales, all present in the literature of ancient Greece and Rome.

Journals related to Mythology, Fairy Tales and Folklore will keep you abreast of the latest scholarship and help stimulate your own research.

Plagiarism (pronounced: play -juh-riz-um)  is the act of taking someone else&rsquo;s words, ideas, or information and passing them off as your own. If you don&rsquo;t give credit to the author  of these ideas in footnotes or endnotes and a bibliography, you are committing plagiarism, which is a serious academic offense.         Students, in the process of learning, acquire ideas from many sources and exchange ideas and opinions with classmates, professors, and others. This occurs in reading, writing, and discussion. Students are expected&mdash;often required&mdash;to build their own work on that of other people, just as professional researchers and writers do. Giving credit to someone whose work has helped one is courteous and honest; in fact, not to give such credit is a crime. Plagiarism is the severest form of academic fraud. Plagiarism is theft.       More specifically, plagiarism is presenting as your own:                   a phrase, sentence, or passage from another writer's work without using quotation marks;    a paraphrased passage from another writer's work;    facts, ideas, or written text gathered or downloaded from the Internet;    another student's work with your name on it;    a purchased paper or \"research\" from a term paper mill.       Other forms of academic fraud include:       \"collaborating\" between two or more students who then submit the same paper under their individual names.    submitting the same paper for two or more courses without the knowledge and the expressed permission of all teachers involved.    giving permission to another student to use your work for a class.       Proper acknowledgement marks the difference. It is your responsibility to know what constitutes plagiarism. Not knowing citation standards is not an excuse. When in doubt, err on the side of over-documentation and cite the source. You can also ask your professor, teaching assistant, or a librarian for help in determining what is and is not plagiarism.

Here are a few other subject guides that will be of interest to you:           English & American Literature Research Guide                   French Language and Literature                   Germanic Languages and Literature                   Classical Studies                   Italian Language and Literature                   Slavic Studies Research Guide                   Spanish and Portuguese Language and Literature                   East Asian Studies                   Latin American Studies                   South Asian Studies                   Francophone Literature                   Comparative Literature                    Comments (0)                                         Bobst Info                 Library Hours and Locations   Library Tutorials and Classes   Citation Help   Comments/Suggestions           Comments (0)                                         New Titles in the Stacks                   The turnip princess: and other newly discovered fairy tales - Franz Xaver von Sch\u00f6nwerth Call Number: GR167.B3 S3785 2015 With this volume, the holy trinity of fairy tales\u2014the Brothers Grimm, Charles Perrault, and Hans Christian Andersen\u2014becomes a quartet. In the 1850s, Franz Xaver von Sch\u00f6nwerth traversed the forests, lowlands, and mountains of northern Bavaria to record fairy tales, gaining the admiration of even the Brothers Grimm. Most of Sch\u00f6nwerth's work was lost\u2014until a few years ago, when thirty boxes of manu\u00adscripts were uncovered in a German municipal archive. Now, for the first time, Sch\u00f6nwerth's lost fairy tales are available in English. Violent, dark, and full of action, and upending the relationship between damsels in distress and their dragon-slaying heroes, these more than seventy stories bring us closer than ever to the unadorned oral tradition in which fairy tales are rooted, revolutionizing our understanding of a hallowed genre.   Gods, heroes, and monsters: a sourcebook of Greek, Roman, and Near Eastern myths in translation - Carolina L\u00f3pez-Ruiz Call Number: BL312 .L66 2014 Setting itself apart from typical anthologies in classical mythology, Gods, Heroes, and Monsters: A Sourcebook of Greek, Roman, and Near Eastern Myths in Translation presents essential Greek and Roman sources--including work from Homer, Hesiod, Virgil, and Ovid--alongside analogous narratives from the ancient Near East--Mesopotamia, Egypt, the Hittite kingdom, Ugarit, Phoenicia, and the Hebrew Bible. Some of the sources appear here in English translations for the first time.   Folklore, horror stories, and the slender man: the development of an internet mythology - Shira Chess Call Number: GR44.E43 C44 2015 Since 2009, the Slender Man had been growing in popularity as an emergent, groundbreaking Internet horror myth. It entered the broader popular consciousness in May 2014, when two twelve year old girls led a third girl into a wooded area and stabbed her numerous times. The Slender Man takes on important cultural meanings in the age of the Internet - meanings often neglected when the crime version of the story went reported in the media. The revisions that they made to it helps to suggest an iterative folk telling tradition. Because the Slender Man storytelling process has become both crowd sourced and participatory - taking place at what we identify as a \"digital campfire\" - the interpretations and analyses are not meant to be static, but to provide an explanation of how Internet mythologies develop and prosper. This book introduces unique attributes of digital culture and establishes a needed framework for studies of other Internet memes and mythologies.   Fairy tales, natural history and Victorian culture - aurence Talairach-Vielmas Call Number: PR585.S33 T35 2014 Fairy Tales, Natural History and Victorian Culture deals with the way in which natural history was connected to the world of fairies and highlights how shifts in the understanding of natural history, especially after 1859, had a significant impact on fairy stories and Victorian experiments with the literary fairy tale.   Fairy tales, myth, and psychoanalytic theory : feminism and retelling the tale - Veronica L. Schanoes Call Number: GR550 .S29 2014 Schanoes's book posits a new model for understanding both feminist psychoanalytic theory and feminist retellings, one that emphasizes the interdependence of theory and art and challenges the notion that literary revision involves a masculinist struggle with the writer's artistic forbearers.

Before being lionized as zaftig Norse angels who guided strong warriors to Valhalla, Valkyries may have offered rebirth through cannibalization. \"Little Red Riding Hood\" was based on Diana, goddess of the hunt.

Folklore: an encyclopedia of beliefs, customs, tales, music, and art - Thomas A. Green Call Number: GR35 .F63 1997 Non-circulating The broad field of folklore studies, developed over the past two centuries, provides significant insights into many aspects of human culture. While the term \"folklore\" conjures images of ancient practices and beliefs or folk heroes and traditional stories, it also applies to today's ever-changing cultural landscape. Even certain aspects of modern Internet-based popular culture and contemporary rites of passage represent folklore. This encyclopedia covers all the major genres of both ancient and contemporary folklore. This second edition adds more than 100 entries that examine the folklore practices of major ethnic groups, folk heroes, creatures of myth and legend, and emerging areas of interest in folklore studies.

The superb translation by Christopher Betts exactly captures the tone and flavor of Perrault's world, and the delightful spirit of the originals. Bett's introduction deftly illuminates why in Perrault's hands these humble fairy tales have such great imaginative power, showing how they transmute into vivid fantasies the hidden fears and conflicts by which children are affected--fears of abandonment, conflicts with siblings and parents--and resolve so satisfactorily the problems experienced by children while growing up. The volume also includes appendices on related tales and selected variants, a bibliography, chronology, and notes.

If you are looking for criticism of a theme or literary or artistic movement, you can attach the phrase history and criticism . For example:         Carter, Angela, 1940--Criticism and interpretation    Carroll , Lewis , 1832-1898 -- Criticism and interpretation    You could also do a keyword search, combining the terms fairy tales and criticism , both as subject heading terms.

The Witch Must Die: How Fairy Tales Shape Our Lives - Sheldon Cashdan Call Number: GR550 .C39 1999 What accounts for the enduring charm of fairy tales?

C. Knoepflmacher Behind the innocent face of Victorian fairy tales such as Through the Looking Glass or Mopsa the Fairy lurks the specter of an intense gender debate about the very nature of childhood. Offering brilliant rereadings of classics from the \"Golden Age of Children's Literature\" as well as literature commonly considered \"grown-up,\" U. C. Knoepflmacher illuminates this debate, probing deeply into the relations between adults and children, adults and their own childhood selves, and the lives of beloved Victorian authors and their \"children's tales.\"   Women at the beginning: origin myths from the Amazons to the Virgin Mary - Patrick J. Geary Call Number: BL795.W65 G43 2006 In these four artfully crafted essays, Patrick Geary explores the way ancient and medieval authors wrote about women.

There are a number of Graphic Novel series and stand alones that reinterpret classic fairy tales and give them a modern twist. Two of the most notable are Bill Willingham's Fables and it's spinoff series, Jack of Fables . If mermaids are your area of interest, Sailor Twain is for you.

Enlisting the support of Goldilocks and a cage full of fairies, Jack plans the entire retirement community's escape.

There are three types of sources:   1) Primary Sources        Materials that contain direct evidence, first-hand testimony, or an eyewitness account of a topic or event under investigation   Primary sources provide the raw data for your research   Examples: In addition to diaries, correspondence, photographs, and many other types of sources typically considered to be primary sources, you may add just about anything to the list. The way you interpret or use a source determines whether it is a primary source or not.     2) Secondary Sources       Use primary data to solve research problems   Examples: scholarly books and articles   Secondary sources can be interpreted as primary sources when the artifactual characteristics of the item are of research value.     3) Tertiary Sources       Books or articles that synthesize and report on secondary sources for general readers   Examples: textbooks, encyclopedia articles, Wikipedia       Adapted from The Craft of Research by Wayne C. Booth, Gregory G. Colomb, Joseph M. Williams. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, c2008.

Analyzing a wide range of traditional stories, from the tales of Sindbad to \u201cThe Three Little Pigs,\u201d \u201cHansel and Gretel,\u201d and \u201cThe Sleeping Beauty,\u201d Bettelheim shows how the fantastical, sometimes cruel, but always deeply significant narrative strands of the classic fairy tales can aid in our greatest human task, that of finding meaning for one\u2019s life.   Man and his symbols - Carl Jung Call Number: BF173 .J944 Illustrated throughout with revealing images, this is the first and only work in which the world-famous Swiss psychologist explains to the layperson his enormously influential theory of symbolism as revealed in dreams.   Amor and Psyche : the psychic development of the feminine: a commentary on the tale by Apuleius - Erich Neumann Call Number: PA6209.M5 N4 1999 The renowned tale of Amor and Psyche, from Apuleius's second-century Latin novel The Golden Ass, is one of the most charming fragments of classical literature. Neumann chose it as the exemplar of an unusual study of feminine psychology. Unfolding the spiritual and mythical background of the pagan narrative, he shows how the contest between the mortal maid Psyche and the great goddess Aphrodite over the god Amor--Aphrodite's son, Psyche's husband--yields surprising and valuable insights into the psychic life of women.   The Interpretation of Fairy Tales - Marie Franz Call Number: GR550 .F714 1996 Of the various types of mythological literature, fairy tales are the simplest and purest expressions of the collective unconscious and thus offer the clearest understanding of the basic patterns of the human psyche. Every people or nation has its own way of experiencing this psychic reality, and so a study of the world's fairy tales yields a wealth of insights into the archetypal experiences of humankind. Perhaps the foremost authority on the psychological interpretation of fairy tales is Marie-Louise von Franz. In this book\u2014originally published as An Introduction to the Interpretation of Fairy Tales \u2014she describes the steps involved in analyzing and illustrates them with a variety of European tales, from \"Beauty and the Beast\" to \"The Robber Bridegroom.\" Dr. von Franz begins with a history of the study of fairy tales and the various theories of interpretation. By way of illustration she presents a detailed examination of a simple Grimm's tale, \"The Three Feathers,\" followed by a comprehensive discussion of motifs related to Jung's concept of the shadow, the anima, and the animus.            Comments (0)                                         Thematic Studies                   Off with their heads!: fairy tales and the culture of childhood - Maria Tatar Call Number: GR550 .T38 1992 When Hansel and Gretel try to eat the witch's gingerbread house in the woods, are they indulging their \"uncontrolled cravings\" and \"destructive desires\" or are they simply responding normally to the hunger pangs they feel after being abandoned by their parents? Challenging Bruno Bettelheim and other critics who read fairy tales as enactments of children's untamed urges, Maria Tatar argues that it is time to stop casting the children as villians. In this provocative book she explores how adults mistreat children, focusing on adults not only as hostile characters in fairy tales themselves but also as real people who use frightening stories to discipline young listeners.   The Brothers Grimm and folktale - James M. McGlathery Call Number: PT921 .B76 1988 ISBN: 0252061918 Some of the best folklore and Grimm scholars from Europe and the U.S. combined to give an excellent overview of the scholarly research and current critical thought regarding Jakob and Wilhelm Grimm and their hugely popular Grimm's Fairy Tales... The book is directed to the general educated public and is very readable.   Ariadne's thread: a guide to international tales found in classical literature - William F. Hansen Call Number: GR74.6 .H35 2002 From Cinderella to The Boy Who Cried Wolf to The Dragon Slayer to the Judgment of Solomon, certain legends, myths, and folktales are part of the oral tradition in countries around the world. In addition to their pervasiveness, these stories show an astonishing longevity; many such tales are found in classical antiquity. Ariadne's Thread is an encyclopedia of more than a hundred such international oral tales, all present in the literature of ancient Greece and Rome.

Journals related to Mythology, Fairy Tales and Folklore will keep you abreast of the latest scholarship and help stimulate your own research. The numerous online databases available to you through the library will allow you to search through the contents of these journals (and many others), but browsing through an individual journal will allow you the opportunity for more specific topic research. Here is a small sampling of the journals:  Marvels and Tales Marvels & Tales is a peer-reviewed journal that is international and multidisciplinary in orientation. The journal publishes scholarly work dealing with the fairy tale in any of its diverse manifestations and contexts. Notes and Queries Founded under the editorship of the antiquary W J Thoms, the primary intention of Notes and Queries was, and still remains, the asking and answering of readers' questions. It is devoted principally to English language and literature, lexicography, history, and scholarly antiquarianism.

Fabula Acts as a medium of discussion for issues of all kinds which are of interest to international folk narrative research. Journal of Folklore Research The Journal of Folklore Research has provided an international forum for current theory and research among scholars of traditional culture since 1964. Journal of Popular Culture The Journal of Popular Culture continues to break down the barriers between so-called \u201clow\u201d and \u201chigh\u201d culture and focuses on filling in the gaps that a neglect of popular culture has left in our understanding of the workings of society.

Plagiarism (pronounced: play -juh-riz-um)  is the act of taking someone else&rsquo;s words, ideas, or information and passing them off as your own. If you don&rsquo;t give credit to the author  of these ideas in footnotes or endnotes and a bibliography, you are committing plagiarism, which is a serious academic offense.         Students, in the process of learning, acquire ideas from many sources and exchange ideas and opinions with classmates, professors, and others. This occurs in reading, writing, and discussion. Students are expected&mdash;often required&mdash;to build their own work on that of other people, just as professional researchers and writers do. Giving credit to someone whose work has helped one is courteous and honest; in fact, not to give such credit is a crime. Plagiarism is the severest form of academic fraud. Plagiarism is theft.       More specifically, plagiarism is presenting as your own:                   a phrase, sentence, or passage from another writer's work without using quotation marks;    a paraphrased passage from another writer's work;    facts, ideas, or written text gathered or downloaded from the Internet;    another student's work with your name on it;    a purchased paper or \"research\" from a term paper mill.       Other forms of academic fraud include:       \"collaborating\" between two or more students who then submit the same paper under their individual names.    submitting the same paper for two or more courses without the knowledge and the expressed permission of all teachers involved.    giving permission to another student to use your work for a class.       Proper acknowledgement marks the difference. It is your responsibility to know what constitutes plagiarism. Not knowing citation standards is not an excuse. When in doubt, err on the side of over-documentation and cite the source. You can also ask your professor, teaching assistant, or a librarian for help in determining what is and is not plagiarism.
