Description       The ruin of the environment begins with agriculture. With this assertion Paul Shepard sharpens a modern tradition of radical environmental thinking that ranges from Rousseau to Elizabeth Kolbert. In this course, we will consider some of the basic issues behind our urges to protect, and squander, the environment. If the environment includes wilderness, how does such wildness relate to our own sense of who we are? How wild, how civilized, are we? Is homo sapiens hard-wired for violence? To what extent do our current forms of economic and social organization allow or prohibit us from accommodating ourselves to the world around us? In this seminar, we will write about these issues and imagine realistic alternative futures. Authors may include Matsuo Basho, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Henry David Thoreau, Black Elk, Darwin, Sigmund Freud, Franz Kafka, Elizabeth Bishop, Edward Abbey, Paul Shepard, Elizabeth Kolbert, Alice Walker, and Cormac McCarthy.

The First-Year Program begins with orientation and a variety of events during Welcome Week. At orientation you will meet faculty who will help you to think about your education as an interdisciplinary and independent venture. To help you settle into NYU and Gallatin, orientation also includes many social activities, informal discussions, and other opportunities to help you make new friends and become familiar with NYU and the surrounding Greenwich Village neighborhood.     First-year students (as well as transfer students who enter with fewer than 32 credits) take three courses that constitute the First-Year Program: the first-year interdisciplinary seminar, first-year writing seminar and first-year research seminar. The First-Year Interdisciplinary Seminar introduces students to the goals, methods, and philosophy of university education and to the interdisciplinary, individualized approach of the Gallatin School. These small classes of about 18 students encourage discussion rather than lecturing and focus on a theme\u2014&quot;The Ancient Hero and the Heroic&quot;; &quot;The Thingliness of Things&quot;; &quot;Capitalism and Democracy&quot;\u2014 that incorporates significant world texts representing several disciplines.     The first-year writing seminar and first-year research seminar constitute a two-semester sequence intended to help students develop their writing and research skills and to prepare them for the kinds of writing they will be doing in their other courses. Rather than attribute the success of excellent writing to a writer\u2019s innate gifts or to some mysterious moment of inspiration, these seminars approach writing as a craft that can be learned by acquiring the skills appropriate for each stage in the writing process (free writing, drafting, revising, polishing). Each seminar is organized around a particular theme\u2014&quot;Aesthetics on Trial&quot;; &quot;Wilderness and Civilization&quot;; &quot;Art and the Dream Life&quot;\u2014with related readings that serve both as springboards for discussion and models for students\u2019 own essays. Usually, the writing seminar begins with personal and descriptive essays and proceeds to focus on the critical essay. A significant portion of the research seminar is devoted to working on a long research paper, with attention to formulating key questions, choosing and evaluating sources, developing a thesis, structuring the argument as a whole and revising and polishing the final paper.

Description       The ruin of the environment begins with agriculture. With this assertion Paul Shepard sharpens a modern tradition of radical environmental thinking that ranges from Rousseau to Elizabeth Kolbert. In this course, we will consider some of the basic issues behind our urges to protect, and squander, the environment. If the environment includes wilderness, how does such wildness relate to our own sense of who we are? How wild, how civilized, are we? Is homo sapiens hard-wired for violence? To what extent do our current forms of economic and social organization allow or prohibit us from accommodating ourselves to the world around us? In this seminar, we will write about these issues and imagine realistic alternative futures. Authors may include Matsuo Basho, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Henry David Thoreau, Black Elk, Darwin, Sigmund Freud, Franz Kafka, Elizabeth Bishop, Edward Abbey, Paul Shepard, Elizabeth Kolbert, Alice Walker, and Cormac McCarthy.

The First-Year Program begins with orientation and a variety of events during Welcome Week. At orientation you will meet faculty who will help you to think about your education as an interdisciplinary and independent venture. To help you settle into NYU and Gallatin, orientation also includes many social activities, informal discussions, and other opportunities to help you make new friends and become familiar with NYU and the surrounding Greenwich Village neighborhood.     First-year students (as well as transfer students who enter with fewer than 32 credits) take three courses that constitute the First-Year Program: the first-year interdisciplinary seminar, first-year writing seminar and first-year research seminar. The First-Year Interdisciplinary Seminar introduces students to the goals, methods, and philosophy of university education and to the interdisciplinary, individualized approach of the Gallatin School. These small classes of about 18 students encourage discussion rather than lecturing and focus on a theme\u2014&quot;The Ancient Hero and the Heroic&quot;; &quot;The Thingliness of Things&quot;; &quot;Capitalism and Democracy&quot;\u2014 that incorporates significant world texts representing several disciplines.     The first-year writing seminar and first-year research seminar constitute a two-semester sequence intended to help students develop their writing and research skills and to prepare them for the kinds of writing they will be doing in their other courses. Rather than attribute the success of excellent writing to a writer\u2019s innate gifts or to some mysterious moment of inspiration, these seminars approach writing as a craft that can be learned by acquiring the skills appropriate for each stage in the writing process (free writing, drafting, revising, polishing). Each seminar is organized around a particular theme\u2014&quot;Aesthetics on Trial&quot;; &quot;Wilderness and Civilization&quot;; &quot;Art and the Dream Life&quot;\u2014with related readings that serve both as springboards for discussion and models for students\u2019 own essays. Usually, the writing seminar begins with personal and descriptive essays and proceeds to focus on the critical essay. A significant portion of the research seminar is devoted to working on a long research paper, with attention to formulating key questions, choosing and evaluating sources, developing a thesis, structuring the argument as a whole and revising and polishing the final paper.

Description       The ruin of the environment begins with agriculture. With this assertion Paul Shepard sharpens a modern tradition of radical environmental thinking that ranges from Rousseau to Elizabeth Kolbert. In this course, we will consider some of the basic issues behind our urges to protect, and squander, the environment. If the environment includes wilderness, how does such wildness relate to our own sense of who we are? How wild, how civilized, are we? Is homo sapiens hard-wired for violence? To what extent do our current forms of economic and social organization allow or prohibit us from accommodating ourselves to the world around us? In this seminar, we will write about these issues and imagine realistic alternative futures. Authors may include Matsuo Basho, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Henry David Thoreau, Black Elk, Darwin, Sigmund Freud, Franz Kafka, Elizabeth Bishop, Edward Abbey, Paul Shepard, Elizabeth Kolbert, Alice Walker, and Cormac McCarthy.

The First-Year Program begins with orientation and a variety of events during Welcome Week. At orientation you will meet faculty who will help you to think about your education as an interdisciplinary and independent venture. To help you settle into NYU and Gallatin, orientation also includes many social activities, informal discussions, and other opportunities to help you make new friends and become familiar with NYU and the surrounding Greenwich Village neighborhood.     First-year students (as well as transfer students who enter with fewer than 32 credits) take three courses that constitute the First-Year Program: the first-year interdisciplinary seminar, first-year writing seminar and first-year research seminar. The First-Year Interdisciplinary Seminar introduces students to the goals, methods, and philosophy of university education and to the interdisciplinary, individualized approach of the Gallatin School. These small classes of about 18 students encourage discussion rather than lecturing and focus on a theme\u2014&quot;The Ancient Hero and the Heroic&quot;; &quot;The Thingliness of Things&quot;; &quot;Capitalism and Democracy&quot;\u2014 that incorporates significant world texts representing several disciplines.     The first-year writing seminar and first-year research seminar constitute a two-semester sequence intended to help students develop their writing and research skills and to prepare them for the kinds of writing they will be doing in their other courses. Rather than attribute the success of excellent writing to a writer\u2019s innate gifts or to some mysterious moment of inspiration, these seminars approach writing as a craft that can be learned by acquiring the skills appropriate for each stage in the writing process (free writing, drafting, revising, polishing). Each seminar is organized around a particular theme\u2014&quot;Aesthetics on Trial&quot;; &quot;Wilderness and Civilization&quot;; &quot;Art and the Dream Life&quot;\u2014with related readings that serve both as springboards for discussion and models for students\u2019 own essays. Usually, the writing seminar begins with personal and descriptive essays and proceeds to focus on the critical essay. A significant portion of the research seminar is devoted to working on a long research paper, with attention to formulating key questions, choosing and evaluating sources, developing a thesis, structuring the argument as a whole and revising and polishing the final paper.

Description       In this seminar we will study a sampling of texts from various fields that deal with the tension between wilderness and civilization and the identities it enables. We will consider how the concept of wilderness sometimes doubles for that of nature in forming a dynamic identity we call \u201ccivilized.\u201d Our studies will draw on insights from biology, ecology, anthropology, political theory, and literature. We will attempt to respond to such questions as: If wilderness is nature without humans, why are we so irresistibly drawn to it? What function does wilderness serve in our civilized lives? How has it become necessary to our imaginative, spiritual, and political lives? What does an investigation of \u201cwilderness,\u201d \u201cnature,\u201d and \u201ccivilization\u201d allow us to express about the world we inhabit? What are the limits of these concepts\u2014what possibilities do they disallow? We will examine these concepts in terms of how they work to create identity for humans, what ways of life they offer, what they obscure. And we\u2019ll look closely at related concepts that structure our sense of ourselves, sometimes without our being wholly conscious of it: What does it mean to be natural, or live a natural lifestyle? Should social organizations follow nature, be \u201corganic,\u201d or go in a different direction? How natural is sex? gender? class? How does what we consider \u201cnatural\u201d and \u201cunnatural\u201d affect the lifestyle options available to us? Our goal in this seminar is to think through these and related issues and to develop language that enables us to imagine viable alternative futures.
