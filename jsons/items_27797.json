leading figures in biopolitical thought--Roberto Esposito, Michel Foucault, Giorgio Agamben, Judith Butler, Jacques Derrida, and others--to explore the extent to which the distinction between bios (or political form of life) and zoe (or \"bare life\") that is central to biopolitical thought enables us to think both the commonalities and the differences in the biopolitical plight of human and non-human bodies.
