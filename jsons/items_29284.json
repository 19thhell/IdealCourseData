Therefore, all employees are expected to make every reasonable effort to report to work during such conditions.     On rare occasions, weather or other extreme emergencies may cause the University to curtail operations, delay opening or close entirely. Such a determination is made by the President\u2019s Office with guidance from the University\u2019s emergency response team; a determination should not be made on an ad hoc, department-by-department basis.   Once a decision is made, the University will make its operating status clear in the following ways:       NYU\u2019s Info alert will appear on the NYU homepage: www.nyu.edu   Information Hot-Line (212) 998-1220   Direct email   Facebook postings (please follow us at http://www.facebook.com/NYU)   Twitter @nyuinfoalert http://twitter.com/nyuinfoalert   NYU Info Alerts at www.nyu.edu/info.alert       In addition, whenever possible, the Office of the Vice President for Human Resources will notify HR Officers of the operational status of the workplace.     Non-essential personnel:     If the University makes the decision to close operations for the day, non-essential personnel will be excused with pay, provided they were originally scheduled to work that day.     Essential personnel:  In an emergency, even if the University is closed, some functions require the onsite presence of essential personnel to insure continued safe and secure operations. Essential personnel are expected to remain at, or report to, work as scheduled during emergency situations or University closures unless specifically directed otherwise by the unit supervisor.   Department heads should, in consultation with HR Officers, establish what services and personnel are essential beforehand and make expectations for reporting and communicating clear. Depending on the nature of the situation, other personnel may be deemed essential at the time of an emergency.   Failure of essential personnel to report to work as required may be cause for disciplinary action.          Notes   1.

Therefore, all employees are expected to make every reasonable effort to report to work during such conditions.     On rare occasions, weather or other extreme emergencies may cause the University to curtail operations, delay opening or close entirely. Such a determination is made by the President\u2019s Office with guidance from the University\u2019s emergency response team; a determination should not be made on an ad hoc, department-by-department basis.   Once a decision is made, the University will make its operating status clear in the following ways:       NYU\u2019s Info alert will appear on the NYU homepage: www.nyu.edu   Information Hot-Line (212) 998-1220   Direct email   Facebook postings (please follow us at http://www.facebook.com/NYU)   Twitter @nyuinfoalert http://twitter.com/nyuinfoalert   NYU Info Alerts at www.nyu.edu/info.alert       In addition, whenever possible, the Office of the Vice President for Human Resources will notify HR Officers of the operational status of the workplace.     Non-essential personnel:     If the University makes the decision to close operations for the day, non-essential personnel will be excused with pay, provided they were originally scheduled to work that day.     Essential personnel:  In an emergency, even if the University is closed, some functions require the onsite presence of essential personnel to insure continued safe and secure operations. Essential personnel are expected to remain at, or report to, work as scheduled during emergency situations or University closures unless specifically directed otherwise by the unit supervisor.   Department heads should, in consultation with HR Officers, establish what services and personnel are essential beforehand and make expectations for reporting and communicating clear. Depending on the nature of the situation, other personnel may be deemed essential at the time of an emergency.   Failure of essential personnel to report to work as required may be cause for disciplinary action.          Notes   1.

Perelman Department of Emergency Medicine                                                      Letter from the Chairman   The history of emergency medicine at the New York University School of Medicine is long and storied. We derive our lineage from Bellevue Hospital Center, established in 1736, which created America\u2019s first hospital based\u00a0ambulance service in 1869 and\u00a0the\u00a0first emergency pavilion in a US hospital in 1876.   The mission of the Ronald O. Perelman Department of Emergency Medicine is to achieve excellence as a local, national and international leader in the field of emergency medicine. We have made a commitment to accomplish this mission by integrating research, teaching and patient care into public service, jointly with the NYU School of Medicine.   Since our early days and in my thirty-one years as the director of emergency services, we have continued to evolve. I am proud to say that our faculty and residents have always worked tirelessly to deliver high-quality, compassionate care to the exceptionally heterogeneous population served by Bellevue Hospital Center, NYU Langone Medical Center and the Manhattan VA Medical Center. I believe that our efforts in emergency medicine, public health, medical toxicology and global health are unsurpassed. I think you will understand our unique contribution to the field of emergency medicine after you have visited our site.   Welcome.   Lewis R. Goldfrank, MD  Herbert W.
