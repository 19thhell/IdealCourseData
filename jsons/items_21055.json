Overview         Computing professionals have to learn new programming    languages all the time. This course teaches the fundamental    principles of programming languages that enable you to learn    new languages quickly and help you decide which one is best    suited for a given task.         We will explore new ways of viewing computation and programs, and new    ways of approaching algorithmic problems, making you better    programmers overall. The topics covered in this course include    recursion and induction, algebraic data types and pattern matching,    higher-order functions, continuations and tail recursion, programming    language syntax and semantics, type systems, and objects and    classes. We will explore this material by building interpreters for    programming languages of increasing complexity. The course will thus    be accompanied by extensive programming projects. We will use the    programming language Scala for these projects, which you will also    learn in this course.      Prerequisites: Computer Systems   Organization (CSCI-UA 201).

Upon entry into the doctoral program, we urge students to begin exploring literature and methodologies pertinent to their particular research interests and to begin identifying specific faculty members, both in and out of the department, who can serve as their dissertation committee members. We recognize that advanced coursework contributes to students&rsquo; intellectual development. Our faculty have determined that two years of full-time coursework, beyond a master&rsquo;s degree or the equivalent, is sufficient, so that students move quickly toward pursuing their dissertation work more exclusively in the third year of study, accompanied by teaching and research opportunities.    Students admitted to the PhD program in Media, Culture, and Communication without an MA degree may be asked to complete up to six additional credits of coursework toward degree fulfillment.    See our PhD Handbook for a checklist to track completion of specific requirements.    The Office of Graduate Studies in NYU Steinhardt provides a list of policies and procedures governing doctoral study. In some instances, the Steinhardt Bulletin should be consulted for more detailed information.
