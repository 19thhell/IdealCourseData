Students must enroll in the following courses: Writing for the Screen NCRD-UT 1000 Participants   will examine the principles and processes of writing for the screen.   Topics include finding and developing story ideas, film language and   script structure. By the end of the course, students will have   participated in in-depth film analysis and intensive screenwriting   exercises and discussions. At the end of the course, students are   expected to complete a film treatment (prose description of your film)   with a step outline for a feature film or T.V. episode you plan to   write. In addition, you must hand in the first scene (3-5 pages) of   your script with dialogue. Non-credit tuition: $1,790 View the course schedule .    Fundamentals of Sight and Sound: Studio NCRD-UT 51 The course provides an in-depth exploration of the creative capabilities (technical, logistical, aesthetic) of producing narrative based studio production work in a multiple camera television studio environment. Students will be trained in working with actors and learning how to connect script and performance to the production of five short studio based projects (each of increasing complexity). Students will have the opportunity to develop a single idea into a full-scale production that will be produced \u201clive\u201d in the studio at the end of the semester. The fundamental skills learned in this class will serve as a foundation for all narrative, experimental and documentary based production work and will be applicable in all intermediate and advanced level production classes. Students will receive training in portable field equipment (for recording supplemental B roll footage) and working with the Avid (the final studio project can be edited for final class screening). Non-credit tuition: $5,743 Lab fee: $566 View the course schedule . Next, students must enroll in one (1) of the following courses:  Seminar in Script Analysis NCRD-UT 1084 This course is designed to help the student analyze a film script. Plot development, character, dialogue, foreground, background, and story are all examined. Using feature films, we highlight these script elements rather than the integrated experience of the script, performance, directing, and editing elements of the film.      Non-credit tuition: $3,575 Projection fee: $72 View the course schedule . Fundamentals of Dramatic and Visual Writing NCRD-UT 33    Through lecture and recitation, this class is an intensive examination of the short film and the fundamental grammar of dramatic and visual writing. In the recitation, each student will write and re-write two original screenplays. The first will be 6-8 pages and the second 12-15 pages. These scripts may be used in the future for upper-level (intermediate and advanced) core production classes. In these workshop sessions students will be asked to read each others work and give constructive feedback/notes to the writer(s). The lecture will serve as a forum for a comprehensive examination of the \"writer's toolbox.\" Through the screening of short films and clips from features as well as the reading of short scripts and sections of feature screenplays, we will explore how preeminent screenwriters use the interplay of visual language, structure, and character to create original, compelling, and emotional stories.
