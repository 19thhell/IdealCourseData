Basic concepts of return and risk are explored in detail with a view to understanding how financial markets work and how different kinds of financial instruments are valued. These instruments, including equities, fixed income securities, options, and other derivative securities become vehicles for exploring various financial markets and the utilization of these markets by managers in different kinds of financial institutions to enhance return and manage risk. The course includes a segment on the use and application of computer-based quantitative technology for financial modeling purposes.                                                                    Introduction to Marketing - MKTG-UB 9001 - 4 points                               Evaluates, from the management point of view, marketing as a system for the satisfaction of human wants and as a catalyst of business activity. Deals with the subject at all levels from producer to consumer and emphasizes the planning required for the efficient use of marketing tools in the development and expansion of markets. Concentrates on the principles, functions, and tools of marketing, including quantitative methods. Utilizes cases and projects to develop a problem-solving ability in dealing with specific areas.                                                                    Culture of Spain: An Anthropological Perspective - SPAN-UA 9631 or ANTH-UA 9250 - 4 points                               The recent changes in both Spain and Portugal are only the latest in a series of important transformations which these two countries have undergone over the past fifty years or so. In that time, they have both gone from being predominantly rural societies where the majority of the population live and work on the land to become industrial societies not unlike those of northern Europe and North America. Yet the underlying cultural heterogeneity of the peoples of the Iberian Peninsula has meant that different regions have often had very distinct reactions to the various pressures towards political, economic and social change.   As well as introducing you to some of the basic concepts used in the study of social change, this course concentrates on examining the ethnographic diversity of the various regions of Spain and Portugal. Knowledge of this underlying diversity is essential in comprehending the importance that regionalism has played in Iberian history and its relevance to the understanding of the acceptance or rejection of such change by the different regions in contemporary Spain and Portugal. The course will specifically examine the rapidly changing role of women in both countries.

Concentrates on epistemological constructions of Spain\u2014the idea of Spain\u2014that emerge from competing external and internal perspectives. Students examine how this national culture is constructed, first analyzing Spain from North African perspectives through Sephardic nostalgic poetry and the Hispano-Arabic literary traditions. The American perspective pits notions of Spanish imperial power and grandeur against the Black Legend, a term that Protestant circles in Europe and the United States promoted to attack the legitimacy of Spain\u2019s New World empire. A final focus on European views analyzes the depiction of Spain as the embodiment of German and French Romantic ideals beginning at the end of the 17th century and the reemergence of the same notion during the Spanish Civil War (1933\u201336). Throughout, students examine principal textual and visual images that contribute to the historical and contemporary construction of a national culture that emerged at geographic and cultural crossroads.

Beginning with an analysis of the effects of anthropogenic industrial carbon dioxide gas emissions on the Earth system as derived from the scientific evidence this course attempts to understand the reaction of the global, European and Spanish political governance systems to these transformations. In order to understand something as apparently specific as the impact of climate change in the Iberian peninsula and the Spanish state\u2019s response to it we must first understand, therefore, how the United Nations and the European Union are responding to climate change since the Spanish political system\u2019s control and mitigation policies are largely determined by these two larger governance systems\u2019 responses.

International human rights legislation imposes  the same obligations on all signatory countries. Despite this, however, interpretation and  application of these rights vary considerably between countries. Students will explore a set  of controversial issues in order to understand the complex differences between the United  States and European countries\u2019 interpretation of human rights obligations, and will also look  at how these differences are portrayed in society by comparing international and national  media coverage of the issues.

From the 8th century until the 17th century, Islam played a crucial role in the history of the Iberian Peninsula. Today this period is often portrayed as one of inter-religious harmony, while al-Andalus is simultaneously mourned in contemporary Islamist discourse as a lost paradise. While we look at the history of Al-Andalus and assess the importance of the contributions of Al-Andalus to Europe and America, we evaluate the significance of its legacy in modern Spain. Furthermore, we will study the protagonist role that Spain has played in relations between Europe and the Mediterranean Islamic countries during the Modern Age. Students will gain further understanding and contextualization of current Arab-Muslim geopolitics. As a case study, we will address the Spanish Protectorate in Morocco, as well as its ensuing process of decolonization and the consequences that shape the current international relations between the two neighboring countries, Spain and Morocco.

Culture of Spain: An Anthropological Perspective - SPAN-UA 9631 or ANTH-UA 9250 - 4 points                               The recent changes in both Spain and Portugal are only the latest in a series of important transformations which these two countries have undergone over the past fifty years or so. In that time, they have both gone from being predominantly rural societies where the majority of the population live and work on the land to become industrial societies not unlike those of northern Europe and North America. Yet the underlying cultural heterogeneity of the peoples of the Iberian Peninsula has meant that different regions have often had very distinct reactions to the various pressures towards political, economic and social change.   As well as introducing you to some of the basic concepts used in the study of social change, this course concentrates on examining the ethnographic diversity of the various regions of Spain and Portugal. Knowledge of this underlying diversity is essential in comprehending the importance that regionalism has played in Iberian history and its relevance to the understanding of the acceptance or rejection of such change by the different regions in contemporary Spain and Portugal. The course will specifically examine the rapidly changing role of women in both countries.

Students examine how this national culture is constructed, first analyzing Spain from North African perspectives through Sephardic nostalgic poetry and the Hispano-Arabic literary traditions. The American perspective pits notions of Spanish imperial power and grandeur against the Black Legend, a term that Protestant circles in Europe and the United States promoted to attack the legitimacy of Spain\u2019s New World empire. A final focus on European views analyzes the depiction of Spain as the embodiment of German and French Romantic ideals beginning at the end of the 17th century and the reemergence of the same notion during the Spanish Civil War (1933\u201336). Throughout, students examine principal textual and visual images that contribute to the historical and contemporary construction of a national culture that emerged at geographic and cultural crossroads.

Beginning with an analysis of the effects of anthropogenic industrial carbon dioxide gas emissions on the Earth system as derived from the scientific evidence this course attempts to understand the reaction of the global, European and Spanish political governance systems to these transformations. In order to understand something as apparently specific as the impact of climate change in the Iberian peninsula and the Spanish state\u2019s response to it we must first understand, therefore, how the United Nations and the European Union are responding to climate change since the Spanish political system\u2019s control and mitigation policies are largely determined by these two larger governance systems\u2019 responses.

Madrid is the political and cultural center of Spain and one of Europe's most lively and charming cities. It boasts a history that goes back to the Middle Ages; from the 16th century on, it was the seat of a brilliant royal court. This is reflected in the city's rich architecture and abundance of monuments.   Contemporary Madrid is a clean and efficient city of wide boulevards, outstanding museums, monuments, theatres, and libraries. The city's public transportation-metro and buses-is first rate. Madrid is famous for its restaurants as well as its nightlife. The numerous caf\u00e9s are frequented by students, writers, artists, and journalists. Because of its location in the geographical center of the country, Madrid is also an ideal base for exploring the rest of the Iberian Peninsula and beyond through a network of rapid, modern bus and rail transportation. Students who have lived and studied in Madrid often look at that period as one of the most transforming experiences of their lives.           ACADEMICS   NYU Summer in Madrid offers Spanish language courses at all levels, including intensive study, as well as Spanish literature, culture, fine arts, history, and cinema courses in English or Spanish. Courses are taught by NYU Madrid faculty and Spanish university professors who are recognized experts in their fields. Students also enjoy a full range of cultural activities, seminars, and excursions led by experts in history, art, and architecture. Visits include the world-renowned Prado museum, other important museums and monuments, and Old Madrid, the &quot;Greenwich Village&quot; of this historic city. In addition, students' knowledge and understanding of Spain is broadened by excursions to other regions and cities such as Santiago de Compostella, Gij\u00f3n and Toledo.           HOUSING &amp; MEALS      The NYU Madrid academic center is two chalet-style buildings located in the beautiful El Viso neighborhood just a few Metro stops from the city center.     All students participating in the program are required to live in NYU-provided housing. The program arranges for students to live in Spanish homes, which is strongly recommended as the best way to encourage the use of Spanish and to immerse oneself in the rhythms of everyday life. Apartments are also available. Students are informed of their homestay families and apartments before arrival in Madrid.           EXCURSIONS   There is a three-day excursion as part of the Summer Program. Option A is Castilla-Leon and the Basque Country (Burgos, Bilbao, and Soria); Option B is Northern Spain: Oviedo and Gijon. Possible day trips include El Escorial, Toledo, and Segovia.           COURSES     Students must register for 8 points. It is strongly suggested that students register for one 4 point language course and one 4 point content course, or for one 8 point intensive language course.

From the 8th century until the 17th century, Islam played a crucial role in the history of the Iberian Peninsula. Today this period is often portrayed as one of inter-religious harmony, while al-Andalus is simultaneously mourned in contemporary Islamist discourse as a lost paradise. While we look at the history of Al-Andalus and assess the importance of the contributions of Al-Andalus to Europe and America, we evaluate the significance of its legacy in modern Spain. Furthermore, we will study the protagonist role that Spain has played in relations between Europe and the Mediterranean Islamic countries during the Modern Age. Students will gain further understanding and contextualization of current Arab-Muslim geopolitics. As a case study, we will address the Spanish Protectorate in Morocco, as well as its ensuing process of decolonization and the consequences that shape the current international relations between the two neighboring countries, Spain and Morocco.

Culture of Spain: An Anthropological Perspective - SPAN-UA 9631 or ANTH-UA 9250 - 4 points                               The recent changes in both Spain and Portugal are only the latest in a series of important transformations which these two countries have undergone over the past fifty years or so. In that time, they have both gone from being predominantly rural societies where the majority of the population live and work on the land to become industrial societies not unlike those of northern Europe and North America. Yet the underlying cultural heterogeneity of the peoples of the Iberian Peninsula has meant that different regions have often had very distinct reactions to the various pressures towards political, economic and social change.   As well as introducing you to some of the basic concepts used in the study of social change, this course concentrates on examining the ethnographic diversity of the various regions of Spain and Portugal. Knowledge of this underlying diversity is essential in comprehending the importance that regionalism has played in Iberian history and its relevance to the understanding of the acceptance or rejection of such change by the different regions in contemporary Spain and Portugal. The course will specifically examine the rapidly changing role of women in both countries.

Students examine how this national culture is constructed, first analyzing Spain from North African perspectives through Sephardic nostalgic poetry and the Hispano-Arabic literary traditions. The American perspective pits notions of Spanish imperial power and grandeur against the Black Legend, a term that Protestant circles in Europe and the United States promoted to attack the legitimacy of Spain\u2019s New World empire. A final focus on European views analyzes the depiction of Spain as the embodiment of German and French Romantic ideals beginning at the end of the 17th century and the reemergence of the same notion during the Spanish Civil War (1933\u201336). Throughout, students examine principal textual and visual images that contribute to the historical and contemporary construction of a national culture that emerged at geographic and cultural crossroads.

Madrid is the political and cultural center of Spain and one of Europe's most lively and charming cities. It boasts a history that goes back to the Middle Ages; from the 16th century on, it was the seat of a brilliant royal court. This is reflected in the city's rich architecture and abundance of monuments.   Contemporary Madrid is a clean and efficient city of wide boulevards, outstanding museums, monuments, theatres, and libraries. The city's public transportation-metro and buses-is first rate. Madrid is famous for its restaurants as well as its nightlife. The numerous caf\u00e9s are frequented by students, writers, artists, and journalists. Because of its location in the geographical center of the country, Madrid is also an ideal base for exploring the rest of the Iberian Peninsula and beyond through a network of rapid, modern bus and rail transportation. Students who have lived and studied in Madrid often look at that period as one of the most transforming experiences of their lives.           ACADEMICS   NYU Summer in Madrid offers Spanish language courses at all levels, including intensive study, as well as Spanish literature, culture, fine arts, history, and cinema courses in English or Spanish. Courses are taught by NYU Madrid faculty and Spanish university professors who are recognized experts in their fields. Students also enjoy a full range of cultural activities, seminars, and excursions led by experts in history, art, and architecture. Visits include the world-renowned Prado museum, other important museums and monuments, and Old Madrid, the &quot;Greenwich Village&quot; of this historic city. In addition, students' knowledge and understanding of Spain is broadened by excursions to other regions and cities such as Santiago de Compostella, Gij\u00f3n and Toledo.           HOUSING &amp; MEALS      The NYU Madrid academic center is two chalet-style buildings located in the beautiful El Viso neighborhood just a few Metro stops from the city center.     All students participating in the program are required to live in NYU-provided housing. The program arranges for students to live in Spanish homes, which is strongly recommended as the best way to encourage the use of Spanish and to immerse oneself in the rhythms of everyday life. Apartments are also available. Students are informed of their homestay families and apartments before arrival in Madrid.           EXCURSIONS   There is a three-day excursion as part of the Summer Program. Option A is Castilla-Leon and the Basque Country (Burgos, Bilbao, and Soria); Option B is Northern Spain: Oviedo and Gijon. Possible day trips include El Escorial, Toledo, and Segovia.           COURSES     Students must register for 8 points. It is strongly suggested that students register for one 4 point language course and one 4 point content course, or for one 8 point intensive language course.
