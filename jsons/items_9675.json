I also co-organized with the Center for Latin American and Caribbean Studies a symposium on \"The Life and Work of Michel-Rolph Trouillot\" (see CLACS website for videotape of conference, March 1, 2013). It was a highly successful event, filling the KJCC auditorium with academics and members of diverse community publics who engaged in spirited dialogs about the many and important legacies of a monumentally important scholar who left us too soon.

Interconnected topics will address a myriad of cultural issues that face Haiti and its Diaspora with the guidance of panels made up of academics, artists, and students all with connections to the island nation. Cross-generational, multi-disciplined panels will explore the how the dynamism of identity and culture can provide windows into important questions of development and global representations of the nation. Topics will address the context of Haitian art in Haiti and on the international art scene, what shapes the social landscape in Haiti and in the Diaspora and how this impacts those who identify with Haiti and its culture.   Panels: An Age Thing : The Generational Haitian Immigrant Experience The differences between the Papa Doc expatriates who fled during the 1950\u2032s, 1960\u2032s and 1970\u2032s, the wave of young immigrants in the early 1990\u2019s, and the influx of 2010 evacuees of all ages builds a dynamic picture of the present Haitian immigrant population in the U.S. and beyond. What motivations and obstacles link us? What experiences in our new space build these groups as distinct from those before and after? Panelists are Alice Backer , lawyer by training and founder and operator of kiske\u00e1city, a blog that highlights Haitian, Haitian-American, and Caribbean culture and current events, Anthonine Pierre , community organizer at Brooklyn Movement Center and former community liaison to the Manhattan Borough President, and Millery Polyn\u00e9 , NYU Gallatin Assistant Professor of History and the Caribbean &amp; chair of the Diaspora in Dialogue Symposium.  Around the V\u00e8v\u00e8 : The Impact of Vodou on Perceptions of Haiti   Though Haitian Vodou stems from traditional religions of West Africa and is a vital link to the history of Haiti\u2019s people, Western and internal state   efforts to distance the nation from the religion have cast Vodou in the shadows. How does the history of Vodou play into the perception of Haiti\u2019s culture? What social, economic and political factors impact Haitians and non-Haitians sentiments about Vodou?   Panelists are Dr. Lois Wilcken , musicologist and director of La Troupe Makandal and Dowoti Desir , Manbo Asogwe and scholar of the Vodou religion. This panel will be moderated by Katherine Smith , Assistant Professor researching contemporary Haiti and Vodou, and HCX\u2019s Faculty Liaison at CLACS, NYU.     Going Back : The Haitian Diasporan Identity in Haiti     Efforts from the Diaspora to support Haiti have always existed, but energies to create sustained change (particularly after 2010) have led to a movement of HaitianDiaspora groups returning to Haiti and working on the ground. What is the impact of these groups and individuals in Haiti? In what capacities are they working with the state or with non-governmental organizations? How are they perceived? How do they perceive their revisited \u201chome?\u201d What is the experience of individuals or Haitian descendants living abroad and \u201creturning\u201d to a land of collective memory?     Panelists are Gabrielle Apollon , first year student focusing on human rights at NYU\u2019s School of Law, Dr. Lesly Kernisant , Founder and CEO of SimACT, and Linda Th\u00e9l\u00e9maque , Founder &amp; President of Project Istwa.        Using the Haitian Eye : Creating as an Artist in the Diaspora     Haitian artists in the Diaspora often create works in response to their individual perspectives and developments back \u201chome.\u201d In what ways have artists\u2019 ideas of longing, faith, memory, and authoritarianism manifested, or not manifested, in their work? How does the diasporic audience interact with Haiti-centered artwork made outside of Haiti, by Haitians and non-Haitians? What facets of Haitian Diasporan art are acting to build dynamism and dialogue about Haiti\u2019s cultural identity?     Panelists are Jeffrey Dessources , Haitian-American poet, professor, and public speaker, Jerry Lamothe , award-winning filmmaker, Rejin Leys , Haitian-American mixed media artist, and Charlot Lucien , Haitian folklorist and performer. Panel will be moderated by Jerry Philogene , Assistant Professor of American studies at Dickinson College.              Click here to register.
