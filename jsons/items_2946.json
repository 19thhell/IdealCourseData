Defining Russia    RUSSN-GA 2121 Required course for graduate students in the department. Lounsbery. 4 points. 2013-14. Interdisciplinary, team-taught course designed to introduce the main methods and chief scholarly debates in contemporary Russian studies.    Conspiracy Theories: Paranoid Fictions After Freud    RUSSN-GA 2122 Borenstein. 4 points. 2013-14. With its clash of ideologies and the rise and fall of metanarratives (modernism, postmodernism, Marxism), the 20th century saw a proliferation of conspiracy theories and intricate attempts to impose rational order on increasingly chaotic systems. This course examines 20th-century narratives that exemplify and explore the modernist and postmodernist paranoid mindset. Authors include Kafka, Olesha, Freud, Pelevin, Pynchon, Dick, and Sologub.

Marxist Aesthetics in Russia    RUSSN-GA 2139 Groys. 4 points. 2013-14. The course has a goal to describe and discuss the development of the Marxist thought on art in Russia before and after the October revolution. It begins with the writings by Plekhanov on the Marxist aesthetics and follows its evolution through Russian avant-garde and Proletkult up to the theories of the theories of the Socialist Realism of the 1930s. In the framework of the seminar we will be reading also the authors relevant for the Russian Marxist art critique like Lukacs, Brecht and Adorno.    Tolstoy vs. Dostoevsky    RUSSN-GA 2208 Lounsbery. 4 points. 2013-14.

The novel has been for a long time understood by its theorists as the genre par excellence of truthlessness. This course attempts to reevaluate this view, proposing that the 19th-century novel in particular should be understood as responding to the emerging tendency to view truth as inseparable from, rather than opposed to, time. This tendency, then, can be said to account for the specific shape and the remarkable \"success\" of the 19th-century European novel. It is in these novels that narrative's essential relation to time achieves its most dramatic fruition. Readings from Goethe, Hegel, Balzac, Stendhal, Dostoevsky, Tolstoy, Henry James, Bakhtin, Koj\u00e8ve, Peter Brooks.    The Bildungsroman in Russia and the West    RUSSN-GA 2126 Kliger. 4 points. 2013-14. Explores the generic field of the Bildungsroman as it organizes a number of representative narratives in 19th-century Russia and Western Europe in light of modernity's paradoxical injunctions toward rigorous socialization on the one hand and subjective volatilization on the other. The course foregrounds difficulties and rewards of the Bildungsroman within the specifically Russian literary tradition and social context. Readings from Goethe, Balzac, Constant, Dostoevsky, Goncharov, Flaubert, Lermontov, Pushkin, Tolstoy, and Turgenev.    Malevich    RUSSN-GA 2290 Seminar. Groys. 4 points. 2013-14.

Through close and critical readings of primary texts we will explore how certain themes (e.g. justice, truth, love, desire, writing, persuasion) are expressed across different genres, and how (and how successfully) philosophy and the emerging arts of poetics and rhetoric distinguish themselves from one another throughout classical antiquity. Throughout our study we will take gender as a guiding question, asking how the texts construct and portray gender, how gender is deployed as an organizing principle, and how conceptions of gender are thereby developed and consolidated in them. Authors include Homer, Heraclitus, Parmenides, Plato, Aristotle, Sappho, Euripides, Aristophanes, Horace, Longinus, and various recent commentators. All readings will be in translation; students with Greek/Latin are encouraged to refer to the original texts.  Junior Theory Seminar: Modernity  Iampolski   Modernity is a product of Enlightenment that dramatically changed the face of the Western culture by proclaiming the autonomy and supremacy of human Reason. This new attitude allowed an unprecedented development of science and became a basis for many fundamental achievements of the Western civilization. However the same attitude has created a lot of contradictions that define modernity. The course is designed to analyze the antinomies of the culture of modernity. We will start with a founding document of European rationalism - philosophical statements by Descartes and will see how the cult of Reason and the great western political principles (equality of rights, the rule of law) related to the dominance of Reason are paradoxically responsible for new kinds of violence and social exclusion. The following subjects will be discussed: individual and masses in modern society; violence and modern war; totalitarianism; mechanization of life, alienation, machines; the emergence of subjectivity and the \"loss experience\"; market, capitalism, and many others.  Topics in 20th Century Lit: The Literature of Dictatorship in Spain and Latin America Matos-Martin This course will analyze representations of the traumatic dictatorial histories of Spain and the Southern Cone countries (Argentina, Chile and Uruguay) from a comparative perspective. We will focus on literary and visual sources such as short stories, novels, fiction films or documentaries, and we will examine topics such as the politics of memory, fascism, political disappearance, war, resistance or violence. Some authors and filmmakers whose works we might engage include Manuel Rivas, Alberto M\u00e9ndez, Luisa Valenzuela, Julio Cort\u00e1zar, Isaac Rosa, Mario Benedetti, Eduardo Galeano, Andr\u00e9s Wood, Marco Bechis, Guillermo del Toro, Agust\u00edn Villaronga, and Ken Loach. Primary materials will be paired with texts by leading cultural and political thinkers working on questions of memory, fascism, terror and violence.  Readings in Contemporary Literary Theory: Theory of Narrative Sanders Have you wondered how a novel or short story guides you as a reader toward a particular interpretation? How is the meaning of a given work generated by the way in which the work is constructed? This is the central question posed by the theory of narrative. Addressing key narratological topics such as point of view, levels of narration, character and plot, and narrative time, we will read selected realist, modernist, and postmodernist works of growing narrative complexity from across the globe. With works by Balzac, Conrad, Robbe-Grillet, Coetzee, and Wicomb as our primary texts, we will explore how the theory of narrative may usefully complement deconstructive, psychoanalytic, feminist, and postcolonial approaches to reading fictional (and non-fictional) narrative texts. We shall also explore issues of filmic narrative as arise in the adaptation of novels for the screen. Our theoretical works will include writings by Mieke Bal, Roland Barthes, Fredric Jameson, and others.  Evolution of Literary Archetypes: Comparative Romanticisms Sieburth Virginia Woolf once quipped, \u201cOn or about December 1910, human character changed,\u201d but she was probably off by more than a century. Most cultural historians would instead locate this seismic shift in the late eighteenth-century with the emergence of the phenomenon loosely termed Romanticism. Rousseau\u2019s Confessions (posthumously published in 1782) are to our modernity what Augustine\u2019s were to Antiquity and provide the foundational text for what it sometimes called our contemporary Culture of Narcissism. Rousseau\u2019s writings, and in particular his emphasis on the individual\u2019s victimization by society, make possible Goethe\u2019s Storm-and-Stress hero, Werther (who commits suicide) and B\u00fcchner\u2019s Lenz and Woyzeck (both of whom go mad). After exploring these various figures of the Pariah, we will examine the Promethean Overreacher, embodied by Goethe\u2019s Faust and Mary Shelley\u2019s Victor Frankenstein. The social and political ferment that accompanied these emerging archetypes of the Romantic Hero finds its most violent expression in the ideal of Revolution. We will read the American and French Revolutions from the perspectives of Blake ( in his early prophecies), Wordsworth (in selections from The Prelude), and Hugo (in his gothic novel about the Haitian Revolution, Bug-Jargal). The final portion of the semester will be devoted to the Romantic Heroine, as depicted in Bront\u00eb\u2019s Wuthering Heights and Flaubert\u2019s Madame Bovary.  Senior Seminar in Comparative Literature: Honors Thesis Vatulescu This seminar, limited to senior Comparative Literature majors engaged in writing a senior honors thesis, is designed to be a writing workshop. Students will articulate and research a thesis topic, identify an appropriate critical approach and methodology, and write at least one chapter of their thesis. Periodical writing installments give the students the opportunity to receive feed-back from their peers and instructor as well as to learn to critique others' work-in-progress. Permission of the DUGS is required to enroll in the course. Students must also have a 3.65 or better GPA, both overall and in the major. The Senior Thesis Seminar must be followed by Independent Study (COLIT-UA 997) to complete the honors thesis.  MAP : Texts and Ideas: Animal Humans Lezra \"One might go so far as to define man as a creature that has failed in its effort to keep its animalness\u2026\" So writes the German philosopher Peter Sloterdijk. What sort of animal were we? Where, how, and by whom has the line between the human and the animal been drawn? With what consequences for our \"human\" understanding of the world? Of concepts like the \"soul,\" \"society,\" politics, the family? Is the line between the human and the animal drawn differently in different genres--in literary works, theological treatises, natural histories, paintings, films? We come at these questions from different angles, following them from antiquity to early modern responses to these questions, and in essays by contemporary philosophers and advocates. Readings: Genesis, Numbers, Euripides' Bacchae, Plato's Phaedrus, Ovid's Metamorphoses, Apuleius' Golden Ass, Marie de France' Bisclavret, Shakespeare's Midsummer Night's Dream, Montaigne's \"Apology in Defense of Raymond Sebond, Machiavelli's Prince, H. G. Wells's Island of Dr. Moreau and Island of Lost Souls, Derrida's \"The Animal that therefore I am,\" selections from Boccaccio, Peter Singer, Giorgio Agamben, Donna Haraway.  Readings in Contemporary Literary Theory: Metropolis and World Literature Zhang As an introduction to the concept and discipline of comparative literature, this course examines how modern metropolises in different parts of the world nourish and challenge literary sensibilities, and how modern literature, by treating the city as both its environment and its hero, evolves from realism to modernism and beyond. Our goal is two-fold: On the one hand, and more immediately concerning literature, it seeks to revive Goethe\u2019s notion of Weltliteratur (world literature) in our own time, not by searching for an overarching theme of human experience and culture in which a universal definition of humanity can be reached once and for all, but only by going through different historical, social, and national situations which manifest themselves in terms of cultural and political differences and self-assertions. On the other hand, and regarding a broader interest in the city itself and its representation in the major works of world literature and film, the course is also intended to engage in common issues of our times such as individuality versus community and collectivity; locality versus globality; past versus present, as they are mediated and intensified by urban forms, experiences, and sensibilities. By hopping from city to city, we hope to construct a trajectory of world literature and its world-historical moments of intensity, which is often articulated through the self-images of the great cities. We will be particularly concerned with how the city and literary imagination interact with one another; how the city can be seen as a producer of cultures, subjectivities, diversity, dissent, and unity; and how the urban experience shapes our understanding of time, space, self, and other. The course is also an imagined field trip to some of the major cities on the literary and intellectual map of the modern world. We will visit London in Charles Dickens and T.S. Eliot; Paris in Hugo, Baudelaire, and Flaubert; Dublin in Joyce, Berlin in Water Benjamin; St. Petersburgh in Dostoyevsky and Andre Bely, New York in Dreiser and Fitzgerald, and finally, across the Pacific, Shanghai, and Beijing, the two urban centers that capture the imagination of modern China as they are portrayed in Lao She and Mao Dun, two leading writers of Chinese realist literature. The EuroAmreican and East Asian focus is by no means limiting. There will be a few classes reserved for students who are interested in reading and discussing other cities in other national literary and cultural traditions. Our readings will be centrally literary but some films will be introduced, both as a visual aid and more importantly a different regime of senses and symbolisms entangled with the city. Each class period will be divided into a short lecture and sustained discussions. Students are also expected to do class presentations and act as discussion leaders. Grades will be based on a 1-2 pp weekly journal on the assignment, and a 10pp final paper.

The novel has been for a long time understood by its theorists as the genre par excellence of truthlessness. This course attempts to reevaluate this view, proposing that the 19th-century novel in particular should be understood as responding to the emerging tendency to view truth as inseparable from, rather than opposed to, time. This tendency, then, can be said to account for the specific shape and the remarkable \"success\" of the 19th-century European novel. It is in these novels that narrative's essential relation to time achieves its most dramatic fruition. Readings from Goethe, Hegel, Balzac, Stendhal, Dostoevsky, Tolstoy, Henry James, Bakhtin, Koj\u00e8ve, Peter Brooks.

Through close and critical readings of primary texts we will explore how certain themes (e.g. justice, truth, love, desire, writing, persuasion) are expressed across different genres, and how (and how successfully) philosophy and the emerging arts of poetics and rhetoric distinguish themselves from one another throughout classical antiquity. Throughout our study we will take gender as a guiding question, asking how the texts construct and portray gender, how gender is deployed as an organizing principle, and how conceptions of gender are thereby developed and consolidated in them. Authors include Homer, Heraclitus, Parmenides, Plato, Aristotle, Sappho, Euripides, Aristophanes, Horace, Longinus, and various recent commentators. All readings will be in translation; students with Greek/Latin are encouraged to refer to the original texts.  Junior Theory Seminar: Modernity  Iampolski   Modernity is a product of Enlightenment that dramatically changed the face of the Western culture by proclaiming the autonomy and supremacy of human Reason. This new attitude allowed an unprecedented development of science and became a basis for many fundamental achievements of the Western civilization. However the same attitude has created a lot of contradictions that define modernity. The course is designed to analyze the antinomies of the culture of modernity. We will start with a founding document of European rationalism - philosophical statements by Descartes and will see how the cult of Reason and the great western political principles (equality of rights, the rule of law) related to the dominance of Reason are paradoxically responsible for new kinds of violence and social exclusion. The following subjects will be discussed: individual and masses in modern society; violence and modern war; totalitarianism; mechanization of life, alienation, machines; the emergence of subjectivity and the \"loss experience\"; market, capitalism, and many others.  Topics in 20th Century Lit: The Literature of Dictatorship in Spain and Latin America Matos-Martin This course will analyze representations of the traumatic dictatorial histories of Spain and the Southern Cone countries (Argentina, Chile and Uruguay) from a comparative perspective. We will focus on literary and visual sources such as short stories, novels, fiction films or documentaries, and we will examine topics such as the politics of memory, fascism, political disappearance, war, resistance or violence. Some authors and filmmakers whose works we might engage include Manuel Rivas, Alberto M\u00e9ndez, Luisa Valenzuela, Julio Cort\u00e1zar, Isaac Rosa, Mario Benedetti, Eduardo Galeano, Andr\u00e9s Wood, Marco Bechis, Guillermo del Toro, Agust\u00edn Villaronga, and Ken Loach. Primary materials will be paired with texts by leading cultural and political thinkers working on questions of memory, fascism, terror and violence.  Readings in Contemporary Literary Theory: Theory of Narrative Sanders Have you wondered how a novel or short story guides you as a reader toward a particular interpretation? How is the meaning of a given work generated by the way in which the work is constructed? This is the central question posed by the theory of narrative. Addressing key narratological topics such as point of view, levels of narration, character and plot, and narrative time, we will read selected realist, modernist, and postmodernist works of growing narrative complexity from across the globe. With works by Balzac, Conrad, Robbe-Grillet, Coetzee, and Wicomb as our primary texts, we will explore how the theory of narrative may usefully complement deconstructive, psychoanalytic, feminist, and postcolonial approaches to reading fictional (and non-fictional) narrative texts. We shall also explore issues of filmic narrative as arise in the adaptation of novels for the screen. Our theoretical works will include writings by Mieke Bal, Roland Barthes, Fredric Jameson, and others.  Evolution of Literary Archetypes: Comparative Romanticisms Sieburth Virginia Woolf once quipped, \u201cOn or about December 1910, human character changed,\u201d but she was probably off by more than a century. Most cultural historians would instead locate this seismic shift in the late eighteenth-century with the emergence of the phenomenon loosely termed Romanticism. Rousseau\u2019s Confessions (posthumously published in 1782) are to our modernity what Augustine\u2019s were to Antiquity and provide the foundational text for what it sometimes called our contemporary Culture of Narcissism. Rousseau\u2019s writings, and in particular his emphasis on the individual\u2019s victimization by society, make possible Goethe\u2019s Storm-and-Stress hero, Werther (who commits suicide) and B\u00fcchner\u2019s Lenz and Woyzeck (both of whom go mad). After exploring these various figures of the Pariah, we will examine the Promethean Overreacher, embodied by Goethe\u2019s Faust and Mary Shelley\u2019s Victor Frankenstein. The social and political ferment that accompanied these emerging archetypes of the Romantic Hero finds its most violent expression in the ideal of Revolution. We will read the American and French Revolutions from the perspectives of Blake ( in his early prophecies), Wordsworth (in selections from The Prelude), and Hugo (in his gothic novel about the Haitian Revolution, Bug-Jargal). The final portion of the semester will be devoted to the Romantic Heroine, as depicted in Bront\u00eb\u2019s Wuthering Heights and Flaubert\u2019s Madame Bovary.  Senior Seminar in Comparative Literature: Honors Thesis Vatulescu This seminar, limited to senior Comparative Literature majors engaged in writing a senior honors thesis, is designed to be a writing workshop. Students will articulate and research a thesis topic, identify an appropriate critical approach and methodology, and write at least one chapter of their thesis. Periodical writing installments give the students the opportunity to receive feed-back from their peers and instructor as well as to learn to critique others' work-in-progress. Permission of the DUGS is required to enroll in the course. Students must also have a 3.65 or better GPA, both overall and in the major. The Senior Thesis Seminar must be followed by Independent Study (COLIT-UA 997) to complete the honors thesis.  MAP : Texts and Ideas: Animal Humans Lezra \"One might go so far as to define man as a creature that has failed in its effort to keep its animalness\u2026\" So writes the German philosopher Peter Sloterdijk. What sort of animal were we? Where, how, and by whom has the line between the human and the animal been drawn? With what consequences for our \"human\" understanding of the world? Of concepts like the \"soul,\" \"society,\" politics, the family? Is the line between the human and the animal drawn differently in different genres--in literary works, theological treatises, natural histories, paintings, films? We come at these questions from different angles, following them from antiquity to early modern responses to these questions, and in essays by contemporary philosophers and advocates. Readings: Genesis, Numbers, Euripides' Bacchae, Plato's Phaedrus, Ovid's Metamorphoses, Apuleius' Golden Ass, Marie de France' Bisclavret, Shakespeare's Midsummer Night's Dream, Montaigne's \"Apology in Defense of Raymond Sebond, Machiavelli's Prince, H. G. Wells's Island of Dr. Moreau and Island of Lost Souls, Derrida's \"The Animal that therefore I am,\" selections from Boccaccio, Peter Singer, Giorgio Agamben, Donna Haraway.  Readings in Contemporary Literary Theory: Metropolis and World Literature Zhang As an introduction to the concept and discipline of comparative literature, this course examines how modern metropolises in different parts of the world nourish and challenge literary sensibilities, and how modern literature, by treating the city as both its environment and its hero, evolves from realism to modernism and beyond. Our goal is two-fold: On the one hand, and more immediately concerning literature, it seeks to revive Goethe\u2019s notion of Weltliteratur (world literature) in our own time, not by searching for an overarching theme of human experience and culture in which a universal definition of humanity can be reached once and for all, but only by going through different historical, social, and national situations which manifest themselves in terms of cultural and political differences and self-assertions. On the other hand, and regarding a broader interest in the city itself and its representation in the major works of world literature and film, the course is also intended to engage in common issues of our times such as individuality versus community and collectivity; locality versus globality; past versus present, as they are mediated and intensified by urban forms, experiences, and sensibilities. By hopping from city to city, we hope to construct a trajectory of world literature and its world-historical moments of intensity, which is often articulated through the self-images of the great cities. We will be particularly concerned with how the city and literary imagination interact with one another; how the city can be seen as a producer of cultures, subjectivities, diversity, dissent, and unity; and how the urban experience shapes our understanding of time, space, self, and other. The course is also an imagined field trip to some of the major cities on the literary and intellectual map of the modern world. We will visit London in Charles Dickens and T.S. Eliot; Paris in Hugo, Baudelaire, and Flaubert; Dublin in Joyce, Berlin in Water Benjamin; St. Petersburgh in Dostoyevsky and Andre Bely, New York in Dreiser and Fitzgerald, and finally, across the Pacific, Shanghai, and Beijing, the two urban centers that capture the imagination of modern China as they are portrayed in Lao She and Mao Dun, two leading writers of Chinese realist literature. The EuroAmreican and East Asian focus is by no means limiting. There will be a few classes reserved for students who are interested in reading and discussing other cities in other national literary and cultural traditions. Our readings will be centrally literary but some films will be introduced, both as a visual aid and more importantly a different regime of senses and symbolisms entangled with the city. Each class period will be divided into a short lecture and sustained discussions. Students are also expected to do class presentations and act as discussion leaders. Grades will be based on a 1-2 pp weekly journal on the assignment, and a 10pp final paper.

Some examples are the emancipation impulse, \u201cdouble consciousness,\u201d  the black struggle for human rights, the rise of black women writers,  postmodernism, sexual and gender politics, and contemporary  expressions of the slavery motif.          The Black Essay SCA-UA 152 Offered every year. 4  points. Examines the urban experience and black  life and culture in New York through a series of writing assignments  on African American neighborhoods, institutions, issues, and culture.  Students are required to travel throughout the black community,  conduct interviews, and do research for essays on the black  experience in the city. They are introduced to the research and  reporting techniques of journalism and given the chance to employ  these techniques in their papers.          The Black Body and the Lens SCA-UA 155 Offered every year. 4  points. This interdisciplinary seminar explores  the range of ideas and methods used by critical thinkers in  addressing the body in photography, video, music, and film. Central  to our discussions is a focus on how the display of the black body  affects how we see and interpret the world. Using a series of case  studies, we consider the construction of beauty, gendered images,  race, and hip-hop culture. The historical gaze has profoundly  determined the visual construction of the black body in contemporary  society. The interplay between the historical and the contemporary,  between self-presentation and imposed representation, is fundamental  to our discussions. The seminar centers the student within the  contemporary world of image making with an emphasis on the black  body. Final projects include an imaging project and/or a written  essay.          Black Feminism SCA-UA 156 Offered once every two  years. 4 points. This course explores the production and  practice of black feminist theory in 20th-century America. We examine  the written work and the activism of African American women and look  at the way that theory and practice historically intersect around  questions of race and gender. Because this is a course on feminism,  we also spend a good deal of time interrogating power and thinking  about the ways in which systems of oppression both produce and block  a black feminist consciousness. Hip Hop &amp; Politics SCA-UA 157 Offered every year. 4 points. In places ranging from the political theory of Adolph Reed to the comedy of Bill Cosby we find a critique of the \"hip hop generation\" so dismissive it might be a useful point of departure for further historical and theoretical inquiry. Besides realizing the worst fears of a previous generation who placed its hopes in the aspirations of 60s-era social movements, this new generation's fashion sensibilities, technological savvy, and strategies for commodifying blackness suggest a demographic now more concerned with the economics of globalization than the political economy of race. This course mixes a diverse set of readings with music and film to interrogate the specific generational tensions that structure popular and intellectual discourses concerning the \"hip-hop generation\" and the perceived demise of contemporary black politics. Race and Reproduction SCA-UA 158 Offered every other year. 4 points. Race and Reproduction is an interdisciplinary course that examines the connections between gender, racial ideology and history of medicine to consider the range of ways that reproduction\u2014medically, culturally, and experientially\u2014produces and troubles racial ideology. In this course we will explore issues in the history of race and reproduction, focusing primarily (though not exclusively) on North American contexts. Cross-cultural breadth will help us to consider the relationship between biological experiences (which are often portrayed as universal) and socio-cultural context. While questions about biology will be central to this history, we will also locate biology within a wider set of issues around social reproduction and the practices of motherhood. Through our readings we will consider how different disciplinary orientations (social history, medical anthropology, feminist theory, art history, etc.) help us to illuminate and problematize the connections between technologies and politics of biology and difference.             Language and Liberation: At Home in the  Caribbean and Abroad SCA-UA 163 Identical to LING-UA 26.  Offered every year. 4 points. Explores the linguistic and cultural  transformations that took place in the Commonwealth Caribbean from  17th-century slavery and bond servitude to the present day. The focus  is on the extent to which Caribbean people were given or demanded the  freedom to create and maintain a postcolonial Caribbean identity.  Discusses the sociohistorical conditions that led to the creation of  new Caribbean languages called \u201cpidgins\u201d and \u201ccreoles\u201d as the  English language was transplanted from Britain to the Third World.          The Postcolonial City SCA-UA 166 Offered once every year. 4  points. Cities have played an important role  throughout African history and in various Afrodiasporic contexts:  from the metropolises of ancient Egypt and the urban centers of  well-known West African civilizations (such as Ghana, Mali, and  Songhai) to cities such as Port-au-Prince, Havana, and Georgetown in  the Caribbean and the urban enclaves in the United States. In  attending to the way actors constitute wealth and power\u2014in  accounting for the way proximity structures interpersonal  experiences\u2014this course uses ethnographic, sociological,  historical, and literary texts to theorize the Afrodiasporic city. We  explore the contours of these urban matrices through special  attention to historical categories that prepare us to theorize the  way Afrodiasporic populations have experienced and lived history  (e.g., the precolonial, the colonial, and the postcolonial). As part  of our mission, we consider the historical emergence of the Third  World as not simply a broad rubric for African and Asian  postcolonies, but instead, a project to reverse the course of  European exploitation. Instead of proceeding strictly  chronologically, students consider the Afrodiasporic urban experience  thematically, through a diverse array of readings.          Topics in Africana Studies SCA-UA 180 Offered once a semester. 4  points. Explores specific issues dealing with  the black urban experience, focusing on social and cultural  institutions. Possible themes, which vary from semester to semester,  include class and poverty, the police, urban development, education,  sports, music, and art.          Topics in Pan-Africanism SCA-UA 181 Offered once a semester. 4  points. Deals with specific themes of  Pan-Africanism and their impact on the modern world. Possible themes,  which vary from semester to semester, include African unity, black  rebellion, colonialism and racism, the African diaspora and culture,  and relationships between Pan-Africanism and movements such as  nationalism, Marxism, and Afrocentricity.      Language Courses          Elementary Swahili I SCA-UA 121 Offered every year. 4  points. Provides students with an elementary  understanding of Swahili, a Bantu language with a rich oral and  written tradition that is spoken by about 100 million people from  Somalia to Mozambique and Zanzibar. After a short presentation of  Swahili\u2019s history, codification, and relation to other languages,  students are drilled in phonetics and grammar. They are also  introduced to poems, songs, and oral narratives.          Elementary Swahili II SCA-UA 122 Prerequisite: Elementary  Swahili I (SCA-UA 121) or permission of the instructor. Offered every  year. 4 points. Expands on the basic knowledge of the  pronunciation, vocabulary, useful expressions, and fundamental  grammatical features acquired in Swahili I. Allows essential  communication skills to develop into conversational ability using  simple and familiar situations. Building on the early grasp of the  language, students expand the range of conversational ability and  understanding of various grammatical concepts associated with this  agglutinative language.          Intermediate Swahili I SCA-UA 123 Prerequisite: Elementary  Swahili II (SCA-UA 122) or permission of the instructor. Offered  every year. 4 points. Builds on the basic knowledge of the  pronunciation, vocabulary, useful expressions, and fundamental  grammatical features already attained at the introductory level. Aims  to strengthen reading, writing, and conversation skills by accessing  a wide range of grammatical and literary knowledge of the language,  its cultural context, and literary genre. Students are required to  familiarize themselves with a novel and a play written in Kiswahili.          Intermediate Swahili II SCA-UA 124 Prerequisite: Intermediate  Swahili I (SCA-UA 123) or permission of the instructor. Offered every  year. 4 points. Aims to enable students to communicate  entirely in Kiswahili, to carry out bidirectional translation from  Swahili to English and from English to Swahili, and to negotiate  technical language. At this level, students would master the  intricacies of Kiswahili grammar; acquire a wide range of vocabulary;  read Kiswahili fluently; understand Kiswahili poetry, idioms, and  proverbs; and use idiomatic Kiswahili in creative writing and  translation.
