Elective courses can be used to provide greater depth in an area of interest, explore new public health concepts or gain additional skill sets. Below are elective courses open to all MPH students who have met identified prerequisite requirements. Students may take electives within his/her area of concentration or outside of it. With advisor approval, MPH students may also select a graduate level course outside of the MPH program, taking advantage of the rich academic offerings across the university. Students work with their advisor in selecting elective courses based on individualized professional and educational needs.

Public Health Program            New York University has united the NYU Steinhardt School Community Public Health and Global Public Health programs into an even stronger, fully-accredited Master of Public Health ( NYU MPH ). The newly consolidated NYU MPH includes three concentrations: Community and International Health, Public Health Nutrition, and Global Health Leadership. The NYU MPH is a university-wide degree program and is no longer a part of the Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development.
