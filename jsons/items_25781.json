The course focuses on software and hardware workflows for the creative applications of multi-channel sound and immersive video for the creation of fixed, generative, reactive, performance-based, and interactive systems that can be experienced in a gallery context and in live and ensemble performance contexts. Students will develop a semester-length project to use scale and immersion to creative effect, and will work on designing systems and pieces that encourage interactivity and group collaboration in performance. The course will feature regular creative critique as well as an overview of relevant interaction design strategies for creating interactive spaces using sensors and cameras. The course assumes some working knowledge of Max/MSP.

The course focuses on software and hardware workflows for the creative applications of multi-channel sound and immersive video for the creation of fixed, generative, reactive, performance-based, and interactive systems that can be experienced in a gallery context and in live and ensemble performance contexts. Students will develop a semester-length project to use scale and immersion to creative effect, and will work on designing systems and pieces that encourage interactivity and group collaboration in performance. The course will feature regular creative critique as well as an overview of relevant interaction design strategies for creating interactive spaces using sensors and cameras. The course assumes some working knowledge of Max/MSP.
