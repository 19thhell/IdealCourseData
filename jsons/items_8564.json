We begin by considering the historical formation of Performance   Studies as a field of study. We will pay close attention to events that we actually   experience. We will extrapolate issues from them, read theory through them, and   explore methods for documenting, analyzing, interpreting,and and writing about   them. Readings will contextualize the performances we experience as well as offer   models for how they might be studied. We will pay particularly close attention   to methods, from observation and interviewing to working with historical sources.   Weekly written responses to the readings and to the performances as well as exercises   in the use of particular methods will provide the basis for class discussions   and oral presentations. All the work that you have done for the course will be   submitted in the form of a portfolio on Friday December 15.

We begin by considering the historical formation of Performance   Studies as a field of study. We will pay close attention to events that we actually   experience. We will extrapolate issues from them, read theory through them, and   explore methods for documenting, analyzing, interpreting,and and writing about   them. Readings will contextualize the performances we experience as well as offer   models for how they might be studied. We will pay particularly close attention   to methods, from observation and interviewing to working with historical sources.   Weekly written responses to the readings and to the performances as well as exercises   in the use of particular methods will provide the basis for class discussions   and oral presentations.

DUE : Friday 11/17        The class will be divided into small working groups, each group will be assigned    a decade between 1850 and 2000. The task is to find Halloween material for    your decade, using various search techniques and types of sources--archives,     library ,    electronic, microfilm, newspapers ,    collections of images    and artifacts. Be imaginative in the kinds of sources you look for, where    you go, and how you search . Each team should divide up the research    so as to cover a range of sources. Seek the assistance of the reference librarian    at whichever collections you use.                     Start with Bobst ,     New-York Historical Society , and     New York Public Library 's main research     library and specialized collections-- NYPL     for the Performing Arts at Lincoln Center and the Schomburg     Center for Research in Black Culture . NYPL has a vast picture collection,     organized by topic. To locate collections in New York City (as well as about     the city) and to find the ethnic press available at Bobst, go to the New     York City page. See Bobst and Beyond: A Guide to Graduate Research     in New York City (1994), available at Bobst.           Go online for the Library of Congress National     Digital Library [extraordinary resources, organized by period, place,     topic, format--including audio files, digital images, etc. Very good for     full text of WPA     interviews (See especially the Florida material and work of Zora Neale Hurston)     and FWP theatre materials, as well as for video and sound files for early     films and, music).           Use Lexis-Nexis ,     Pro-Quest     for newspaper databases, and Jstor     for full runs of journals. Consult the paper indices for earlier periods:     Reader's Guide to Periodicals , and the Index to the New York Times,     as well as indices to nineteenth-century newspapers.           Try to work with archival collections of unpublished materials,     especially in New     York , including the National     Archive of Lesbian and Gay History and Lesbian     Herstory Archives .           Consider using legal cases, patent records, and collections     related to business and advertising, including those related to costumes,     foods, greeting cards, jack o'lanterns, and pranks--New York Public Library's     Library of Science,     Industry, and Business .           Look at police reports at local precincts. Check out The     Municipal Archives of the City of New York for census materials, court     records, photographs, the WPA Federal Writers' Project, NYC unit, including     photographs and materials relating to the guide to NYC, and the WNYC radio     archives (1936-1943).     Check out media     collections . For great photographs from the last five years, go to the     AP (Associated Press)     Photo Archive . Please LOGOUT when you are done with the AP Photo     Archive.             Be thinking about the range of sources that you encountered    in the readings and how the authors used them.         Write a 3-4 page essay on Halloween in your decade. Reflect on    the nature of your sources and use those sources critically and imaginatively.    Try out concepts and techniques encountered in the readings. Reflect on method.

Define your &#147;position,&#148; account for it, and       identify the possibilities and constraints of your positionality.       Explains how you are approaching the question of positionality,      that is, treat the issue &#147;metamethodologically.&#148;            2. Reflect       on the challenges and possibilities of &#147;description&#148; as       Visweswaran and Katz outline them. Show how you will convert your       why questions into how questions. Why does Katz propose that research       focus on how questions? What is the path that he traces for getting       from description to explanation? In what ways might the approaches       of Visweswaran and Katz be useful for your project ?             Recommended             Abu-Lughod, L. 2000. Locating ethnography .

Finding a person to interview and      making contact with that person is part of the research process. Use      networks and, in the case of strangers, have a contact person make the      introduction.        2. Schedule      the interview, arrange permission to audio or videotape the interview,      and secure an audio recorder or video camera. Be sensitive to the possibility      that recording may discourage the person from being interviewed. As a      courtesy, consider offering to give the individual a copy of the the recording.                3. Based on the readings-- and reflecting on them --state the goals      of the interview. What do you hope to elicit in the interview and to what      end?           4. Develop a checklist for the interview. Of the approaches offered in      the readings, which will you use and why?           Recommended           Arksey, Hilary, and Peter Knight, eds. 1999.

In light of that choice (and in relation to your dissertation project), w hich options in Writing Ethnographic Fieldnotes do you anticipate might work best for you and why? Consider notetaking, writing up notes, coding (give examples related either to your research project or to the observation exercise that you will do by 11/11), and writing the final account, whether or not it is an ethnography .

Pay special attention       to the various ways that she articulates (as a stated goal and in       the actual analysis) the relationship between a microanalysis       of music, its production, performance, and experience, on the one       hand, and a macroanalysis of the industry and larger political       contexts and struggles on the other. How, precisely, does she move       between these levels of attention and analysis?              2.       Characterize her research methodologies and writing strategies and       the rationale for the choices that she makes. What do these choices       let her do? Be specific and give examples.             3.       How might you apply what she does to your project?

Reading guidelines and assignment             While visual culture encompasses more than images and images encompass more than photography, we are focusing on photography because of all the visual sources you are likely use photography is chief among them. But there are other compelling reasons as well, not least of which the ontology of photography and its evidentiary status.                 The readings for this week run the gamut from the most practical (the photograph as an historical artifact and historical source) to the most philosophical (a range of approaches to the ontology and phenomenology of photography) and address modes of attention and a range of aesthetic, social, scientific, and political practices, historical and contemporary. These authors also attend to a wide range of photographic genres, including studio portraits, family snapshots, mug shots, &ldquo;documentary&rdquo; or &ldquo;scientific&rdquo; photographs, and dance photography as an art form in its own right. Finally, there is the distinction between photographs that you find, with or without any information about them, and those that you will make&mdash;and in both cases how you will understand what they are, how to analyze them, and what to do with them. There are also the photographs that you may encourage your subjects to make and there is photo elicitation.              (1) How do these authors address the question of evidence with respect to photography?            (2) Identify specific methods and methodological issues in the readings. How might they be relevant to your work?            (3) Illustrate your response by analyzing one of Greenfield's dance images and a second image, either an image related to your project or one from your own family. Please bring the image to class. If you can insert the image into your blog, please do so. If not (and if you can email the image to me), I will insert it for you.
