The hackathon took place\u00a0on April 11 at the Rudin Center,\u00a0under the sponsorship and technical guidance of Google.   Data scientists, civic hackers, graphic designers, analysts, government policymakers, and statistics hobbyists gathered to discover\u00a0solutions to the taxi gap, which is estimated to miss out on about 11,000 rides daily.   We&#8217;ll post some of the solutions soon (the hackers are still hacking!), but in the meantime, here are some pics\u00a0of the event:      Meera Joshi, NYC TLC Commissioner, kicks off the shift-change hackathon on April 11, 2015.

The urban streetscape is facing increasing demands for space from a variety of users \u2013 pedestrians, cyclists, drivers, a spike in deliveries to homes and offices, food trucks, mobile commercial spaces, and more \u2013 without recalibrating the permitting or design. Join us for a series of presentations that ask urban planners, designers, architects, and others: What is the street of the future? We\u2019ll review new visions for pleasant, productive streetscapes that balance the needs of transportation infrastructure, commercial activity, and residents young and old.   Sarah Kaufman, Digital Manager, and Anthony Townsend, Senior Research Scientist, will\u00a0present at the event on behalf of the Rudin Center, along with esteemed professionals from throughout the transportation and tech fields.

In sum:   This report examines the MTA\u2019s current fiscal challenges and identifies options for funding its capital investment needs for the next five years. The analysis of these options includes consideration of how well measures to raise money for the MTA fit into a broader financing plan for the state\u2019s entire transportation system, including its extensive road and bridge network. Specifically this report addresses two questions: (1) how much money does the MTA require to address its capital investment needs, and (2) from where should any requisite new money come?

From the Introduction:     &#8220;The ability of a public transportation network to physically link residents to jobs has become a central point of concern for urban policy in an era of uneven unemployment and rapidly changing job markets. The economy of New York City is unique in North America due to its high uptake of public transportation. Here, 56% of the population uses transit to reach work; an individual\u2019s ability to access a job is largely a function of how well their neighborhood is served by the public transportation system. This report presents direct measurements of job access in New York City, and contrasts the levels of access that are experienced in the city\u2019s many neighborhoods&#8230;             To improve economic opportunities citywide, the NYU Rudin Center recommends that policymakers increase the number of transportation modal options across the city, maximize use of existing transportation infrastructure, and foster the ability to work remotely. These solutions will benefit all New Yorkers\u2019 access to job opportunities and economic improvement.&#8221;     Report maps by NYU Rudin Center, linepointpath and Datapolitan .
