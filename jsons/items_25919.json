If you're looking for the NYU Libraries EZProxy service, please contact the Libraries instead.        This legacy NYU-NET Proxy is being prepared for retirement; if possible, we encourage you to begin using VPN instead.                                        Important Note VPN is the best way to securely connect to NYU services from off campus. Unless you are sure that you need to use NYU-NET Proxy to connect to a certain resource, try using the NYU VPN service first.     NYU-NET Proxy helps you authenticate yourself as an NYU community member when you are connecting to certain    NYU resources from outside of NYU-NET. Using NYU-NET Proxy, your browser will employ a computer system here at    the University to help it access your remote destination (see the bottom of this page for more information about    proxy servers . When accessing NYU-NET in this way, you will be asked to type in your NYU NetID and password    (which is the same as your password for NYUHome).

More About Proxy Servers   A proxy server is a server that sits between a client application, such as a web browser, and a remote server. The proxy server  intercepts each request to the remote server to see if it can fulfill the request itself. If not, it forwards the request to the  remote server. When a proxy server receives a request for an Internet service, such as a web page, if the request passes the  filtering requirements, the proxy server first looks in its local cache of previously downloaded web pages. If it finds the page,  it returns it to the person who requested it without needing to forward the request to the Internet. If it does not find the page, the  proxy server acts on behalf of the person and uses its own IP address to request the web page from the Internet.    An advantage of using a proxy server is that it can improve overall response time, since frequently-requested Internet sites are  likely to be in the proxy's cache.
