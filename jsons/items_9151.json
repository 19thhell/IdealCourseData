Emphasis is on literature, language, and civilization.    Civilization is interpreted here as including broader cultural works affecting    the study of literature, including theater and cinema.    The collection also supports course work and research in the following    programs: Africana Studies; Comparative Literature; Dramatic Literature,    Theatre History, and the Cinema; Literature in Translation; Medieval and    Renaissance Studies; Women's Studies; and the Foreign Language Education    program at the School of Education.    The interdisciplinary approach of courses and research within the French    department (especially for, but not restricted to, medieval and renaissance    studies) and the interdisciplinary programs on contemporary French society    and culture of the Institute of French Studies, which emphasize humanistic    social studies as well as French culture, history, politics, and sociology,    are supported by the various pertinent collections in history, philosophy,    religion, the social sciences, and the sciences.    The library does not acquire or provide specific funding for materials    which are exclusively required for the graduate programs in French of    NYU in France.                 Scope                 Language         The collection consists principally of      literary texts and criticism in French. Works      of major authors are also collected in English      translation. Criticism and literary history and      theory are collected in French as well as in      English. Collecting in other Western European      languages is highly selective.                     Geographical Areas         Coverage emphasizes the literature of      France, with minor emphasis on that of Canada      and Belgium. An attempt is made to collect a      representative body of literature from the      French-speaking countries of the Maghreb,      especially Algeria, and sub-Saharan Africa. For      coverage of literature from the Caribbean,      check the Collection Development Policy      Statement for Latin-American and Caribbean      studies.                     Chronological Periods         Coverage of French literature is from the      medieval period to the present with current      emphasis on all centuries.                            Types of Materials        Included     Monographs, monographic series, serials, newspapers, proceedings, facsimiles,     reprints, microforms, audio-visual and electronic media (including electronic     texts). Exhibition catalogs and dissertations are acquired very selectively.        Excluded     Dissertations when requested only for individual research, manuscripts,     textbooks, ephemera, maps.                       Strengths &amp; Weaknesses of the Collection    The collection's strengths lie in French medieval    literature and in 19th- and 20th-century French literature; among specific    movements, French symbolism and surrealism (19th- and 20th-century respectively)    should be noted.    The collection is weak in literature in French from sub-Saharan Africa    although a representative collection is being developed. When possible,    cooperative projects are pursued, especially with Columbia University    Libraries to collect materials in areas of mutual interest. In this context,    Bobst Library is developing a strong collection in francophone belles-lettres    by Algerian authors.    Important gaps exist in those support collections that are of importance    to interdisciplinary research particularly in the medieval, 16th, 17th,    and 18th centuries: among others, medieval and renaissance science, the    renaissance humanistic endeavor, primary works in Latin, primary works    in religion.    Preservation of materials is quite problematic as many basic works are    in fragile condition and have brittle paper, while, on the other hand,    a large number of French imprints are currently available only in paperback    editions (reference works included). An effort is made to identify brittle    materials to be reviewed for filming and/or replacement.    Continuing efforts will focus on the development of a collection strong    in all areas, from the Middle Ages to the present, the acquisition of    multiple copies of works in heavy demand, the filling of gaps in major    primary and secondary sources, advocacy for the strenghtening of the support    disciplines and collections that allow for an interdisciplinary approach,    and the systematic identification and replacement of missing or worn volumes    of standard works. In the last few years, major retrospective projects    focussing on the Middle Ages, 17th and 19th centuries, gay and lesbian    authors, Maghreb and sub-Saharan authors have been accomplished. Furthermore,    missing volumes in important series, such as, e.g. La Biblioth&eacute;que    de la Pl&eacute;iade, have been replaced on a consistent basis.                 Other Resources        The Fales Library Special Collections include seven manuscript versions    of Celine's \"Entretiens avec le Professeur Y\" as well as manuscript pages    corresponding to pp. 72-129 of the 1957 Gallimard edition of Celine's works.    The Avery Fisher Center for Music and Media houses the Samuel Beckett    Audio visual Archives, the largest tape and video collection of his work    in the world. Included among the holdings are Beckett's Waiting for Godot,    Shades, and Silence to Silence. In many cases, the collection includes the    French, German, and English versions of a single work.    Instructional materials (including language tapes acquired by the language    lab) are available in the Lewis Levine Language Laboratory in the Avery    Fisher Center.
