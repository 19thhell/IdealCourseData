The talk, in conjunction with the current exhibition of the same title now on display at the Brooklyn Museum of Art, will take place December 16, 2009 at 6 p.m. Both the ISAW lecture and the Brooklyn Museum exhibition explore ancient Egyptian art from a slightly new perspective. Egyptians respected the divinity of every element of the human body and paid careful attention to its depictions. The fragments of sculpture and relief which have come down to us through the ages can reveal significant insights into the art and beliefs of ancient Egypt. The lecture will also examine details of the manufacture of wooden sculpture and composite statues, shed light upon specifics of symbolism of certain body parts, and explore the magnificence of ancient Egyptian craftsmanship.  The Body Parts: Ancient Egyptian Fragments and Amulets lecture will take place Dec. 16, at 6 p.m. in the 2nd Floor Lecture Room at ISAW, located at 15 East 84th Street (between 5th and Madison Avenues). The lecture is free and open to the public but seating is limited.
