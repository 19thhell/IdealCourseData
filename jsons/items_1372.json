Senator Gillibrand is championing an agenda of Paid Family and Medical Leave, Quality Affordable Child Care, Universal Pre-K, Increased Minimum Wage and Equal Pay to modernize the American workplace for women workers and the entire middle class with policies that treats them equally, allows them to reach their full economic potential and reflects our values. This Summit will be an important discussion about workplace policies that will place women and middle-class families at the forefront of the economic agenda.       Attendees will also have the opportunity to participate in one of two &quot;solution sessions&quot; designed for panelists to share their experiences and spark discussion about how current workplace policies and challenges have affected their professional and personal success, and what steps need to be taken to allow for full economic empowerment.

Women are breaking into traditionally male-dominated sectors and making vital contributions to the economy. Yet even with a changing workforce, workplace policies have remained the same. Panelists will share their experiences and discuss the importance of supporting women in these new roles through federal policy changes including equal pay, minimum wage, and paid Family Medical Leave, among others.

Gillibrand was first sworn in as United States Senator from New York in January 2009. In November 2012, Gillibrand was elected to her first six-year Senate term with 72 percent of the vote, winning 60 of New York\u2019s 62 counties.   Prior to her service in the Senate, Gillibrand served in the U.S. House of Representatives, representing New York's 20th Congressional District, which spanned 10 counties in upstate New York.   Throughout her time in Congress, Senator Gillibrand has been committed to open and honest government. When she was first elected, she pledged to bring unprecedented transparency and access to her post. And she did, becoming the first Member of Congress to post her official public schedule, personal financial disclosure, and federal earmark requests online. The New York Times called Gillibrand's commitment to transparency a &quot;quiet touch of revolution&quot; in Washington, and The Sunlight Foundation, the leading advocacy organization dedicated to making government more open and transparent, praised Senator Gillibrand as a pioneer for her work. For more information, visit Senator Gillibrand's Sunlight Report at http://gillibrand.senate.gov/sunlight/   And she hasn\u2019t let up since. In 2012, Senator Gillibrand became the first Senator in history to publish her personal tax returns for every year she has served in office directly on her own website, and led the effort to pass the STOCK Act, legislation to finally make insider trading by members of Congress illegal, making them play by the exact same set of rules as every other American. A Washington Post report hailed the STOCK Act as the \u201cmost substantial debate on congressional ethics in nearly five years.\u201d   In the U.S. Senate, Senator Gillibrand has made her presence felt, helping lead the fight to repeal &quot;Don't Ask Don't Tell,&quot; the policy that banned gays from serving openly in the military, and providing health care and compensation to the 9/11 first responders and community survivors that are sick with diseases caused by the toxins at Ground Zero. Senator Gillibrand worked to bring Democrats and Republicans together to win both legislative victories, leading Newsweek/The Daily Beast to name Senator Gillibrand one of \u201c150 Women Who Shake the World.\u201d   As the mother of two young children, Senator Gillibrand knows that working families are struggling in this difficult economy. By making quality child care and higher education more affordable, providing property tax relief and keeping our neighborhoods safe, Senator Gillibrand's legislative agenda puts middle class and working families first. She has written legislation to address the country's nursing shortage, make quality autism treatment more affordable, improve asthma treatment for children, and ensure that drinking water and baby products are safe for consumers. And she led the way to take drop-side cribs that were responsible for the deaths of infants off the market.   Senator Gillibrand's number one priority is to rebuild the American economy, by creating good-paying jobs, helping small businesses get loans, and partnering with the private sector to foster innovation and entrepreneurship. She wrote new legislation to strengthen and retool New York\u2019s manufacturers, and stamp more products with the words \u201cMade in America,\u201d and create new manufacturing jobs in New York.   As the first New York Senator to sit on the Agriculture Committee in nearly 40 years, Senator Gillibrand is giving New York families the seat at the table they deserve as Congress debates food policy. She worked hard to strengthen the 2012 Farm Bill for New York by strengthening specialty crops, expanding rural broadband, improving recovery efforts from natural disasters, and protect access to nutrition assistance for struggling children and families.   After serving on the Armed Services Committee in the House, Senator Gillibrand is again serving on the Senate Armed Services, using her position to strengthen America's armed services, national security and military readiness, and to continue fighting for America's troops and military families by creating better economic opportunities for veterans returning home to their families today. Among her top priorities for the 113th Congress, is ending the scourge of sexual violence in the military, and strengthening the rights and protections of victims of sexual assault.   From her seat on the Aging Committee, Senator Gillibrand is committed to fighting on behalf of seniors, working to lower the cost of prescription drugs, make long-term care more affordable so seniors can remain independent for as long as they are able, and protecting seniors from financial fraud. Senator Gillibrand is also working to lower property taxes, co-sponsoring legislation that would give New York residents a full federal tax deduction for their property taxes.   After attending Albany's Academy of Holy Names, Senator Gillibrand graduated in 1984 from Emma Willard School in Troy, New York, the first all women's high school in the United States. A magna cum laude graduate of Dartmouth College in 1988, Gillibrand went on to receive her law degree from the UCLA School of Law in 1991 and served as a law clerk on the Second Circuit Court of Appeals.   After working as an attorney in New York City for more than a decade, Senator Gillibrand served as Special Counsel to United States Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Andrew Cuomo during the Clinton Administration. She then worked as an attorney in Upstate New York before becoming a member of Congress.   Born and raised in upstate New York, Senator Gillibrand now lives in Brunswick, New York, with her husband, Jonathan Gillibrand, and their two young sons, nine-year-old Theodore and four-year-old Henry.                       Keynote               Billie Jean King                                           Former Tennis Icon, Humanitarian                               Billie Jean King, member of the President's Council on Fitness, Sports &amp; Nutrition, is a sports icon and humanitarian who won 39 Grand Slam singles, doubles, and mixed doubles tennis titles, including a record 20 championships at Wimbledon. She empowered women and educated men when she defeated Bobby Riggs in one of the greatest moments in sports history \u2013 the Battle of the Sexes in 1973, which celebrates its 40th anniversary this year. This match is remembered for its effect on society and its contribution to the women's movement. In 2008, she authored Pressure is a Privilege: Lessons I've Learned from Life and the Battle of the Sexes to commemorate the 35th anniversary of her historic 1973 match against Bobby Riggs.   She was one of nine players who broke away from the tennis establishment and accepted $1 contracts from tennis promoter Gladys Heldman in 1970 in Houston. The revolt led to the birth of women's professional tennis and the formation of the Virginia Slims Tour and Women's Tennis Association.   King founded the Women's Tennis Association (1973), which marks its 40th anniversary in 2013, the Women's Sports Foundation (1974), Women's Sports Magazine (1974), and co-founded GreenSlam, an environmental initiative for the sports industry (2007). She also co-founded World TeamTennis (1974), the groundbreaking co-ed professional tennis league, and founded the World TeamTennis Recreational League, one of the most popular recreational tennis formats in the U.S.   She was honored on August 28, 2006, when the National Tennis Center, home of the U. S. Open, was renamed the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center in honor of King's contributions to tennis, sports, and society both on and off the court. She continues to be involved with the USTA. On August 9, 2009, King was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Barack Obama, making her the first female athlete to receive this honor. LIFE Magazine also named her &quot;one of the most important Americans of the 20th century.&quot;                        Confirmed Participants               Vanessa Karen Bush                                           Editor-in-Chief of ESSENCE                               Bio to come.

Julie Rice was living in Los Angeles. A busy talent manager - she could barely stop her hectic &quot;movie biz&quot; schedule to fit in a workout, let alone enjoy it. After searching high and low for an exercise that would keep her not only physically in shape but also mentally inspired, she found indoor cycling. The music and the energy kept her coming back and yet she felt it could be even more....   Elizabeth Cutler grew up in Chicago. While studying abroad from the University of Colorado she did some SOUL searching and wound up in a monastery in India, at the National Palace Museum, and in a traditional japanese house in Kyoto. Eventually she returned to Colorado where inspiring cardio was just one mountain around the corner. Hiking was a natural and breathtaking way to stay fit and happy. She sold luxury real estate and practiced Jin Shin Jyutsu (ancient practice and philosophy of healing aka grandparent of acupuncture). After meeting her husband she moved to Manhattan.   Shortly after both women had relocated to New York City, they began searching for some type of cardio exercise they could fall in love with. But unfortunately, no luck. There were certainly enough ways to burn calories, but nothing that made their hearts sing. Ultimately they realized they would have to create it! Elizabeth and Julie met at a lunch and the rest was SOULhistory! They both believed indoor cycling could be inspiring; they both believed you could incorporate upper body and core workout into the routine; and finally they believed with some great branding, a beautiful environment, and outstanding customer service, the 45-minute class could be transformed into a special experience each time.   Elizabeth combed Craigslist and found the &quot;rear lobby&quot; at West 72nd Street. Julie learned all she could about renting towels and passing out schedule cards up and down the avenues of the West Side of NYC. Slowly, the riders began to come.   Today both are amazed at the community that has become SoulCycle. The inspiring instructors, dedicated riders, and tireless studio soul team. It is truly a labor of SOUL. Both continued to be inspired BY and AT SoulCycle.

Lisa Price                                           Founder, Carol's Daughter                               From humble beginnings in her Brooklyn kitchen, Founder of Carol\u2019s Daughter, Inc., Lisa Price transformed her beloved hobby of mixing up fragrances and creams at home into a multi-million dollar beauty empire.   In the early 1990\u2019s, Price began experimenting with making her own fragrances and perfume sprays when she wasn\u2019t busy working on the legendary sitcom The Cosby Show. She added oils to unscented lotions, and began learning the aromatherapeutic and healing properties of the oils.   When the show finished its remarkable TV run in 1992, Price used the end of one chapter of her life to embark on another. With $100 in cash, her own kitchen, and the simple notion that people should follow their hearts, Lisa started building the collection that would become a beauty revolution. She began by selling her homespun beauty products at flea markets, but then had to set up shop in her living room as demand increased. Favorable word-of-mouth spread like wildfire as her customers enjoyed such unique products as Love Butter, Hair Milk, Black Vanilla Hair Smoothie and Lemon Mint Manicure. Her business continued to grow, aided by the encouragement and assistance of family members and friends.   In August of 1994, Price officially established Carol's Daughter (the company lovingly named after her mother). Initially starting out with a handful of steady customers, those numbers grew in leaps and bounds as women outside her neighborhood and circle of friends began to take notice. Almost overnight, celebrities like Jada Pinkett-Smith, Erykah Badu, Rosie Perez and Halle Berry became loyal customers.   Price is the recipient of numerous awards, among them the National Black MBA Association's Entrepreneur of the Year Award (2000), the Working Woman Magazine\u2019s Entrepreneurial Excellence Award (2001), the National Book Club Conference Terrie Williams Inspiration Award (2004), the YWCA \u201cW\u201d Award (2010), the FFAWN I\u2019m Power \u2013 I\u2019m Beauty Award (2010) and a Cosmetic Executive Women Achiever Award (2010).   She is also the author of Success Never Smelled So Sweet, a remarkable memoir that chronicles her transformation from a young Black woman deep in debt and burdened by low self-esteem to the president of a multi-million dollar business. Looking back on her years growing up in Brooklyn, Price vividly recalls her recurring connection with nature: a profound love and appreciation of the natural fragrances of the world. Price continues to encourage the entrepreneurial spirit of other women through her book, speaking engagements and business seminars.   Price is an active philanthropist and currently sits on the board of the Foundation for the Advancement of Women Now (FFAWN), a charity that is dedicated to empowering women and instilling confidence so that they may achieve their dreams through education, empowerment and encouragement. The foundation was founded by Steve Stoute and Mary J. Blige.   Today, Carol's Daughter sells millions of dollars worth of products, employs more than 80 staff members and boasts nine stores across the country, with a flagship store in Harlem. Price hopes to continue expanding Carol's Daughter to other cities.   Price is dedicated to giving back to the community through both her business and her personal life. She has taken a hands-on approach to involvement in community fundraising walks and gala events for the Lupus Foundation of America. Additionally, Price generously and frequently offers product donations to community organizations both large and small in an effort to help Carol\u2019s Daughter's extended friends and family with their own outreach and fundraising efforts.   Most recently, Price has been appointed as a member of the National Women\u2019s Business Council, an independent source of advice and policy recommendations to the President, Congress, and the U.S. Small Business Administration on economic issues that face female business owners.   Price and her husband, Gordon, have two sons and a daughter and live in Brooklyn. When she can find the time (between managing her business and family), Price enjoys going to the beach, reading, crocheting, and watching movies.
