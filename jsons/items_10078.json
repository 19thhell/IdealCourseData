Politics and Literature Apter  Micropolitics: Scenes from the Everyday Life of Power (Literature and Theory) This course will take a close look at forms of political fiction and theories of literature and politics, drawing on theorists of micropolitics (Foucault, Deleuze) and \"the politics of the aesthetic\" (Lukacs, Jameson, Ranci\u00e8re, Esposito). We will read literary works by Disraeli, Stendhal, Trollope, Zola, Mallarm\u00e9 and Proust that explore the microphenomenology of political life; the diffusion and dilution of \"the Political\" in the social; the elusiveness and formlessness of the political event; the role of contingency in A central question will be: How is politics as a scene of maneuvers and application of cunning (is Machiavellianism) mapped on (or not) to formal, abstract models of political aesthetics (capitalist epic, democracy in language, the \"revolutionary\" dimension of avant-gardism, comic forms of class struggle, tragic forms of communitas)? The final section of the course will examine politics as a popular, contemporary genre, especially in film and epic television serials. Examples studied will be Roberto Saviano's hit TV series Come Away With Me (read with Paolo Flores d'Arcais,'s \"Anatomy of Berlusconismo), Armando Iannucci's film In the Loop, and the recent TV series House of Cards. Requirements: One 12-15 page paper and an oral presentation. Students who want to work on a comparative project that brings in film or visual media may do so with instructor's approval.    Introduction to Comp Lit: Necessary Fiction  Basterra We like to think of ourselves as acting freely, creating our own ideas and objects. In other words, we like to think of ourselves as subjects. The self-conscious and autonomous subject constitutes itself in relation to what is \u2018other.\u2019 But what is this \u2018other\u2019? The word \u2018other\u2019 does not always refer to another person: It may also refer to constitutive events, or \u2018necessary fictions.\u2019 These \u2018others\u2019 may be the addressees of our poems, the material and immaterial products of our imaginations, and indeed the otherness we find in ourselves. How do we relate to these \u2018others\u2019? How do desire, action, and ethical duty (but also fate, guilt, and the law), allow us to perceive ourselves as free? We will explore these and other questions as they have been posed in literary works by Aeschylus, Sophocles, Plato, Ovid, Garcilaso de la Vega, Racine, Keats, Poe, Gautier, Baudelaire, Melville, Lorca, Salinas, Kafka, Beckett, paintings by Da Vinci and Vel\u00e1zquez, and philosophical and theoretical writings by Kant, Hegel, Freud, Saussure, Heidegger, Lacan, and Levinas. Though the tragic fate of Agamemnon or Oedipus appears inevitable, in our reading we explore how fate is a necessary fiction that enables action. Today we have transferred the power of fate onto other essentialized constructs such as the free market, advertising, or intelligence organizations which come to structure our desires and dictate the course of our lives. We will trace how inspiration may be found in negation by reading literary texts on the unknown contents of letters \u2013 as in Poe \u2013or on endless waiting for what will never come\u2014as in Melville and Beckett. Situated at intersection of the different discourses that comprise Comparative Literature \u2013 fiction, poetry, art, philosophy, psychoanalysis, and political theory \u2013 this class aims to problematize the notion of modern subjectivity. Our primary concerns will be at once ethical and poetic: How can what exceeds knowledge and representation signal itself in thought?    Junior Theory Seminar: Philosophy of the Body Bianchi What is a body, and how has the body figured in the history of Western thought? How is the body constituted in relation to its others: mind/spirit/soul? How does the body appear as an object both natural and technological? How do bodies come to bear social and political significance: in relation to sex, gender, class, race, sexuality, and bodily ability among others? How are bodies fashioned and produced by personal and cultural practices? In this class we will address the devaluation of the body and somatophobia in the history of Western philosophy, and track the resurgence of the body in 20th and 21st century thought, including existentialism, phenomenology, feminist theory, race theory, queer theory, disability theory and \u201cnew materialisms.\u201d Lastly, we will examine critical analyses of bodily regimes and practices, which may include (according to class interest) dieting, body modification, bodily violence, medical technologies.  Topics in 20th Century Literature: Comparative Theory and the Intellectual Dopico   Studies in Prose Genres: Autobiography Garcia What is the relationship of autobiographical acts to history? How does the decline of history as an \u201cautonomous and self-authenticating mode of thought,\u201d to borrow from Hayden White, alter how we read autobiographies? Turning to literary analysis, how does autobiography figure in the tasks of autocritique associated with comparative thinking? What happens when we think of autobiographies less as \u201clife stories\u201d and more as \u201cactors,\u201d as Bruno Latour puts it, with which we interact as \u201cco-actors\u201d and by way of complex affects and associations? This course will turn periodically to theorizations of history, selfhood and objecthood. But most of our attention will be devoted to the autobiographical act itself as we explore works by Christopher Isherwood, James Weldon Johnson, Lillian Smith, Anatole Broyard and Jay-Z, among other writers.  Topics: Biopolitics & Violence in Contemporary Spain Matos-Martin With the current changes to the world order in general, the economic and sociopolitical situation in Spain in particular, biopolitics\u2014implementing power through the bodies of and generating desired positions for the citizens\u2014offers a critical lens to understand how power operates by convincing, manipulating and criminalizing the masses. Whereas modern biopolitics refers to the State\u2019s ability to insert docile and disciplined bodies into its mechanisms of exercising power (Foucault), it also implies various degrees of violence, exclusion and abjection. Within this framework, this course will explore different forms of biopolitics with an emphasis on violence and exclusion practices and as articulated in fiction and film in contemporary Spain. Some of the topics we will attend to include the Spanish Civil War, the Franco regime, nationalism, terrorism, delinquency and crime, and immigration. Primary writers, directors and artists whose works we might examine include: Alberto M\u00e9ndez, Isaac Rosa, Fernando Le\u00f3n de Aranoa, Guillermo del Toro, Dulce Chac\u00f3n, Eloy de la Iglesia, Dulce Chac\u00f3n, Bernardo Atxaga, Bel\u00e9n Gopegui, Iciar Bolla\u00edn, Ricardo Men\u00e9ndez Salm\u00f3n, Chus Guti\u00e9rrez, Manuel Huerga or Agust\u00edn Villaronga. We will examine these literary works together with theoretical readings about biopolitics, violence, war and exclusion, and raise questions about the dynamics in Spain today.  MAP : Texts and Ideas: Paranoid Narratives Sanders It\u2019s no secret that we live in an age of paranoia. What began life in the nineteenth century as a psychiatric diagnosis may now be the predominant form taken by our experience of politics and technology. We explore the evolution of ideas about paranoia through a careful reading of key texts, with special focus on narrative: Could there be something about the structure of narrative\u2014its \u201cvoices\u201d and its \u201cspeakers,\u201d its drive for explanation of origins\u2014that is paranoid, or gives rise to paranoia? Tracing psychoanalytic theories of paranoia (Sigmund Freud, Melanie Klein), and attending no less to their narrative structure, we address this question and others by reading key autobiographical and fictional works from Europe and Africa, such as Schreber\u2019s Memoirs of My Nervous Illness, Orwell\u2019s Nineteen Eighty-Four, Head\u2019s A Question of Power, Marks\u2019 Not Either an Experimental Doll, Coetzee\u2019s Disgrace, as well as political writings and documents by Richard Hofstadter, Michel Foucault, Julian Assange (Wikileaks), South African AIDS denialists, and Rwandan g\u00e9nocidaires.  Topics in 20th Century Literature: Documents, Documentary, Fiction Vatulescu This course will explore representative works from key moments in the evolution of documentary\u2014the beginnings of the newsreel, literatura fakta, Soviet and Nazi propaganda, American depression documentary books, the cin\u00e9ma-v\u00e9rit\u00e9 movement, and the rise of autobiographical/personal documentary films. What accounts for the waxing and waning of the documentary through time, as evident in its recent popularity in American culture? What is the relationship between documentary modes and particular media and technologies\u2014print, photography, cinema, video, and digital? Other topics include the role of the artist, indexicality and representation, literature as historical document, \u201cfiction in the archives,\u201d false documents and forgery, collage, illustration, and other uses of the document in twentieth century art. Critical and theoretical readings by Eric Barnouw, Roland Barthes, Stella Bruzzi, Jane Gaines, Jacques Derrida, Giorgio Agamben, Barbara Johnson, Bill Nichols, Philip Rosen, Vivian Sobchack, Susan Sontag, Jacques Ranci\u00e8re, Edward Said, Alan Sekula, and others.

Politics and Literature Apter  Micropolitics: Scenes from the Everyday Life of Power (Literature and Theory) This course will take a close look at forms of political fiction and theories of literature and politics, drawing on theorists of micropolitics (Foucault, Deleuze) and \"the politics of the aesthetic\" (Lukacs, Jameson, Ranci\u00e8re, Esposito). We will read literary works by Disraeli, Stendhal, Trollope, Zola, Mallarm\u00e9 and Proust that explore the microphenomenology of political life; the diffusion and dilution of \"the Political\" in the social; the elusiveness and formlessness of the political event; the role of contingency in A central question will be: How is politics as a scene of maneuvers and application of cunning (is Machiavellianism) mapped on (or not) to formal, abstract models of political aesthetics (capitalist epic, democracy in language, the \"revolutionary\" dimension of avant-gardism, comic forms of class struggle, tragic forms of communitas)? The final section of the course will examine politics as a popular, contemporary genre, especially in film and epic television serials. Examples studied will be Roberto Saviano's hit TV series Come Away With Me (read with Paolo Flores d'Arcais,'s \"Anatomy of Berlusconismo), Armando Iannucci's film In the Loop, and the recent TV series House of Cards. Requirements: One 12-15 page paper and an oral presentation. Students who want to work on a comparative project that brings in film or visual media may do so with instructor's approval.    Introduction to Comp Lit: Necessary Fiction  Basterra We like to think of ourselves as acting freely, creating our own ideas and objects. In other words, we like to think of ourselves as subjects. The self-conscious and autonomous subject constitutes itself in relation to what is \u2018other.\u2019 But what is this \u2018other\u2019? The word \u2018other\u2019 does not always refer to another person: It may also refer to constitutive events, or \u2018necessary fictions.\u2019 These \u2018others\u2019 may be the addressees of our poems, the material and immaterial products of our imaginations, and indeed the otherness we find in ourselves. How do we relate to these \u2018others\u2019? How do desire, action, and ethical duty (but also fate, guilt, and the law), allow us to perceive ourselves as free? We will explore these and other questions as they have been posed in literary works by Aeschylus, Sophocles, Plato, Ovid, Garcilaso de la Vega, Racine, Keats, Poe, Gautier, Baudelaire, Melville, Lorca, Salinas, Kafka, Beckett, paintings by Da Vinci and Vel\u00e1zquez, and philosophical and theoretical writings by Kant, Hegel, Freud, Saussure, Heidegger, Lacan, and Levinas. Though the tragic fate of Agamemnon or Oedipus appears inevitable, in our reading we explore how fate is a necessary fiction that enables action. Today we have transferred the power of fate onto other essentialized constructs such as the free market, advertising, or intelligence organizations which come to structure our desires and dictate the course of our lives. We will trace how inspiration may be found in negation by reading literary texts on the unknown contents of letters \u2013 as in Poe \u2013or on endless waiting for what will never come\u2014as in Melville and Beckett. Situated at intersection of the different discourses that comprise Comparative Literature \u2013 fiction, poetry, art, philosophy, psychoanalysis, and political theory \u2013 this class aims to problematize the notion of modern subjectivity. Our primary concerns will be at once ethical and poetic: How can what exceeds knowledge and representation signal itself in thought?    Junior Theory Seminar: Philosophy of the Body Bianchi What is a body, and how has the body figured in the history of Western thought? How is the body constituted in relation to its others: mind/spirit/soul? How does the body appear as an object both natural and technological? How do bodies come to bear social and political significance: in relation to sex, gender, class, race, sexuality, and bodily ability among others? How are bodies fashioned and produced by personal and cultural practices? In this class we will address the devaluation of the body and somatophobia in the history of Western philosophy, and track the resurgence of the body in 20th and 21st century thought, including existentialism, phenomenology, feminist theory, race theory, queer theory, disability theory and \u201cnew materialisms.\u201d Lastly, we will examine critical analyses of bodily regimes and practices, which may include (according to class interest) dieting, body modification, bodily violence, medical technologies.  Topics in 20th Century Literature: Comparative Theory and the Intellectual Dopico   Studies in Prose Genres: Autobiography Garcia What is the relationship of autobiographical acts to history? How does the decline of history as an \u201cautonomous and self-authenticating mode of thought,\u201d to borrow from Hayden White, alter how we read autobiographies? Turning to literary analysis, how does autobiography figure in the tasks of autocritique associated with comparative thinking? What happens when we think of autobiographies less as \u201clife stories\u201d and more as \u201cactors,\u201d as Bruno Latour puts it, with which we interact as \u201cco-actors\u201d and by way of complex affects and associations? This course will turn periodically to theorizations of history, selfhood and objecthood. But most of our attention will be devoted to the autobiographical act itself as we explore works by Christopher Isherwood, James Weldon Johnson, Lillian Smith, Anatole Broyard and Jay-Z, among other writers.  Topics: Biopolitics & Violence in Contemporary Spain Matos-Martin With the current changes to the world order in general, the economic and sociopolitical situation in Spain in particular, biopolitics\u2014implementing power through the bodies of and generating desired positions for the citizens\u2014offers a critical lens to understand how power operates by convincing, manipulating and criminalizing the masses. Whereas modern biopolitics refers to the State\u2019s ability to insert docile and disciplined bodies into its mechanisms of exercising power (Foucault), it also implies various degrees of violence, exclusion and abjection. Within this framework, this course will explore different forms of biopolitics with an emphasis on violence and exclusion practices and as articulated in fiction and film in contemporary Spain. Some of the topics we will attend to include the Spanish Civil War, the Franco regime, nationalism, terrorism, delinquency and crime, and immigration. Primary writers, directors and artists whose works we might examine include: Alberto M\u00e9ndez, Isaac Rosa, Fernando Le\u00f3n de Aranoa, Guillermo del Toro, Dulce Chac\u00f3n, Eloy de la Iglesia, Dulce Chac\u00f3n, Bernardo Atxaga, Bel\u00e9n Gopegui, Iciar Bolla\u00edn, Ricardo Men\u00e9ndez Salm\u00f3n, Chus Guti\u00e9rrez, Manuel Huerga or Agust\u00edn Villaronga. We will examine these literary works together with theoretical readings about biopolitics, violence, war and exclusion, and raise questions about the dynamics in Spain today.  MAP : Texts and Ideas: Paranoid Narratives Sanders It\u2019s no secret that we live in an age of paranoia. What began life in the nineteenth century as a psychiatric diagnosis may now be the predominant form taken by our experience of politics and technology. We explore the evolution of ideas about paranoia through a careful reading of key texts, with special focus on narrative: Could there be something about the structure of narrative\u2014its \u201cvoices\u201d and its \u201cspeakers,\u201d its drive for explanation of origins\u2014that is paranoid, or gives rise to paranoia? Tracing psychoanalytic theories of paranoia (Sigmund Freud, Melanie Klein), and attending no less to their narrative structure, we address this question and others by reading key autobiographical and fictional works from Europe and Africa, such as Schreber\u2019s Memoirs of My Nervous Illness, Orwell\u2019s Nineteen Eighty-Four, Head\u2019s A Question of Power, Marks\u2019 Not Either an Experimental Doll, Coetzee\u2019s Disgrace, as well as political writings and documents by Richard Hofstadter, Michel Foucault, Julian Assange (Wikileaks), South African AIDS denialists, and Rwandan g\u00e9nocidaires.  Topics in 20th Century Literature: Documents, Documentary, Fiction Vatulescu This course will explore representative works from key moments in the evolution of documentary\u2014the beginnings of the newsreel, literatura fakta, Soviet and Nazi propaganda, American depression documentary books, the cin\u00e9ma-v\u00e9rit\u00e9 movement, and the rise of autobiographical/personal documentary films. What accounts for the waxing and waning of the documentary through time, as evident in its recent popularity in American culture? What is the relationship between documentary modes and particular media and technologies\u2014print, photography, cinema, video, and digital? Other topics include the role of the artist, indexicality and representation, literature as historical document, \u201cfiction in the archives,\u201d false documents and forgery, collage, illustration, and other uses of the document in twentieth century art. Critical and theoretical readings by Eric Barnouw, Roland Barthes, Stella Bruzzi, Jane Gaines, Jacques Derrida, Giorgio Agamben, Barbara Johnson, Bill Nichols, Philip Rosen, Vivian Sobchack, Susan Sontag, Jacques Ranci\u00e8re, Edward Said, Alan Sekula, and others.

Through close readings of primary texts we will observe how certain themes (e.g. justice, love, desire) are expressed across different genres, and how (and how successfully) philosophy and the emerging arts of poetics and rhetoric distinguish themselves and develop throughout the classical antiquity. Authors include Homer, the Presocratic philosophers, Plato,Aristotle, Sappho, Euripides, Aristophanes, Lucretius, Cicero, Horace, Longinus, Quintilian, and various modern and contemporary commentators. Our study will be divided into five thematic units: 1. First Beginnings; 2. Philosophy and Poetry; 3. Love and Desire in Ancient Greek Philosophy and Literature; 4. Classical Rhetoric. The course will be primarily discussion based. We will work on carefully understanding, analyzing, and criticizing texts, considering the significance of genre in classical thinking, appreciating classical texts in their cultural context, and developing written and spoken skills. Each week students will be required to read approximately 60-120 pages of text (toward the upper end for literary texts, and the lower end for philosophical/theoretical texts).        African Literature: Arts, Literature &amp; Film    Diawara Thurs 2:00-4:45pm COLIT-UA 844   A look at contemporary African Literature, film and art as a way of examining different outcomes of postcolonial cultural policies and practices in Africa. The main topics include 1) a discussion of the Negritude Movement and the artistic legacy of Leopold Sedar Senghor; 2) a close look at the Guinean Cultural Revolution and the African experimentations with Marxist and socialist realist art forms; 3) Pan-Africanism and art; and 4) the post-nationalist writers and video artists of Nigeria. The aim of the class is to provide students with a sense of the context of artistic productions in Africa. It is hoped that students will gain an understanding of some of the major trends in African literature and film; and become conversant with the politics, aesthetics and reception theories behind African imaginative works.      Topics in Film and Literature: South by South: Ideological Maps And Fictions of Uneven Development Dopico Tues 2-4:45pm COLIT-UA 300.001 SPAN-UA 551.002 This course considers the \u201cidea of  the South\u201d as geopolitical territory, imaginary landscape and ideological  map:a fictive and creative topos where  regional mythology, racial divisions, national contests, and cultural  imperialism together produce extraordinary narratives and alternative histories.  Reading comparatively, south by south,  we discover a dynamic cultural genealogy from the global South\u2019s western  hemisphere that precedes the urgency of current debates about uneven  development and the problems of North and South. We will encounter artists who manipulate and  contest the political imaginary and the fictive qualities  assigned to the South and its subjects.Engaging works that exalt or decry that ideological geography, we will  examine how these artists remake \u201cthe South,\u201d and how they engage the North and  its fictions.    Lectures and section discussions will  consider works that reflect on different Souths and consider how they portray  seductive, dangerous, infantile, charming, backward, or even criminal cultures.  In texts, visual art, and films from Europe and the Americas, we will consider  how realities and fantasies of the South are represented, how a global South  becomes a true fiction, and how writers from \u201cSouthern\u201d places respond to the  realities of uneven development and to their own barbarous, childlike, or  exotic status on political maps and cultural markets. We will question why writers explore lost  worlds, or belatedly return to a region\u2019s buried history to fictively rework  and revive the past. We will consider  why outsiders, children, and outlaws are central tropes. We will think about  the exceptional \u201crepresentational burden\u201d of Southern artists and consider how  they negotiate their double bind -- how they engage the biases and appetites of  the North and at the same time respond to the weight of history, self-hatred  and loyalty in the South. In our reading  we will trace the tension of the North-South axis in narratives that \u201cexplain\u201d  the South and those who live or pass through it. We will consider stories that manipulate the  status of the native artist (or native informant), the promise and mirage of  the cultural tourist, the uneasy spectatorship of the imperial traveler, the ressentiment   of the exile, and the collecting and  correcting anthropology of the political and economic immigrant. Thinking about the relationship between geopolitics  and regional mythology, we will consider the enduring forms of this imaginary  and ideological mapping, how it has been vital to nationalism, empire and  neo-colonialism, but also how it continues to function in the political  conflicts and cultural markets of \u201cglobalization.   Primary texts will include many  of the following Giuseppe di Lampedusa, The Leopard, Leonardo Sciascia, The  Wine Dark Sea, Thomas Mann, \u201cDeath in Venice,\u201d \u201cMario and the Magician,\u201d   Albert Camus, The Stranger, Andr\u00e9 Gide, \u201c The Immoralist,\u201d W.E.B DuBois, The Souls of Black Folk, William  Faulkner, Absalom, Absalom!, Zora Neale Hurston, Their Eyes Were  Watching God, Richard Wright, Black  Boy , selections from Uncle Tom\u2019s Children, Flannery O\u2019Connor, Wise  Blood , The Violent Bear It Away, Dorothy Allison, Bastard out of  Carolina, Alejo Carpentier, The Lost Steps, Juan Rulfo, Pedro  P\u00e1ramo, Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez, One Hundred Years of Solitud, Junot D\u00edaz, The Brief Wondrous Life of  Oscar Wao. Films will  include a selection from: The Leopard, Salvatore  Giuliano, Rocco and His Brothers, Divorce Italian Style, La terra trema, Death  in Venice, L\u2019America, Birth of a Nation,  The Emperor Jones, Baby Doll, Suddenly Last Summer, Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, Cabin  in the Sky, Raisin in the Sun, Daughters of the Dust, Gone With the Wind,  Jezebel, The Little Foxes, To Kill a Mockingbird, Cape Fear, Cool Hand Luke, Deliverance,  The Heart is a Lonely Hunter, Slingblade, La ultima cena, Memorias del subdesarrollo, Lugar sin l\u00edmites       Topics in 20th Century Literature: Richard Wright's Books   Garcia    Mon 12:30-3:15pm   COLIT-UA 190.002   SCA-UA 715 In a scene from his classic book Black Boy, Richard Wright describes the clandestine means by which he obtained library books otherwise unavailable to him in the segregated, color-coded social world of the early twentieth-century U.S. South. By the early 1940s, when he became the most famous black writer in the world and acquired a global reading public, Wright had amassed a wide range of books across many genres and literary traditions. This course explores Wright's career through an examination of works that figured in his intellectual formation and works by authors Wright in turn influenced. The course begins with key writings by Wright and the critical reception of his work in the U.S. and Europe during his lifetime and proceeds through a chronological examination of pivotal texts he encountered. Works by Marx, Proust, Horatio Alger, Gertrude Stein, H. L. Mencken, Theodore Dreiser, Jean-Paul Sartre, Ralph Ellison, George Lamming, Lillian Smith, James Baldwin, William James, and Kenneth Burke, among others, will form the course reading list.      Jr. Theory Seminar: Modernity    Iampolski    Tues 4:55-7:35pm   COLIT-UA 200   Modernity is a product of  Enlightenment that dramatically changed the face of the Western culture by  proclaiming the autonomy and supremacy of human Reason. This new attitude  allowed an unprecedented development of science and became a basis for many fundamental achievements of the Western  civilization. However the same attitude has created a lot of contradictions  that define modernity. The course is designed to analyze the antinomies of the  culture of modernity. We will start with a founding  document of European rationalism - philosophical statements by Descartes and  will see how the cult of Reason and the great western political principles (equality of rights, the rule of  law) related to the dominance of Reason are paradoxically responsible for new  kinds of violence and social exclusion.   The following subjects (among  others) will be discussed:   -- Modern Rationality and Modern  Science.   -- Changing notion of Experience.   -- New understanding of Space, Distance, Time.   -- Culture of appearances.   -- Nation, State.   -- Democracy and Totalitarianism.   -- Violence, War and Discipline.   -- Machines.   -- Market, Money and the Struggle for Survival.   -- Commodity and Desire.    Readings include: Marx,  Freud, Descartes, Arendt, Foucault, Benjamin, Elias, Deleuze, Balibar, Lefort  and many others.      Topics in 20th Century Literature: Paranoid Narratives Sanders Wed 12:30-3:15pm COLIT-UA 190   It\u2019s no secret that we live in an age of paranoia. What  began as a psychiatric diagnosis may now be the predominant form taken by our  experience of politics and of technology. But could there be something about  the very structure of narrative itself\u2014its \u201cvoices\u201d and its \u201cspeakers\u201d\u2014that is  paranoid, or gives rise to paranoia? Tracing psychoanalytic theories of  paranoia (Sigmund Freud, Melanie Klein), and attending no less to their   narrative structure, we address this question and others by reading key  autobiographical and fictional works, such as may include Daniel Paul  Schreber\u2019s Memoirs of My Nervous Illness , George Orwell\u2019s Nineteen  Eighty-Four , James Ellroy\u2019s American  Tabloid , as well as political writings and documents by Richard Hofstadter,  Michel Foucault, Julian Assange (Wikileaks), South African AIDS denialists, and  Rwandan g\u00e9nocidaires .      Studies in Prose Genres: Autobiography Sieburth Mon/Wed 11:00-12:15pm COLIT-UA 125   The word Autobiography can be etymologically decomposed  into: autos (\u201cself\u201d) + bios (\u201clife\u201d) + graph\u00ea (\u201cwriting\u201d), and over the course of the semester we will be looking at the interaction of these three elements as the genre of autobiography evolves over time. Until the 20 th century, autobiography has been, for the most, a predominantly Western practice\u2014for very specific religious and cultural reasons, which we shall explore and which have to do with the particular constructions of the \u201cself\u201d associated with the Judeo-Christian tradition. Examples of autobiographical writing, however, can also be found in classical Chinese and Japanese cultures, and we shall accordingly examine a few samples of these at the outset of the course by reading a few short Confucian autobiographies, selections from The Pillow Book of Sei Shonagan , and Shen Fu\u2019s Six Records of a Floating Life . We will then turn our attention to the Confessions of St. Augustine, a conversion narrative which in many ways provides the master-text of Western autobiography. This will be followed by another Christian \u201cLife,\u201d the earliest known text of its sort in vernacular English, the 15 th -century Book of Margery Kempe . Selections from Montaigne\u2019s Essays will then be placed against this religious tradition of autobiography: emphasis will be laid not only on the more secularized or \u201chumanist\u201d notions of the self emerging during the Renaissance, but on the essay-form itself as providing a non-narrative model for self-portraiture. From Montaigne, we will turn to Puritan and early Republican America, represented by the \u201ccaptivity narrative\u201d of Mary Rowlandson and by Ben Franklin\u2019s slippery account of his self-fashioning into celebrity. This will lead into a reading of the first six books of Rousseau\u2019s Confessions , which rewrite Augustine while setting the agenda for the next two centuries of modern autobiography. Equally influential, at least insofar as the African American literary tradition is concerned, is the Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass , which blends elements of the sentimental novel and the European picaresque into a call for political self-liberation through writing. The final unit of the course will focus on the impact of psychiatry and psychoanalysis on modern autobiography: the texts include Aur\u00e9lia , G\u00e9rard de Nerval\u2019s account of his descent into \u201cmadness,\u201d Michel Leiris\u2019s post-surrealist Manhood , and the poet H.D.\u2019s account of her analysis in Vienna with the master himself, Tribute to Freud.
