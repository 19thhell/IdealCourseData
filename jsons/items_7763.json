The program is a two-year mandatory experience with an encouraged additional year of training. Fellows participate in comprehensive clinical rotations, formal didactics, and mentored research at different stages of their training. During the first year, fellows provide supervised clinical consultation at three distinct sites that serve a broad diversity of patients: NYU Langone Medical Center, Bellevue Hospital Center, and the New York campus of the Veterans Affairs New York Harbor Healthcare System. Fellows maintain a continuity clinic throughout the fellowship focused on the outpatient management of HIV. During the second year, fellows choose from a variety of clinical, translational or basic science research opportunities to engage in mentored research. Fellows have the option of pursuing mentor-based or other intra or extramural support to extend research training.   \u00a0   Fellowship objectives   Nurture an academic environment in which fellows can develop clinical and investigative skills in infectious diseases that will promote excellence as an ID specialist.   Provide training, experiences, and professional development that will serve as the basis for successful careers in academic medicine, clinical practice, and infectious disease related public health fields.   Provide the opportunity to observe and manage adult patients with a wide variety of infectious diseases on an inpatient and outpatient basis to ensure clinical expertise in the prevention, diagnosis and management of infectious disease.   Maintain an environment that promotes learning on quality improvement, patient safety, collaboration with other health care professionals and improve systems directed toward providing patient centered care.   Provide the opportunity for fellows to conduct rigorous, mentored research in the clinical, translational or basic science of infectious diseases that can lead to careers as independent, extramurally funded investigators.   \u00a0   Fellowship tracks   The program accepts four fellows per year in three pathways, or tracks: clinician track, clinical investigator track, and basic investigator track. All tracks confer board eligibility for Infectious Diseases and follow formats set forth by the Infectious Disease Society of America.\u00a0   \u00a0   Clinician Track   The Clinician Track is designed for trainees whose primary interests are in becoming leaders in clinical care and management of patients with infectious diseases; it is also ideal for those interested in intensive clinical training leading to careers in public health policy or infectious disease prevention.   The Clinician Track consists of two years of training. After the first year of fellowship, Clinician Track fellows concentrate on additional clinical training and experience, to extend and deepen their clinical acumen. During the first year, each Clinician Track Fellow selects an area of concentration for the second year. Examples of concentrations include hospital epidemiology, antimicrobial stewardship, HIV, viral hepatitis, transplant infectious diseases, or quality management. The second year includes an additional weekly outpatient clinic in general infectious diseases, viral hepatitis, or HIV primary care; additional inpatient consultation experience with enhanced responsibility, the NYC Department of Health STD rotation, and elective rotations. Electives include the pulmonary tuberculosis clinic, Hansen's Disease clinic, pediatric infectious disease, and transplant infectious diseases. Clinician Track fellows also gain experience in teaching in the medical school and residency house staff programs.   \u00a0   Investigator Tracks   The Investigator Tracks are designed for trainees with a substantial background in basic or clinical research and whose career interests are in leading extramurally-funded research programs in infectious diseases. Applicants to these tracks are advised to identify potential mentors among the NYU infectious diseases core or affiliated faculty at the time of application. Prospective applicants are welcome to contact the Program Director for advice in identifying potential mentors that align with their interests, prior to submitting a formal application to the fellowship training program.   \u00a0   Basic Investigator Track   The Basic Investigator Track provides training in laboratory and/or translational research leading to a career as an independent investigator. Since a career as an investigator depends on support from peer-reviewed extramural sources, training in this track includes substantial guidance and support in obtaining extramural funding as well as in performing innovative research. During the first year, each Basic Investigator Track Fellow will select a research mentor, and working with that mentor, will plan their initial research project. After completing the clinical experience required for subspecialty board eligibility, training in this track concentrates on mentored research, with reduced clinical responsibilities to allow time for intensive research training. Fellows in the Basic Investigator Track are encouraged to engage in advanced graduate-level course work appropriate to their research interests, such as advanced courses in microbial pathogenesis and immunology, and/or human or population genetics. In addition to a primary mentor, fellows in the Basic Investigator Track have a faculty mentoring committee that meets with the individual fellow regularly during their research training to assist them with scientific and career development.\u00a0   \u00a0   Clinical Investigator Track   The Clinical Investigator Track provides training in epidemiology, outcomes research, field studies, clinical trials, or other patient-based research leading to a career as an independent investigator. Since a career as an investigator depends on support from peer-reviewed extramural sources, training in this track includes substantial guidance and support in obtaining extramural funding as well as in performing innovative research. During the first year, each Clinical Investigator Track Fellow will select a research mentor, and working with that mentor, will plan their initial research project. After completing the clinical experience required for subspecialty board eligibility, training in this track concentrates on mentored research, with reduced clinical responsibilities to allow time for intensive research training. Fellows in the Clinical Investigator Track are encouraged to engage in advanced graduate-level course work appropriate to their research interests, such as epidemiology, biostatistics, and clinical research methods available through the NYU Clinical and Translational Science Institute , or the NYU Center for Health Informatics and Bioinformatics . In addition to a primary mentor, fellows in the Clinical Investigator Track have a faculty mentoring committee that meets with the individual fellow regularly during their research training to assist them with scientific and career development.

The second year includes an additional weekly outpatient clinic in general infectious diseases, viral hepatitis, or HIV primary care; additional inpatient consultation experience with enhanced responsibility, the NYC Department of Health STD rotation, and elective rotations. Electives include the pulmonary tuberculosis clinic, Hansen's Disease clinic, pediatric infectious disease, and transplant infectious diseases. Clinician Track fellows also gain experience in teaching in the medical school and residency house staff programs.   \u00a0   Investigator Tracks   The Investigator Tracks are designed for trainees with a substantial background in basic or clinical research and whose career interests are in leading extramurally-funded research programs in infectious diseases. Applicants to these tracks are advised to identify potential mentors among the NYU infectious diseases core or affiliated faculty at the time of application. Prospective applicants are welcome to contact the Program Director for advice in identifying potential mentors that align with their interests, prior to submitting a formal application to the fellowship training program.   \u00a0   Basic Investigator Track   The Basic Investigator Track provides training in laboratory and/or translational research leading to a career as an independent investigator. Since a career as an investigator depends on support from peer-reviewed extramural sources, training in this track includes substantial guidance and support in obtaining extramural funding as well as in performing innovative research. During the first year, each Basic Investigator Track Fellow will select a research mentor, and working with that mentor, will plan their initial research project. After completing the clinical experience required for subspecialty board eligibility, training in this track concentrates on mentored research, with reduced clinical responsibilities to allow time for intensive research training. Fellows in the Basic Investigator Track are encouraged to engage in advanced graduate-level course work appropriate to their research interests, such as advanced courses in microbial pathogenesis and immunology, and/or human or population genetics. In addition to a primary mentor, fellows in the Basic Investigator Track have a faculty mentoring committee that meets with the individual fellow regularly during their research training to assist them with scientific and career development.\u00a0   \u00a0   Clinical Investigator Track   The Clinical Investigator Track provides training in epidemiology, outcomes research, field studies, clinical trials, or other patient-based research leading to a career as an independent investigator.

The program is a two-year mandatory experience with an encouraged additional year of training. Fellows participate in comprehensive clinical rotations, formal didactics, and mentored research at different stages of their training. During the first year, fellows provide supervised clinical consultation at three distinct sites that serve a broad diversity of patients: NYU Langone Medical Center, Bellevue Hospital Center, and the New York campus of the Veterans Affairs New York Harbor Healthcare System. Fellows maintain a continuity clinic throughout the fellowship focused on the outpatient management of HIV. During the second year, fellows choose from a variety of clinical, translational or basic science research opportunities to engage in mentored research. Fellows have the option of pursuing mentor-based or other intra or extramural support to extend research training.   \u00a0   Fellowship objectives   Nurture an academic environment in which fellows can develop clinical and investigative skills in infectious diseases that will promote excellence as an ID specialist.   Provide training, experiences, and professional development that will serve as the basis for successful careers in academic medicine, clinical practice, and infectious disease related public health fields.   Provide the opportunity to observe and manage adult patients with a wide variety of infectious diseases on an inpatient and outpatient basis to ensure clinical expertise in the prevention, diagnosis and management of infectious disease.   Maintain an environment that promotes learning on quality improvement, patient safety, collaboration with other health care professionals and improve systems directed toward providing patient centered care.   Provide the opportunity for fellows to conduct rigorous, mentored research in the clinical, translational or basic science of infectious diseases that can lead to careers as independent, extramurally funded investigators.   \u00a0   Fellowship tracks   The program accepts four fellows per year in three pathways, or tracks: clinician track, clinical investigator track, and basic investigator track. All tracks confer board eligibility for Infectious Diseases and follow formats set forth by the Infectious Disease Society of America.\u00a0   \u00a0   Clinician Track   The Clinician Track is designed for trainees whose primary interests are in becoming leaders in clinical care and management of patients with infectious diseases; it is also ideal for those interested in intensive clinical training leading to careers in public health policy or infectious disease prevention.   The Clinician Track consists of two years of training. After the first year of fellowship, Clinician Track fellows concentrate on additional clinical training and experience, to extend and deepen their clinical acumen. During the first year, each Clinician Track Fellow selects an area of concentration for the second year. Examples of concentrations include hospital epidemiology, antimicrobial stewardship, HIV, viral hepatitis, transplant infectious diseases, or quality management. The second year includes an additional weekly outpatient clinic in general infectious diseases, viral hepatitis, or HIV primary care; additional inpatient consultation experience with enhanced responsibility, the NYC Department of Health STD rotation, and elective rotations. Electives include the pulmonary tuberculosis clinic, Hansen's Disease clinic, pediatric infectious disease, and transplant infectious diseases. Clinician Track fellows also gain experience in teaching in the medical school and residency house staff programs.   \u00a0   Investigator Tracks   The Investigator Tracks are designed for trainees with a substantial background in basic or clinical research and whose career interests are in leading extramurally-funded research programs in infectious diseases. Applicants to these tracks are advised to identify potential mentors among the NYU infectious diseases core or affiliated faculty at the time of application. Prospective applicants are welcome to contact the Program Director for advice in identifying potential mentors that align with their interests, prior to submitting a formal application to the fellowship training program.   \u00a0   Basic Investigator Track   The Basic Investigator Track provides training in laboratory and/or translational research leading to a career as an independent investigator. Since a career as an investigator depends on support from peer-reviewed extramural sources, training in this track includes substantial guidance and support in obtaining extramural funding as well as in performing innovative research. During the first year, each Basic Investigator Track Fellow will select a research mentor, and working with that mentor, will plan their initial research project. After completing the clinical experience required for subspecialty board eligibility, training in this track concentrates on mentored research, with reduced clinical responsibilities to allow time for intensive research training. Fellows in the Basic Investigator Track are encouraged to engage in advanced graduate-level course work appropriate to their research interests, such as advanced courses in microbial pathogenesis and immunology, and/or human or population genetics. In addition to a primary mentor, fellows in the Basic Investigator Track have a faculty mentoring committee that meets with the individual fellow regularly during their research training to assist them with scientific and career development.\u00a0   \u00a0   Clinical Investigator Track   The Clinical Investigator Track provides training in epidemiology, outcomes research, field studies, clinical trials, or other patient-based research leading to a career as an independent investigator.

The program is a two-year mandatory experience with an encouraged additional year of training. Fellows participate in comprehensive clinical rotations, formal didactics, and mentored research at different stages of their training. During the first year, fellows provide supervised clinical consultation at three distinct sites that serve a broad diversity of patients: NYU Langone Medical Center, Bellevue Hospital Center, and the New York campus of the Veterans Affairs New York Harbor Healthcare System. Fellows maintain a continuity clinic throughout the fellowship focused on the outpatient management of HIV. During the second year, fellows choose from a variety of clinical, translational or basic science research opportunities to engage in mentored research. Fellows have the option of pursuing mentor-based or other intra or extramural support to extend research training.   \u00a0   Fellowship objectives   Nurture an academic environment in which fellows can develop clinical and investigative skills in infectious diseases that will promote excellence as an ID specialist.   Provide training, experiences, and professional development that will serve as the basis for successful careers in academic medicine, clinical practice, and infectious disease related public health fields.   Provide the opportunity to observe and manage adult patients with a wide variety of infectious diseases on an inpatient and outpatient basis to ensure clinical expertise in the prevention, diagnosis and management of infectious disease.   Maintain an environment that promotes learning on quality improvement, patient safety, collaboration with other health care professionals and improve systems directed toward providing patient centered care.   Provide the opportunity for fellows to conduct rigorous, mentored research in the clinical, translational or basic science of infectious diseases that can lead to careers as independent, extramurally funded investigators.   \u00a0   Fellowship tracks   The program accepts four fellows per year in three pathways, or tracks: clinician track, clinical investigator track, and basic investigator track. All tracks confer board eligibility for Infectious Diseases and follow formats set forth by the Infectious Disease Society of America.\u00a0   \u00a0   Clinician Track   The Clinician Track is designed for trainees whose primary interests are in becoming leaders in clinical care and management of patients with infectious diseases; it is also ideal for those interested in intensive clinical training leading to careers in public health policy or infectious disease prevention.   The Clinician Track consists of two years of training. After the first year of fellowship, Clinician Track fellows concentrate on additional clinical training and experience, to extend and deepen their clinical acumen. During the first year, each Clinician Track Fellow selects an area of concentration for the second year. Examples of concentrations include hospital epidemiology, antimicrobial stewardship, HIV, viral hepatitis, transplant infectious diseases, or quality management. The second year includes an additional weekly outpatient clinic in general infectious diseases, viral hepatitis, or HIV primary care; additional inpatient consultation experience with enhanced responsibility, the NYC Department of Health STD rotation, and elective rotations. Electives include the pulmonary tuberculosis clinic, Hansen's Disease clinic, pediatric infectious disease, and transplant infectious diseases. Clinician Track fellows also gain experience in teaching in the medical school and residency house staff programs.   \u00a0   Investigator Tracks   The Investigator Tracks are designed for trainees with a substantial background in basic or clinical research and whose career interests are in leading extramurally-funded research programs in infectious diseases. Applicants to these tracks are advised to identify potential mentors among the NYU infectious diseases core or affiliated faculty at the time of application. Prospective applicants are welcome to contact the Program Director for advice in identifying potential mentors that align with their interests, prior to submitting a formal application to the fellowship training program.   \u00a0   Basic Investigator Track   The Basic Investigator Track provides training in laboratory and/or translational research leading to a career as an independent investigator. Since a career as an investigator depends on support from peer-reviewed extramural sources, training in this track includes substantial guidance and support in obtaining extramural funding as well as in performing innovative research. During the first year, each Basic Investigator Track Fellow will select a research mentor, and working with that mentor, will plan their initial research project. After completing the clinical experience required for subspecialty board eligibility, training in this track concentrates on mentored research, with reduced clinical responsibilities to allow time for intensive research training. Fellows in the Basic Investigator Track are encouraged to engage in advanced graduate-level course work appropriate to their research interests, such as advanced courses in microbial pathogenesis and immunology, and/or human or population genetics. In addition to a primary mentor, fellows in the Basic Investigator Track have a faculty mentoring committee that meets with the individual fellow regularly during their research training to assist them with scientific and career development.\u00a0   \u00a0   Clinical Investigator Track   The Clinical Investigator Track provides training in epidemiology, outcomes research, field studies, clinical trials, or other patient-based research leading to a career as an independent investigator.
