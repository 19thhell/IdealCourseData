The MA curriculum exposes students to research on the role of emotion, cognition, perception, and intrapersonal as well as interpersonal dynamics in engendering change at various levels, particularly in the community context. Particular focus is on action research programs and prevention intervention research projects.    Working under the supervision of the Program Director and a faculty mentor, students apply the skills acquired in their core courses as well as specialized areas of knowledge to an independent research problem. This work culminates in a final integrative project, such as a publishable quality research thesis, program development proposal, or prevention intervention study. Recent student research topics have included: Civic Engagement in South African Youth; Socio-Dramatic Play in Young Children; Music Therapy Outcomes with Autistic Youth; Low-Income Housing Status and Literacy Outcomes; and Parent and Teacher Satisfaction with Intervention Programming.
