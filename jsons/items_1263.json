I also work beyond the French tradition\u2014on medieval Europe in general, and on the Eastern Mediterranean and Middle East. I have drawn on various kinds of theory, in particular, narratology, in order to grasp medieval plot structures. I have worked on the complex relations between oral and written tradition (often a two-way street!). Much of my recent work deals with the performance of medieval narrative: drawing on evidence from the texts, manuscript tradition, and historical documents, I attempt to reconstruct performance possibilities of medieval epics, romances, and tales. (I also teach an UG course that is like an ongoing workshop: talented students perform all the works they read and study; many clips are available on my performance websites; I thus also work in the Digital Humanities.) Currently, I am also working on theories of cognition, as well as on the representation and role of the emotions in medieval literature. For example, how do various medieval genres differ in their handling of the emotions of the characters and in the emotional responses elicited from audiences? The general purpose of my scholarly work is, I would say, to make sense of the Middle Ages\u2014both other and (as it were) us.

The Center branches into the University's four significant spheres of activity in French Studies: the Department, the Institute of French Studies, NYU Paris, and La Maison Fran\u00e7aise. These form the most comprehensive American academic complex devoted to the culture of France, past and present. The Department of French currently has 19 faculty members, representing a broad spectrum of specialization in all areas of French literature and civilization, and 14 full-time language lecturers. In addition, the Department offers courses by eminent visiting professors, including R\u00e9da Bensma\u00efa, Fran\u00e7ois Cornillat, Marielle Mac\u00e9, Christian Biet, Yves Citton, Philippe Roger, and Fran\u00e7ois Noudlemann. The Department offers approximately 8 graduate seminars each semester, with enrollments ranging from five to fifteen students. Thus, students are able to choose from the rich offerings of a large department, yet also enjoy the opportunity for close, personal interaction with professors. Mini-seminars are another important feature of the department's program (See Upcoming Events ). Some who have headed seminars in recent years are: Michel Zink, Michel Deguy, Jacques Darras, Guy Scarpetta, Jean Milly, Jacqueline Cerquiglini-Toulet, Jacques Roubaud, Dani\u00e8le Sallenave, Claude Simon, Jacques Derrida, Jacques Garelli, Robert Abirached, Erik Arnoult, Viviane Forrester.   PROGRAMS OF STUDY  PH.D. PROGRAMS Doctoral students must complete 72 points of post-undergraduate   coursework (about 18 courses). This may include credits earned during   M.A. work at NYU or transfer credits from another graduate institution.    Ph.D. in French Literature The Ph.D. program in French literature prepares students to teach in all areas of French and Francophone literature, stressing both breadth and depth through research seminars and qualifying exams. Ph.D. students in French literature will complete coursework in all seven fields--Medieval, Renaissance, 17th century, 18th century, 19th century, and 20th century and Francophone literatures--as well as a proseminar in textual analysis. The program also trains students to be outstanding researchers and important contributors in the field which best speaks to their intellectual passions. Interdisciplinary Ph.D. Program in French Literature The Interdisciplinary Program in French Literature enables students to conjoin the study of literature with cinema, fine arts, music or with the social and human sciences (history, linguistics, politics, sociology, anthropology). Students design a course of doctoral study that reflects their special interests and takes advantage of the exceptionally rich resources of New York University (Institute of French Studies, Medieval and Renaissance Studies, Dramatic Literature, Theatre History, Cinema Studies, etc.). To enter the program, students must apply after the completion of the M.A. in French Literature and during their first semester of doctoral studies. Joint Ph.D. in French Studies and French Literature The Institute of French Studies (IFS) at NYU is an interdisciplinary program devoted to the study of modern and contemporary France and francophone countries. The Department of French and the IFS offer a joint Ph.D. in French Studies and French that is designed for students interested in developing research expertise in the history and analysis of literary texts closely linked to their social, cultural, and political contexts. It prepares students to teach both literature and civilization in French departments, and gives them the scholarly expertise to integrate the two. The Joint program combines strong training in literary analysis with substantial exposure to the study of France, Europe, and the Francophone world, offered by historians and social scientists. The program covers 19th and 20th-Century France and French literature, although students ordinarily develop a narrower research specialty within this time period. The specific focus--and challenge--of the joint degree is the marrying of a social science research approach with a literary one. Students applying to the program should have a background both in French literature and in history and the social sciences. Admission to the joint Ph.D. program must be granted by both the IFS and the Department of French.  M.A. PROGRAMS Master's students must complete 32 points of post-undergraduate coursework (8 courses). The distribution is dependent upon the program of study: M.A. in French Literature The M.A. in French Literature may be pursued in New York City or in Paris. The course of studies leading to the M.A. in French Literature is comprehensive in that candidates are expected to acquire a broad knowledge of all areas of French literature. Students in French Literature are expected to acquire a solid background in critical practice and a broad knowledge of all periods of French literature by completing at least one course each in six of seven areas (Middle Ages; Renaissance; 17th, 18th, 19th, and 20th centuries; Francophone) and one course in textual analysis. M.A. in Literary Translation: French \u2013 English This M.A. program in Literary Translation teaches master\u2019s students the skills to translate from French to English at a professional level. It aims at educating a much-needed new generation of literary translators. The program is supported by all the faculty members of the NYU French department and provides an excellent theoretical and analytical education in translation. NYU provides the perfect environment for this type of program in translation: 1) our location in NYC where, besides the French Publishers\u2019 Agency, the vast majority of American publishers likely to publish French books in translation are located, and 2) the NYU-in-Paris Center, where students will spend a six-week Summer session allowing them to meet with contemporary French writers, publishers, and foreign rights managers. For information about Master's programs housed in Paris, see the NYU Paris site: Master of Arts in French Language and Civilization, Master of Arts in Teaching French as a Foreign Language.  FUNDING PH.D. FUNDING All students admitted to Ph.D. programs at the Graduate School of Arts and Science (GSAS) will receive a Henry M. MacCracken Fellowship, for a period of five years. This fellowship includes full tuition remission, waiver of registration and services fees, and health insurance through NYU, as well as a competitive fellowship stipend toward your expenses. GSAS also provides a one-time start-up stipend for first-year students. Students who enter with external funding may still be awarded a MacCracken fellowship to ensure that they are receiving full-funding from both sources combined. Following the MacCracken Fellowship, students are encouraged to apply for both internal and external fellowships. In addition to the stipend, our doctoral students are strongly encouraged to teach for four semesters to gain invaluable experience for their careers. And with the implementation of Financial Aid Reform (FAR4), teaching as an adjunct instructor provides compensation over and above the MacCracken stipend.  M.A. FUNDING NYU Paris offers competitive financial aid packages to M.A. students, including a 30% tuition scholarship (offered to all students) as well as a number of merit-based scholarships and employment opportunities. To learn more about NYU Paris funding please visit their website.  The Graduate School\u2019s Tuition Incentive Program (TIP) encourages students to apply for external grants and provides matching tuition points (from 50 to 100 percent) to eligible recipients of external awards from recognized, academic sources of funding outside NYU. For applications and specific details about TIP eligibility criteria, please see the TIP application document (PDF). New York University offers several loan programs to students. Information is available at www.nyu.edu/financial.aid or at the Office of Financial Aid, 212-998-4444. For a description of all Graduate School fellowships and assistantships, please refer to the document Financing Graduate Education (PDF). SCHOLARSHIPS AND LOANS The financial aid package, including scholarships and loans, that students receive from NYU is based on the information submitted on the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) application. FAFSA is the basic application form for most student aid programs, available January 1 each year. The federal school code number for NYU is 002785. Additional information on Financial Aid and Fellowships is available through the GSAS website and through the NYU Office of Financial Aid .  COURSEWORK  CREDIT TRANSFER Students may be awarded up to 23 points of transfer credit for your earned master's degree toward your doctoral coursework in consultation with the Director of Graduate Studies and pending approval from the Graduate School. FOREIGN language requirement Native or near-native fluency in French is expected of all graduate students in the NYU Department of French. This requirement is filled by passing any graduate-level course taught in French. Doctoral students in French Literature are also required to fulfill a requirement for a second foreign language apart from French or English, preferably by the end of the second year. This can be fulfilled in several ways: (1) having taken and passed an intermediate-level language course no more than two years prior to matriculation into the graduate program, (2) taking and passing such a course while in residence at NYU, (3) passing a GSAS-administered foreign language exam. If a student is a native speaker of a language other than French or English, he or she may petition the Director of Graduate Studies for a waiver of this requirement. The joint Ph.D. in French Literature \u2013 French Studies and all M.A. programs do not have a second foreign language requirement. COURSES The Department of French offers at least 8 graduate seminars each semester, covering a broad spectrum of topics in French literature and civilization, critical theory, the history of ideas, cultural studies, film, Francophone studies, and translation. See current course offerings and the bulletin course descriptions . Inter-University Doctoral Consortium Even if not formally enrolled in an interdisciplinary program, students in the French Department are welcome and encouraged to take courses outside the department and through the Inter-University Doctoral Consortium which are germane to their research interests. The Inter-University Doctoral Consortium (IUDC) offers eligible GSAS students the opportunity to take graduate courses at distinguished universities throughout the greater New York area. The IUDC has been in existence for over 25 years and offers students an enormous array of courses and opportunities for contact with faculty and students in their fields. Participating schools are: Columbia University, Princeton University, CUNY Graduate Center, Rutgers University, Fordham University, SUNY Stony Brook, the Graduate Faculty at New School University, Teachers College at Columbia University, and New York University. The IUDC is open to doctoral students from participating schools who have completed at least one year of full time study toward the Ph.D. Terminal master's students and non-GSAS students are not eligible.  CERTIFICATE PROGRAMS Students are encouraged to take courses at the IFS--or any department--that pertain to their research interests. Doctoral students in the Department of French may complete a Certificate of Achievement in French Studies by completing four courses at the IFS while in residence at NYU. Students may also apply to earn a certificate in Poetics and Theory or a Concentration in Medieval and Renaissance Studies .  TEACHING The NYU Department of French instructs over 1,000 students per semester in its language and content classes, many of which are taught by students in the Ph.D. program as adjunct instructors. The Department of French feels that teaching is an essential experience for its doctoral students to grow in their skills and confidence as educators and to be competitive on the job market. With the implementation of Financial Aid Reform 4 (FAR4)(PDF download), teaching as an adjunct instructor provides compensation over and above the MacCracken stipend. Ph.D. students in the Department of French typically teach for two years, usually beginning in their second year of coursework. Doctoral students may also have other opportunities to teach, such as undergraduate summer language or literature courses in New York or at NYU Paris. M.A.-track students are not eligible to teach classes through the Department of French at NYU.  TEACHER TRAINING First-time adjunct instructors receive training in the form of a week-long intensive Teaching Orientation the summer before they begin teaching. Training continues in a bi-weekly Teaching Seminar and Workshop through the fall and spring semesters, in which students examine the theoretical underpinnings of second language acquisition and explore praxis through sample lesson plan and exercise creation, test writing and analysis, textbook analyses, and peer- and self observation. This Teaching Orientation and Workshop is a required course for all doctoral students in the Department of French and carries four points (two points each semester) points toward the 72-point Ph.D. requirement.  STUDYING IN FRANCE AND ABROAD NYU PARIS At NYU Paris, students in graduate studies have the   unique opportunity to immerse themselves in French intellectual and   cultural life. Students join a rich and stimulating academic community   that is small enough to provide individual attention yet is made up of   some of the very best scholars in French literature, history, and   civilization. Host to a series of conferences and lectures that bring   together artists, filmmakers, politicians, and writers, NYU Paris is a   thriving center of intellectual and cultural exchange. See the NYU Paris site for more information.  Ph.D. students may elect to take courses at NYU Paris in the summer, or, in the case of Ph.D. students who do not hold an earned M.A., to complete their M.A. at NYU Paris. Students may also apply to hold a resident assistant position at NYU Paris in the summer, perhaps coupled with study there. There are also opportunities for students to teach summer language courses and, during the academic year, one student is needed to teach a literature course in the Anglophone program, as well. The Department of French also has an agreement with the Ecole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure in both Lyon and Paris that allows up to two doctoral students to spend a year or semester at the ENS and participate fully in its seminars. After finishing coursework, doctoral students may choose to conduct research for their dissertation in France or other relevant locations. They may continue to draw on their MacCracken fellowship as it is available and may also be eligible for supplementary funding through additional competitive fellowships at NYU or externally. The faculty will make every effort to assist students in making contact with relevant universities, libraries, archives, and other resources. The M.A. program in French Literature is offered at both NYU in New York and NYU Paris. Students generally complete their coursework at the campus to which they applied. The M.A. in French Language and Civilization is offered only at NYU Paris. Students in the M.A. in Literary Translation program spend the fall and spring semesters in New York and a six-week summer session in Paris. The M.A. in Teaching French as a Foreign Language is a multi-year program, of which the first year is spent at NYU Paris. (The remaining coursework is completed on a full- or part-time basis at the Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development at NYU Washington Square.) To Learn more about M.A. programs at NYU Paris please visit the NYU Paris website   NYU RESOURCES LIBRARY NYU's Bobst Library houses over 3.3 million volumes, twenty thousand journals, and over 3 million microforms. NYU also has reciprocal borrowing privileges with several other nearby university libraries and reciprocal on-site access with Columbia's Butler Library. In addition, the New York Public Library is freely available and boasts four major research centers and myriad local lending branches throughout the City. The Avery Fisher Center for Music and Media at Bobst Library offers an impressive selection of French film; the Department also houses a small collection of films of its own. The Department of French is housed at 19 University Place, just north of Washington Square Park and just across the street from La Maison Fran\u00e7aise and the Institute for French Studies on the historic Washington Mews. LA MAISON FRAN \u00c7 AISE La Maison Fran \u00e7 aise is one of the most active centers of French-American cultural exchange on any American campus. Founded in 1957 on the historic Washington Mews just north of Washington Square Park, the Maison offers a year-round program of activities, including lectures, roundtables, conferences, film and video screenings, art exhibits, concerts, and special presentations. All events are free and open to the public. INSTITUTE OF FRENCH STUDIES Established in 1978 through a major grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities, the Institute of French Studies (IFS) offers degree programs for Ph.D. students for careers in higher education and master's programs to prepare students for careers in international business, banking, the media, cultural organizations, and government. In addition to its teaching programs, the Institute of French Studies fosters research by faculty, doctoral students, research associates, and a wide array of visiting scholars, who share their research through the French Studies Colloquia public lecture series and weekly luncheon seminars.  GRADUATE STUDENT COMMUNITY There are approximately 60 graduate students, from M.A. students to Ph.D. candidates finishing their dissertations, based in our department here at NYU Washington Square. All graduate students are invited to take part in the French Graduate Students' Association (FGSA), which serves as a forum for students on both the master\u2019s and doctoral level. Through meetings and a regular dialogue with the Director of Graduate Studies, the FGSA provides an organized channel through which graduate students voice their interests and concerns and make suggestions to the faculty.The Graduate Student Association also organizes a series of \u201cbrown-bag lunches,\u201d including work-in-progress discussions. Individual students have also convened dissertation writing groups, the teaching and training committee, and other initiatives. In addition to this, graduate students participate in a series of Teaching and Training workshops organized by the graduate student instructors and Language Lecturers and take responsibility for organizing events for undergraduate students such as the monthly Cin\u00e9-Club, and Caf\u00e9 et Conversation conversational hours.  JOB PLACEMENT In 2014, current and recent graduates obtained tenure-track positions at the University of South Carolina, Wagner College, and Dartmouth College. Students also accepted one-year appointments at Vassar College and New York University and a two-year appointment at Bard College. In 2013, current and recent graduates secured tenure track positions at University of Wisconsin - Madison, Catholic University, University of Southern Indiana, and the Borough of Manhattan Community College; one-year appointments at Bryn Mawr and Wagner College (Staten Island); and a post-doctoral fellowship in the Princeton Society of Fellows.

I also work beyond the French tradition\u2014on medieval Europe in general, and on the Eastern Mediterranean and Middle East. I have drawn on various kinds of theory, in particular, narratology, in order to grasp medieval plot structures. I have worked on the complex relations between oral and written tradition (often a two-way street!). Much of my recent work deals with the performance of medieval narrative: drawing on evidence from the texts, manuscript tradition, and historical documents, I attempt to reconstruct performance possibilities of medieval epics, romances, and tales. (I also teach an UG course that is like an ongoing workshop: talented students perform all the works they read and study; many clips are available on my performance websites; I thus also work in the Digital Humanities.) Currently, I am also working on theories of cognition, as well as on the representation and role of the emotions in medieval literature. For example, how do various medieval genres differ in their handling of the emotions of the characters and in the emotional responses elicited from audiences? The general purpose of my scholarly work is, I would say, to make sense of the Middle Ages\u2014both other and (as it were) us.

The Center branches into the University's four significant spheres of activity in French Studies: the Department, the Institute of French Studies, NYU Paris, and La Maison Fran\u00e7aise. These form the most comprehensive American academic complex devoted to the culture of France, past and present. The Department of French currently has 19 faculty members, representing a broad spectrum of specialization in all areas of French literature and civilization, and 14 full-time language lecturers. In addition, the Department offers courses by eminent visiting professors, including R\u00e9da Bensma\u00efa, Fran\u00e7ois Cornillat, Marielle Mac\u00e9, Christian Biet, Yves Citton, Philippe Roger, and Fran\u00e7ois Noudlemann. The Department offers approximately 8 graduate seminars each semester, with enrollments ranging from five to fifteen students. Thus, students are able to choose from the rich offerings of a large department, yet also enjoy the opportunity for close, personal interaction with professors. Mini-seminars are another important feature of the department's program (See Upcoming Events ). Some who have headed seminars in recent years are: Michel Zink, Michel Deguy, Jacques Darras, Guy Scarpetta, Jean Milly, Jacqueline Cerquiglini-Toulet, Jacques Roubaud, Dani\u00e8le Sallenave, Claude Simon, Jacques Derrida, Jacques Garelli, Robert Abirached, Erik Arnoult, Viviane Forrester.   PROGRAMS OF STUDY  PH.D. PROGRAMS Doctoral students must complete 72 points of post-undergraduate   coursework (about 18 courses). This may include credits earned during   M.A. work at NYU or transfer credits from another graduate institution.    Ph.D. in French Literature The Ph.D. program in French literature prepares students to teach in all areas of French and Francophone literature, stressing both breadth and depth through research seminars and qualifying exams. Ph.D. students in French literature will complete coursework in all seven fields--Medieval, Renaissance, 17th century, 18th century, 19th century, and 20th century and Francophone literatures--as well as a proseminar in textual analysis. The program also trains students to be outstanding researchers and important contributors in the field which best speaks to their intellectual passions. Interdisciplinary Ph.D. Program in French Literature The Interdisciplinary Program in French Literature enables students to conjoin the study of literature with cinema, fine arts, music or with the social and human sciences (history, linguistics, politics, sociology, anthropology). Students design a course of doctoral study that reflects their special interests and takes advantage of the exceptionally rich resources of New York University (Institute of French Studies, Medieval and Renaissance Studies, Dramatic Literature, Theatre History, Cinema Studies, etc.). To enter the program, students must apply after the completion of the M.A. in French Literature and during their first semester of doctoral studies. Joint Ph.D. in French Studies and French Literature The Institute of French Studies (IFS) at NYU is an interdisciplinary program devoted to the study of modern and contemporary France and francophone countries. The Department of French and the IFS offer a joint Ph.D. in French Studies and French that is designed for students interested in developing research expertise in the history and analysis of literary texts closely linked to their social, cultural, and political contexts. It prepares students to teach both literature and civilization in French departments, and gives them the scholarly expertise to integrate the two. The Joint program combines strong training in literary analysis with substantial exposure to the study of France, Europe, and the Francophone world, offered by historians and social scientists. The program covers 19th and 20th-Century France and French literature, although students ordinarily develop a narrower research specialty within this time period. The specific focus--and challenge--of the joint degree is the marrying of a social science research approach with a literary one. Students applying to the program should have a background both in French literature and in history and the social sciences. Admission to the joint Ph.D. program must be granted by both the IFS and the Department of French.  M.A. PROGRAMS Master's students must complete 32 points of post-undergraduate coursework (8 courses). The distribution is dependent upon the program of study: M.A. in French Literature The M.A. in French Literature may be pursued in New York City or in Paris. The course of studies leading to the M.A. in French Literature is comprehensive in that candidates are expected to acquire a broad knowledge of all areas of French literature. Students in French Literature are expected to acquire a solid background in critical practice and a broad knowledge of all periods of French literature by completing at least one course each in six of seven areas (Middle Ages; Renaissance; 17th, 18th, 19th, and 20th centuries; Francophone) and one course in textual analysis. M.A. in Literary Translation: French \u2013 English This M.A. program in Literary Translation teaches master\u2019s students the skills to translate from French to English at a professional level. It aims at educating a much-needed new generation of literary translators. The program is supported by all the faculty members of the NYU French department and provides an excellent theoretical and analytical education in translation. NYU provides the perfect environment for this type of program in translation: 1) our location in NYC where, besides the French Publishers\u2019 Agency, the vast majority of American publishers likely to publish French books in translation are located, and 2) the NYU-in-Paris Center, where students will spend a six-week Summer session allowing them to meet with contemporary French writers, publishers, and foreign rights managers. For information about Master's programs housed in Paris, see the NYU Paris site: Master of Arts in French Language and Civilization, Master of Arts in Teaching French as a Foreign Language.  FUNDING PH.D. FUNDING All students admitted to Ph.D. programs at the Graduate School of Arts and Science (GSAS) will receive a Henry M. MacCracken Fellowship, for a period of five years. This fellowship includes full tuition remission, waiver of registration and services fees, and health insurance through NYU, as well as a competitive fellowship stipend toward your expenses. GSAS also provides a one-time start-up stipend for first-year students. Students who enter with external funding may still be awarded a MacCracken fellowship to ensure that they are receiving full-funding from both sources combined. Following the MacCracken Fellowship, students are encouraged to apply for both internal and external fellowships. In addition to the stipend, our doctoral students are strongly encouraged to teach for four semesters to gain invaluable experience for their careers. And with the implementation of Financial Aid Reform (FAR4), teaching as an adjunct instructor provides compensation over and above the MacCracken stipend.  M.A. FUNDING NYU Paris offers competitive financial aid packages to M.A. students, including a 30% tuition scholarship (offered to all students) as well as a number of merit-based scholarships and employment opportunities. To learn more about NYU Paris funding please visit their website.  The Graduate School\u2019s Tuition Incentive Program (TIP) encourages students to apply for external grants and provides matching tuition points (from 50 to 100 percent) to eligible recipients of external awards from recognized, academic sources of funding outside NYU. For applications and specific details about TIP eligibility criteria, please see the TIP application document (PDF). New York University offers several loan programs to students. Information is available at www.nyu.edu/financial.aid or at the Office of Financial Aid, 212-998-4444. For a description of all Graduate School fellowships and assistantships, please refer to the document Financing Graduate Education (PDF). SCHOLARSHIPS AND LOANS The financial aid package, including scholarships and loans, that students receive from NYU is based on the information submitted on the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) application. FAFSA is the basic application form for most student aid programs, available January 1 each year. The federal school code number for NYU is 002785. Additional information on Financial Aid and Fellowships is available through the GSAS website and through the NYU Office of Financial Aid .  COURSEWORK  CREDIT TRANSFER Students may be awarded up to 23 points of transfer credit for your earned master's degree toward your doctoral coursework in consultation with the Director of Graduate Studies and pending approval from the Graduate School. FOREIGN language requirement Native or near-native fluency in French is expected of all graduate students in the NYU Department of French. This requirement is filled by passing any graduate-level course taught in French. Doctoral students in French Literature are also required to fulfill a requirement for a second foreign language apart from French or English, preferably by the end of the second year. This can be fulfilled in several ways: (1) having taken and passed an intermediate-level language course no more than two years prior to matriculation into the graduate program, (2) taking and passing such a course while in residence at NYU, (3) passing a GSAS-administered foreign language exam. If a student is a native speaker of a language other than French or English, he or she may petition the Director of Graduate Studies for a waiver of this requirement. The joint Ph.D. in French Literature \u2013 French Studies and all M.A. programs do not have a second foreign language requirement. COURSES The Department of French offers at least 8 graduate seminars each semester, covering a broad spectrum of topics in French literature and civilization, critical theory, the history of ideas, cultural studies, film, Francophone studies, and translation. See current course offerings and the bulletin course descriptions . Inter-University Doctoral Consortium Even if not formally enrolled in an interdisciplinary program, students in the French Department are welcome and encouraged to take courses outside the department and through the Inter-University Doctoral Consortium which are germane to their research interests. The Inter-University Doctoral Consortium (IUDC) offers eligible GSAS students the opportunity to take graduate courses at distinguished universities throughout the greater New York area. The IUDC has been in existence for over 25 years and offers students an enormous array of courses and opportunities for contact with faculty and students in their fields. Participating schools are: Columbia University, Princeton University, CUNY Graduate Center, Rutgers University, Fordham University, SUNY Stony Brook, the Graduate Faculty at New School University, Teachers College at Columbia University, and New York University. The IUDC is open to doctoral students from participating schools who have completed at least one year of full time study toward the Ph.D. Terminal master's students and non-GSAS students are not eligible.  CERTIFICATE PROGRAMS Students are encouraged to take courses at the IFS--or any department--that pertain to their research interests. Doctoral students in the Department of French may complete a Certificate of Achievement in French Studies by completing four courses at the IFS while in residence at NYU. Students may also apply to earn a certificate in Poetics and Theory or a Concentration in Medieval and Renaissance Studies .  TEACHING The NYU Department of French instructs over 1,000 students per semester in its language and content classes, many of which are taught by students in the Ph.D. program as adjunct instructors. The Department of French feels that teaching is an essential experience for its doctoral students to grow in their skills and confidence as educators and to be competitive on the job market. With the implementation of Financial Aid Reform 4 (FAR4)(PDF download), teaching as an adjunct instructor provides compensation over and above the MacCracken stipend. Ph.D. students in the Department of French typically teach for two years, usually beginning in their second year of coursework. Doctoral students may also have other opportunities to teach, such as undergraduate summer language or literature courses in New York or at NYU Paris. M.A.-track students are not eligible to teach classes through the Department of French at NYU.  TEACHER TRAINING First-time adjunct instructors receive training in the form of a week-long intensive Teaching Orientation the summer before they begin teaching. Training continues in a bi-weekly Teaching Seminar and Workshop through the fall and spring semesters, in which students examine the theoretical underpinnings of second language acquisition and explore praxis through sample lesson plan and exercise creation, test writing and analysis, textbook analyses, and peer- and self observation. This Teaching Orientation and Workshop is a required course for all doctoral students in the Department of French and carries four points (two points each semester) points toward the 72-point Ph.D. requirement.  STUDYING IN FRANCE AND ABROAD NYU PARIS At NYU Paris, students in graduate studies have the   unique opportunity to immerse themselves in French intellectual and   cultural life. Students join a rich and stimulating academic community   that is small enough to provide individual attention yet is made up of   some of the very best scholars in French literature, history, and   civilization. Host to a series of conferences and lectures that bring   together artists, filmmakers, politicians, and writers, NYU Paris is a   thriving center of intellectual and cultural exchange. See the NYU Paris site for more information.  Ph.D. students may elect to take courses at NYU Paris in the summer, or, in the case of Ph.D. students who do not hold an earned M.A., to complete their M.A. at NYU Paris. Students may also apply to hold a resident assistant position at NYU Paris in the summer, perhaps coupled with study there. There are also opportunities for students to teach summer language courses and, during the academic year, one student is needed to teach a literature course in the Anglophone program, as well. The Department of French also has an agreement with the Ecole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure in both Lyon and Paris that allows up to two doctoral students to spend a year or semester at the ENS and participate fully in its seminars. After finishing coursework, doctoral students may choose to conduct research for their dissertation in France or other relevant locations. They may continue to draw on their MacCracken fellowship as it is available and may also be eligible for supplementary funding through additional competitive fellowships at NYU or externally. The faculty will make every effort to assist students in making contact with relevant universities, libraries, archives, and other resources. The M.A. program in French Literature is offered at both NYU in New York and NYU Paris. Students generally complete their coursework at the campus to which they applied. The M.A. in French Language and Civilization is offered only at NYU Paris. Students in the M.A. in Literary Translation program spend the fall and spring semesters in New York and a six-week summer session in Paris. The M.A. in Teaching French as a Foreign Language is a multi-year program, of which the first year is spent at NYU Paris. (The remaining coursework is completed on a full- or part-time basis at the Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development at NYU Washington Square.) To Learn more about M.A. programs at NYU Paris please visit the NYU Paris website   NYU RESOURCES LIBRARY NYU's Bobst Library houses over 3.3 million volumes, twenty thousand journals, and over 3 million microforms. NYU also has reciprocal borrowing privileges with several other nearby university libraries and reciprocal on-site access with Columbia's Butler Library. In addition, the New York Public Library is freely available and boasts four major research centers and myriad local lending branches throughout the City. The Avery Fisher Center for Music and Media at Bobst Library offers an impressive selection of French film; the Department also houses a small collection of films of its own. The Department of French is housed at 19 University Place, just north of Washington Square Park and just across the street from La Maison Fran\u00e7aise and the Institute for French Studies on the historic Washington Mews. LA MAISON FRAN \u00c7 AISE La Maison Fran \u00e7 aise is one of the most active centers of French-American cultural exchange on any American campus. Founded in 1957 on the historic Washington Mews just north of Washington Square Park, the Maison offers a year-round program of activities, including lectures, roundtables, conferences, film and video screenings, art exhibits, concerts, and special presentations. All events are free and open to the public. INSTITUTE OF FRENCH STUDIES Established in 1978 through a major grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities, the Institute of French Studies (IFS) offers degree programs for Ph.D. students for careers in higher education and master's programs to prepare students for careers in international business, banking, the media, cultural organizations, and government. In addition to its teaching programs, the Institute of French Studies fosters research by faculty, doctoral students, research associates, and a wide array of visiting scholars, who share their research through the French Studies Colloquia public lecture series and weekly luncheon seminars.  GRADUATE STUDENT COMMUNITY There are approximately 60 graduate students, from M.A. students to Ph.D. candidates finishing their dissertations, based in our department here at NYU Washington Square. All graduate students are invited to take part in the French Graduate Students' Association (FGSA), which serves as a forum for students on both the master\u2019s and doctoral level. Through meetings and a regular dialogue with the Director of Graduate Studies, the FGSA provides an organized channel through which graduate students voice their interests and concerns and make suggestions to the faculty.The Graduate Student Association also organizes a series of \u201cbrown-bag lunches,\u201d including work-in-progress discussions. Individual students have also convened dissertation writing groups, the teaching and training committee, and other initiatives. In addition to this, graduate students participate in a series of Teaching and Training workshops organized by the graduate student instructors and Language Lecturers and take responsibility for organizing events for undergraduate students such as the monthly Cin\u00e9-Club, and Caf\u00e9 et Conversation conversational hours.  JOB PLACEMENT In 2014, current and recent graduates obtained tenure-track positions at the University of South Carolina, Wagner College, and Dartmouth College. Students also accepted one-year appointments at Vassar College and New York University and a two-year appointment at Bard College. In 2013, current and recent graduates secured tenure track positions at University of Wisconsin - Madison, Catholic University, University of Southern Indiana, and the Borough of Manhattan Community College; one-year appointments at Bryn Mawr and Wagner College (Staten Island); and a post-doctoral fellowship in the Princeton Society of Fellows.
