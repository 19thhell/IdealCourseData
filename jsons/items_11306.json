Built in 1899 for Adam Lanfear Norrie, the house was extensively altered in 1928 and the present Italian Renaissance fa\u00e7ade and interiors bear little resemblance to the original house. After its purchase by the Leon Levy Foundation in 2004, the house was transformed into a suite of offices, study rooms, galleries, and a library, with careful attention given to retaining as much of its original architectural detail as possible.    A.L. Norrie Residence    East 84th Street was starting to turn quite chic in 1897, when Adam Lanfear Norrie (1856-1910), a well-known man of fortune whose name appeared regularly in New York\u2019s society pages, decided to leave his residence on East 41st Street and migrate north with his peers. To design his new residence on a large land parcel at 15 East 84th Street, between Fifth and Madison Avenues, Norrie commissioned the fashionable architectural firm of Renwick, Aspinwall &amp; Owen.    Two years later, the four-story brick Norrie residence was completed. Its fa\u00e7ade ran one and a half city lots at the street line and was set back on the remaining half lot, creating an L-shaped footprint. A wrought-iron canopy led to a round-arched doorway in the setback area. The house featured several elements of the Tuscan villa style, including a tile roof with projecting eaves and exaggeratedly large corbels, or brackets, that flanked the arched windows on the fourth floor. Behind the house, the architects built a two-story stable that opened on East 85th Street; between the house and stable, there was a large formal garden. Norrie added features to the property after its completion, including a one-story brick squash court designed in 1901 by Renwick Aspinwall.    The Norries often entertained lavishly in their new home, and its fashionable interiors, including the hallway, ballroom, dining room and library, were showcased in a photo spread in\u00a0 Architectural Record magazine in 1903.    After the death of her husband in 1910, Mrs. Norrie continued to reside in the house until her marriage to the Count Odet Armand Marie de Jumilhac of Paris.\u00a0 In 1919, she sold the property to Charles F. Hoffman, a real estate broker, and two years later Edward L. Doheny purchased it from Hoffman\u2019s estate.\u00a0 Doheny\u2019s father, the investor Edward L. Doheny Sr., reportedly resided at the house when he was indicted for bribery and conspiracy in the Teapot Dome case, the oil scandal that rocked the tenure of President Warren G. Harding.    Ogden Mills Reid Residence    In 1927, Ogden Mills Reid (1882-1947), editor-in-chief of the\u00a0 New York Herald-Tribune , purchased the property, including the former stable, and hired the architect Lafayette A. Goldstone to extensively alter the building. Reid was the son of Whitelaw Reid, editor-in-chief and principal owner of the\u00a0 Tribune , who later served as Ambassador to England, and Elisabeth Reid. After graduating from Yale Law School, the younger Reid began his career as a reporter at the\u00a0 Tribune , working his way up to managing editor before inheriting the paper following his father\u2019s death in 1912.\u00a0 As editor-in-chief, Reid invested both time and resources in the paper. In 1924 he bought the\u00a0 New York Herald and merged the two papers to create the storied\u00a0 Herald-Tribune .    Goldstone, Reid\u2019s architect (1876-1956), was born in Poughkeepsie, New York. He left school at the age of 14, but his parents arranged for him to receive lessons in drawing and architecture several evenings a week and he arrived in New York City in 1891 ready to practice architecture.\u00a0 He partnered with William Lawrence Rouse and, from 1909 to 1917, their highly popular firm had 119 jobs, including 47 apartment houses.\u00a0 Rouse &amp; Goldstone dissolved in 1926, but shortly thereafter Goldstone received the commission to alter the Reid house, both inside and out.\u00a0 Major townhouse renovations such as this were common sights in the side streets of the Upper East Side in the 1920s.    According to Goldstone\u2019s wife and son, \u201cOf all the houses that L.A.G. planned, the one that gave him the most satisfaction was the town house for the owners of the\u00a0 New York Herald-Tribune , Mr. and Mrs. Ogden Mills Reid\u2026\u00a0 The owners\u2019 desire for the finest materials and workmanship made this project a most congenial one to the architect.\u201d Goldstone added one story to the building, plus a penthouse, and redesigned the facade in the neo-Italian Renaissance style that was more popular around the turn of the century. His designs, by and large, survive to this day.    The entrance, a tall rounded-arch doorway surrounded by Tuscan pilasters protrudes slightly from the center of the building.\u00a0 The number \u201c15\u201d is carved into the keystone.\u00a0 Above the keystone, a panel is surrounded by rosettes, and above that a cornice topped with a wrought-iron railing.\u00a0 A decorative cornice, with regularly spaced horizontal brackets, is above the fourth floor windows.\u00a0 The soffit, or underside of the cornice, is adorned with geometric patterns \u2013 circles and diamonds.    Goldstone also radically transformed the house\u2019s interior, although when possible he salvaged materials from the Norrie residence and reused them in his design.\u00a0 He removed the original staircase and installed a grand spiral staircase with a walnut handrail and iron balustrade extending from the first through fifth floors. He placed mustard-yellow colored glazed terra cotta blocks on the walls of much of the cellar, which housed the kitchen, the servants\u2019 dining room, a pastry room, a vegetable room, and a game refrigerator.    The entrance vestibule, entrance hall, reception room, dining room, and a sitting room for Mr. Reid were located on the first floor.\u00a0 The second floor housed the library, drawing room, and tea service and flower rooms. A silver pantry and a silver vault were located on the second floor mezzanine.\u00a0 Mr. and Mrs. Reid\u2019s bedrooms occupied much of the third floor, along with a sitting room and dressing room for Mrs. Reid, a maid\u2019s bedroom, a pressing room, linen closet, and cedar closet.\u00a0 The fourth floor included the children\u2019s bedrooms, a study, and a kitchen.\u00a0 Guests and their servants used the fifth floor, which held four guest rooms, a sitting room, four guests\u2019 servants and a servants\u2019 hall.\u00a0 The sixth floor, or penthouse, was where the maids lived, in eleven bed rooms, all told. The residence was equipped with a passenger lift, a service lift, and a dumbwaiter.    Stephen Wise Congress House    Following the death of her husband in 1947, Mrs. Reid, an active woman who helped run the\u00a0 Herald Tribune and served as a trustee of Barnard College, remained in the house until 1950, when she sold the property, including the garage, to the American Jewish Congress (AJC).\u00a0 The house then became known as the Stephen Wise Congress House in honor of Rabbi Stephen S. Wise, who spearheaded the organization of the AJC and served as its vice-president from 1921-25 and as president or honorary president until his death in 1949.\u00a0 During these years, the house at 15 East 84th Street served as AJC\u2019s headquarters and was open to the public for lectures and special events. In 1989, the AJC subdivided the property into two lots and sold the garage on East 85th Street and part of the garden to a developer who constructed two townhouses on the site, completed in 1996.    Institute for the Study of the Ancient World, New York University    In 2004, the Stephen Wise Congress House was acquired by the Leon Levy Foundation as the future home of the Institute for the Study of the Ancient World. To rehabilitate the building, the Foundation hired Selldorf Architects, a highly respected architecture and design firm, led by Annabelle Selldorf, whose renovation work includes the transformation of a 1914 mansion located at East 86th Street and Fifth Avenue into the Neue Galerie, a museum for German and Austrian art. Selldorf\u2019s design provides space for the graduate research and Ph.D. degree-granting center and for an extensive program of colloquia, lectures, and exhibitions that will be open to the public. Respectful of the historic fabric of the building, Selldorf Architects restored original details when possible. The wood paneled library on the second floor was restored and is now being used as a common room and sometime lecture hall. The main staircase was extended to the sixth floor.\u00a0A modern library was designed for the Institute's extensive collection of books and archives about the ancient world. Constructed primarily of steel and glass, and located in a three-story atrium in the north part of the building, the library offers naturally lit study spaces for scholars and provides access to open stacks.    -- Researched and written by Elizabeth McEnaney       Bibliography    \"A.
