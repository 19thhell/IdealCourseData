Most of what we    do, think and feel depends on our understanding of what it means to be    male or female, and on the different expectations people have for men and    women. Every aspect of the institutions, opportunities, and ideas    around us are permeated by gender differences. Our goal is to make    sense of this. Some of the questions we address are:             What do we mean by gender inequality? How does it arise?     Why does it take different forms? Why do some societies have    greater equality than others? How do the various institutions    like the family, the economy and religion affect the social position of    women and men? How do the direct relations between women and    men--as friends, brother and sister, lovers, spouses, parent and child,    colleagues, boss and employee--depend on or affect the social positions    of women and men? Why and when does sex inequality change?             On completing the course, students will know how to assess the major    social and intellectual questions raised by the issue of sex inequality.    Through intensive reading and discussion, this course will give    students the intellectual tools needed to understand and talk about sex    inequality knowledgeably and perceptively. This course also    promotes the growth of general skills in theoretical criticism and social    analysis.         Requirements:         All students must attend class consistently and punctually, join in    class discussion, write brief papers, prepare a \"gender social biography\"    term paper, take quizzes, and take a final exam.         All students should take part in class discussion and those who do an    outstanding job will receive extra credit.         Each student will write a \"gender social biography\" for a term paper.    This paper will try to show how your identity and experiences have    been shaped in conformity with gender expectations and how they have    defied or ignored them. The paper will take into account the various    kinds of social influences and experiences studied in this class.    During the semester, students will write brief gender biography    \"chapters\" for each section of the course, relating the subject of that    section to their gender biography. These will then be incorporated and    revised into the final term paper. Details about the gender social    biography are on another page .    No late papers will be accepted under any conditions.         A final examination will take place in class and cover all of the    course material. This examination will focus on the main ideas of    the materials we read and discuss in class.         Expectations:         A class is a collective learning enterprise. We must all act    responsibly and with decorum or the enterprise fails. We must each try to    avoid making the class less pleasant for others. This means we come    to class on time, pay attention, and avoid disruptive actions such as    talking to those in adjoining seats, eating noisily, and the like.     We will have a lot of discussion, some among all in class, some in    groups. Everyone is always free to disagree with other people's    ideas, but we should all treat everyone else and their ideas    respectfully. Plagiarism or academic dishonesty of any kind will    not be tolerated.

Study Questions                   What do people commonly mean by the distinction between     \u201cgender\u201d and \u201csex?\u201d          Why do people studying gender inequality stress a     distinction between \u201cgender inequality\u201d and \u201cgender     differences?\u201d          While making sense of gender inequality, why do we need to     keep in mind other forms of inequality within a society?          What is the difference between status inequality and     positional inequality?          Why do some authors suggest that the rise of women\u2019s status     over the past two centuries might be considered a paradox while     others suggest that the persistence of gender inequality in recent     decades might be viewed as a paradox?          In what ways has gender inequality declined over the past     150 years?          What are principal ways that gender inequality persists in     the U.S. and similar \u201cmodern\u201d nations according to our sources?          What does Jackson mean when he says that \u201ctwo kinds of     social conflict fueled the decline of gender     inequality\u201d?          What do we mean when we say women and men are     unequal?          What do we mean by saying that women and men have competing     ideologies or myths about gender?          What is the difference between distributional differences     and categorical differences when we are comparing the characteristics     of two groups?          What is problematic about the common cultural explanations     of \u201cdeceptive distinctions\u201d between women and men?          How does \u201cframing\u201d work in Ridgeway\u2019s     analysis?                             II. How is gender inequality symbolized and reproduced in    everyday life?

How does gender inequality in modern society influence the power     most men feel they have?          What do people mean when they say institutions are gendered?          Why might some argue that Freud\u2019s theory attributed key gender     differences to biology while others argue that it did not?          How is it possible that gender identity (whether we are male or     female and what it means to be either) is learned (not inherent or     biological), but that we experience it as natural and     unchangeable?          What did Gilligan claim about the relationship between gender and     ethics, and why has the claim been controversial?          How would you explain the term \u201csex roles?\u201d          How does Dozier\u2019s study raise questions about standard ways of     distinguishing \u201csex\u201d from \u201cgender\u201d or claims that gender is socially     constructed by people \u201cdoing gender\u201d in interactions?          What is the \u201cgender similarities hypothesis\u201d and how do research     findings support or not support it?          According to Ridgeway, how are gender stereotypes related to a     general problem of coordinating social interactions? (And can     you identify any serious problems with Ridgeway's argument about this     proposed relationship? This part is very high difficulty.)          How, according to Ridgeway might the existence of framing lead to     social inequality?          According to Ridgeway what is the difference between specific     status beliefs and diffuse status beliefs?                             III.

How has the popularity of     biological explanations varied across historical periods and     cultures?          How is the work of evolutionary psychologists relevant to     the study of gender inequality, and what limits the value of its     contribution?          What seems to be the historical pattern of motives behind     brain research and hormonal research concerned with gender (and     sexuality) differences, and the results they find?          What was the influential argument that Margaret Mead     presented in 1935 book Sex and Temperament in Three Primitive     Societies?          Why are those who study gender inequality so concerned with     the division of labor?          When comparing across societies, what are some of the     conditions that seem to correlate with or indicate high levels of     gender inequality?          What do we know about the relationship between testosterone     levels and violent behavior?          According to Herdt, what is the significance of \u201ccoming     out\u201d rituals?          How does it make sense to think about the role of biology     in the origins of gender inequality?

Study Questions                   Summarize important changes in women\u2019s economic     participation over the past 150 years. Among other things, it is     useful to consider differences by period, by type of women, and by     type of job.          How does the movement of women into traditionally male jobs     compare to the movement of men into traditionally female jobs?          How does employment potentially serve as a source of pride,     obligation, resources, negative identity for men and for women?      The goal here is to think through the reasons that women and men seek     and hold jobs and the effects that having (or not having) those jobs     have upon them.          What contributes to the wage/income differential between     women and men?          Explain the \u201cglass ceiling.\u201d          How did goverment policies, laws, and actions influence     women's changing employment in the twentieth century?          According to Ridgeway, how have framing processes     influenced the jobs into which women are hired, women\u2019s promotions,     and women\u2019s wages/salaries?          Why is the analysis of \u201ctokenism\u201d important for     understanding changes in women\u2019s economic participation?          What seem to be the causes and the effects of sexual     harassment?          How can we explain how women\u2019s economic participation has     changed over the long term? Consider the motives and the     actions of women, ordinary men, and powerful men. Also consider     the difference between women\u2019s movement into low-status jobs and     their movement into high-status jobs.          According to Reskin, what causes women\u2019s wages or income to     be lower than that of men, and how does that argument relate to the     ideas present in other readings this week?          How have different kinds of discrimination influenced     women\u2019s experiences in the economy?                             IX. Political processes and individual action.

Why do we want to distinguish between ordinary and powerful men while explaining the     persistence and decline of gender inequality?          Responding to changing circumstances, women and men sometimes      adopted new strategies or changed their typical behavior in ways      that contributed to gender inequality\u2019s decline over time.      However, even as they contributed to gender inequality's decline,      they typically did not seek to reduce gender inequality, commonly      did not favor a change in gender expectations, and often did not      even recognize that their actions could or would affect gender      inequality. So, how do we explain this pattern?          Why has men\u2019s defense of gender inequality declined over the past     150 years?          How have the goals of feminist movements been compatible      with (the effects and requirements of) long-term structural      changes in the U.S. and other modern societies? And in what      ways have their goals been in conflict with that long-term      trajectory          Assess the reasoning behind these two claims: \u201cmen have probably     sustained their gender advantages more through competition with other     men than through efforts to keep women from enjoying similar     opportunities or status\u201d; \u201cmen resisting women\u2019s advance      [typically] understood themselves to be fulfilling their      obligations or protecting well-earned rights\u201d.          How did both ordinary men\u2019s interests in opposing improvements in     women\u2019s status and their capacity to do so change over     time?           Writers have suggested that men long opposed women\u2019s movement     into high-status jobs (and women\u2019s access to higher education that     would prepare them for such jobs) because adding women would increase the     competition men would face for promotions and the like. Why is this a     strong or weak argument?          Why are culturally derived beliefs and rational calculations both     important for understanding changes over time in men\u2019s typical     actions that affected gender inequality? (Note that the same question     can be asked about women\u2019s typical actions.)          If most men in positions of organizational power share a     discriminatory attitude towards women, why do we expect any men with     similar organizational power who do not share these discriminatory     biases still to act (in their jobs) largely like their discriminatory     colleagues? (Note this question relates to the general problem of why     people conform, but in this question focuses on the causes specific     to the context of organizational power.)          What do analysts mean by the \u201cmale rebellion\u201d against marriage in     the second half of the twentieth century, and why might it have     occurred?           Why did men in government think differently about the woman     suffrage issue than ordinary male voters? How does this compare     to differences between the ways that employers\u2019 thought about hiring     women and the ways that male workers thought about it?          How do we explain women\u2019s difficulties at achieving economic     power through entrepreneurial success, rising through organizational     ranks, or inheriting wealth?          How do we explain women\u2019s difficulties at achieving political     power, both as individuals and collectively?          How have feminist efforts contributed to the reduction in gender     inequality, and how have those efforts fallen short?                             X.

Cancian                       Study Questions                   What do we mean by institutional     individualism?           How does the impact on family organization made by the rise     of modern education compare to the impact of the rise of modern     industry?           What are the highlights of women\u2019s changing educational     opportunities in the U.S. over the past 150 years?          With respect to the U.S. experience, in what ways is it     likely that the education offered to women and men (at various     levels) influenced gender inequality over the past 150     years?          What were the major influences responsible for the rise of     meritocratic ideas and their increasing     influence?           Why does Ridgeway stress it is important not only that we     hold stereotypical beliefs about gender, but that we can take it for     granted that others hold them as well?          According to Ridgeway, what are the most basic, shared     beliefs about differences between women and men in our culture (we     are concerned with the content of the beliefs, not the     terminology)?          What, according to Ridgeway, decides which gender     stereotypes are embodied in popular beliefs about the differences     between women and men?          Why do people who privately hold \"alternative\" gender     beliefs seemingly still commonly act on the basis of the dominant     beliefs, particularly in their \u201cpublic\u201d     lives?           Why did the ideologies of female domesticity change over     time?          If men did not impose the content of the successive     ideologies of female domesticity, what     did?           What common characteristics of the otherwise diverse ideals     of female domesticity made them seem to work for both women and men     and for the acceptability of gender inequality to     both?          With respect to the determination of dominant ideologies,     what is the relevant common underlying idea in the Marxist concept of     \u201cdetermination within limits\u201d, the Weberian idea of \u201celective     affinity\u201d, and Merton\u2019s concept of \u201cfunctional     alternatives?\u201d          What does Cancian mean when she says, \u201cPart of the reason     that men seem so much less loving than women is that their behavior     is measured with a feminine ruler\u201d?

Most of what we    do, think and feel depends on our understanding of what it means to be    male or female, and on the different expectations people have for men and    women. Every aspect of the institutions, opportunities, and ideas    around us are permeated by gender differences. Our goal is to make    sense of this. Some of the questions we address are:             What do we mean by gender inequality? How does it arise?     Why does it take different forms? Why do some societies have    greater equality than others? How do the various institutions    like the family, the economy and religion affect the social position of    women and men? How do the direct relations between women and    men--as friends, brother and sister, lovers, spouses, parent and child,    colleagues, boss and employee--depend on or affect the social positions    of women and men? Why and when does sex inequality change?             On completing the course, students will know how to assess the major    social and intellectual questions raised by the issue of sex inequality.    Through intensive reading and discussion, this course will give    students the intellectual tools needed to understand and talk about sex    inequality knowledgeably and perceptively. This course also    promotes the growth of general skills in theoretical criticism and social    analysis.         Requirements:         All students must attend class consistently and punctually, join in    class discussion, write brief papers, prepare a \"gender social biography\"    term paper, take quizzes, and take a final exam.         All students should take part in class discussion and those who do an    outstanding job will receive extra credit.         Each student will write a \"gender social biography\" for a term paper.    This paper will try to show how your identity and experiences have    been shaped in conformity with gender expectations and how they have    defied or ignored them. The paper will take into account the various    kinds of social influences and experiences studied in this class.    During the semester, students will write brief gender biography    \"chapters\" for each section of the course, relating the subject of that    section to their gender biography. These will then be incorporated and    revised into the final term paper. Details about the gender social    biography are on another page .    No late papers will be accepted under any conditions.         A final examination will take place in class and cover all of the    course material. This examination will focus on the main ideas of    the materials we read and discuss in class.         Expectations:         A class is a collective learning enterprise. We must all act    responsibly and with decorum or the enterprise fails. We must each try to    avoid making the class less pleasant for others. This means we come    to class on time, pay attention, and avoid disruptive actions such as    talking to those in adjoining seats, eating noisily, and the like.     We will have a lot of discussion, some among all in class, some in    groups. Everyone is always free to disagree with other people's    ideas, but we should all treat everyone else and their ideas    respectfully. Plagiarism or academic dishonesty of any kind will    not be tolerated.

How does gender inequality in modern society influence the power     most men feel they have?          What do people mean when they say institutions are gendered?          Why might some argue that Freud\u2019s theory attributed key gender     differences to biology while others argue that it did not?          How is it possible that gender identity (whether we are male or     female and what it means to be either) is learned (not inherent or     biological), but that we experience it as natural and     unchangeable?

What is the \u201cgender similarities hypothesis\u201d and how do research     findings support or not support it?          According to Ridgeway, how are gender stereotypes related to a     general problem of coordinating social interactions? (And can     you identify any serious problems with Ridgeway's argument about this     proposed relationship? This part is very high difficulty.)          How, according to Ridgeway might the existence of framing lead to     social inequality?

Study Questions                   Summarize important changes in women\u2019s economic     participation over the past 150 years. Among other things, it is     useful to consider differences by period, by type of women, and by     type of job.          How does the movement of women into traditionally male jobs     compare to the movement of men into traditionally female jobs?          How does employment potentially serve as a source of pride,     obligation, resources, negative identity for men and for women?      The goal here is to think through the reasons that women and men seek     and hold jobs and the effects that having (or not having) those jobs     have upon them.          What contributes to the wage/income differential between     women and men?          Explain the \u201cglass ceiling.\u201d          How did goverment policies, laws, and actions influence     women's changing employment in the twentieth century?          According to Ridgeway, how have framing processes     influenced the jobs into which women are hired, women\u2019s promotions,     and women\u2019s wages/salaries?          Why is the analysis of \u201ctokenism\u201d important for     understanding changes in women\u2019s economic participation?          What seem to be the causes and the effects of sexual     harassment?          How can we explain how women\u2019s economic participation has     changed over the long term? Consider the motives and the     actions of women, ordinary men, and powerful men. Also consider     the difference between women\u2019s movement into low-status jobs and     their movement into high-status jobs.          According to Reskin, what causes women\u2019s wages or income to     be lower than that of men, and how does that argument relate to the     ideas present in other readings this week?          How have different kinds of discrimination influenced     women\u2019s experiences in the economy?                             IX. Political processes and individual action.

Why do we want to distinguish between ordinary and powerful men while explaining the     persistence and decline of gender inequality?          Responding to changing circumstances, women and men sometimes      adopted new strategies or changed their typical behavior in ways      that contributed to gender inequality\u2019s decline over time.      However, even as they contributed to gender inequality's decline,      they typically did not seek to reduce gender inequality, commonly      did not favor a change in gender expectations, and often did not      even recognize that their actions could or would affect gender      inequality. So, how do we explain this pattern?          Why has men\u2019s defense of gender inequality declined over the past     150 years?          How have the goals of feminist movements been compatible      with (the effects and requirements of) long-term structural      changes in the U.S. and other modern societies? And in what      ways have their goals been in conflict with that long-term      trajectory          Assess the reasoning behind these two claims: \u201cmen have probably     sustained their gender advantages more through competition with other     men than through efforts to keep women from enjoying similar     opportunities or status\u201d; \u201cmen resisting women\u2019s advance      [typically] understood themselves to be fulfilling their      obligations or protecting well-earned rights\u201d.          How did both ordinary men\u2019s interests in opposing improvements in     women\u2019s status and their capacity to do so change over     time?           Writers have suggested that men long opposed women\u2019s movement     into high-status jobs (and women\u2019s access to higher education that     would prepare them for such jobs) because adding women would increase the     competition men would face for promotions and the like. Why is this a     strong or weak argument?          Why are culturally derived beliefs and rational calculations both     important for understanding changes over time in men\u2019s typical     actions that affected gender inequality? (Note that the same question     can be asked about women\u2019s typical actions.)          If most men in positions of organizational power share a     discriminatory attitude towards women, why do we expect any men with     similar organizational power who do not share these discriminatory     biases still to act (in their jobs) largely like their discriminatory     colleagues? (Note this question relates to the general problem of why     people conform, but in this question focuses on the causes specific     to the context of organizational power.)          What do analysts mean by the \u201cmale rebellion\u201d against marriage in     the second half of the twentieth century, and why might it have     occurred?           Why did men in government think differently about the woman     suffrage issue than ordinary male voters? How does this compare     to differences between the ways that employers\u2019 thought about hiring     women and the ways that male workers thought about it?          How do we explain women\u2019s difficulties at achieving economic     power through entrepreneurial success, rising through organizational     ranks, or inheriting wealth?          How do we explain women\u2019s difficulties at achieving political     power, both as individuals and collectively?          How have feminist efforts contributed to the reduction in gender     inequality, and how have those efforts fallen short?                             X.

How does the impact on family organization made by the rise     of modern education compare to the impact of the rise of modern     industry?           What are the highlights of women\u2019s changing educational     opportunities in the U.S. over the past 150 years?          With respect to the U.S. experience, in what ways is it     likely that the education offered to women and men (at various     levels) influenced gender inequality over the past 150     years?          What were the major influences responsible for the rise of     meritocratic ideas and their increasing     influence?           Why does Ridgeway stress it is important not only that we     hold stereotypical beliefs about gender, but that we can take it for     granted that others hold them as well?          According to Ridgeway, what are the most basic, shared     beliefs about differences between women and men in our culture (we     are concerned with the content of the beliefs, not the     terminology)?          What, according to Ridgeway, decides which gender     stereotypes are embodied in popular beliefs about the differences     between women and men?          Why do people who privately hold \"alternative\" gender     beliefs seemingly still commonly act on the basis of the dominant     beliefs, particularly in their \u201cpublic\u201d     lives?           Why did the ideologies of female domesticity change over     time?          If men did not impose the content of the successive     ideologies of female domesticity, what     did?           What common characteristics of the otherwise diverse ideals     of female domesticity made them seem to work for both women and men     and for the acceptability of gender inequality to     both?          With respect to the determination of dominant ideologies,     what is the relevant common underlying idea in the Marxist concept of     \u201cdetermination within limits\u201d, the Weberian idea of \u201celective     affinity\u201d, and Merton\u2019s concept of \u201cfunctional     alternatives?\u201d          What does Cancian mean when she says, \u201cPart of the reason     that men seem so much less loving than women is that their behavior     is measured with a feminine ruler\u201d?

According to Ridgeway, what are the key conditions that are     obstructing, and could even reverse, the shifts toward gender     equality?          According to Ridgeway, why do gender stereotypes survive     disconfirming evidence?          How does Ridgeway use the idea of \"cultural lag?\"          According to Jackson, what are the principal causes of gender     inequality's decline?          According to Jackson, what are the main components of arguments     that the movement toward gender inequality is severely     threatened?          What, according to Jackson, are the principal defects in     arguments contending that our movement toward greater gender equality     may be stopped or even turned back?          How have interests affecting gender inequality changed over time     for important categories of men, women, and organizations? Are there     important relevant interests that have not changed much?          With respect to actions relevant to gender inequality, compare     how women's behaviors and life cycle patterns have changed with     analogous changes in men's lives."}, {"content": "%PDF-1.4 %  75

                        http://www.nyu.edu/classes/jackson/causes.of.gender.inequality                                      In this course we will     investigate what causes inequality between women and     men . How does it arise, why      does it take different forms, why does it vary in     degree across societies, what are the components     that add up to gender inequality, how do various     institutions and practices contribute to it, and how      does it change? The course will emphasize the history of gender     inequality in the United States.     While we focus on gender     inequality, we will also    seek to understand social causation more generally. We will explore    the diverse ways social causation works and how we can identify the causes    behind important social phenomena.

Table of Contents                              Description \u2013 Scope, Organization, and Access:      The Scope of the Topics and Materials.      We know a lot about gender inequality \u2013 its history, how people     experience it in their lives, the ways it varies in intensity and form     across time and place, the beliefs that make it seem natural, and much     more. The outpouring of research and commentary on gender     inequality over the past half century has been extraordinary.      Unfortunately, despite all this, our understanding of what causes     gender inequality remains troubled. Both ordinary people and experts     (such as scholars) commonly fluctuate between simplistic explanations     that founder under close scrutiny and throwing up their hands in     frustration over what can seem an enigma beyond human     comprehension. Here we will seek to surmount this dilemma.      We will explore diverse facets of gender inequality and varied ideas     about what causes might be decisive. We will also look carefully     at the ways we can identify and verify the causes of social     phenomena. Through these efforts we will aim both to enhance our     understanding of what produces gender inequality and to improve our     general ability to do causal social analyses effectively.      The class     organization and goals. In this class, each week's work will     be organized around an analytical task, as well as a set of     readings. Rather than focusing on discussion of the readings,     the analytical tasks involve attempting a causal analysis of some     aspect of gender inequality related to the week's issue, building on     the materials we read (in brief papers of a couple pages). The     approach in this class seeks to develop analytical skills as well as     understandings of the relevant literature by stressing doing actual     analyses of gender inequality. (Note: this class does not have an exam     nor a final paper.)      All class meetings are organized as discussions. Part of our     class discussions will be on the common readings and part on students'     efforts to explore the analytical tasks each week. We will     adjust the time devoted to these two goals according to our     experiences over the class. Every week, students will initiate     discussions on readings and papers. To make this work, each week's     papers will be exchanged (electronically) with enough lead time that     we can all read all the papers prior to the class meetings.      Each topic below includes \u2013 beside the common readings \u2013     three other subsections. These are: an analytical task ,     recommended readings , and related readings . The analytical task is the writing     assignment for the week. Everyone should read the common     readings while doing the analytical task (and be prepared to     discuss them). In each of these papers \u2013 always brief      papers \u2013 students will try out causal ideas related to the week's     topic. Recommended and     related readings are optional      materials useful for those who want to dig deeper into a topic.      To simplify navigating through the syllabus, these subsections are     hidden until the viewer clicks on the subsection heading, then they     will appear.      Most of our readings will be articles available for downloading.      The links will appear in the online version of the course     syllabus. Excerpts from Down So Long . . .: The Puzzling     Persistence of Gender Inequality (book manuscript by RMJ not yet     published) will similarly be available for downloading from the class web     site. (As we will read selections from Jackson's book Destined     for Equality [Harvard U Press] throughout the course, you might     want to buy it or borrow it.)      Any student unfamiliar with the study of gender, can (and probably     should) pick up the basics from a standard textbook in the area \u2013 I     recommend Michael Kimmel's Gendered Society (which I use in my     basic general undergraduate class on gender, so used copies should be     easy to find).      For further relevant sources, my reading lists/syllabi for two     graduate courses might be valuable. The one most directly     related is      What Causes Gender Inequality:     Analytical Foundations ; a more general class,           What Causes Inequality: Analytical     Foundations , may provide materials for broader     questions about different kinds of inequalities and how to think about     gender inequality in relationship to them.       A note      on the \"hidden\" material below : Each section of     this guide includes \u2013 beside the common readings \u2013 three     subsections, one for an analytical task , one for recommended     readings , and one for related readings . To     simplify navigating through the course guide, only the headings for     these subsections are initially visible. The contents of all     these subsections are hidden (so that the beginning appearance of the     page is similar to a standard syllabus) until the viewer clicks on a     subsection heading, then its contents will appear. While this     organization is helpful for negotiating the page most of the time, it     can become an obstacle if we want to search the page (for example, for     a particular article) as searches will ignore the hidden material     (that is, if you search a page you are viewing in an internet browser,     the search will only examine what is shown on the page at that time).      To overcome this limitation, you can \"open\" all the hidden sections to     show everything on the page by clicking the \u00a7 symbol at the top of the     page. (To restore the page to the normal condensed view, simply     reload the page which will collapse all the \"hidden\" sections to their     usual look). The table of contents at the top of this page will     aid speedy navigation to any topic, which is particularly helpful if     you reveal all the \"hidden\" material.                              The Topics                I. Introduction. What    do we mean by gender inequality?     To analyze the causes of gender     inequality, we need to know what we mean by gender     inequality. How can we conceive of and talk about     gender inequality in ways that are general enough to apply across the     range of relevant phenomena, consistent enough to minimize conceptual     ambiguities, and precise enough to be analytically effective?      Gender inequality has been extraordinarily diverse and wide     spread. Women and men are unequal in every conceivable way in     endless circumstances, both immediate and enduring, by both objective     criteria and subjective experience. So, what counts as gender     inequality? Can we characterize it in ways that let us confidently and     impartially assess when there is more or less of it?          Analytical     Task                 No task for the introductory meeting.

II. Causality - What are causes,    mechanisms, and the like?     We casually refer to causes and effects in normal   interactions all the time. We all conduct our lives \u2013 choosing actions,   making decisions, trying to influence others \u2013 based on theories about why   and how things happen in the world. From the early stages of childhood   we attribute causes, building a vision of the social (and physical) world   that makes it understandable. Every action, every choice about what to   do, is based on our anticipation of its effects, our understandings of   consequences. Analytical and scientific reasoning has a similar form,   but requires that we approach causation more systematically and   self-consciously.          Analytical     Task                 The general      analytical problem . In this and other societies,      women and men commonly dress differently. Prepare a      causal analysis that seeks to explain why women and men dress      differently .              Our analytical task this week is to attempt a \"simple\"       causal analysis of a gender difference that is obvious but not       often questioned - the way we dress. The purpose of this       exercise is to get us thinking about causality.        To the degree that we can, we want to try to think of       different kinds of causes based on varied ways of framing the       causal question. Realistically, one could easily write a       book about all the possible ways of interpreting this causal       question and answering it. We are just trying to develop       some sensible insights in a couple pages.                   Thinking Tools .       The starting point of most causal analyses is a comparison.       When we start with the general question \"what causes X?\" we turn      it into possible comparisons to produce an answer. Examples      of such questions might be \"why do people in group A do X more      than those in group B?,\" \"why does X occur more often in summer      than winter?,\" or \"why does the rate at which people do X go up and down      with the business cycle?\" The underlying idea is simple but      powerful. If we are trying to explain some phenomenon, X,      then we need to identify variations in the likelihood of X or the      rate of X, and look for potential causes that (1) vary across the      relevant circumstances in a way that could explain X and (2) that      we can connect to the outcomes for X in some way. For      example, with the gender distinctive clothing question, some ways      to better specify the question and look at it through comparisons      are:              What causes individual       conformity to the cultural pattern? What       induces women and men to conform to the expectations for       dressing differently? Whenever we observe a consistent       pattern of social behavior, some common conditions or       processes must be inducing people to act in a similar       way. Figuring out what encourages conformity and       discourages deviance allows us to provide a causal       explanation. Think about what happens to people who do       not conform to the expectations about male and female       appropriate clothing. And, just as important, ask why it       is that people punish nonconformists. Here the basic       comparison is between people who conform and those who do not,       or between the reactions of people to conformity and       nonconformity.        What causes differences       in dress \"codes\" across cultures? What circumstances       could exist across societies that consistently produce gender       differences in modes of dress? The clothing       characteristic of each sex varies greatly across societies       (and time). Clothing differs between \"primitive\"       cultures and modern ones, between warm and cold climates, and       between different parts of the world. But seemingly       everywhere men and women dress differently. How can we       explain this pattern? Here the primary comparison is       between cultures that have different clothing.        Why do the expectations       about clothing differences vary by context ? Why       are gender differences in dress greater in some circumstances       than in others? For example, both women and men may wear       similar coveralls in a factory, but women and men generally       wear dramatically different clothing to formal dances.        Our efforts to find causes behind any phenomena are improved       by looking at variations. If male and female clothing is       just a little different in some contexts but greatly different       in others, we can usefully focus on what might produce this       variance in gender differences. Here the primary       comparison is between contexts with greater differences in the       expected clothing and contexts with lesser differences.                   Thinking Tools 2 .       While considering how to explain the differences in the ways      women and men dress, it can also be helpful to think through       ways that this pattern could be considered an example of a       larger pattern. The explanation for the broader pattern       may be different or easier to develop. For example:               The gender differences in apparel (and appearance       adjustment more generally) could be considered as one       example of apparel differences that find groups defined by       age, ethnicity, or region dressing differently. That       is to say, it is not only women and men who consistently       dress differently. Different ways of dressing also       distinguish other groups. If we think about those       other groups, does it give us insights into explaining the       difference between women's and men's clothing?        The gender differences in dress could be considered as one       example of a wider range of behavioral differences between       women and men such as rules of proper decorum, speech       patterns, or displays of sexuality. That is, we can       point to other presentational differences between women and       men. If we think about the range of these       presentational differences, do they suggest ideas that might       help explain differences in apparel?

How is gender inequality    symbolized and reproduced in everyday life?     To start our investigation of the causes of gender   inequality, we will consider how people experience and act out gender in   their day to day lives. We want to think about the most basic   questions. Why and when do women and men act differently? Why   and when do people respond differently to women than men? How do all   these private individual actions when taken together over time influence the   understanding of gender in a culture and gender inequality?          Analytical     Task                  The general       analytical problem . Using a typical setting       where women and men meet, assess how Ridgeway's framing       approach helps explain the role of gender in these       interactions and where it might fall short.               For this task, we choose some familiar (to us) setting        or type of interaction where women and men typically        engage each other. For example, this could be a        workplace, a bar, interactions between buyers and sellers,        or parties. We use this as our source of empirical        data and focus our argument on explaining gender        interactions there.         First, we need to read Ridgeway's argument        carefully. Then we try to apply her argument to the        setting we have chosen.         We want to assess how much we believe people's actions (in        the context we chose) fit the expectations we can derive        from her argument and when they might not. As we        work on our analyses, we are evaluating Ridgeway's        approach as a tool. The right tool allows us to construct        a better edifice with less effort; the wrong tool does        not.                      Thinking tools .       The remaining notes for this analytical task look at some       analytical steps that allow us to think through this problem       effectively.               Systematic steps in        the analysis . Doing this kind of thought        experiment, we want our thinking to be as systematic as        possible. For all systematic causal analyses, we        want to consider how the phenomenon being examined varies        in regular or predictable ways across conditions,        settings, types of people, places, or the like. Then, we        ask what conditions or events typically precede or occur        along with the outcomes that could plausibly influence        those outcomes.                 For example, first, we simply consider possible         differences between men's and women's actions.          Then we consider how their actions might differ         between opposite-sex and same-sex encounters.          We can broaden the range of the examples we use to         think about these differences by considering other         characteristics that might affect interactions, such         as the age or race of the people, whether the         interaction is cordial or unfriendly, how well the         people know each other, and so on.          We want to ask ourselves if the gender aspect of the         interaction will be influenced by these other         circumstances that seem relevant to interactions. For         example, does gender influence cordial interactions         differently from the ways it influences confrontations         in our setting? If we believe the answer         is yes, then we consider how and why.          Analogously, we want to think about the ways that         people's goals in gendered interactions vary in these         kinds of circumstances, and how these goals influence         their actions. For example, in the same setting,         a person seeking sex will commonly act differently         than someone trying to curry favor or sell a product.                  When we apply a systematic logic to the analysis, we         usually do not want to write about all the         possibilities we think about. Instead, we use         the ones that we find telling. But we will not         identify those telling possibilities unless we         systematically work through all the relevant possible         influences.                         Gender context .        We can take the analysis of interactions another step by        considering how the influence of gender on these        interactions is potentially affected by conditions like:                 the presence or absence of onlookers (i.e., the         relative privacy of the interaction) or          the gender distribution of other people present         (i.e., mostly male, mostly female, or mixed)                         Conformity .         Whenever we try to explain patterns like this, we want to        consider the exceptions. When will people violate        the implications of gender expectations and what follows        when they do? Are there circumstances that make it        more likely people will depart from conventional        behavior? Violations of norms or common expectations        are valuable for causal analyses because cracks in the        veneer of social order can reveal its structure and        dynamics.                      Bring it       together . After working through the steps       above, we try to assess when Ridgeway's approach does a good       job explaining how gender influences behavior in our chosen       setting, and when her approach seems to fall short. Do       we see ways that her approach neglects or misunderstands       important causes influencing the gender character of behavior       in the context we examine? Our central goal here is to       explain how and why gender organizes interactions in our       chosen example. We are not attempting a general evaluation of       Ridgeway's ideas, but a focused assessment of their       effectiveness in the setting we have selected to try them out.

And how does    explaining the \"origins\" of gender inequality relate to explaining the    \"persistence\" of gender inequality?     Although some scholars may question if    women have been subordinate in all societies, all agree that men have been   dominant in most societies although the degree of dominance varies   greatly. This raises the very tricky question, how do we explain the   prevalence of male dominance? This exceedingly elusive question   continues to elude any answer that will evoke a consensus.          Analytical     Task                  Analytical Task       Alternative 1: An analytical critique . As most       of us lack the substantive knowledge needed to develop even       simple analyses of gender inequality's possible origins, we       will explore the causal possibilities by responding to the       arguments of people who are knowledgeable.               Please read the \" Basics of Causal        Descriptions \" on a separate page for some simple,        beginning ideas about describing a causal analysis.         Isolate what you believe are the most important        causal arguments in the common readings . Give        a critical assessment of their different approaches .         In doing this, try to pay attention to what it is that        makes you find the causal arguments more or less        persuasive. The recommended and related readings        provide a range of material that you can look at as you        need to deepen and sharpen your arguments.                       It can be helpful to look back at the material from        Topic II, especially Gerring's list of criteria for causal        arguments.                      Analytical Task       Alternative 2: A hypothetical scenario . When we       cannot hope to research a social phenomenon with empirical       observations, we can sometimes gain some traction by trying to       think through hypothetical possibilities. Here is an       example.               Assume that sometime in the near future we launch a        rocket into space with a crew of 1,000. This crew is        evenly divided between women and men, the women and men        have similar credentials and accomplishments, and the two        sexes are about equally represented at each level of        authority. The crew members' cultural understandings        are similar to those of college students today.         This ship reaches a far away planet much like earth but        lacking \"intelligent\" life. Unfortunately, the        ship's engines have become unstable and the crew must        abandon it. So they must start life on this new        planet. While they possess much advanced knowledge,        they have no technology. They must start from        scratch, producing food, organizing themselves into a        community, pairing off to reproduce, slowly building        toward some kind of technological development over        generations. [Note: If the distant planet scenario        seems unnerving, we could have the same effect by dropping        a 1,000 people on a remote island that is isolated as a        social experiment.]         Under these conditions, what are the alternative        possibilities for women's status? What might decide        which alternative occurs?

What determines men's and    women's roles and positions within families?     Family and kinship are potentially relevant to gender   inequality in varied ways and a lot of work had pursued such issues.    Probably the two most important general issues involve the ways that women   and men are unequal within families and the ways that family organization   both contributes to and is influenced by gender inequality beyond the family   institution. We will just touch the surface of these issues this week.          Analytical     Task                  The general       analytical problem . We want to provide an       integrated analytical overview of the principal causal       arguments about gender inequality and family organization that       appear in the common readings.        Each of the readings has various causal arguments about       family organization, some directly about gender inequality,       some relevant to gender inequality but not directly exploring       it. Some of the causal questions may receive different       causal analyses by these authors. Sometimes two or more       authors may use a similar causal approach to explain different       causal problems. Our goal is to sort this out.        Our overviews should be organized around the causal       arguments, not        a series of summaries of what each author wrote (see Thinking       Tools).        Thinking tools .               We want to use one of the following two possible ways to        organize the causal assessment (unless one of us has a        better way). The first organizes around what is to        be explained, the second around the causes.                 First approach .          We start by identifying the principal causal problems         addressed by the group of papers. That is, we         figure out what they suggest needs to be         explained. Then, we organize these causal         problems in a sensible order (including consideration         of some problems potentially being secondary or         sub-problems of others). Under each causal         problem, we summarize and assess all the relevant         explanations found in the readings.          Second approach .          We start by identifying the principal causal         frameworks used in the papers. That is, we         figure out what they suggest are the conditions or         processes that have the most important influence over         the outcomes. Then, we organize these causal         frameworks in a sensible order, taking into account         which are entirely different and which might be         variations of a similar theme, and which are competing         versus complementary. For each of these, after         summarizing the causal logic of the framework, we show         how it has been used by these authors, describing the         range of outcomes the framework is supposed to         determine and how it has such effects.          Note that         regardless which way we organize our analysis of         competing causal arguments, it can be valuable to         think about not only what is          considered by the authors being examine, but also         which theoretical questions and which causal         frameworks seem relevant but absent.                         Please reread the \" Basics of Causal        Descriptions \" on the starting point for describing a        causal analysis.                      Bringing it       together . In short, our aim is to produce a       critical overview of the principal causal arguments concerning       the family and gender inequality, starting with the ideas       present in the common readings for this week. To do this       effectively, we need to identify all the relevant causal       arguments, deduce the logical structure of each causal       argument and determine how to present that clearly (even if       the original source is inconsistent or ambiguous), detect how       the causal arguments (from different sources) relate to each       other and present them in a way that makes those relations       clear, and, where possible, summarize the important analytical       strengths and weaknesses of each argument (or facet to an       argument).       (We should start with the understanding that this kind of       analytical overview is rather easy to do poorly and very       demanding to do well and thoroughly. At this stage we       are not aspiring to a professional job but hoping to achieve       a reasonable, if basic, analysis.)                             Common Readings           Andrew J.

What is the role of    sexuality?     Sexuality has been evoked in     multiple ways in the study of gender inequality. Some have     considered it as a possible motivating cause for inequality, others have     explored how gender inequality can mold the experience and practice of     sexuality, and others have tried to theoretically incorporate     sexuality as a peculiar tension between women and men that mediates     both the causes and effects of gender inequality. Essentially,     everyone recognizes sexuality is critically important to gender     inequality, but we lack agreement or clarity on how it matters.          Analytical     Task                 The general analytical      problem . Our central task this week is to propose a      causal account that plausibly explains the relationship between one      aspect of sexuality and gender inequality.              Everyone who analyzes gender inequality considers sexuality       important, but they have highly varied ideas about what       matters and why. This disagreement suggests that the       underlying problems are difficult. We cannot       hope to solve them in this brief effort. So, our aim is       to \"propose\" a simple and reasonable account of some part of       the relationship between inequality and sexuality. We are        not trying to develop a full, professional analysis.        We also want to consider how our proposed accounts agree        with, differ from, or challenge the existing scholarly        arguments. Again, our goal here is limited. The        aim is to give a reasonable first sense of how the proposed        account fits (or does not fit).                   Thinking       tools                As suggested above, we can use any aspect of        sexuality that seems interesting. However, it may        help if the selected facet of sexuality:                 has a relationship to gender inequality that at         least some writers think is important. Which way         it is important is wide open. The role of the         chosen sexuality characteristic relative to gender         inequality may be cause, effect, catalyst, or whatever         else seems causally relevant.          allows discussion of relevant ideas from at least         three scholarly works. These may be part of the         common readings, any of the other readings recommended         here, or another legitimate source. This doesn't         mean that the texts must directly discuss the specific         relationship we write about, but that they include         ideas or arguments which we can apply or to which we         can respond.                         A basic approach to the task presentation might have the        following three parts:                 First, we lay out the causal, explanatory         problem. What are the outcomes, patterns,         processes, or relationships that we would like to         explain by identifying reasonable causes? And         why is this important enough to merit attention? (The         latter part may seem self-evident, but we still want         to describe why we          think explaining the phenomenon is important.)          Second, we provide the causal analysis. We         want to be as complete as possible within reasonable         space limits. And, we want to be clear, simple,         and direct.          Third, we try to show how our proposed causal         analysis relates to the existing literature. For         our purposes, we can limit ourselves to considering a         couple theories or perspectives that would support or         compliment our approach and a couple that would be         likely to question our proposed causal analysis.          (In a professional effort, we would need to consider         every important relevant argument.) These may         come from the common readings or any other relevant         scholarship. When discussing those who might         disagree, we want to be as specific as possible about         what criticism we would expect from each of these         \"opponents\" and how we might respond.                                      Bringing it       together . In short, our aim is to construct a       basic causal argument seeking to understand how some aspect of       sexuality is related to gender inequality, and to assess how       that causal argument relates to the existing literature (as       represented in our readings).

Attempts to explain gender inequality at all levels are   haunted by essentialism . Essentialist arguments impute   distinctive attributes to women and men and attribute the social differences   between women's and men's activities, opportunities, statuses, and roles to   these distinct attributes. Even theoretical analyses of gender   inequality that expressly reject the possibility of consequential, inherent   sex differences, commonly build their explanations of inequality on   gender differences. To complicate matters, essentialist arguments   proclaiming superior attributes for women exist alongside of the arguments   proclaiming women inferior. Moreover, while for some, essentialism   always means a difference based in biology or genetics, for others it   includes cultural differences that are embodied in women and men.          Analytical     Task                 The general analytical problem .      To investigate how essentialist arguments work, we will      examine how different kinds of essentialist arguments might be      applied to explain some aspect of gender inequality, in contrast      to a non-essentialist argument. We aim to see both the      attraction of essentialist arguments and the possibilities for      alternatives.             Select one form or facet of gender inequality that you will       try to explain for this task. This instance or aspect of       gender inequality should be sufficiently important,       widespread, and enduring or recurring to merit thoughtful       theory and explanation. It should also be narrow or       specific enough that the goal of explaining it is       plausible. For example, the facet might be that wives       commonly defer to husbands.        For the selected type or aspect of gender inequality, you       will suggest five alternative explanations, each one       representing a different approach to explaining such social       phenomena. The explanations should be succinct but       clear. They should also be plausible to the extent that       a reasonable person might make such an argument. Plausible       does not mean true, of course. Rather, we are trying to       imagine an argument that would seem plausible to people who       are advocates for each of the perspectives.                   The five types of explanation .       Attempt to devise the best explanations you can for the relevant      facet of inequality from each of the following      perspectives. Explanations may be categorized in many      ways. The five perspectives defined here are meant to engage      different responses to the problem of essentialism.              Direct biological - Devise an explanation claiming       that some biological difference between the sexes produces the       relevant aspect of inequality by making women and men act       differently. For example, an argument might be that men       are stronger than women so men dominate women as a simple       result of superior strength. (More complex biological       explanations might be derived from evolutionary       psychology.) This type of explanation is usually purely       essentialist. Note that this type of explanation can be       divided further into those relying on real biological       differences and those imputing fictional biological       differences. Let us stress biological differences that       are at least potentially real here, leaving the fictitious       ones for below.        Indirect biological - Formulate an explanation       claiming some biological difference does not directly       produce the inequality, but the biological difference has       important effects or implications of some sort, and those       effects that make likely or unavoidable the emergence or       persistence of the selected aspect of gender inequality.        For example, someone might argue that women's child bearing       makes them anxious about the welfare of their children, and       that anxiety makes them feel weak and in want of a protector,       leading them to defer to husbands. Or, others might       suggest that women's biologically induced child rearing       orientation encourages both women and men to make men       responsible for warfare, and that men's resulting skill at       combat, their possession of weapons, and men's organization       around mutual defense leaves wives typically in their       husbands' control. The key for this type of explanation       is that the relevant biological differences do not directly       cause the gender inequality being explained, but have effects       on social behavior and social organization that lead to gender       inequality. These types of explanations have       essentialist origins in a biological difference, but the       explanation as a whole may invoke mediating causal influences       that reduce the essentialist quality, sometimes greatly.        Non-biological sex difference - Suggest how       some socially constructed difference between women and men \u2013       one that is neither biological nor a direct result of       biological differences \u2013 initiates or preserves the aspect of       gender inequality being explained. This will usually be       an enduring individual characteristic (a difference that       people carry with them, not a difference in their       circumstances). For example, one might claim that women       are fearful and dependent because of socialization processes       (that have no biological basis), and this psychological       condition induces wives to defer to their husbands. Or,       one might argue that childhood sports available only to boys       result in a higher competitive drive that accounts for adult       men's greater success in business. This type of       explanation claims a real difference exists between women and       men (in the society or social context where the inequality       being explained occurs; the relevant sex difference need not       exist in all or any other society or social context), but this       difference is a social construction. This type of       explanation often becomes redundantly circular: each aspect of       inequality exists as a result of inequality, and that overall       inequality is constituted by the various aspects.        Fictitious sex difference - An imputed sex       difference that does not really exist is claimed to play a       significant role in producing the selected facet of gender       inequality. For example, someone might suggest that       although women have no better capacity for child rearing,       people commonly assume they do because women bear children,       and that this false expectation produces a division of labor       and power favoring men. This type of explanation focuses       on the consequences of beliefs, relying on the observation       that beliefs can organize behavior even if they are false       beliefs. While such fictitious differences are commonly       assumed to be biological, they need not be.        Causes independent of sex differentiation - A       causal process that does not involve any difference between       the sexes is argued to produce the inequality being       considered. For example, some might argue that for       families to fulfill their social functions effectively, they       need one spouse/parent to perform the critical emotional       actions needed and the other spouse/parent to perform the       practical and leadership actions (this is essentially a       well-know idea of Talcott Parsons). This role       differentiation can then result in spouse inequality, as an       indirect and unintended consequence. This category       includes highly diverse explanations, the one critical       similarity among them being that they do not rely on a sex       difference in their central causal argument. It may be       worth noting that one reason explanations based on sex       differences (including all the preceding perspectives) are       more common is that formulating a plausible analysis that       forgoes the mechanism of sex differences is often a hard task.                         (Note, in this task we are aiming to produce explanations that      those advocating each of the above types of explanation would      think are reasonable. It is often hardest to conceive good      explanations from the points of view we find unconvincing or      unappealing, but the capacity to do this is a valuable skill.)       Bringing it together .       The point of this exercise is to examine how it is possible to      devise a range of alternative causal explanations of gender      inequality stressing some mechanism of sex differences, while      developing alternative theories that do not rely on sex      differences is rather hard. The difference arguments run the      full range from being directly and fully biological to relying on      non-biological or fictitious differences in indirect ways.       The arguments that exclude not only biology but all dependence on      sex differences commonly derive from another theoretical approach,      such as functionalism or conflict theories. The challenge      with these approaches is not only to make the immediate causal      process eschew differences, but to avoid relying on sex      differences one or two steps earlier in the causal chain.

What is the role of     violence and intimidation in the relationships between men and     women?     Most theoretical approaches to gender inequality   suggest that violence between women and men plays a role in sustaining   inequality; some also point toward violence as an initial    cause. A recurring issue concerns the degree to which violence is an   expression or result of gender inequality or, alternatively, is a cause of   inequality. The separate roles of rape, harassment, and domestic   violence, and their relationships to each other are another critical   question. Much research and argument has also been focused on the   question of women's aggressive impulses and actions.          Analytical     Task                 Analytical Task 1:      Explain why women do not engage in sexual harassment or sexual      violence at anything like the rates that men do? Our      strategy is to reverse the usual way people approach the problem      of gender violence.              When people refer to the patterns of violence between women       and men (in modern societies), they are usually referring to       several distinctive patterns including sexual violence       (particularly rape), sexual harassment, and intimate partner       violence (which includes wife battering). These       categories implicitly distinguish patterns of aggression based       on several criteria: the degree to which the aggressive acts       involve sexuality, the severity of the aggressive acts, and       the relationship between the man and woman. These       aggressive actions in these categories are all related to       gender inequality both in that inequality engenders them and       that they reinforce gender inequality. They are       particularly linked in their contributions to women\u2019s fear and       sense of physical vulnerability. And that fear is       crucial. For it is the prospect of possible violence       that induces women to restrict their behavior, to seek male       protectors, and to heed men\u2019s wishes.        Here, to simplify our task, we will set aside the question       of intimate partner violence.        To begin, you might consider what determines the actions of       women that do or do not lead to violence and how those       immediate determinants differ from the determinants for       men. Men vary greatly, so you must decide if you will       abstract away all that variation (to talk of \"men\" in the most       generic or abstract possible manner) or if you feel that some       variations (e.g. wealth or age) require consideration.        Remember that you can restrict the scope of your analysis.               Potential determinants include beliefs, resources,        opportunities, the anticipated consequences of alternative        actions         Another way to look at it is the old detective's script:        motives, means, opportunity         It is commonly useful to start your reasoning        concretely, using what you know best. Think about        the kinds of people you know best, either through personal        experience or from studying them. Try to explain        concretely why the women do not engage in sexual        harassment or sexual violence more. This gives you a        starting point.               Expect to develop your argument backwards from the concrete       beginnings. This means that after you assemble your       first round explanation of what directly influences women's       actions, you take those explanatory conditions as the problem       to explain in the second. For example, if you used       women's beliefs about violence as an immediate cause of their       restrained violence, then you next need to consider why they       have different beliefs from men. You want to produce at       least two levels of the causal analysis, and see if you can do       three.        Please take the time to look over the lists of Recommended       and Related Readings. You are likely to find some work       there what will shorten the time needed to complete this task.                              Analytical Task 2 : Try      to develop a clear causal analysis of the role played in      gender inequality by a fear of violence.                    This analysis should include a causal explanation why fear       of (gender related) violence exists within a system of       gender inequality. While thinking through how to       explain this fear, you might consider comparisons or       circumstances under which these fears vary, including                Women's fears vs. men's fears         The circumstances under which women experience greater        fear and those where they feel safe         Differences in the amount of fear typical amongst        groups or categories of women according to their age,        affluence, location, companions, or any other relevant        social condition         Differences in the distribution of fear across        societies distinguished by such conditions as forms of        economic and political organization, degree of        development, prevailing religious or cultural        institutions and the like                       This analysis should also include a causal explanation of       the consequences for gender inequality of the distribution       of fears of violence. In what ways do fears of       violence influence the behavior of women or the       relationships between women and men? Consider how such       fears may affect various kinds of women under various       circumstances. But remember to return to aggregate       effects \u2013 it is the impact of these fears on the pattern of       women's experiences and behavior that affects gender       inequality writ large.        Avoid the analytic temptation to argue as if equality       might imply an absence of discord and aggression.        Realistically, equality between two groups by itself only       leads us to expect that acts of aggression will occur with       equal frequency and effect between members of the two       groups. Removing inequality as a source of discord       should reduce one kind of frustrations that motivate       aggression. Other sources of discord still exist,       however, and some forms of aggression that would be       suppressed by inequality might even rise.        Try to introduce appropriate connections between the       argument(s) you present and the readings. Consider not       only the common readings from this week, but also past       readings and optional ones from this week that seem       particularly relevant.        The causal arguments should try to conform to the       standards for a good causal argument that we have read about       and discussed. Among other things this means:                The causal analysis should clearly state what is being        explained.         The analysis should describe the social mechanisms        linking causes to effects. It should show what        happens in the world that produces the outcomes, what        kinds of people or organizations behave in manner, what        circumstances arise that induce the relevant behavior,        and so forth. This may be abstract at the level of        the causal model.         The analysis should consider why the decisive        causes exist and take the form that they do. That        is, the causal analysis should push back at least one        step past the causes being invoked to ask what causes        them.         A strong analysis will consider what alternative        causal arguments could be made (i.e., how the causal        processes could be different from what you describe) and        show what evidence or logic favors the argument you have        presented. A thorough causal analysis will        recognize that other causal models might be considered        plausable, and try to compare the causal model being        promoted to the alternatives.         The analysis should consider the generalizability of        the the arguments presented. It should consider to        what periods, places, types of societies, parts of        society, kinds of social relationships or interactions        do the arguments apply?         Most will find it difficult to do all of the above        effectively, so consider it suggestions about what would        be ideal, then apply your judgment about allocating your        time and effort.

How has the economy    influenced men's and women's positions in society?     Analyses of gender inequality attribute great   importance to the economy. Gender inequality appears everywhere   embedded in economic inequality, in the sense that a critical aspect of   gender inequality involves unequal access to economic resources and   positions. This relationship becomes clearer in more \"advanced\"   societies where economic organization has become institutionally   differentiated from kinship and political organization. Sometimes this   unequal economic access is understood as an expression of gender inequality,   sometimes a cause of gender inequality, sometimes a result. Many analyses   consider it all three.          Analytical     Task                 Analytical Task       1: Develop a causal analysis of economic inequality between      women and men that accounts for two empirical observations, one      being the earnings inequality between the sexes by the gender      composition of major occupational categories, the other being the      changing likelihood that wives will earn more than their husbands.              The data to be explained can be found in three tables (click to see) .        Use the tabs at the bottom to switch between tables.               The first table shows the 2012 earnings gap in the 20        occupational categories that have the largest number of        females. These have been sorted by the proportion        female. The numbers in dark red show the earnings        gap where women also account for two-thirds or more of the        those in the occupational category.         The second table shows the same kind of data as the        first, but is for the 20 occupational categories that have        the largest number of males. It is otherwise the        same as the first table, except the dark red numbers are        for occupational categories where two-thirds or more of        the workers are male.         The third table shows the changing proportion of married        couples where the wife earns more than the husband over        the 25 years up to 2011.                      Preliminary to developing an analysis, the first task is,       of course, to interpret what the data in the tables tell us       about economic inequality between women and men. It is       recommended that you focus on the dark red numbers of all the       tables. The first two tables are meant to be interpreted       as one.        The main task is to develop a background analysis of gender       inequality in the economy, as it exists today and how it has       changed over the past several decades. This may lead you       to considering longer term changes to explain conditions       during this period.        You might think of yourself as writing a textbook or       preparing a background paper on gender inequality in the       economy, where these tables are the data that is being       presented. Your goal is to offer an understanding of       these tables.        One way to think about this is in terms of what we don't see       in the tables.               Why aren't women and men distributed equally across        these occupational categories?         Why are women's earnings lower?         Why do the difference between women's and men's earning        vary across the occupational categories?         Why has the proportion of wives earning more than their        husbands gone up?         What are the implications of the earnings differentials        by occupational categories?         What are the implications of the data on wives'        earnings?         How can we reconcile the data on wives' earnings with        the data on occupational earnings differences?                      In short, we are aiming at a brief explanation of women's       vs. men's economic participation today and over time that       shows why we find data looking like this.                   Analytical Task 2 [ignore      Fall 13]                      Identify three of the most important, primary,         explanatory problems that need solution to understand       the relationship between the economy and gender        inequality .                 Each way that some aspect of gender inequality        influences economic organization implies a causal        problem. Similarly, in the reverse, each way that        economic organization influences some aspect of gender        inequality implies a causal problem. For example,        women used to have no access to most high-status        positions in the American economy and are now still        under represented in them. In either direction we        might consider the intensity or degree of gender        inequality, rather than some aspect of gender        inequality, as that which influences or is influenced by        economic organization. For each observation or        claim about economic inequality between women and men,        we can ask \"why?\" or \"how?\" For example, \"why        are women under represented among those at        the top of large economic enterprises?\" or \"how does        women's relative absence from positions great economic        power influence the persistence of gender inequality?\"         Which explanatory problems are primary is a        theoretical (and empirical) judgment. A         primary causal process is one without which the         relationship between the economy and gender inequality         would look and work differently . Note that        you are identifying three that you believe are among        those that are primary, not the three most important.                        For each of the three selected, primary,       explanatory problems, do the following: State clearly what        is the explanatory problem and why it is a        primary or important one . Think carefully about       what makes some causal processes more important than others       when we are trying to understand a social phenomenon (her       the relationship between gender inequality and economic       organization).        Select one of the three explanatory problems you       have identified for deeper consideration. For that       problem:                Briefly describe what stand out as the         possible causal processes that could account for        the relationship or condition that is the focus of the        explanatory problem. For example, what might        be the causal processes that account for few women        being in positions of high economic power? These        are the competing or alternative explanations for the        problem. These may include the causes or        explanations explicitly suggested in the literature        concerning the problem, or explanations derived from        applying a more general theoretical orientation (e.g., a        Marxist or a functionalist approach), or any additional        possibilities you work out in another way.          Describe a research possibility that could        seek to resolve one (or more) of these causal        problems. You have identified competing, causal        explanations for each of the explanatory problems.         For one of these, consider how we might hope to learn        which causal explanation is more valid by doing relevant        research. To do this, we usually want to think        about the circumstances under which the competing        theories suggest that something in the world should look        or work differently.                       To summarize, the analytical task involves (1) identifying       three primary, explanatory problems relating gender       inequality and economic organization, providing a careful       description for each of those explanatory problems, stating       why it is important, (2) for one explanatory problem,       exploring competing explanations that could solve the       problem, and describing a research design that could,       hypothetically, discover which explanation is better.

X. What role does ideology play in    determining the relations between men and women?     Ideology is near the center of almost all   efforts to explain gender inequalities. People's conceptions of   masculinity and femininity, ideas concerning the fairness of differential   treatment or expectations of women and men, internalized schema that   evoke different judgments of women's and men's actions, rules about proper   male and female behavior applied to children \u2013 all these and more concern the   influence of ideology on gender identities, differential treatment of women   and men, and the organization and persistence of gender inequality.    Conversely, each ideological belief that symbolizes, legitimates, invokes,   guides, induces, or helps sustain gender inequality is itself a product of   gender inequality. To untangle these complex causal interdependencies,   we must always attend carefully to two kinds of distinctions. First,   we must consistently recognize differences in levels of social organization,   including, among others, societal structures and culture, organizations,   social networks, social processes, and individual actors. While it is   tempting to treat ideological beliefs as diffuse entities unconnected to   identifiable people, organizations, or structures, the analytical results   are poor. Second, we must consistently distinguish between   contemporaneous causes (e.g., the ways that internalized schema can   influence interactions) and asynchronous or historical causes (e.g., the   ways that changes in domestic production induce different ideas about   women's place). Causal arguments about ideology consider it as both an   effect of gender inequality and a cause of gender inequality, although it is   ideology's potential role as a contributing cause that stands out as more   theoretically important.          Analytical     Task                 The general analytical problem .      For this week's task, we want to pose an initial analysis of the      relationship between ideology and some aspect of gender      inequality. We want to consider the joint direction of      causal influence for the selected context, how the dynamics of      inequality influences the ideas and how the presence of ideas      influences the understandings and actions of all the relevant      actors.             The aim of       this week's task is to explore the relationship between       beliefs \u2013 ideology \u2013 and some example of inequality. The       goal is to work through the various ways that ideas and       expectations are involved in the causal processes surrounding       gender inequality using the chosen example to do this at a       more concrete level. The purpose of the task       specification that follows is to help you to be systematic       about this.        To begin ,       choose one aspect or component of gender inequality.        This may involve the direct relationships between women and       men or a difference in the opportunities or status available       to women. Examples might be the way that women overall       select less prestigious fields of study than men in college,       that higher education used to be restricted for women, that       women are objects of sex trafficking, that male professional       sports have much higher status, or the different kinds of       restaurants that use male vs. female waiters. You might       try to be a bit creative. It can be helpful to focus your       discussion using a concrete instance of that type of       inequality with which you are familiar.                   Contents of the analysis .       Use this schematic outline as a starting point.             1        Clarify what aspect or component of gender inequality is your       focus.               As always, remember to give the basic characteristics        and principal patterns of the inequality as you understand        it. Among other possibilities, this will normally        include: (1) describe what is unequal; (2) describe what        this inequality looks like, how it is experienced, or how        it has its impact in social life; (3) assess how the        distribution appears or is manifest in the world, how we        would recognize the differences between more or less of        it, and how it is currently distributed).         The goal is to ensure the reader (and you) clearly        understand what inequality is relevant, and what examples        of that inequality you will address.                      2        Describe the principal ideological beliefs or ideas that seem       relevant to the inequality being examined.               While identifying the relevant beliefs is obviously        crucial, it can also be difficult. The range of        potentially relevant beliefs may be very large, so we have        to exercise judgment about which are most important         It may help to distinguish beliefs that motivate         the practice of this aspect of gender inequality from         those that legitimate it.         It is crucial to consider the actions and ideas of both men and women .         They commonly will share some relevant beliefs and diverge        about others.         Consider also whether different beliefs motivate or        legitimate this type of inequality in different times,        places, or circumstances. That is, you want to        decide what characteristics of the beliefs connected to        this inequality are fairly consistent across various        concrete instances of this type of inequality and what        sort of beliefs differ across instances. For        example, the beliefs that motivated male resistance to        women entering \"male\" occupations may have varied by the        status of the occupation and by the time period women        began to enter.         Consider the degree of consensus (or dispute) over the        important beliefs. When is the consensus high or        low, what causes it to be high or low, and what difference        does the degree of agreement make? In particular, do        people dispute some aspects of the beliefs relevant to        this type of inequality, such that the dispute affects the        inequality or informs us about it? Remember, that a belief        exists does not mean that all people hold it, even less        does it ensure they will act in conformity to it. The        greater the disagreement about a belief within a group or         category of actors, the less that it can contribute to         consistent responses it decides actions (although this         may not diminish its appeal as a justification).         Beliefs have a variety of other variable characteristics         that can be important to analyzing their significance.         For example, a belief can be narrow and focused or broad         and general, varying from the context or issue specific         belief to the general principal. A belief can be so         salient and closely held that people refer to it all the         time or so insignificant and loosely held that it plays a         role only when forced to the forefront.                      3        Assess the effects of these beliefs.               Consider the social significance or function of beliefs.         The effects of beliefs are generally understood by        comparing them to real or hypothetical alternatives.         Although beliefs exist only by being held by individuals,         we generally want to think of beliefs as cultural         phenomena. The beliefs that concern us are those preserved         and imposed by cultures or acquired as the common effect of         shared or parallel experiences. People are prone to all         kinds of idiosyncratic beliefs, but only shared beliefs         have social effect.         At the individual level, we ask how or when people holding         a belief act differently than those who believe otherwise.         At the social level, we ask how the presence of those         beliefs in a group or circumstance has social consequences         -- such as influencing the structure of organizations, the         prevailing legal system, or direction of historical         changes.         What we identify as important effects will therefore        depend on the selection of those alternative beliefs.         Reasonable alternatives might include: beliefs observed to        exist in more egalitarian (or more unequal) circumstances,        reversal of beliefs about women and men (often implausible        in reality, but potentially clarifying as an imaginary        experiment), the absence of any such beliefs, or the        presence of some reasonable hypothetical alternative         beliefs.         As usual, we want to give some thought to both women and        men, and we want to consider how the effects of the        beliefs might vary depending on the context or other        mediating influences. Typically, we expect to find women         and men share many beliefs, but are sharply divided on        others.         Beliefs can affect judgments, motives, aspirations,        quality of experience, and so forth. Again, deciding        what is important is an analytical judgment. We are trying        to figure out what beliefs really make a difference to the        strength, durability, or form of gender inequality.                      4        Try to explain how the relevant beliefs come to exist and why       they persist.               Thus, for the example of inequality being examined, we         are trying to explain how beliefs or ideas might         arise as a result of the presence of the inequality         that they legitimate and motivate. This is our         central goal, and it is difficult.         It can help to do a hypothetical experiment.         Consider an imaginary circumstance (which might have a        real historical counterpart) where the relevant aspect of        gender inequality did not exist, nor did the related        beliefs \u2013 then at some point in time this type of gender        inequality came into existence. Then try to think        through how ideas would change as a result of the        emergence of this facet of gender inequality.         Consider what issues might arise if this type of        inequality came to exist, but the beliefs still did not,        and how might the response to such issues lead to new        beliefs. Think about both women and men trying to make        sense of the unequal circumstances, and trying to mold the        perception of reality and justice to fit their        circumstances.         To make the analysis more concrete, see if you can        provide evidence or observations about real circumstances        where this type of inequality is minimal (different        cultures, different historical periods, different parts of        society). Assess how the beliefs under minimal        inequality compare to those where it is high.         It is a good idea to consider under what conditions, if        any, would the beliefs associated with a facet of gender         inequality exist without the presence of this facet of        gender inequality. That is, could similar or analogous        beliefs appear with different kinds of inequality or under        conditions of little inequality. The first        possibility is critical, because it suggests beliefs due        to the presence of inequality per se, not dependent on the        type of inequality. The second possibility suggests        the prospect of beliefs hijacked from conditions distinct        from inequality, then converted to some service to        reinforce or challenge inequality.         It is also a good idea to consider how people acquire        the relevant beliefs? Are they part of general        cultural expectations, are the transferred in specific        contexts, or do people generate them from experience        rather than learning them from others?         Finally, ask what happens if some people question or        reject the beliefs? This question applies to both women        and men. The mechanisms to ensure acceptance and        conformity are crucial to the preservation and        effectiveness of beliefs.                      5        Finally, after completing the steps in the analysis above, try       to give an overall assessment about the significance of       ideology to the facet of gender inequality you are       considering.                   Additional Notes              Throughout, be careful to distinguish between empirical        claims and moral claims. Both kinds of beliefs       are important. And they may be confused or overlapping       rather than neatly distinguished in real life. Still,       they are crucially different. Similarly, distinguish       between the explanation of beliefs and the justification        of beliefs.

Today, feminism is both extolled and condemned, often   by people whose orientations toward feminism seem to defy their   interests. Both the popular press and scholarship have devoted a lot   of effort seeking to make sense of people's beliefs about feminism and   equality, but these efforts have done little to reduce the disagreements.          Analytical     Task                 The goal of this task is to explore what young people think      about feminism today and to attempt to explain these beliefs.       As a prelude, you should interview some female and some male      acquaintances about feminism.             Use your own judgment about who to interview and how       many. You are trying to get enough \"data\" to serve as       the basis for your analysis.        Also use your own judgment about how to conduct your       interviews and what to ask. However, at a minimum try to       include: 1) how they would define feminism, 2) what kinds of       the people they know do they consider feminist, 3) what they       think is true about gender inequality/equality today, 4)       whether or not they consider themselves feminist and why, 5)       whether or not they consider themselves committed to gender       equality.                   Based on these interviews and your pre-existing observations,      write a descriptive assessment of young, educated American's      orientation toward feminism.       Prepare a provisional causal analysis of these current attitudes      toward feminism and gender equality in your reference population.      Try to do a reasoned analysis, taking into account the readings      for this topic.       Causal analyses always hinge on the choice of comparison.       Among others, you might consider: 1) the differences between now      and the past, 2) the differences between women and men, 3) the      differences between those who identify as feminist and those who      do not, 3) the difference between people like you and people      unlike you                     Common Readings            Destined for Equality : Women's      Rejection of Subordination      Nancy Burns and Katherine Gallagher. \" Public      Opinion on Gender Issues: The Politics of Equity and Roles .\"     Annual Review of Political Science, 2010, Vol. 13: 425-443       [doi: 10.1146/annurev.polisci.12.040507.142213]      Jo Freeman. \" Political      Organization in the Feminist Movement .\" Acta Sociologica ,     Vol. 18, No. 2/3 (1975), pp. 222-244      Susan E.

How have political    processes and structures sustained men's and women's relative status?     As structure and as actor, the state has been   unavoidably central to ongoing practice of gender inequality, to its   persistence, and to changes in the form and amount of gender inequality.     States or governments have power. Through the   military and police, a state can enforce conformity to its rules, repel and   punish challenges from the scale of individual acts to collective   rebellions, and by threat, implicit or explicit, deter rebellions from   appearing. Through the law, regulations, and bureaucratic policies, a state   can define what constitutes acceptable or legitimate behavior at all levels   of social organization. Through economic policies of taxation, expenditures,   and redistributions (such as welfare policies or agricultural supports), a   state influences the relative economic status of different groups.     By acting differently toward groups with   regard to any of these aspects of government power, a state can create,   reinforce, or exacerbate social inequalities. Analogously, a state can, in   theory, obstruct, destabilize, or diminish social inequality by using its   power in ways that are inconsistent with social inequalities. States   determine, influence, legitimize, and sanction rights and opportunities;   they may do so in more or less egalitarian ways.     When significant, enduring, social inequality   exists, those privileged by that form of inequality will normally have more   influence over the state than do those disadvantaged by the inequality, and   the overall effect of state policies will reinforce the exercise and   persistence of the inequality. A fundamental problem for all state theories   is who or what decides state policies and actions. To some degree, those   \"in\" the state (elected, appointed, hired, or appropriated) make decisions   based on their interests and outlooks as members of the state apparatus. To   some degree, state actors respond to the influence of power brokers outside   the state, such as the economically powerful. In either case, when making   policy or strategic planning decisions, those influencing state actions are   in part responding to what they perceive will be the responses of all actors   in the nation affected by those decisions. States, or the political   actors who comprise the government, also have their own interests, most   notably preserving their power, and these interests are not automatically   consistent with the interests of dominant social groups.     These political processes may support and   enforce gender inequality, passively permit it, or oppose gender inequality   (as is true with any form of social inequality). They may do any combination   of these with respect to different aspects of gender inequality.    Sustaining influence over political processes is a fundamental feature and   goal of socially dominant groups and the long monopoly of men over political   power has both demonstrated and sustained gender inequality. Yet,   government actions have also contributed to the decline of gender inquality   over the past two centuries.          Analytical     Task                 You have been hired by the newly elected President of the United      States (or the analogous top political position in another country      that you prefer to examine). One of the new President\u2019s main      goals for her years in office is to use government power to      improve gender inequality and the status of women. Your job      is to recommend toward what specific goals she should focus her      efforts.       You may recommend new legislation (or the removal of old), new      administrative strategies such as who gets appointed, new      executive policies (for example, rules for the military) that are      within the President\u2019s power without legislation, concerted      efforts to influence public opinion or state level      governance. In short, you can consider the entire range of      actions available to a President.       You should propose at least three distinct initiatives that you      believe could serve this purpose.       Chose the strategy you believe holds the most promise. For      this strategy, you must provide an analytical justification. Your      justification should consider the following:             At what aspects of gender inequality is the policy       aimed?        Include a brief analysis of this inequality that explains       what is unequal, how great is the inequality, who does it       effect, how widely is it recognized, how it has (or has not)       changed over time, and what seem to be the principal causes.        Describe how have government actions (or inaction)       influenced this inequality in the past.        Show why we should expect that it will be easy or hard to       carry out the strategy and how the possible difficulties       reflect the influence or effects of gender inequality.        Explain how the proposed strategy can be expected to       alleviate gender inequality. This explanation should       connect directly to the causal explanation of the inequality       being diminished.                   In short, you should propose several strategies by which a      government could promote greater gender equality, then provide an      analytic appraisal of the strategy you deem best. This      appraisal should stress the causes of relevant facets of gender      inequality, how the proposed strategy will affect that causal      process, and how gender inequality has a causal influence on      government policy that must be countered to implement the      policy. Do not forget to provide a historical context.

XIII. What does the future hold?     Where do we go from here? Predicting the future is the     ultimate challenge for causal analyses. To have any potential to     see into the future, we need a sound and thorough causal theory, one     that can encompass the range of possible influences     simultaneously. We also need to cope with the unpredictable     potential effects of processes and events that are outside the     boundaries of our theories. These are extremely difficult     conditions to meet. But the need to make some sense of the     future weighs on us. Will gender inquality continue to decline,     and greater gender equality spread throughout the world? Are     some aspects of gender inquality particularly resistant to reduction,     and if so why? Could change stagnate? Behind such concerns     are two principal questions. What has caused the long-term     pattern of declining gender inequality? And what has preserved     aspects of gender inequality in the face of these accumulating     changes? Combining the answers to these two questions with an     effort to project the relevant influences into the future, is the     basis for trying to understand the possibilities for the future.      Behind this also lies another analytical question with moral     overtones: what does gender equality really mean?                    Analytical       Task 1                    Select two types of inequality, both       important, one that you believe to be moving toward greater       equality at a relatively high rate, the other that you       believe is moving toward equality at a relatively slow rate       (or is stalled or is moving backwards)               for each of these two types, describe what is the        inequality (how are women and men unequal, which women        and men experience it, how do things differ when this        inequality is high from when it is low)         describe the evidence and logic that suggests one        type is declining relatively quickly and the other        relatively slowly                      Try to explain why the two different rates of movement       toward equality               For each, consider what processes, conditions,        interests, and the like propel the movement toward        greater equality         For each, consider what circumstances, activities,        and the like obstruct the movement toward greater        equality         Try to explain how and why the balance between the        causes propelling greater equality and the causes        sustaining existing inequality differ between the two        types of gender inequality                                                 Analytical       Task 2                    The general       analytical problem . Using two       plausible future scenarios about gender inequality, assess       what processes or conditions will decide which future       alternative comes to pass.        The task has the following main parts               Select two         of three alternatives to use for the analysis: highest        conceivable level of equality, highest possibility of in equality,        most likely conditions. Essentially this means        that we compare the two extreme possibilities, or we        compare what we think most likely with one of the        extreme possibilities.         For each of the two        selected alternatives, give a clear description of what        the expected level of gender inequality means.         How severe will be major components of gender        inequality, how consistent will different aspects of        gender inequality be with each other, how consistent        will these patterns be in society, and so on. (It        might help to look back over the range of topics        covered above.)         The center of the        analysis will be to provide a causal argument about        what causal conditions and sequence of developments         could lead to each of the two alternatives.         To this end, we must consider the full        range of causal influences that we have examined        previously.                      Thinking tools .               To consider any future path, we must make assumptions        about: (1) how far into the future, (2) in what society        and with respect to what social groups, and (3) what        other changes might occur, altering the cultural,        political, and economic environment.                  For our purposes, let us set the future to be         about one and two generations, that is when your         children are your current age, and then when their         children reach a similar age. The key         tradeoff with setting the distance into the future         is simple: the further we go into the future the         more interesting and significant are the social         changes but equally the more obscure become the         realistic possibilities.          Let us focus on our own society as a whole,         referencing distinctive social categories as         needed.          Similarly, let us assume that the cultural,         political, and economic environments are reasonably         stable, with the expectation that existing long         term trends will continue into the future. We         will ignore the potential for significant         structural changes and historical \"shocks\" such as         economic recessions and wars. Of course, the         further we look into the future, the more         speculative and fallible such assumptions become,         but our purpose is not to predict the actual         future.                         Looking forward, the future is always uncertain,        however well we may explain it once it becomes the        past. One way to make the future more amenable to        analysis is to simplify it into what we believe are the        principal alternative futures that matter to us.         Probably the simplest technique it to focus on one        characteristic and consider the most extreme plausible        possibilities.         With this in mind, let us try to analyze the future        of gender inequality by contrasting stark        alternatives. To begin consider three        possibilities:                 First, the highest level of gender equality that         we can imagine. This might be the current         state of inequality, or it might be the highest         level of inequality now seen in any comparable         society, or it might be a much higher level of         inequality. The problem here is to imagine         what is the greatest amount of future inequality we         can          Second, the highest level of gender in equality         that we can imagine.          And, third, the most likely level of gender         inequality that we expect. This could         coincide with either one of the previous, but will         commonly be somewhere between them.                         For deciding the plausibility of any future        circumstances, we want to remember that there are two        kinds of limiting conditions we must consider.         First, functional plausibility ,        asking if that level of inequality is feasible in the        context of what we perceive to be the relevant        surrounding circumstances. For a simple example,        a social custom of leaving all property to sons is        largely unworkable in a society with a low reproduction        rate because so many families have no sons.         Second, transition        plausibility , asking if a conceivable        historical path of development could lead from present        circumstances to the future scenario. For a        simple example, it might be possible to conceive how        American society could have functioned with full gender        equality in 1900, but it would extremely difficult to        suggest any plausible way that condition could have        emerged under any conceivable historical sequence from        the social organization of American society in 1850.                              Bringing it together . Our goal here is       not to predict the future of gender inequality, but to       examine what sequence of causal conditions seem likely determinants       of that future. We are trying to discover defensible       \" if, then \" arguments. To do this, we are       starting by imagining possible futures, then working       backwards from them to find paths from the present to those       futures, then asserting what else must occur for those       paths to materialize. We should not forget, there may       be more than one path to an imagined future and more than       one set of causal conditions that could lead us there.        For each alternative being considered, we want to analyze        why and how it might reasonably occur.        As an optional extra, you can offer an analysis of which        alternative seems more likely and why.

How have women's and     men's actions obstructed or furthered change, taking into account     the changing institutional context?       Both women and men    have acted in every possible way towards gender inequality. What    we want to understand are the circumstances in which they predictably    act in ways that either reinforce or erode inequality. People's    actions are complex results of their interests, ideologies,    circumstances, opportunities, and constraints. While theories of    gender inequality invoke all kinds of abstract causal processes, in real    life inequality is sustained and changed by the actions of women and    men. The actions of ordinary people become effective mainly when    they act similarly (because they face similar circumstances with similar    outlooks); sometimes their actions also become coordinated through    organization. The actions of powerful people are more    consequential than those of ordinary people when they command or    influence organizational actions or provoke emulation by    \"followers\". Even unique political actions may have great effect    by altering laws, policies, or the balance of power, although even in    these cases the institutionalization of changes generally depends on    dispersed acceptance; in the economic realm, even organizational actions    typically become effective only when multiple organizations pursue    parallel policies (governmental controls over an economy would be an    exception).           Analytical      Task                  The goal of this task is to       examine why some of men's actions worked against gender       inequality while others sustained it, and similarly why       women's actions also included ones that challenged gender       inequality and others that reinforced it. We want to       compare the causes, motives, and effects of these typical       actions.               \"Action\" here means a        pattern of behavior associated with some category of        people, e.g. the tendency to take or not take advantage of        educational opportunities by women of some type in some        period. The relevant actions are those that were one        typical result either of being either in certain enduring        categories of women or men (for example, single women with        higher education) or in certain recurring circumstances        (for example, married women whose husbands lost their jobs        for long periods). The category could include all        women or all men.        To say that actions        reinforce gender inequality means that they either bolster        the stability of gender inequality or help to make it more        severe; alternatively, if those actions became rare        and were not replaced by alternative actions with        similar effects, then either the degree of gender        inequality experienced by some people would decline or the        persistence of gender inequality would become more        problematic. (by the identified group in the        identified conditions)        Analogously, to say that        actions challenge gender inequality means that those        actions, if taken by enough people, result in reducing the        amount of gender inequality or they erode the stability of        gender inequality making it more vulnerable to future        challenges.                    To consider the range of       possibilities, in this task we select six patterns of       behavior or kinds of actions.               Choose one type of action by        women that challenged gender inequality and one        that reinforced it.        Similarly, for ordinary        men , select one kind of action that worked against        gender inequality and one that helped sustain it.        Finally, do the same for men        with power .                    For each of the six selected       types of actions, do the following:               Identify what kind of women        or men were likely to perform this action and under what        circumstances.        Describe the action,        including an assessment of its effects on gender        inequality. This may include consideration of        reasons why its effects might vary (e.g., the number        acting might have to surpass a threshold before there are        widespread effects, the effects might be contingent on        other conditions, the effects might happen after a delay,        and so on).        Try to specify the reasons        why this type of action occurred. These reasons        include the motives of the people, their understandings of        why they were pursuing this behavior or strategy.         The reasons also include the social and cultural        conditions that induce the actions and make them seem        necessary, sensible, and just. The reasons may also        include triggering events.                    To summarize: Pick six kinds of       behavior that have made a difference to the persistence of       gender inequality, one reinforcing and one challenging for       each of the three categories: women, ordinary men, powerful       men. Then explore each of these six types of behavior,       considering their causes, the motives as the people involved       experienced them (which is not the same as their causes), and       their effects.

How do the media    influence or reflect gender inequality?     Commentators often point toward media influence when   they try to explain contemporary gender inequality. Theories of media alert    us that we must always consider reciprocal causal processes. While any    individual may appear only to be the object of media influence, the content    and impact of media depend greatly on the existing culture and social    structure. The relationship of the media to the collective market effect of    consumers may be compared to the relationship between elected public officials    and voters. Also, consumers have considerable freedom to choose which media    outlets to give their attention and people selectively interpret and judge    the media to which they are exposed. All of this makes the relationship    between what is portrayed in the media and what occur in the \"real\" world    rather complex.          Analytical     Task                 Select one kind of popular/mass media, such as magazines or the      cinema, or, alternatively, a form of popular culture thought to      have an analogous impact, such as popular music.       Prepare a simple comparative analysis of current examples to      examples from around 1980, a third of a century ago.             Choose a small, reasonable sample from the two       periods. For example, the samples might be       advertisements from three magazines present in both periods,       or the female and male protagonists of top earning movies, or       the lyrics of the highest rated songs.        Using the dimensions or characteristics identified in the       readings, (or analogous ones that better fit the media you are       assessing), characterize the differences in the ways women and       men are portrayed in the two periods.                   Given the results of your comparisons, show how the data you      observe might be explained by (1) theories stressing the influence      of the media on gender expectations, evaluations, and behavior, or      (2) theories stressing the media as reflecting gender inequality,      or (3) theories stressing market segmentation (audiences choose      among media offerings and media makers aim at audience segments.       Prepare a simple, reasonable response to the questions, \"What is      the basic causal relationship between mass media and gender       inequality?\" and \"How      is the correspondence between media portrayals and real-life      gender inequality sustained over time as gender inequality changes?

How have political     processes and structures sustained men's and women's relative     status? [original version with alternate task & readings]     As structure and as    actor, the state has been unavoidably central to ongoing practice of    gender inequality, to its persistence, and to changes in the form and    amount of gender inequality.      States or governments have power. Through the    military and police, a state can enforce conformity to its rules, repel    and punish challenges from the scale of individual acts to collective    rebellions, and by threat, implicit or explicit, deter rebellions from    appearing. Through the law, regulations, and bureaucratic policies, a    state can define what constitutes acceptable or legitimate behavior at    all levels of social organization. Through economic policies of    taxation, expenditures, and redistributions (such as welfare policies or    agricultural supports), a state influences the relative economic status    of different groups.      By acting differently toward groups with regard to    any of these aspects of government power, a state can create, reinforce,    or exacerbate social inequalities. Analogously, a state can, in theory,    obstruct, destabilize, or diminish social inequality by using its power    in ways that are inconsistent with social inequalities. States    determine, influence, legitimize, and sanction rights and opportunities;    they may do so in more or less egalitarian ways.      When significant, enduring, social inequality    exists, those privileged by that form of inequality will normally have    more influence over the state than do those disadvantaged by the    inequality, and the overall effect of state policies will reinforce the    exercise and persistence of the inequality. A fundamental problem for    all state theories is who or what decides state policies and actions. To    some degree, those \"in\" the state (elected, appointed, hired, or    appropriated) make decisions based on their interests and outlooks as    members of the state apparatus. To some degree, state actors respond to    the influence of power brokers outside the state, such as the    economically powerful. In either case, when making policy or strategic    planning decisions, those influencing state actions are in part    responding to what they perceive will be the responses of all actors in    the nation affected by those decisions.           Analytical      Task                   Task summary: Assess the most       important ways the American state (or some other) has       influenced and been influenced by gender inequality over the       past two hundred years. Try to keep in mind that this       always concerns the accumulation and exercise of social power.              What are the crucial ways that       government reflected gender inequality?                Consider how and why the        state treated women and men differently         Consider ways that the        state helped gender inequality operate smoothly         Consider how the state        helped gender inequality to persist                     How and why has the state       promoted gender equality by reducing the differences in its       treatment of women? How has the state How and why has       the state made it difficult (and irrational) for many to       continue practices that disadvantage women?        How and why have the relevant       government actions changed over time?         While developing the analysis       for this task, it can be helpful to examine how the       relationship between the state and gender inequality resembled       or differed from the state's relationships to other kinds of       inequality.

Most of what we    do, think and feel depends on our understanding of what it means to be    male or female, and on the different expectations people have for men and    women. Every aspect of the institutions, opportunities, and ideas    around us are permeated by gender differences. Our goal is to make    sense of this. Some of the questions we address are:             What do we mean by gender inequality? How does it arise?     Why does it take different forms? Why do some societies have    greater equality than others? How do the various institutions    like the family, the economy and religion affect the social position of    women and men? How do the direct relations between women and    men--as friends, brother and sister, lovers, spouses, parent and child,    colleagues, boss and employee--depend on or affect the social positions    of women and men? Why and when does sex inequality change?             On completing the course, students will know how to assess the major    social and intellectual questions raised by the issue of sex inequality.    Through intensive reading and discussion, this course will give    students the intellectual tools needed to understand and talk about sex    inequality knowledgeably and perceptively. This course also    promotes the growth of general skills in theoretical criticism and social    analysis.         Requirements:         All students must attend class consistently and punctually, join in    class discussion, write brief papers, prepare a \"gender social biography\"    term paper, take quizzes, and take a final exam.         All students should take part in class discussion and those who do an    outstanding job will receive extra credit.         Each student will write a \"gender social biography\" for a term paper.    This paper will try to show how your identity and experiences have    been shaped in conformity with gender expectations and how they have    defied or ignored them. The paper will take into account the various    kinds of social influences and experiences studied in this class.    During the semester, students will write brief gender biography    \"chapters\" for each section of the course, relating the subject of that    section to their gender biography. These will then be incorporated and    revised into the final term paper. Details about the gender social    biography are on another page .    No late papers will be accepted under any conditions.         A final examination will take place in class and cover all of the    course material. This examination will focus on the main ideas of    the materials we read and discuss in class.         Expectations:         A class is a collective learning enterprise. We must all act    responsibly and with decorum or the enterprise fails. We must each try to    avoid making the class less pleasant for others. This means we come    to class on time, pay attention, and avoid disruptive actions such as    talking to those in adjoining seats, eating noisily, and the like.     We will have a lot of discussion, some among all in class, some in    groups. Everyone is always free to disagree with other people's    ideas, but we should all treat everyone else and their ideas    respectfully. Plagiarism or academic dishonesty of any kind will    not be tolerated.

Study Questions                   What do people commonly mean by the distinction between     \u201cgender\u201d and \u201csex?\u201d          Why do people studying gender inequality stress a     distinction between \u201cgender inequality\u201d and \u201cgender     differences?\u201d          While making sense of gender inequality, why do we need to     keep in mind other forms of inequality within a society?          What is the difference between status inequality and     positional inequality?          Why do some authors suggest that the rise of women\u2019s status     over the past two centuries might be considered a paradox while     others suggest that the persistence of gender inequality in recent     decades might be viewed as a paradox?          In what ways has gender inequality declined over the past     150 years?          What are principal ways that gender inequality persists in     the U.S. and similar \u201cmodern\u201d nations according to our sources?          What does Jackson mean when he says that \u201ctwo kinds of     social conflict fueled the decline of gender     inequality\u201d?          What do we mean when we say women and men are     unequal?          What do we mean by saying that women and men have competing     ideologies or myths about gender?          What is the difference between distributional differences     and categorical differences when we are comparing the characteristics     of two groups?          What is problematic about the common cultural explanations     of \u201cdeceptive distinctions\u201d between women and men?          How does \u201cframing\u201d work in Ridgeway\u2019s     analysis?                             II. How is gender inequality symbolized and reproduced in    everyday life?              Gendered Society : The Social    Construction of Gender Relations [111-120, 124-127]          Framed by Gender : Ch. 2 \"A Primary Frame for    Organizing Social Relations\" [important, read carefully]          Gendered Society Reader : Beards,    Breasts, and Bodies: Doing Sex in a Gendered World, Raine    Dozier          Gendered Society Reader : The Gender Similarities    Hypothesis, Janet Shibley Hyde          Gendered Society : \"So, That    Explains It\": Psychoanalytic and Developmental Perspectives on Gender    [86-101, 106-110]                       Study Questions                   Why is it meaningful to say that gender identities are both     voluntary and coerced?          How does gender inequality in modern society influence the power     most men feel they have?          What do people mean when they say institutions are gendered?          Why might some argue that Freud\u2019s theory attributed key gender     differences to biology while others argue that it did not?          How is it possible that gender identity (whether we are male or     female and what it means to be either) is learned (not inherent or     biological), but that we experience it as natural and     unchangeable?          What did Gilligan claim about the relationship between gender and     ethics, and why has the claim been controversial?          How would you explain the term \u201csex roles?\u201d          How does Dozier\u2019s study raise questions about standard ways of     distinguishing \u201csex\u201d from \u201cgender\u201d or claims that gender is socially     constructed by people \u201cdoing gender\u201d in interactions?          What is the \u201cgender similarities hypothesis\u201d and how do research     findings support or not support it?          According to Ridgeway, how are gender stereotypes related to a     general problem of coordinating social interactions? (And can     you identify any serious problems with Ridgeway's argument about this     proposed relationship? This part is very high difficulty.)          How, according to Ridgeway might the existence of framing lead to     social inequality?          According to Ridgeway what is the difference between specific     status beliefs and diffuse status beliefs?                             III.

How has the popularity of     biological explanations varied across historical periods and     cultures?          How is the work of evolutionary psychologists relevant to     the study of gender inequality, and what limits the value of its     contribution?          What seems to be the historical pattern of motives behind     brain research and hormonal research concerned with gender (and     sexuality) differences, and the results they find?          What was the influential argument that Margaret Mead     presented in 1935 book Sex and Temperament in Three Primitive     Societies?          Why are those who study gender inequality so concerned with     the division of labor?          When comparing across societies, what are some of the     conditions that seem to correlate with or indicate high levels of     gender inequality?          What do we know about the relationship between testosterone     levels and violent behavior?          According to Herdt, what is the significance of \u201ccoming     out\u201d rituals?          How does it make sense to think about the role of biology     in the origins of gender inequality?          How and why do we distinguish explaining the origins of     gender inequality from the persistence of gender     inequality?                             IV.

Study Questions                   Summarize important changes in women\u2019s economic     participation over the past 150 years. Among other things, it is     useful to consider differences by period, by type of women, and by     type of job.          How does the movement of women into traditionally male jobs     compare to the movement of men into traditionally female jobs?          How does employment potentially serve as a source of pride,     obligation, resources, negative identity for men and for women?      The goal here is to think through the reasons that women and men seek     and hold jobs and the effects that having (or not having) those jobs     have upon them.          What contributes to the wage/income differential between     women and men?          Explain the \u201cglass ceiling.\u201d          How did goverment policies, laws, and actions influence     women's changing employment in the twentieth century?          According to Ridgeway, how have framing processes     influenced the jobs into which women are hired, women\u2019s promotions,     and women\u2019s wages/salaries?          Why is the analysis of \u201ctokenism\u201d important for     understanding changes in women\u2019s economic participation?          What seem to be the causes and the effects of sexual     harassment?          How can we explain how women\u2019s economic participation has     changed over the long term? Consider the motives and the     actions of women, ordinary men, and powerful men. Also consider     the difference between women\u2019s movement into low-status jobs and     their movement into high-status jobs.          According to Reskin, what causes women\u2019s wages or income to     be lower than that of men, and how does that argument relate to the     ideas present in other readings this week?          How have different kinds of discrimination influenced     women\u2019s experiences in the economy?                             IX. Political processes and individual action. How have    political processes, men, and women each both resisted and furthered    change?

Why do we want to distinguish between ordinary and powerful men while explaining the     persistence and decline of gender inequality?          Responding to changing circumstances, women and men sometimes      adopted new strategies or changed their typical behavior in ways      that contributed to gender inequality\u2019s decline over time.      However, even as they contributed to gender inequality's decline,      they typically did not seek to reduce gender inequality, commonly      did not favor a change in gender expectations, and often did not      even recognize that their actions could or would affect gender      inequality. So, how do we explain this pattern?          Why has men\u2019s defense of gender inequality declined over the past     150 years?          How have the goals of feminist movements been compatible      with (the effects and requirements of) long-term structural      changes in the U.S. and other modern societies? And in what      ways have their goals been in conflict with that long-term      trajectory          Assess the reasoning behind these two claims: \u201cmen have probably     sustained their gender advantages more through competition with other     men than through efforts to keep women from enjoying similar     opportunities or status\u201d; \u201cmen resisting women\u2019s advance      [typically] understood themselves to be fulfilling their      obligations or protecting well-earned rights\u201d.          How did both ordinary men\u2019s interests in opposing improvements in     women\u2019s status and their capacity to do so change over     time?           Writers have suggested that men long opposed women\u2019s movement     into high-status jobs (and women\u2019s access to higher education that     would prepare them for such jobs) because adding women would increase the     competition men would face for promotions and the like. Why is this a     strong or weak argument?          Why are culturally derived beliefs and rational calculations both     important for understanding changes over time in men\u2019s typical     actions that affected gender inequality? (Note that the same question     can be asked about women\u2019s typical actions.)          If most men in positions of organizational power share a     discriminatory attitude towards women, why do we expect any men with     similar organizational power who do not share these discriminatory     biases still to act (in their jobs) largely like their discriminatory     colleagues? (Note this question relates to the general problem of why     people conform, but in this question focuses on the causes specific     to the context of organizational power.)          What do analysts mean by the \u201cmale rebellion\u201d against marriage in     the second half of the twentieth century, and why might it have     occurred?           Why did men in government think differently about the woman     suffrage issue than ordinary male voters? How does this compare     to differences between the ways that employers\u2019 thought about hiring     women and the ways that male workers thought about it?          How do we explain women\u2019s difficulties at achieving economic     power through entrepreneurial success, rising through organizational     ranks, or inheriting wealth?          How do we explain women\u2019s difficulties at achieving political     power, both as individuals and collectively?          How have feminist efforts contributed to the reduction in gender     inequality, and how have those efforts fallen short?                             X. What role does ideology play in determining the relations    between men and women?                   Down So Long: Disputed Ideals: Ideologies of     Domesticity and Feminist Rebellion               Framed by Gender : Ch. 3 \"Cultural Beliefs and the    Gendering of Social Relations\"          Destined for Equality : Institutional Individualism    (all remaining)          Gendered Society Reader : The Feminization of Love,     Francesca M. Cancian                       Study Questions                   What do we mean by institutional     individualism?           How does the impact on family organization made by the rise     of modern education compare to the impact of the rise of modern     industry?           What are the highlights of women\u2019s changing educational     opportunities in the U.S. over the past 150 years?          With respect to the U.S. experience, in what ways is it     likely that the education offered to women and men (at various     levels) influenced gender inequality over the past 150     years?          What were the major influences responsible for the rise of     meritocratic ideas and their increasing     influence?           Why does Ridgeway stress it is important not only that we     hold stereotypical beliefs about gender, but that we can take it for     granted that others hold them as well?          According to Ridgeway, what are the most basic, shared     beliefs about differences between women and men in our culture (we     are concerned with the content of the beliefs, not the     terminology)?          What, according to Ridgeway, decides which gender     stereotypes are embodied in popular beliefs about the differences     between women and men?          Why do people who privately hold \"alternative\" gender     beliefs seemingly still commonly act on the basis of the dominant     beliefs, particularly in their \u201cpublic\u201d     lives?           Why did the ideologies of female domesticity change over     time?          If men did not impose the content of the successive     ideologies of female domesticity, what     did?           What common characteristics of the otherwise diverse ideals     of female domesticity made them seem to work for both women and men     and for the acceptability of gender inequality to     both?          With respect to the determination of dominant ideologies,     what is the relevant common underlying idea in the Marxist concept of     \u201cdetermination within limits\u201d, the Weberian idea of \u201celective     affinity\u201d, and Merton\u2019s concept of \u201cfunctional     alternatives?\u201d          What does Cancian mean when she says, \u201cPart of the reason     that men seem so much less loving than women is that their behavior     is measured with a feminine ruler\u201d?                                 XI. What does the future hold?

According to Ridgeway, what are the key conditions that are     obstructing, and could even reverse, the shifts toward gender     equality?          According to Ridgeway, why do gender stereotypes survive     disconfirming evidence?          How does Ridgeway use the idea of \"cultural lag?\"          According to Jackson, what are the principal causes of gender     inequality's decline?          According to Jackson, what are the main components of arguments     that the movement toward gender inequality is severely     threatened?          What, according to Jackson, are the principal defects in     arguments contending that our movement toward greater gender equality     may be stopped or even turned back?          How have interests affecting gender inequality changed over time     for important categories of men, women, and organizations? Are there     important relevant interests that have not changed much?          With respect to actions relevant to gender inequality, compare     how women's behaviors and life cycle patterns have changed with     analogous changes in men's lives."}, {"content": "%PDF-1.4 %  75

                        http://www.nyu.edu/classes/jackson/causes.of.gender.inequality                                      In this course we will     investigate what causes inequality between women and     men . How does it arise, why      does it take different forms, why does it vary in     degree across societies, what are the components     that add up to gender inequality, how do various     institutions and practices contribute to it, and how      does it change? The course will emphasize the history of gender     inequality in the United States.     While we focus on gender     inequality, we will also    seek to understand social causation more generally. We will explore    the diverse ways social causation works and how we can identify the causes    behind important social phenomena.

Table of Contents                              Description \u2013 Scope, Organization, and Access:      The Scope of the Topics and Materials.      We know a lot about gender inequality \u2013 its history, how people     experience it in their lives, the ways it varies in intensity and form     across time and place, the beliefs that make it seem natural, and much     more. The outpouring of research and commentary on gender     inequality over the past half century has been extraordinary.      Unfortunately, despite all this, our understanding of what causes     gender inequality remains troubled. Both ordinary people and experts     (such as scholars) commonly fluctuate between simplistic explanations     that founder under close scrutiny and throwing up their hands in     frustration over what can seem an enigma beyond human     comprehension. Here we will seek to surmount this dilemma.      We will explore diverse facets of gender inequality and varied ideas     about what causes might be decisive. We will also look carefully     at the ways we can identify and verify the causes of social     phenomena. Through these efforts we will aim both to enhance our     understanding of what produces gender inequality and to improve our     general ability to do causal social analyses effectively.      The class     organization and goals. In this class, each week's work will     be organized around an analytical task, as well as a set of     readings. Rather than focusing on discussion of the readings,     the analytical tasks involve attempting a causal analysis of some     aspect of gender inequality related to the week's issue, building on     the materials we read (in brief papers of a couple pages). The     approach in this class seeks to develop analytical skills as well as     understandings of the relevant literature by stressing doing actual     analyses of gender inequality. (Note: this class does not have an exam     nor a final paper.)      All class meetings are organized as discussions. Part of our     class discussions will be on the common readings and part on students'     efforts to explore the analytical tasks each week. We will     adjust the time devoted to these two goals according to our     experiences over the class. Every week, students will initiate     discussions on readings and papers. To make this work, each week's     papers will be exchanged (electronically) with enough lead time that     we can all read all the papers prior to the class meetings.      Each topic below includes \u2013 beside the common readings \u2013     three other subsections. These are: an analytical task ,     recommended readings , and related readings . The analytical task is the writing     assignment for the week. Everyone should read the common     readings while doing the analytical task (and be prepared to     discuss them). In each of these papers \u2013 always brief      papers \u2013 students will try out causal ideas related to the week's     topic. Recommended and     related readings are optional      materials useful for those who want to dig deeper into a topic.      To simplify navigating through the syllabus, these subsections are     hidden until the viewer clicks on the subsection heading, then they     will appear.      Most of our readings will be articles available for downloading.      The links will appear in the online version of the course     syllabus. Excerpts from Down So Long . . .: The Puzzling     Persistence of Gender Inequality (book manuscript by RMJ not yet     published) will similarly be available for downloading from the class web     site. (As we will read selections from Jackson's book Destined     for Equality [Harvard U Press] throughout the course, you might     want to buy it or borrow it.)      Any student unfamiliar with the study of gender, can (and probably     should) pick up the basics from a standard textbook in the area \u2013 I     recommend Michael Kimmel's Gendered Society (which I use in my     basic general undergraduate class on gender, so used copies should be     easy to find).      For further relevant sources, my reading lists/syllabi for two     graduate courses might be valuable. The one most directly     related is      What Causes Gender Inequality:     Analytical Foundations ; a more general class,           What Causes Inequality: Analytical     Foundations , may provide materials for broader     questions about different kinds of inequalities and how to think about     gender inequality in relationship to them.       A note      on the \"hidden\" material below : Each section of     this guide includes \u2013 beside the common readings \u2013 three     subsections, one for an analytical task , one for recommended     readings , and one for related readings . To     simplify navigating through the course guide, only the headings for     these subsections are initially visible. The contents of all     these subsections are hidden (so that the beginning appearance of the     page is similar to a standard syllabus) until the viewer clicks on a     subsection heading, then its contents will appear. While this     organization is helpful for negotiating the page most of the time, it     can become an obstacle if we want to search the page (for example, for     a particular article) as searches will ignore the hidden material     (that is, if you search a page you are viewing in an internet browser,     the search will only examine what is shown on the page at that time).      To overcome this limitation, you can \"open\" all the hidden sections to     show everything on the page by clicking the \u00a7 symbol at the top of the     page. (To restore the page to the normal condensed view, simply     reload the page which will collapse all the \"hidden\" sections to their     usual look). The table of contents at the top of this page will     aid speedy navigation to any topic, which is particularly helpful if     you reveal all the \"hidden\" material.                              The Topics                I. Introduction. What    do we mean by gender inequality?     To analyze the causes of gender     inequality, we need to know what we mean by gender     inequality. How can we conceive of and talk about     gender inequality in ways that are general enough to apply across the     range of relevant phenomena, consistent enough to minimize conceptual     ambiguities, and precise enough to be analytically effective?      Gender inequality has been extraordinarily diverse and wide     spread. Women and men are unequal in every conceivable way in     endless circumstances, both immediate and enduring, by both objective     criteria and subjective experience. So, what counts as gender     inequality? Can we characterize it in ways that let us confidently and     impartially assess when there is more or less of it?          Analytical     Task                 No task for the introductory meeting.

II. Causality - What are causes,    mechanisms, and the like?     We casually refer to causes and effects in normal   interactions all the time. We all conduct our lives \u2013 choosing actions,   making decisions, trying to influence others \u2013 based on theories about why   and how things happen in the world. From the early stages of childhood   we attribute causes, building a vision of the social (and physical) world   that makes it understandable. Every action, every choice about what to   do, is based on our anticipation of its effects, our understandings of   consequences. Analytical and scientific reasoning has a similar form,   but requires that we approach causation more systematically and   self-consciously.          Analytical     Task                 The general      analytical problem . In this and other societies,      women and men commonly dress differently. Prepare a      causal analysis that seeks to explain why women and men dress      differently .              Our analytical task this week is to attempt a \"simple\"       causal analysis of a gender difference that is obvious but not       often questioned - the way we dress. The purpose of this       exercise is to get us thinking about causality.        To the degree that we can, we want to try to think of       different kinds of causes based on varied ways of framing the       causal question. Realistically, one could easily write a       book about all the possible ways of interpreting this causal       question and answering it. We are just trying to develop       some sensible insights in a couple pages.                   Thinking Tools .       The starting point of most causal analyses is a comparison.       When we start with the general question \"what causes X?\" we turn      it into possible comparisons to produce an answer. Examples      of such questions might be \"why do people in group A do X more      than those in group B?,\" \"why does X occur more often in summer      than winter?,\" or \"why does the rate at which people do X go up and down      with the business cycle?\" The underlying idea is simple but      powerful. If we are trying to explain some phenomenon, X,      then we need to identify variations in the likelihood of X or the      rate of X, and look for potential causes that (1) vary across the      relevant circumstances in a way that could explain X and (2) that      we can connect to the outcomes for X in some way. For      example, with the gender distinctive clothing question, some ways      to better specify the question and look at it through comparisons      are:              What causes individual       conformity to the cultural pattern? What       induces women and men to conform to the expectations for       dressing differently? Whenever we observe a consistent       pattern of social behavior, some common conditions or       processes must be inducing people to act in a similar       way. Figuring out what encourages conformity and       discourages deviance allows us to provide a causal       explanation. Think about what happens to people who do       not conform to the expectations about male and female       appropriate clothing. And, just as important, ask why it       is that people punish nonconformists. Here the basic       comparison is between people who conform and those who do not,       or between the reactions of people to conformity and       nonconformity.        What causes differences       in dress \"codes\" across cultures? What circumstances       could exist across societies that consistently produce gender       differences in modes of dress? The clothing       characteristic of each sex varies greatly across societies       (and time). Clothing differs between \"primitive\"       cultures and modern ones, between warm and cold climates, and       between different parts of the world. But seemingly       everywhere men and women dress differently. How can we       explain this pattern? Here the primary comparison is       between cultures that have different clothing.        Why do the expectations       about clothing differences vary by context ? Why       are gender differences in dress greater in some circumstances       than in others? For example, both women and men may wear       similar coveralls in a factory, but women and men generally       wear dramatically different clothing to formal dances.        Our efforts to find causes behind any phenomena are improved       by looking at variations. If male and female clothing is       just a little different in some contexts but greatly different       in others, we can usefully focus on what might produce this       variance in gender differences. Here the primary       comparison is between contexts with greater differences in the       expected clothing and contexts with lesser differences.                   Thinking Tools 2 .       While considering how to explain the differences in the ways      women and men dress, it can also be helpful to think through       ways that this pattern could be considered an example of a       larger pattern. The explanation for the broader pattern       may be different or easier to develop. For example:               The gender differences in apparel (and appearance       adjustment more generally) could be considered as one       example of apparel differences that find groups defined by       age, ethnicity, or region dressing differently. That       is to say, it is not only women and men who consistently       dress differently. Different ways of dressing also       distinguish other groups. If we think about those       other groups, does it give us insights into explaining the       difference between women's and men's clothing?        The gender differences in dress could be considered as one       example of a wider range of behavioral differences between       women and men such as rules of proper decorum, speech       patterns, or displays of sexuality. That is, we can       point to other presentational differences between women and       men. If we think about the range of these       presentational differences, do they suggest ideas that might       help explain differences in apparel?

How is gender inequality    symbolized and reproduced in everyday life?     To start our investigation of the causes of gender   inequality, we will consider how people experience and act out gender in   their day to day lives. We want to think about the most basic   questions. Why and when do women and men act differently? Why   and when do people respond differently to women than men? How do all   these private individual actions when taken together over time influence the   understanding of gender in a culture and gender inequality?          Analytical     Task                  The general       analytical problem . Using a typical setting       where women and men meet, assess how Ridgeway's framing       approach helps explain the role of gender in these       interactions and where it might fall short.               For this task, we choose some familiar (to us) setting        or type of interaction where women and men typically        engage each other. For example, this could be a        workplace, a bar, interactions between buyers and sellers,        or parties. We use this as our source of empirical        data and focus our argument on explaining gender        interactions there.         First, we need to read Ridgeway's argument        carefully. Then we try to apply her argument to the        setting we have chosen.         We want to assess how much we believe people's actions (in        the context we chose) fit the expectations we can derive        from her argument and when they might not. As we        work on our analyses, we are evaluating Ridgeway's        approach as a tool. The right tool allows us to construct        a better edifice with less effort; the wrong tool does        not.                      Thinking tools .       The remaining notes for this analytical task look at some       analytical steps that allow us to think through this problem       effectively.               Systematic steps in        the analysis . Doing this kind of thought        experiment, we want our thinking to be as systematic as        possible. For all systematic causal analyses, we        want to consider how the phenomenon being examined varies        in regular or predictable ways across conditions,        settings, types of people, places, or the like. Then, we        ask what conditions or events typically precede or occur        along with the outcomes that could plausibly influence        those outcomes.                 For example, first, we simply consider possible         differences between men's and women's actions.          Then we consider how their actions might differ         between opposite-sex and same-sex encounters.          We can broaden the range of the examples we use to         think about these differences by considering other         characteristics that might affect interactions, such         as the age or race of the people, whether the         interaction is cordial or unfriendly, how well the         people know each other, and so on.          We want to ask ourselves if the gender aspect of the         interaction will be influenced by these other         circumstances that seem relevant to interactions. For         example, does gender influence cordial interactions         differently from the ways it influences confrontations         in our setting? If we believe the answer         is yes, then we consider how and why.          Analogously, we want to think about the ways that         people's goals in gendered interactions vary in these         kinds of circumstances, and how these goals influence         their actions. For example, in the same setting,         a person seeking sex will commonly act differently         than someone trying to curry favor or sell a product.                  When we apply a systematic logic to the analysis, we         usually do not want to write about all the         possibilities we think about. Instead, we use         the ones that we find telling. But we will not         identify those telling possibilities unless we         systematically work through all the relevant possible         influences.                         Gender context .        We can take the analysis of interactions another step by        considering how the influence of gender on these        interactions is potentially affected by conditions like:                 the presence or absence of onlookers (i.e., the         relative privacy of the interaction) or          the gender distribution of other people present         (i.e., mostly male, mostly female, or mixed)                         Conformity .         Whenever we try to explain patterns like this, we want to        consider the exceptions. When will people violate        the implications of gender expectations and what follows        when they do? Are there circumstances that make it        more likely people will depart from conventional        behavior? Violations of norms or common expectations        are valuable for causal analyses because cracks in the        veneer of social order can reveal its structure and        dynamics.                      Bring it       together . After working through the steps       above, we try to assess when Ridgeway's approach does a good       job explaining how gender influences behavior in our chosen       setting, and when her approach seems to fall short. Do       we see ways that her approach neglects or misunderstands       important causes influencing the gender character of behavior       in the context we examine? Our central goal here is to       explain how and why gender organizes interactions in our       chosen example. We are not attempting a general evaluation of       Ridgeway's ideas, but a focused assessment of their       effectiveness in the setting we have selected to try them out.

And how does    explaining the \"origins\" of gender inequality relate to explaining the    \"persistence\" of gender inequality?     Although some scholars may question if    women have been subordinate in all societies, all agree that men have been   dominant in most societies although the degree of dominance varies   greatly. This raises the very tricky question, how do we explain the   prevalence of male dominance? This exceedingly elusive question   continues to elude any answer that will evoke a consensus.          Analytical     Task                  Analytical Task       Alternative 1: An analytical critique . As most       of us lack the substantive knowledge needed to develop even       simple analyses of gender inequality's possible origins, we       will explore the causal possibilities by responding to the       arguments of people who are knowledgeable.               Please read the \" Basics of Causal        Descriptions \" on a separate page for some simple,        beginning ideas about describing a causal analysis.         Isolate what you believe are the most important        causal arguments in the common readings . Give        a critical assessment of their different approaches .         In doing this, try to pay attention to what it is that        makes you find the causal arguments more or less        persuasive. The recommended and related readings        provide a range of material that you can look at as you        need to deepen and sharpen your arguments.                       It can be helpful to look back at the material from        Topic II, especially Gerring's list of criteria for causal        arguments.                      Analytical Task       Alternative 2: A hypothetical scenario . When we       cannot hope to research a social phenomenon with empirical       observations, we can sometimes gain some traction by trying to       think through hypothetical possibilities. Here is an       example.               Assume that sometime in the near future we launch a        rocket into space with a crew of 1,000. This crew is        evenly divided between women and men, the women and men        have similar credentials and accomplishments, and the two        sexes are about equally represented at each level of        authority. The crew members' cultural understandings        are similar to those of college students today.         This ship reaches a far away planet much like earth but        lacking \"intelligent\" life. Unfortunately, the        ship's engines have become unstable and the crew must        abandon it. So they must start life on this new        planet. While they possess much advanced knowledge,        they have no technology. They must start from        scratch, producing food, organizing themselves into a        community, pairing off to reproduce, slowly building        toward some kind of technological development over        generations. [Note: If the distant planet scenario        seems unnerving, we could have the same effect by dropping        a 1,000 people on a remote island that is isolated as a        social experiment.]         Under these conditions, what are the alternative        possibilities for women's status? What might decide        which alternative occurs?

What determines men's and    women's roles and positions within families?     Family and kinship are potentially relevant to gender   inequality in varied ways and a lot of work had pursued such issues.    Probably the two most important general issues involve the ways that women   and men are unequal within families and the ways that family organization   both contributes to and is influenced by gender inequality beyond the family   institution. We will just touch the surface of these issues this week.          Analytical     Task                  The general       analytical problem . We want to provide an       integrated analytical overview of the principal causal       arguments about gender inequality and family organization that       appear in the common readings.        Each of the readings has various causal arguments about       family organization, some directly about gender inequality,       some relevant to gender inequality but not directly exploring       it. Some of the causal questions may receive different       causal analyses by these authors. Sometimes two or more       authors may use a similar causal approach to explain different       causal problems. Our goal is to sort this out.        Our overviews should be organized around the causal       arguments, not        a series of summaries of what each author wrote (see Thinking       Tools).        Thinking tools .               We want to use one of the following two possible ways to        organize the causal assessment (unless one of us has a        better way). The first organizes around what is to        be explained, the second around the causes.                 First approach .          We start by identifying the principal causal problems         addressed by the group of papers. That is, we         figure out what they suggest needs to be         explained. Then, we organize these causal         problems in a sensible order (including consideration         of some problems potentially being secondary or         sub-problems of others). Under each causal         problem, we summarize and assess all the relevant         explanations found in the readings.          Second approach .          We start by identifying the principal causal         frameworks used in the papers. That is, we         figure out what they suggest are the conditions or         processes that have the most important influence over         the outcomes. Then, we organize these causal         frameworks in a sensible order, taking into account         which are entirely different and which might be         variations of a similar theme, and which are competing         versus complementary. For each of these, after         summarizing the causal logic of the framework, we show         how it has been used by these authors, describing the         range of outcomes the framework is supposed to         determine and how it has such effects.          Note that         regardless which way we organize our analysis of         competing causal arguments, it can be valuable to         think about not only what is          considered by the authors being examine, but also         which theoretical questions and which causal         frameworks seem relevant but absent.                         Please reread the \" Basics of Causal        Descriptions \" on the starting point for describing a        causal analysis.                      Bringing it       together . In short, our aim is to produce a       critical overview of the principal causal arguments concerning       the family and gender inequality, starting with the ideas       present in the common readings for this week. To do this       effectively, we need to identify all the relevant causal       arguments, deduce the logical structure of each causal       argument and determine how to present that clearly (even if       the original source is inconsistent or ambiguous), detect how       the causal arguments (from different sources) relate to each       other and present them in a way that makes those relations       clear, and, where possible, summarize the important analytical       strengths and weaknesses of each argument (or facet to an       argument).       (We should start with the understanding that this kind of       analytical overview is rather easy to do poorly and very       demanding to do well and thoroughly. At this stage we       are not aspiring to a professional job but hoping to achieve       a reasonable, if basic, analysis.)                             Common Readings           Andrew J.

What is the role of    sexuality?     Sexuality has been evoked in     multiple ways in the study of gender inequality. Some have     considered it as a possible motivating cause for inequality, others have     explored how gender inequality can mold the experience and practice of     sexuality, and others have tried to theoretically incorporate     sexuality as a peculiar tension between women and men that mediates     both the causes and effects of gender inequality. Essentially,     everyone recognizes sexuality is critically important to gender     inequality, but we lack agreement or clarity on how it matters.          Analytical     Task                 The general analytical      problem . Our central task this week is to propose a      causal account that plausibly explains the relationship between one      aspect of sexuality and gender inequality.              Everyone who analyzes gender inequality considers sexuality       important, but they have highly varied ideas about what       matters and why. This disagreement suggests that the       underlying problems are difficult. We cannot       hope to solve them in this brief effort. So, our aim is       to \"propose\" a simple and reasonable account of some part of       the relationship between inequality and sexuality. We are        not trying to develop a full, professional analysis.        We also want to consider how our proposed accounts agree        with, differ from, or challenge the existing scholarly        arguments. Again, our goal here is limited. The        aim is to give a reasonable first sense of how the proposed        account fits (or does not fit).                   Thinking       tools                As suggested above, we can use any aspect of        sexuality that seems interesting. However, it may        help if the selected facet of sexuality:                 has a relationship to gender inequality that at         least some writers think is important. Which way         it is important is wide open. The role of the         chosen sexuality characteristic relative to gender         inequality may be cause, effect, catalyst, or whatever         else seems causally relevant.          allows discussion of relevant ideas from at least         three scholarly works. These may be part of the         common readings, any of the other readings recommended         here, or another legitimate source. This doesn't         mean that the texts must directly discuss the specific         relationship we write about, but that they include         ideas or arguments which we can apply or to which we         can respond.                         A basic approach to the task presentation might have the        following three parts:                 First, we lay out the causal, explanatory         problem. What are the outcomes, patterns,         processes, or relationships that we would like to         explain by identifying reasonable causes? And         why is this important enough to merit attention? (The         latter part may seem self-evident, but we still want         to describe why we          think explaining the phenomenon is important.)          Second, we provide the causal analysis. We         want to be as complete as possible within reasonable         space limits. And, we want to be clear, simple,         and direct.          Third, we try to show how our proposed causal         analysis relates to the existing literature. For         our purposes, we can limit ourselves to considering a         couple theories or perspectives that would support or         compliment our approach and a couple that would be         likely to question our proposed causal analysis.          (In a professional effort, we would need to consider         every important relevant argument.) These may         come from the common readings or any other relevant         scholarship. When discussing those who might         disagree, we want to be as specific as possible about         what criticism we would expect from each of these         \"opponents\" and how we might respond.                                      Bringing it       together . In short, our aim is to construct a       basic causal argument seeking to understand how some aspect of       sexuality is related to gender inequality, and to assess how       that causal argument relates to the existing literature (as       represented in our readings).

Attempts to explain gender inequality at all levels are   haunted by essentialism . Essentialist arguments impute   distinctive attributes to women and men and attribute the social differences   between women's and men's activities, opportunities, statuses, and roles to   these distinct attributes. Even theoretical analyses of gender   inequality that expressly reject the possibility of consequential, inherent   sex differences, commonly build their explanations of inequality on   gender differences. To complicate matters, essentialist arguments   proclaiming superior attributes for women exist alongside of the arguments   proclaiming women inferior. Moreover, while for some, essentialism   always means a difference based in biology or genetics, for others it   includes cultural differences that are embodied in women and men.          Analytical     Task                 The general analytical problem .      To investigate how essentialist arguments work, we will      examine how different kinds of essentialist arguments might be      applied to explain some aspect of gender inequality, in contrast      to a non-essentialist argument. We aim to see both the      attraction of essentialist arguments and the possibilities for      alternatives.             Select one form or facet of gender inequality that you will       try to explain for this task. This instance or aspect of       gender inequality should be sufficiently important,       widespread, and enduring or recurring to merit thoughtful       theory and explanation. It should also be narrow or       specific enough that the goal of explaining it is       plausible. For example, the facet might be that wives       commonly defer to husbands.        For the selected type or aspect of gender inequality, you       will suggest five alternative explanations, each one       representing a different approach to explaining such social       phenomena. The explanations should be succinct but       clear. They should also be plausible to the extent that       a reasonable person might make such an argument. Plausible       does not mean true, of course. Rather, we are trying to       imagine an argument that would seem plausible to people who       are advocates for each of the perspectives.                   The five types of explanation .       Attempt to devise the best explanations you can for the relevant      facet of inequality from each of the following      perspectives. Explanations may be categorized in many      ways. The five perspectives defined here are meant to engage      different responses to the problem of essentialism.              Direct biological - Devise an explanation claiming       that some biological difference between the sexes produces the       relevant aspect of inequality by making women and men act       differently. For example, an argument might be that men       are stronger than women so men dominate women as a simple       result of superior strength. (More complex biological       explanations might be derived from evolutionary       psychology.) This type of explanation is usually purely       essentialist. Note that this type of explanation can be       divided further into those relying on real biological       differences and those imputing fictional biological       differences. Let us stress biological differences that       are at least potentially real here, leaving the fictitious       ones for below.        Indirect biological - Formulate an explanation       claiming some biological difference does not directly       produce the inequality, but the biological difference has       important effects or implications of some sort, and those       effects that make likely or unavoidable the emergence or       persistence of the selected aspect of gender inequality.        For example, someone might argue that women's child bearing       makes them anxious about the welfare of their children, and       that anxiety makes them feel weak and in want of a protector,       leading them to defer to husbands. Or, others might       suggest that women's biologically induced child rearing       orientation encourages both women and men to make men       responsible for warfare, and that men's resulting skill at       combat, their possession of weapons, and men's organization       around mutual defense leaves wives typically in their       husbands' control. The key for this type of explanation       is that the relevant biological differences do not directly       cause the gender inequality being explained, but have effects       on social behavior and social organization that lead to gender       inequality. These types of explanations have       essentialist origins in a biological difference, but the       explanation as a whole may invoke mediating causal influences       that reduce the essentialist quality, sometimes greatly.        Non-biological sex difference - Suggest how       some socially constructed difference between women and men \u2013       one that is neither biological nor a direct result of       biological differences \u2013 initiates or preserves the aspect of       gender inequality being explained. This will usually be       an enduring individual characteristic (a difference that       people carry with them, not a difference in their       circumstances). For example, one might claim that women       are fearful and dependent because of socialization processes       (that have no biological basis), and this psychological       condition induces wives to defer to their husbands. Or,       one might argue that childhood sports available only to boys       result in a higher competitive drive that accounts for adult       men's greater success in business. This type of       explanation claims a real difference exists between women and       men (in the society or social context where the inequality       being explained occurs; the relevant sex difference need not       exist in all or any other society or social context), but this       difference is a social construction. This type of       explanation often becomes redundantly circular: each aspect of       inequality exists as a result of inequality, and that overall       inequality is constituted by the various aspects.        Fictitious sex difference - An imputed sex       difference that does not really exist is claimed to play a       significant role in producing the selected facet of gender       inequality. For example, someone might suggest that       although women have no better capacity for child rearing,       people commonly assume they do because women bear children,       and that this false expectation produces a division of labor       and power favoring men. This type of explanation focuses       on the consequences of beliefs, relying on the observation       that beliefs can organize behavior even if they are false       beliefs. While such fictitious differences are commonly       assumed to be biological, they need not be.        Causes independent of sex differentiation - A       causal process that does not involve any difference between       the sexes is argued to produce the inequality being       considered. For example, some might argue that for       families to fulfill their social functions effectively, they       need one spouse/parent to perform the critical emotional       actions needed and the other spouse/parent to perform the       practical and leadership actions (this is essentially a       well-know idea of Talcott Parsons). This role       differentiation can then result in spouse inequality, as an       indirect and unintended consequence. This category       includes highly diverse explanations, the one critical       similarity among them being that they do not rely on a sex       difference in their central causal argument. It may be       worth noting that one reason explanations based on sex       differences (including all the preceding perspectives) are       more common is that formulating a plausible analysis that       forgoes the mechanism of sex differences is often a hard task.                         (Note, in this task we are aiming to produce explanations that      those advocating each of the above types of explanation would      think are reasonable. It is often hardest to conceive good      explanations from the points of view we find unconvincing or      unappealing, but the capacity to do this is a valuable skill.)       Bringing it together .       The point of this exercise is to examine how it is possible to      devise a range of alternative causal explanations of gender      inequality stressing some mechanism of sex differences, while      developing alternative theories that do not rely on sex      differences is rather hard. The difference arguments run the      full range from being directly and fully biological to relying on      non-biological or fictitious differences in indirect ways.       The arguments that exclude not only biology but all dependence on      sex differences commonly derive from another theoretical approach,      such as functionalism or conflict theories. The challenge      with these approaches is not only to make the immediate causal      process eschew differences, but to avoid relying on sex      differences one or two steps earlier in the causal chain.

What is the role of     violence and intimidation in the relationships between men and     women?     Most theoretical approaches to gender inequality   suggest that violence between women and men plays a role in sustaining   inequality; some also point toward violence as an initial    cause. A recurring issue concerns the degree to which violence is an   expression or result of gender inequality or, alternatively, is a cause of   inequality. The separate roles of rape, harassment, and domestic   violence, and their relationships to each other are another critical   question. Much research and argument has also been focused on the   question of women's aggressive impulses and actions.          Analytical     Task                 Analytical Task 1:      Explain why women do not engage in sexual harassment or sexual      violence at anything like the rates that men do? Our      strategy is to reverse the usual way people approach the problem      of gender violence.              When people refer to the patterns of violence between women       and men (in modern societies), they are usually referring to       several distinctive patterns including sexual violence       (particularly rape), sexual harassment, and intimate partner       violence (which includes wife battering). These       categories implicitly distinguish patterns of aggression based       on several criteria: the degree to which the aggressive acts       involve sexuality, the severity of the aggressive acts, and       the relationship between the man and woman. These       aggressive actions in these categories are all related to       gender inequality both in that inequality engenders them and       that they reinforce gender inequality. They are       particularly linked in their contributions to women\u2019s fear and       sense of physical vulnerability. And that fear is       crucial. For it is the prospect of possible violence       that induces women to restrict their behavior, to seek male       protectors, and to heed men\u2019s wishes.        Here, to simplify our task, we will set aside the question       of intimate partner violence.        To begin, you might consider what determines the actions of       women that do or do not lead to violence and how those       immediate determinants differ from the determinants for       men. Men vary greatly, so you must decide if you will       abstract away all that variation (to talk of \"men\" in the most       generic or abstract possible manner) or if you feel that some       variations (e.g. wealth or age) require consideration.        Remember that you can restrict the scope of your analysis.               Potential determinants include beliefs, resources,        opportunities, the anticipated consequences of alternative        actions         Another way to look at it is the old detective's script:        motives, means, opportunity         It is commonly useful to start your reasoning        concretely, using what you know best. Think about        the kinds of people you know best, either through personal        experience or from studying them. Try to explain        concretely why the women do not engage in sexual        harassment or sexual violence more. This gives you a        starting point.               Expect to develop your argument backwards from the concrete       beginnings. This means that after you assemble your       first round explanation of what directly influences women's       actions, you take those explanatory conditions as the problem       to explain in the second. For example, if you used       women's beliefs about violence as an immediate cause of their       restrained violence, then you next need to consider why they       have different beliefs from men. You want to produce at       least two levels of the causal analysis, and see if you can do       three.        Please take the time to look over the lists of Recommended       and Related Readings. You are likely to find some work       there what will shorten the time needed to complete this task.                              Analytical Task 2 : Try      to develop a clear causal analysis of the role played in      gender inequality by a fear of violence.                    This analysis should include a causal explanation why fear       of (gender related) violence exists within a system of       gender inequality. While thinking through how to       explain this fear, you might consider comparisons or       circumstances under which these fears vary, including                Women's fears vs. men's fears         The circumstances under which women experience greater        fear and those where they feel safe         Differences in the amount of fear typical amongst        groups or categories of women according to their age,        affluence, location, companions, or any other relevant        social condition         Differences in the distribution of fear across        societies distinguished by such conditions as forms of        economic and political organization, degree of        development, prevailing religious or cultural        institutions and the like                       This analysis should also include a causal explanation of       the consequences for gender inequality of the distribution       of fears of violence. In what ways do fears of       violence influence the behavior of women or the       relationships between women and men? Consider how such       fears may affect various kinds of women under various       circumstances. But remember to return to aggregate       effects \u2013 it is the impact of these fears on the pattern of       women's experiences and behavior that affects gender       inequality writ large.        Avoid the analytic temptation to argue as if equality       might imply an absence of discord and aggression.        Realistically, equality between two groups by itself only       leads us to expect that acts of aggression will occur with       equal frequency and effect between members of the two       groups. Removing inequality as a source of discord       should reduce one kind of frustrations that motivate       aggression. Other sources of discord still exist,       however, and some forms of aggression that would be       suppressed by inequality might even rise.        Try to introduce appropriate connections between the       argument(s) you present and the readings. Consider not       only the common readings from this week, but also past       readings and optional ones from this week that seem       particularly relevant.        The causal arguments should try to conform to the       standards for a good causal argument that we have read about       and discussed. Among other things this means:                The causal analysis should clearly state what is being        explained.         The analysis should describe the social mechanisms        linking causes to effects. It should show what        happens in the world that produces the outcomes, what        kinds of people or organizations behave in manner, what        circumstances arise that induce the relevant behavior,        and so forth. This may be abstract at the level of        the causal model.         The analysis should consider why the decisive        causes exist and take the form that they do. That        is, the causal analysis should push back at least one        step past the causes being invoked to ask what causes        them.         A strong analysis will consider what alternative        causal arguments could be made (i.e., how the causal        processes could be different from what you describe) and        show what evidence or logic favors the argument you have        presented. A thorough causal analysis will        recognize that other causal models might be considered        plausable, and try to compare the causal model being        promoted to the alternatives.         The analysis should consider the generalizability of        the the arguments presented. It should consider to        what periods, places, types of societies, parts of        society, kinds of social relationships or interactions        do the arguments apply?         Most will find it difficult to do all of the above        effectively, so consider it suggestions about what would        be ideal, then apply your judgment about allocating your        time and effort.

How has the economy    influenced men's and women's positions in society?     Analyses of gender inequality attribute great   importance to the economy. Gender inequality appears everywhere   embedded in economic inequality, in the sense that a critical aspect of   gender inequality involves unequal access to economic resources and   positions. This relationship becomes clearer in more \"advanced\"   societies where economic organization has become institutionally   differentiated from kinship and political organization. Sometimes this   unequal economic access is understood as an expression of gender inequality,   sometimes a cause of gender inequality, sometimes a result. Many analyses   consider it all three.          Analytical     Task                 Analytical Task       1: Develop a causal analysis of economic inequality between      women and men that accounts for two empirical observations, one      being the earnings inequality between the sexes by the gender      composition of major occupational categories, the other being the      changing likelihood that wives will earn more than their husbands.              The data to be explained can be found in three tables (click to see) .        Use the tabs at the bottom to switch between tables.               The first table shows the 2012 earnings gap in the 20        occupational categories that have the largest number of        females. These have been sorted by the proportion        female. The numbers in dark red show the earnings        gap where women also account for two-thirds or more of the        those in the occupational category.         The second table shows the same kind of data as the        first, but is for the 20 occupational categories that have        the largest number of males. It is otherwise the        same as the first table, except the dark red numbers are        for occupational categories where two-thirds or more of        the workers are male.         The third table shows the changing proportion of married        couples where the wife earns more than the husband over        the 25 years up to 2011.                      Preliminary to developing an analysis, the first task is,       of course, to interpret what the data in the tables tell us       about economic inequality between women and men. It is       recommended that you focus on the dark red numbers of all the       tables. The first two tables are meant to be interpreted       as one.        The main task is to develop a background analysis of gender       inequality in the economy, as it exists today and how it has       changed over the past several decades. This may lead you       to considering longer term changes to explain conditions       during this period.        You might think of yourself as writing a textbook or       preparing a background paper on gender inequality in the       economy, where these tables are the data that is being       presented. Your goal is to offer an understanding of       these tables.        One way to think about this is in terms of what we don't see       in the tables.               Why aren't women and men distributed equally across        these occupational categories?         Why are women's earnings lower?         Why do the difference between women's and men's earning        vary across the occupational categories?         Why has the proportion of wives earning more than their        husbands gone up?         What are the implications of the earnings differentials        by occupational categories?         What are the implications of the data on wives'        earnings?         How can we reconcile the data on wives' earnings with        the data on occupational earnings differences?                      In short, we are aiming at a brief explanation of women's       vs. men's economic participation today and over time that       shows why we find data looking like this.                   Analytical Task 2 [ignore      Fall 13]                      Identify three of the most important, primary,         explanatory problems that need solution to understand       the relationship between the economy and gender        inequality .                 Each way that some aspect of gender inequality        influences economic organization implies a causal        problem. Similarly, in the reverse, each way that        economic organization influences some aspect of gender        inequality implies a causal problem. For example,        women used to have no access to most high-status        positions in the American economy and are now still        under represented in them. In either direction we        might consider the intensity or degree of gender        inequality, rather than some aspect of gender        inequality, as that which influences or is influenced by        economic organization. For each observation or        claim about economic inequality between women and men,        we can ask \"why?\" or \"how?\" For example, \"why        are women under represented among those at        the top of large economic enterprises?\" or \"how does        women's relative absence from positions great economic        power influence the persistence of gender inequality?\"         Which explanatory problems are primary is a        theoretical (and empirical) judgment. A         primary causal process is one without which the         relationship between the economy and gender inequality         would look and work differently . Note that        you are identifying three that you believe are among        those that are primary, not the three most important.                        For each of the three selected, primary,       explanatory problems, do the following: State clearly what        is the explanatory problem and why it is a        primary or important one . Think carefully about       what makes some causal processes more important than others       when we are trying to understand a social phenomenon (her       the relationship between gender inequality and economic       organization).        Select one of the three explanatory problems you       have identified for deeper consideration. For that       problem:                Briefly describe what stand out as the         possible causal processes that could account for        the relationship or condition that is the focus of the        explanatory problem. For example, what might        be the causal processes that account for few women        being in positions of high economic power? These        are the competing or alternative explanations for the        problem. These may include the causes or        explanations explicitly suggested in the literature        concerning the problem, or explanations derived from        applying a more general theoretical orientation (e.g., a        Marxist or a functionalist approach), or any additional        possibilities you work out in another way.          Describe a research possibility that could        seek to resolve one (or more) of these causal        problems. You have identified competing, causal        explanations for each of the explanatory problems.         For one of these, consider how we might hope to learn        which causal explanation is more valid by doing relevant        research. To do this, we usually want to think        about the circumstances under which the competing        theories suggest that something in the world should look        or work differently.                       To summarize, the analytical task involves (1) identifying       three primary, explanatory problems relating gender       inequality and economic organization, providing a careful       description for each of those explanatory problems, stating       why it is important, (2) for one explanatory problem,       exploring competing explanations that could solve the       problem, and describing a research design that could,       hypothetically, discover which explanation is better.

X. What role does ideology play in    determining the relations between men and women?     Ideology is near the center of almost all   efforts to explain gender inequalities. People's conceptions of   masculinity and femininity, ideas concerning the fairness of differential   treatment or expectations of women and men, internalized schema that   evoke different judgments of women's and men's actions, rules about proper   male and female behavior applied to children \u2013 all these and more concern the   influence of ideology on gender identities, differential treatment of women   and men, and the organization and persistence of gender inequality.    Conversely, each ideological belief that symbolizes, legitimates, invokes,   guides, induces, or helps sustain gender inequality is itself a product of   gender inequality. To untangle these complex causal interdependencies,   we must always attend carefully to two kinds of distinctions. First,   we must consistently recognize differences in levels of social organization,   including, among others, societal structures and culture, organizations,   social networks, social processes, and individual actors. While it is   tempting to treat ideological beliefs as diffuse entities unconnected to   identifiable people, organizations, or structures, the analytical results   are poor. Second, we must consistently distinguish between   contemporaneous causes (e.g., the ways that internalized schema can   influence interactions) and asynchronous or historical causes (e.g., the   ways that changes in domestic production induce different ideas about   women's place). Causal arguments about ideology consider it as both an   effect of gender inequality and a cause of gender inequality, although it is   ideology's potential role as a contributing cause that stands out as more   theoretically important.          Analytical     Task                 The general analytical problem .      For this week's task, we want to pose an initial analysis of the      relationship between ideology and some aspect of gender      inequality. We want to consider the joint direction of      causal influence for the selected context, how the dynamics of      inequality influences the ideas and how the presence of ideas      influences the understandings and actions of all the relevant      actors.             The aim of       this week's task is to explore the relationship between       beliefs \u2013 ideology \u2013 and some example of inequality. The       goal is to work through the various ways that ideas and       expectations are involved in the causal processes surrounding       gender inequality using the chosen example to do this at a       more concrete level. The purpose of the task       specification that follows is to help you to be systematic       about this.        To begin ,       choose one aspect or component of gender inequality.        This may involve the direct relationships between women and       men or a difference in the opportunities or status available       to women. Examples might be the way that women overall       select less prestigious fields of study than men in college,       that higher education used to be restricted for women, that       women are objects of sex trafficking, that male professional       sports have much higher status, or the different kinds of       restaurants that use male vs. female waiters. You might       try to be a bit creative. It can be helpful to focus your       discussion using a concrete instance of that type of       inequality with which you are familiar.                   Contents of the analysis .       Use this schematic outline as a starting point.             1        Clarify what aspect or component of gender inequality is your       focus.               As always, remember to give the basic characteristics        and principal patterns of the inequality as you understand        it. Among other possibilities, this will normally        include: (1) describe what is unequal; (2) describe what        this inequality looks like, how it is experienced, or how        it has its impact in social life; (3) assess how the        distribution appears or is manifest in the world, how we        would recognize the differences between more or less of        it, and how it is currently distributed).         The goal is to ensure the reader (and you) clearly        understand what inequality is relevant, and what examples        of that inequality you will address.                      2        Describe the principal ideological beliefs or ideas that seem       relevant to the inequality being examined.               While identifying the relevant beliefs is obviously        crucial, it can also be difficult. The range of        potentially relevant beliefs may be very large, so we have        to exercise judgment about which are most important         It may help to distinguish beliefs that motivate         the practice of this aspect of gender inequality from         those that legitimate it.         It is crucial to consider the actions and ideas of both men and women .         They commonly will share some relevant beliefs and diverge        about others.         Consider also whether different beliefs motivate or        legitimate this type of inequality in different times,        places, or circumstances. That is, you want to        decide what characteristics of the beliefs connected to        this inequality are fairly consistent across various        concrete instances of this type of inequality and what        sort of beliefs differ across instances. For        example, the beliefs that motivated male resistance to        women entering \"male\" occupations may have varied by the        status of the occupation and by the time period women        began to enter.         Consider the degree of consensus (or dispute) over the        important beliefs. When is the consensus high or        low, what causes it to be high or low, and what difference        does the degree of agreement make? In particular, do        people dispute some aspects of the beliefs relevant to        this type of inequality, such that the dispute affects the        inequality or informs us about it? Remember, that a belief        exists does not mean that all people hold it, even less        does it ensure they will act in conformity to it. The        greater the disagreement about a belief within a group or         category of actors, the less that it can contribute to         consistent responses it decides actions (although this         may not diminish its appeal as a justification).         Beliefs have a variety of other variable characteristics         that can be important to analyzing their significance.         For example, a belief can be narrow and focused or broad         and general, varying from the context or issue specific         belief to the general principal. A belief can be so         salient and closely held that people refer to it all the         time or so insignificant and loosely held that it plays a         role only when forced to the forefront.                      3        Assess the effects of these beliefs.               Consider the social significance or function of beliefs.         The effects of beliefs are generally understood by        comparing them to real or hypothetical alternatives.         Although beliefs exist only by being held by individuals,         we generally want to think of beliefs as cultural         phenomena. The beliefs that concern us are those preserved         and imposed by cultures or acquired as the common effect of         shared or parallel experiences. People are prone to all         kinds of idiosyncratic beliefs, but only shared beliefs         have social effect.         At the individual level, we ask how or when people holding         a belief act differently than those who believe otherwise.         At the social level, we ask how the presence of those         beliefs in a group or circumstance has social consequences         -- such as influencing the structure of organizations, the         prevailing legal system, or direction of historical         changes.         What we identify as important effects will therefore        depend on the selection of those alternative beliefs.         Reasonable alternatives might include: beliefs observed to        exist in more egalitarian (or more unequal) circumstances,        reversal of beliefs about women and men (often implausible        in reality, but potentially clarifying as an imaginary        experiment), the absence of any such beliefs, or the        presence of some reasonable hypothetical alternative         beliefs.         As usual, we want to give some thought to both women and        men, and we want to consider how the effects of the        beliefs might vary depending on the context or other        mediating influences. Typically, we expect to find women         and men share many beliefs, but are sharply divided on        others.         Beliefs can affect judgments, motives, aspirations,        quality of experience, and so forth. Again, deciding        what is important is an analytical judgment. We are trying        to figure out what beliefs really make a difference to the        strength, durability, or form of gender inequality.                      4        Try to explain how the relevant beliefs come to exist and why       they persist.               Thus, for the example of inequality being examined, we         are trying to explain how beliefs or ideas might         arise as a result of the presence of the inequality         that they legitimate and motivate. This is our         central goal, and it is difficult.         It can help to do a hypothetical experiment.         Consider an imaginary circumstance (which might have a        real historical counterpart) where the relevant aspect of        gender inequality did not exist, nor did the related        beliefs \u2013 then at some point in time this type of gender        inequality came into existence. Then try to think        through how ideas would change as a result of the        emergence of this facet of gender inequality.         Consider what issues might arise if this type of        inequality came to exist, but the beliefs still did not,        and how might the response to such issues lead to new        beliefs. Think about both women and men trying to make        sense of the unequal circumstances, and trying to mold the        perception of reality and justice to fit their        circumstances.         To make the analysis more concrete, see if you can        provide evidence or observations about real circumstances        where this type of inequality is minimal (different        cultures, different historical periods, different parts of        society). Assess how the beliefs under minimal        inequality compare to those where it is high.         It is a good idea to consider under what conditions, if        any, would the beliefs associated with a facet of gender         inequality exist without the presence of this facet of        gender inequality. That is, could similar or analogous        beliefs appear with different kinds of inequality or under        conditions of little inequality. The first        possibility is critical, because it suggests beliefs due        to the presence of inequality per se, not dependent on the        type of inequality. The second possibility suggests        the prospect of beliefs hijacked from conditions distinct        from inequality, then converted to some service to        reinforce or challenge inequality.         It is also a good idea to consider how people acquire        the relevant beliefs? Are they part of general        cultural expectations, are the transferred in specific        contexts, or do people generate them from experience        rather than learning them from others?         Finally, ask what happens if some people question or        reject the beliefs? This question applies to both women        and men. The mechanisms to ensure acceptance and        conformity are crucial to the preservation and        effectiveness of beliefs.                      5        Finally, after completing the steps in the analysis above, try       to give an overall assessment about the significance of       ideology to the facet of gender inequality you are       considering.                   Additional Notes              Throughout, be careful to distinguish between empirical        claims and moral claims. Both kinds of beliefs       are important. And they may be confused or overlapping       rather than neatly distinguished in real life. Still,       they are crucially different. Similarly, distinguish       between the explanation of beliefs and the justification        of beliefs.

Today, feminism is both extolled and condemned, often   by people whose orientations toward feminism seem to defy their   interests. Both the popular press and scholarship have devoted a lot   of effort seeking to make sense of people's beliefs about feminism and   equality, but these efforts have done little to reduce the disagreements.          Analytical     Task                 The goal of this task is to explore what young people think      about feminism today and to attempt to explain these beliefs.       As a prelude, you should interview some female and some male      acquaintances about feminism.             Use your own judgment about who to interview and how       many. You are trying to get enough \"data\" to serve as       the basis for your analysis.        Also use your own judgment about how to conduct your       interviews and what to ask. However, at a minimum try to       include: 1) how they would define feminism, 2) what kinds of       the people they know do they consider feminist, 3) what they       think is true about gender inequality/equality today, 4)       whether or not they consider themselves feminist and why, 5)       whether or not they consider themselves committed to gender       equality.                   Based on these interviews and your pre-existing observations,      write a descriptive assessment of young, educated American's      orientation toward feminism.       Prepare a provisional causal analysis of these current attitudes      toward feminism and gender equality in your reference population.      Try to do a reasoned analysis, taking into account the readings      for this topic.       Causal analyses always hinge on the choice of comparison.       Among others, you might consider: 1) the differences between now      and the past, 2) the differences between women and men, 3) the      differences between those who identify as feminist and those who      do not, 3) the difference between people like you and people      unlike you                     Common Readings            Destined for Equality : Women's      Rejection of Subordination      Nancy Burns and Katherine Gallagher. \" Public      Opinion on Gender Issues: The Politics of Equity and Roles .\"     Annual Review of Political Science, 2010, Vol. 13: 425-443       [doi: 10.1146/annurev.polisci.12.040507.142213]      Jo Freeman. \" Political      Organization in the Feminist Movement .\" Acta Sociologica ,     Vol. 18, No. 2/3 (1975), pp. 222-244      Susan E.

How have political    processes and structures sustained men's and women's relative status?     As structure and as actor, the state has been   unavoidably central to ongoing practice of gender inequality, to its   persistence, and to changes in the form and amount of gender inequality.     States or governments have power. Through the   military and police, a state can enforce conformity to its rules, repel and   punish challenges from the scale of individual acts to collective   rebellions, and by threat, implicit or explicit, deter rebellions from   appearing. Through the law, regulations, and bureaucratic policies, a state   can define what constitutes acceptable or legitimate behavior at all levels   of social organization. Through economic policies of taxation, expenditures,   and redistributions (such as welfare policies or agricultural supports), a   state influences the relative economic status of different groups.     By acting differently toward groups with   regard to any of these aspects of government power, a state can create,   reinforce, or exacerbate social inequalities. Analogously, a state can, in   theory, obstruct, destabilize, or diminish social inequality by using its   power in ways that are inconsistent with social inequalities. States   determine, influence, legitimize, and sanction rights and opportunities;   they may do so in more or less egalitarian ways.     When significant, enduring, social inequality   exists, those privileged by that form of inequality will normally have more   influence over the state than do those disadvantaged by the inequality, and   the overall effect of state policies will reinforce the exercise and   persistence of the inequality. A fundamental problem for all state theories   is who or what decides state policies and actions. To some degree, those   \"in\" the state (elected, appointed, hired, or appropriated) make decisions   based on their interests and outlooks as members of the state apparatus. To   some degree, state actors respond to the influence of power brokers outside   the state, such as the economically powerful. In either case, when making   policy or strategic planning decisions, those influencing state actions are   in part responding to what they perceive will be the responses of all actors   in the nation affected by those decisions. States, or the political   actors who comprise the government, also have their own interests, most   notably preserving their power, and these interests are not automatically   consistent with the interests of dominant social groups.     These political processes may support and   enforce gender inequality, passively permit it, or oppose gender inequality   (as is true with any form of social inequality). They may do any combination   of these with respect to different aspects of gender inequality.    Sustaining influence over political processes is a fundamental feature and   goal of socially dominant groups and the long monopoly of men over political   power has both demonstrated and sustained gender inequality. Yet,   government actions have also contributed to the decline of gender inquality   over the past two centuries.          Analytical     Task                 You have been hired by the newly elected President of the United      States (or the analogous top political position in another country      that you prefer to examine). One of the new President\u2019s main      goals for her years in office is to use government power to      improve gender inequality and the status of women. Your job      is to recommend toward what specific goals she should focus her      efforts.       You may recommend new legislation (or the removal of old), new      administrative strategies such as who gets appointed, new      executive policies (for example, rules for the military) that are      within the President\u2019s power without legislation, concerted      efforts to influence public opinion or state level      governance. In short, you can consider the entire range of      actions available to a President.       You should propose at least three distinct initiatives that you      believe could serve this purpose.       Chose the strategy you believe holds the most promise. For      this strategy, you must provide an analytical justification. Your      justification should consider the following:             At what aspects of gender inequality is the policy       aimed?        Include a brief analysis of this inequality that explains       what is unequal, how great is the inequality, who does it       effect, how widely is it recognized, how it has (or has not)       changed over time, and what seem to be the principal causes.        Describe how have government actions (or inaction)       influenced this inequality in the past.        Show why we should expect that it will be easy or hard to       carry out the strategy and how the possible difficulties       reflect the influence or effects of gender inequality.        Explain how the proposed strategy can be expected to       alleviate gender inequality. This explanation should       connect directly to the causal explanation of the inequality       being diminished.                   In short, you should propose several strategies by which a      government could promote greater gender equality, then provide an      analytic appraisal of the strategy you deem best. This      appraisal should stress the causes of relevant facets of gender      inequality, how the proposed strategy will affect that causal      process, and how gender inequality has a causal influence on      government policy that must be countered to implement the      policy. Do not forget to provide a historical context.

XIII. What does the future hold?     Where do we go from here? Predicting the future is the     ultimate challenge for causal analyses. To have any potential to     see into the future, we need a sound and thorough causal theory, one     that can encompass the range of possible influences     simultaneously. We also need to cope with the unpredictable     potential effects of processes and events that are outside the     boundaries of our theories. These are extremely difficult     conditions to meet. But the need to make some sense of the     future weighs on us. Will gender inquality continue to decline,     and greater gender equality spread throughout the world? Are     some aspects of gender inquality particularly resistant to reduction,     and if so why? Could change stagnate? Behind such concerns     are two principal questions. What has caused the long-term     pattern of declining gender inequality? And what has preserved     aspects of gender inequality in the face of these accumulating     changes? Combining the answers to these two questions with an     effort to project the relevant influences into the future, is the     basis for trying to understand the possibilities for the future.      Behind this also lies another analytical question with moral     overtones: what does gender equality really mean?                    Analytical       Task 1                    Select two types of inequality, both       important, one that you believe to be moving toward greater       equality at a relatively high rate, the other that you       believe is moving toward equality at a relatively slow rate       (or is stalled or is moving backwards)               for each of these two types, describe what is the        inequality (how are women and men unequal, which women        and men experience it, how do things differ when this        inequality is high from when it is low)         describe the evidence and logic that suggests one        type is declining relatively quickly and the other        relatively slowly                      Try to explain why the two different rates of movement       toward equality               For each, consider what processes, conditions,        interests, and the like propel the movement toward        greater equality         For each, consider what circumstances, activities,        and the like obstruct the movement toward greater        equality         Try to explain how and why the balance between the        causes propelling greater equality and the causes        sustaining existing inequality differ between the two        types of gender inequality                                                 Analytical       Task 2                    The general       analytical problem . Using two       plausible future scenarios about gender inequality, assess       what processes or conditions will decide which future       alternative comes to pass.        The task has the following main parts               Select two         of three alternatives to use for the analysis: highest        conceivable level of equality, highest possibility of in equality,        most likely conditions. Essentially this means        that we compare the two extreme possibilities, or we        compare what we think most likely with one of the        extreme possibilities.         For each of the two        selected alternatives, give a clear description of what        the expected level of gender inequality means.         How severe will be major components of gender        inequality, how consistent will different aspects of        gender inequality be with each other, how consistent        will these patterns be in society, and so on. (It        might help to look back over the range of topics        covered above.)         The center of the        analysis will be to provide a causal argument about        what causal conditions and sequence of developments         could lead to each of the two alternatives.         To this end, we must consider the full        range of causal influences that we have examined        previously.                      Thinking tools .               To consider any future path, we must make assumptions        about: (1) how far into the future, (2) in what society        and with respect to what social groups, and (3) what        other changes might occur, altering the cultural,        political, and economic environment.                  For our purposes, let us set the future to be         about one and two generations, that is when your         children are your current age, and then when their         children reach a similar age. The key         tradeoff with setting the distance into the future         is simple: the further we go into the future the         more interesting and significant are the social         changes but equally the more obscure become the         realistic possibilities.          Let us focus on our own society as a whole,         referencing distinctive social categories as         needed.          Similarly, let us assume that the cultural,         political, and economic environments are reasonably         stable, with the expectation that existing long         term trends will continue into the future. We         will ignore the potential for significant         structural changes and historical \"shocks\" such as         economic recessions and wars. Of course, the         further we look into the future, the more         speculative and fallible such assumptions become,         but our purpose is not to predict the actual         future.                         Looking forward, the future is always uncertain,        however well we may explain it once it becomes the        past. One way to make the future more amenable to        analysis is to simplify it into what we believe are the        principal alternative futures that matter to us.         Probably the simplest technique it to focus on one        characteristic and consider the most extreme plausible        possibilities.         With this in mind, let us try to analyze the future        of gender inequality by contrasting stark        alternatives. To begin consider three        possibilities:                 First, the highest level of gender equality that         we can imagine. This might be the current         state of inequality, or it might be the highest         level of inequality now seen in any comparable         society, or it might be a much higher level of         inequality. The problem here is to imagine         what is the greatest amount of future inequality we         can          Second, the highest level of gender in equality         that we can imagine.          And, third, the most likely level of gender         inequality that we expect. This could         coincide with either one of the previous, but will         commonly be somewhere between them.                         For deciding the plausibility of any future        circumstances, we want to remember that there are two        kinds of limiting conditions we must consider.         First, functional plausibility ,        asking if that level of inequality is feasible in the        context of what we perceive to be the relevant        surrounding circumstances. For a simple example,        a social custom of leaving all property to sons is        largely unworkable in a society with a low reproduction        rate because so many families have no sons.         Second, transition        plausibility , asking if a conceivable        historical path of development could lead from present        circumstances to the future scenario. For a        simple example, it might be possible to conceive how        American society could have functioned with full gender        equality in 1900, but it would extremely difficult to        suggest any plausible way that condition could have        emerged under any conceivable historical sequence from        the social organization of American society in 1850.                              Bringing it together . Our goal here is       not to predict the future of gender inequality, but to       examine what sequence of causal conditions seem likely determinants       of that future. We are trying to discover defensible       \" if, then \" arguments. To do this, we are       starting by imagining possible futures, then working       backwards from them to find paths from the present to those       futures, then asserting what else must occur for those       paths to materialize. We should not forget, there may       be more than one path to an imagined future and more than       one set of causal conditions that could lead us there.        For each alternative being considered, we want to analyze        why and how it might reasonably occur.        As an optional extra, you can offer an analysis of which        alternative seems more likely and why.

How have women's and     men's actions obstructed or furthered change, taking into account     the changing institutional context?       Both women and men    have acted in every possible way towards gender inequality. What    we want to understand are the circumstances in which they predictably    act in ways that either reinforce or erode inequality. People's    actions are complex results of their interests, ideologies,    circumstances, opportunities, and constraints. While theories of    gender inequality invoke all kinds of abstract causal processes, in real    life inequality is sustained and changed by the actions of women and    men. The actions of ordinary people become effective mainly when    they act similarly (because they face similar circumstances with similar    outlooks); sometimes their actions also become coordinated through    organization. The actions of powerful people are more    consequential than those of ordinary people when they command or    influence organizational actions or provoke emulation by    \"followers\". Even unique political actions may have great effect    by altering laws, policies, or the balance of power, although even in    these cases the institutionalization of changes generally depends on    dispersed acceptance; in the economic realm, even organizational actions    typically become effective only when multiple organizations pursue    parallel policies (governmental controls over an economy would be an    exception).           Analytical      Task                  The goal of this task is to       examine why some of men's actions worked against gender       inequality while others sustained it, and similarly why       women's actions also included ones that challenged gender       inequality and others that reinforced it. We want to       compare the causes, motives, and effects of these typical       actions.               \"Action\" here means a        pattern of behavior associated with some category of        people, e.g. the tendency to take or not take advantage of        educational opportunities by women of some type in some        period. The relevant actions are those that were one        typical result either of being either in certain enduring        categories of women or men (for example, single women with        higher education) or in certain recurring circumstances        (for example, married women whose husbands lost their jobs        for long periods). The category could include all        women or all men.        To say that actions        reinforce gender inequality means that they either bolster        the stability of gender inequality or help to make it more        severe; alternatively, if those actions became rare        and were not replaced by alternative actions with        similar effects, then either the degree of gender        inequality experienced by some people would decline or the        persistence of gender inequality would become more        problematic. (by the identified group in the        identified conditions)        Analogously, to say that        actions challenge gender inequality means that those        actions, if taken by enough people, result in reducing the        amount of gender inequality or they erode the stability of        gender inequality making it more vulnerable to future        challenges.                    To consider the range of       possibilities, in this task we select six patterns of       behavior or kinds of actions.               Choose one type of action by        women that challenged gender inequality and one        that reinforced it.        Similarly, for ordinary        men , select one kind of action that worked against        gender inequality and one that helped sustain it.        Finally, do the same for men        with power .                    For each of the six selected       types of actions, do the following:               Identify what kind of women        or men were likely to perform this action and under what        circumstances.        Describe the action,        including an assessment of its effects on gender        inequality. This may include consideration of        reasons why its effects might vary (e.g., the number        acting might have to surpass a threshold before there are        widespread effects, the effects might be contingent on        other conditions, the effects might happen after a delay,        and so on).        Try to specify the reasons        why this type of action occurred. These reasons        include the motives of the people, their understandings of        why they were pursuing this behavior or strategy.         The reasons also include the social and cultural        conditions that induce the actions and make them seem        necessary, sensible, and just. The reasons may also        include triggering events.                    To summarize: Pick six kinds of       behavior that have made a difference to the persistence of       gender inequality, one reinforcing and one challenging for       each of the three categories: women, ordinary men, powerful       men. Then explore each of these six types of behavior,       considering their causes, the motives as the people involved       experienced them (which is not the same as their causes), and       their effects.

How do the media    influence or reflect gender inequality?     Commentators often point toward media influence when   they try to explain contemporary gender inequality. Theories of media alert    us that we must always consider reciprocal causal processes. While any    individual may appear only to be the object of media influence, the content    and impact of media depend greatly on the existing culture and social    structure. The relationship of the media to the collective market effect of    consumers may be compared to the relationship between elected public officials    and voters. Also, consumers have considerable freedom to choose which media    outlets to give their attention and people selectively interpret and judge    the media to which they are exposed. All of this makes the relationship    between what is portrayed in the media and what occur in the \"real\" world    rather complex.          Analytical     Task                 Select one kind of popular/mass media, such as magazines or the      cinema, or, alternatively, a form of popular culture thought to      have an analogous impact, such as popular music.       Prepare a simple comparative analysis of current examples to      examples from around 1980, a third of a century ago.             Choose a small, reasonable sample from the two       periods. For example, the samples might be       advertisements from three magazines present in both periods,       or the female and male protagonists of top earning movies, or       the lyrics of the highest rated songs.        Using the dimensions or characteristics identified in the       readings, (or analogous ones that better fit the media you are       assessing), characterize the differences in the ways women and       men are portrayed in the two periods.                   Given the results of your comparisons, show how the data you      observe might be explained by (1) theories stressing the influence      of the media on gender expectations, evaluations, and behavior, or      (2) theories stressing the media as reflecting gender inequality,      or (3) theories stressing market segmentation (audiences choose      among media offerings and media makers aim at audience segments.       Prepare a simple, reasonable response to the questions, \"What is      the basic causal relationship between mass media and gender       inequality?\" and \"How      is the correspondence between media portrayals and real-life      gender inequality sustained over time as gender inequality changes?

How have political     processes and structures sustained men's and women's relative     status? [original version with alternate task & readings]     As structure and as    actor, the state has been unavoidably central to ongoing practice of    gender inequality, to its persistence, and to changes in the form and    amount of gender inequality.      States or governments have power. Through the    military and police, a state can enforce conformity to its rules, repel    and punish challenges from the scale of individual acts to collective    rebellions, and by threat, implicit or explicit, deter rebellions from    appearing. Through the law, regulations, and bureaucratic policies, a    state can define what constitutes acceptable or legitimate behavior at    all levels of social organization. Through economic policies of    taxation, expenditures, and redistributions (such as welfare policies or    agricultural supports), a state influences the relative economic status    of different groups.      By acting differently toward groups with regard to    any of these aspects of government power, a state can create, reinforce,    or exacerbate social inequalities. Analogously, a state can, in theory,    obstruct, destabilize, or diminish social inequality by using its power    in ways that are inconsistent with social inequalities. States    determine, influence, legitimize, and sanction rights and opportunities;    they may do so in more or less egalitarian ways.      When significant, enduring, social inequality    exists, those privileged by that form of inequality will normally have    more influence over the state than do those disadvantaged by the    inequality, and the overall effect of state policies will reinforce the    exercise and persistence of the inequality. A fundamental problem for    all state theories is who or what decides state policies and actions. To    some degree, those \"in\" the state (elected, appointed, hired, or    appropriated) make decisions based on their interests and outlooks as    members of the state apparatus. To some degree, state actors respond to    the influence of power brokers outside the state, such as the    economically powerful. In either case, when making policy or strategic    planning decisions, those influencing state actions are in part    responding to what they perceive will be the responses of all actors in    the nation affected by those decisions.           Analytical      Task                   Task summary: Assess the most       important ways the American state (or some other) has       influenced and been influenced by gender inequality over the       past two hundred years. Try to keep in mind that this       always concerns the accumulation and exercise of social power.              What are the crucial ways that       government reflected gender inequality?                Consider how and why the        state treated women and men differently         Consider ways that the        state helped gender inequality operate smoothly         Consider how the state        helped gender inequality to persist                     How and why has the state       promoted gender equality by reducing the differences in its       treatment of women? How has the state How and why has       the state made it difficult (and irrational) for many to       continue practices that disadvantage women?        How and why have the relevant       government actions changed over time?         While developing the analysis       for this task, it can be helpful to examine how the       relationship between the state and gender inequality resembled       or differed from the state's relationships to other kinds of       inequality.

    (Sociology of) Sex and    Gender         SOC-UA 21 \u2013 Spring 2015         Robert Max    Jackson                                 Assisting: Jessie Ford                 http://www.nyu.edu/classes/jackson/sex.and.gender                            Description:         This course will stress explaining inequalities between women and men    and interpreting what they mean for people's lives. Most of what we    do, think and feel depends on our understanding of what it means to be    male or female, and on the different expectations people have for men and    women. Every aspect of the institutions, opportunities, and ideas    around us are permeated by gender differences. Our goal is to make    sense of this. Some of the questions we address are:             What do we mean by gender inequality? How does it arise?     Why does it take different forms? Why do some societies have    greater equality than others? How do the various institutions    like the family, the economy and religion affect the social position of    women and men? How do the direct relations between women and    men--as friends, brother and sister, lovers, spouses, parent and child,    colleagues, boss and employee--depend on or affect the social positions    of women and men? Why and when does sex inequality change?             On completing the course, students will know how to assess the major    social and intellectual questions raised by the issue of sex inequality.    Through intensive reading and discussion, this course will give    students the intellectual tools needed to understand and talk about sex    inequality knowledgeably and perceptively. This course also    promotes the growth of general skills in theoretical criticism and social    analysis.         Requirements:         All students must attend class consistently and punctually, join in    class discussion, write brief papers, prepare a \"gender social biography\"    term paper, take quizzes, and take a final exam.         All students should take part in class discussion and those who do an    outstanding job will receive extra credit.         Each student will write a \"gender social biography\" for a term paper.    This paper will try to show how your identity and experiences have    been shaped in conformity with gender expectations and how they have    defied or ignored them. The paper will take into account the various    kinds of social influences and experiences studied in this class.    During the semester, students will write brief gender biography    \"chapters\" for each section of the course, relating the subject of that    section to their gender biography. These will then be incorporated and    revised into the final term paper. Details about the gender social    biography are on another page .    No late papers will be accepted under any conditions.         A final examination will take place in class and cover all of the    course material. This examination will focus on the main ideas of    the materials we read and discuss in class.         Expectations:         A class is a collective learning enterprise. We must all act    responsibly and with decorum or the enterprise fails. We must each try to    avoid making the class less pleasant for others. This means we come    to class on time, pay attention, and avoid disruptive actions such as    talking to those in adjoining seats, eating noisily, and the like.     We will have a lot of discussion, some among all in class, some in    groups. Everyone is always free to disagree with other people's    ideas, but we should all treat everyone else and their ideas    respectfully. Plagiarism or academic dishonesty of any kind will    not be tolerated.

Study Questions                   What do people commonly mean by the distinction between     \u201cgender\u201d and \u201csex?\u201d          Why do people studying gender inequality stress a     distinction between \u201cgender inequality\u201d and \u201cgender     differences?\u201d          While making sense of gender inequality, why do we need to     keep in mind other forms of inequality within a society?          What is the difference between status inequality and     positional inequality?          Why do some authors suggest that the rise of women\u2019s status     over the past two centuries might be considered a paradox while     others suggest that the persistence of gender inequality in recent     decades might be viewed as a paradox?          In what ways has gender inequality declined over the past     150 years?          What are principal ways that gender inequality persists in     the U.S. and similar \u201cmodern\u201d nations according to our sources?          What does Jackson mean when he says that \u201ctwo kinds of     social conflict fueled the decline of gender     inequality\u201d?          What do we mean when we say women and men are     unequal?          What do we mean by saying that women and men have competing     ideologies or myths about gender?          What is the difference between distributional differences     and categorical differences when we are comparing the characteristics     of two groups?          What is problematic about the common cultural explanations     of \u201cdeceptive distinctions\u201d between women and men?          How does \u201cframing\u201d work in Ridgeway\u2019s     analysis?                             II. How is gender inequality symbolized and reproduced in    everyday life?              Gendered Society : The Social    Construction of Gender Relations [111-120, 124-127]          Framed by Gender : Ch. 2 \"A Primary Frame for    Organizing Social Relations\" [important, read carefully]          Gendered Society Reader : Beards,    Breasts, and Bodies: Doing Sex in a Gendered World, Raine    Dozier          Gendered Society Reader : The Gender Similarities    Hypothesis, Janet Shibley Hyde          Gendered Society : \"So, That    Explains It\": Psychoanalytic and Developmental Perspectives on Gender    [86-101, 106-110]                       Study Questions                   Why is it meaningful to say that gender identities are both     voluntary and coerced?          How does gender inequality in modern society influence the power     most men feel they have?          What do people mean when they say institutions are gendered?          Why might some argue that Freud\u2019s theory attributed key gender     differences to biology while others argue that it did not?          How is it possible that gender identity (whether we are male or     female and what it means to be either) is learned (not inherent or     biological), but that we experience it as natural and     unchangeable?          What did Gilligan claim about the relationship between gender and     ethics, and why has the claim been controversial?          How would you explain the term \u201csex roles?\u201d          How does Dozier\u2019s study raise questions about standard ways of     distinguishing \u201csex\u201d from \u201cgender\u201d or claims that gender is socially     constructed by people \u201cdoing gender\u201d in interactions?          What is the \u201cgender similarities hypothesis\u201d and how do research     findings support or not support it?          According to Ridgeway, how are gender stereotypes related to a     general problem of coordinating social interactions? (And can     you identify any serious problems with Ridgeway's argument about this     proposed relationship? This part is very high difficulty.)          How, according to Ridgeway might the existence of framing lead to     social inequality?          According to Ridgeway what is the difference between specific     status beliefs and diffuse status beliefs?                             III.

How has the popularity of     biological explanations varied across historical periods and     cultures?          How is the work of evolutionary psychologists relevant to     the study of gender inequality, and what limits the value of its     contribution?          What seems to be the historical pattern of motives behind     brain research and hormonal research concerned with gender (and     sexuality) differences, and the results they find?          What was the influential argument that Margaret Mead     presented in 1935 book Sex and Temperament in Three Primitive     Societies?          Why are those who study gender inequality so concerned with     the division of labor?          When comparing across societies, what are some of the     conditions that seem to correlate with or indicate high levels of     gender inequality?          What do we know about the relationship between testosterone     levels and violent behavior?          According to Herdt, what is the significance of \u201ccoming     out\u201d rituals?          How does it make sense to think about the role of biology     in the origins of gender inequality?          How and why do we distinguish explaining the origins of     gender inequality from the persistence of gender     inequality?                             IV.

Study Questions                   Summarize important changes in women\u2019s economic     participation over the past 150 years. Among other things, it is     useful to consider differences by period, by type of women, and by     type of job.          How does the movement of women into traditionally male jobs     compare to the movement of men into traditionally female jobs?          How does employment potentially serve as a source of pride,     obligation, resources, negative identity for men and for women?      The goal here is to think through the reasons that women and men seek     and hold jobs and the effects that having (or not having) those jobs     have upon them.          What contributes to the wage/income differential between     women and men?          Explain the \u201cglass ceiling.\u201d          How did goverment policies, laws, and actions influence     women's changing employment in the twentieth century?          According to Ridgeway, how have framing processes     influenced the jobs into which women are hired, women\u2019s promotions,     and women\u2019s wages/salaries?          Why is the analysis of \u201ctokenism\u201d important for     understanding changes in women\u2019s economic participation?          What seem to be the causes and the effects of sexual     harassment?          How can we explain how women\u2019s economic participation has     changed over the long term? Consider the motives and the     actions of women, ordinary men, and powerful men. Also consider     the difference between women\u2019s movement into low-status jobs and     their movement into high-status jobs.          According to Reskin, what causes women\u2019s wages or income to     be lower than that of men, and how does that argument relate to the     ideas present in other readings this week?          How have different kinds of discrimination influenced     women\u2019s experiences in the economy?                             IX. Political processes and individual action.

Why do we want to distinguish between ordinary and powerful men while explaining the     persistence and decline of gender inequality?          Responding to changing circumstances, women and men sometimes      adopted new strategies or changed their typical behavior in ways      that contributed to gender inequality\u2019s decline over time.      However, even as they contributed to gender inequality's decline,      they typically did not seek to reduce gender inequality, commonly      did not favor a change in gender expectations, and often did not      even recognize that their actions could or would affect gender      inequality. So, how do we explain this pattern?          Why has men\u2019s defense of gender inequality declined over the past     150 years?          How have the goals of feminist movements been compatible      with (the effects and requirements of) long-term structural      changes in the U.S. and other modern societies? And in what      ways have their goals been in conflict with that long-term      trajectory          Assess the reasoning behind these two claims: \u201cmen have probably     sustained their gender advantages more through competition with other     men than through efforts to keep women from enjoying similar     opportunities or status\u201d; \u201cmen resisting women\u2019s advance      [typically] understood themselves to be fulfilling their      obligations or protecting well-earned rights\u201d.          How did both ordinary men\u2019s interests in opposing improvements in     women\u2019s status and their capacity to do so change over     time?           Writers have suggested that men long opposed women\u2019s movement     into high-status jobs (and women\u2019s access to higher education that     would prepare them for such jobs) because adding women would increase the     competition men would face for promotions and the like. Why is this a     strong or weak argument?          Why are culturally derived beliefs and rational calculations both     important for understanding changes over time in men\u2019s typical     actions that affected gender inequality? (Note that the same question     can be asked about women\u2019s typical actions.)          If most men in positions of organizational power share a     discriminatory attitude towards women, why do we expect any men with     similar organizational power who do not share these discriminatory     biases still to act (in their jobs) largely like their discriminatory     colleagues? (Note this question relates to the general problem of why     people conform, but in this question focuses on the causes specific     to the context of organizational power.)          What do analysts mean by the \u201cmale rebellion\u201d against marriage in     the second half of the twentieth century, and why might it have     occurred?           Why did men in government think differently about the woman     suffrage issue than ordinary male voters? How does this compare     to differences between the ways that employers\u2019 thought about hiring     women and the ways that male workers thought about it?          How do we explain women\u2019s difficulties at achieving economic     power through entrepreneurial success, rising through organizational     ranks, or inheriting wealth?          How do we explain women\u2019s difficulties at achieving political     power, both as individuals and collectively?          How have feminist efforts contributed to the reduction in gender     inequality, and how have those efforts fallen short?                             X.

Cancian                       Study Questions                   What do we mean by institutional     individualism?           How does the impact on family organization made by the rise     of modern education compare to the impact of the rise of modern     industry?           What are the highlights of women\u2019s changing educational     opportunities in the U.S. over the past 150 years?          With respect to the U.S. experience, in what ways is it     likely that the education offered to women and men (at various     levels) influenced gender inequality over the past 150     years?          What were the major influences responsible for the rise of     meritocratic ideas and their increasing     influence?           Why does Ridgeway stress it is important not only that we     hold stereotypical beliefs about gender, but that we can take it for     granted that others hold them as well?          According to Ridgeway, what are the most basic, shared     beliefs about differences between women and men in our culture (we     are concerned with the content of the beliefs, not the     terminology)?          What, according to Ridgeway, decides which gender     stereotypes are embodied in popular beliefs about the differences     between women and men?          Why do people who privately hold \"alternative\" gender     beliefs seemingly still commonly act on the basis of the dominant     beliefs, particularly in their \u201cpublic\u201d     lives?           Why did the ideologies of female domesticity change over     time?          If men did not impose the content of the successive     ideologies of female domesticity, what     did?           What common characteristics of the otherwise diverse ideals     of female domesticity made them seem to work for both women and men     and for the acceptability of gender inequality to     both?          With respect to the determination of dominant ideologies,     what is the relevant common underlying idea in the Marxist concept of     \u201cdetermination within limits\u201d, the Weberian idea of \u201celective     affinity\u201d, and Merton\u2019s concept of \u201cfunctional     alternatives?\u201d          What does Cancian mean when she says, \u201cPart of the reason     that men seem so much less loving than women is that their behavior     is measured with a feminine ruler\u201d?

According to Ridgeway, what are the key conditions that are     obstructing, and could even reverse, the shifts toward gender     equality?          According to Ridgeway, why do gender stereotypes survive     disconfirming evidence?          How does Ridgeway use the idea of \"cultural lag?\"          According to Jackson, what are the principal causes of gender     inequality's decline?          According to Jackson, what are the main components of arguments     that the movement toward gender inequality is severely     threatened?          What, according to Jackson, are the principal defects in     arguments contending that our movement toward greater gender equality     may be stopped or even turned back?          How have interests affecting gender inequality changed over time     for important categories of men, women, and organizations? Are there     important relevant interests that have not changed much?          With respect to actions relevant to gender inequality, compare     how women's behaviors and life cycle patterns have changed with     analogous changes in men's lives."}]},

    (Sociology of) Sex and    Gender         SOC-UA 21 \u2013 Spring 2015         Robert Max    Jackson                                 Assisting: Jessie Ford                 http://www.nyu.edu/classes/jackson/sex.and.gender                            Description:         This course will stress explaining inequalities between women and men    and interpreting what they mean for people's lives. Most of what we    do, think and feel depends on our understanding of what it means to be    male or female, and on the different expectations people have for men and    women. Every aspect of the institutions, opportunities, and ideas    around us are permeated by gender differences. Our goal is to make    sense of this. Some of the questions we address are:             What do we mean by gender inequality? How does it arise?     Why does it take different forms? Why do some societies have    greater equality than others? How do the various institutions    like the family, the economy and religion affect the social position of    women and men? How do the direct relations between women and    men--as friends, brother and sister, lovers, spouses, parent and child,    colleagues, boss and employee--depend on or affect the social positions    of women and men? Why and when does sex inequality change?             On completing the course, students will know how to assess the major    social and intellectual questions raised by the issue of sex inequality.    Through intensive reading and discussion, this course will give    students the intellectual tools needed to understand and talk about sex    inequality knowledgeably and perceptively. This course also    promotes the growth of general skills in theoretical criticism and social    analysis.         Requirements:         All students must attend class consistently and punctually, join in    class discussion, write brief papers, prepare a \"gender social biography\"    term paper, take quizzes, and take a final exam.         All students should take part in class discussion and those who do an    outstanding job will receive extra credit.         Each student will write a \"gender social biography\" for a term paper.    This paper will try to show how your identity and experiences have    been shaped in conformity with gender expectations and how they have    defied or ignored them. The paper will take into account the various    kinds of social influences and experiences studied in this class.    During the semester, students will write brief gender biography    \"chapters\" for each section of the course, relating the subject of that    section to their gender biography. These will then be incorporated and    revised into the final term paper. Details about the gender social    biography are on another page .    No late papers will be accepted under any conditions.         A final examination will take place in class and cover all of the    course material. This examination will focus on the main ideas of    the materials we read and discuss in class.         Expectations:         A class is a collective learning enterprise. We must all act    responsibly and with decorum or the enterprise fails. We must each try to    avoid making the class less pleasant for others. This means we come    to class on time, pay attention, and avoid disruptive actions such as    talking to those in adjoining seats, eating noisily, and the like.     We will have a lot of discussion, some among all in class, some in    groups. Everyone is always free to disagree with other people's    ideas, but we should all treat everyone else and their ideas    respectfully. Plagiarism or academic dishonesty of any kind will    not be tolerated.

Study Questions                   What do people commonly mean by the distinction between     \u201cgender\u201d and \u201csex?\u201d          Why do people studying gender inequality stress a     distinction between \u201cgender inequality\u201d and \u201cgender     differences?\u201d          While making sense of gender inequality, why do we need to     keep in mind other forms of inequality within a society?          What is the difference between status inequality and     positional inequality?          Why do some authors suggest that the rise of women\u2019s status     over the past two centuries might be considered a paradox while     others suggest that the persistence of gender inequality in recent     decades might be viewed as a paradox?          In what ways has gender inequality declined over the past     150 years?          What are principal ways that gender inequality persists in     the U.S. and similar \u201cmodern\u201d nations according to our sources?          What does Jackson mean when he says that \u201ctwo kinds of     social conflict fueled the decline of gender     inequality\u201d?          What do we mean when we say women and men are     unequal?          What do we mean by saying that women and men have competing     ideologies or myths about gender?          What is the difference between distributional differences     and categorical differences when we are comparing the characteristics     of two groups?          What is problematic about the common cultural explanations     of \u201cdeceptive distinctions\u201d between women and men?          How does \u201cframing\u201d work in Ridgeway\u2019s     analysis?                             II. How is gender inequality symbolized and reproduced in    everyday life?              Gendered Society : The Social    Construction of Gender Relations [111-120, 124-127]          Framed by Gender : Ch. 2 \"A Primary Frame for    Organizing Social Relations\" [important, read carefully]          Gendered Society Reader : Beards,    Breasts, and Bodies: Doing Sex in a Gendered World, Raine    Dozier          Gendered Society Reader : The Gender Similarities    Hypothesis, Janet Shibley Hyde          Gendered Society : \"So, That    Explains It\": Psychoanalytic and Developmental Perspectives on Gender    [86-101, 106-110]                       Study Questions                   Why is it meaningful to say that gender identities are both     voluntary and coerced?          How does gender inequality in modern society influence the power     most men feel they have?          What do people mean when they say institutions are gendered?          Why might some argue that Freud\u2019s theory attributed key gender     differences to biology while others argue that it did not?          How is it possible that gender identity (whether we are male or     female and what it means to be either) is learned (not inherent or     biological), but that we experience it as natural and     unchangeable?          What did Gilligan claim about the relationship between gender and     ethics, and why has the claim been controversial?          How would you explain the term \u201csex roles?\u201d          How does Dozier\u2019s study raise questions about standard ways of     distinguishing \u201csex\u201d from \u201cgender\u201d or claims that gender is socially     constructed by people \u201cdoing gender\u201d in interactions?          What is the \u201cgender similarities hypothesis\u201d and how do research     findings support or not support it?          According to Ridgeway, how are gender stereotypes related to a     general problem of coordinating social interactions? (And can     you identify any serious problems with Ridgeway's argument about this     proposed relationship? This part is very high difficulty.)          How, according to Ridgeway might the existence of framing lead to     social inequality?          According to Ridgeway what is the difference between specific     status beliefs and diffuse status beliefs?                             III.

How has the popularity of     biological explanations varied across historical periods and     cultures?          How is the work of evolutionary psychologists relevant to     the study of gender inequality, and what limits the value of its     contribution?          What seems to be the historical pattern of motives behind     brain research and hormonal research concerned with gender (and     sexuality) differences, and the results they find?          What was the influential argument that Margaret Mead     presented in 1935 book Sex and Temperament in Three Primitive     Societies?          Why are those who study gender inequality so concerned with     the division of labor?          When comparing across societies, what are some of the     conditions that seem to correlate with or indicate high levels of     gender inequality?          What do we know about the relationship between testosterone     levels and violent behavior?          According to Herdt, what is the significance of \u201ccoming     out\u201d rituals?          How does it make sense to think about the role of biology     in the origins of gender inequality?          How and why do we distinguish explaining the origins of     gender inequality from the persistence of gender     inequality?                             IV.

Study Questions                   Summarize important changes in women\u2019s economic     participation over the past 150 years. Among other things, it is     useful to consider differences by period, by type of women, and by     type of job.          How does the movement of women into traditionally male jobs     compare to the movement of men into traditionally female jobs?          How does employment potentially serve as a source of pride,     obligation, resources, negative identity for men and for women?      The goal here is to think through the reasons that women and men seek     and hold jobs and the effects that having (or not having) those jobs     have upon them.          What contributes to the wage/income differential between     women and men?          Explain the \u201cglass ceiling.\u201d          How did goverment policies, laws, and actions influence     women's changing employment in the twentieth century?          According to Ridgeway, how have framing processes     influenced the jobs into which women are hired, women\u2019s promotions,     and women\u2019s wages/salaries?          Why is the analysis of \u201ctokenism\u201d important for     understanding changes in women\u2019s economic participation?          What seem to be the causes and the effects of sexual     harassment?          How can we explain how women\u2019s economic participation has     changed over the long term? Consider the motives and the     actions of women, ordinary men, and powerful men. Also consider     the difference between women\u2019s movement into low-status jobs and     their movement into high-status jobs.          According to Reskin, what causes women\u2019s wages or income to     be lower than that of men, and how does that argument relate to the     ideas present in other readings this week?          How have different kinds of discrimination influenced     women\u2019s experiences in the economy?                             IX. Political processes and individual action.

Why do we want to distinguish between ordinary and powerful men while explaining the     persistence and decline of gender inequality?          Responding to changing circumstances, women and men sometimes      adopted new strategies or changed their typical behavior in ways      that contributed to gender inequality\u2019s decline over time.      However, even as they contributed to gender inequality's decline,      they typically did not seek to reduce gender inequality, commonly      did not favor a change in gender expectations, and often did not      even recognize that their actions could or would affect gender      inequality. So, how do we explain this pattern?          Why has men\u2019s defense of gender inequality declined over the past     150 years?          How have the goals of feminist movements been compatible      with (the effects and requirements of) long-term structural      changes in the U.S. and other modern societies? And in what      ways have their goals been in conflict with that long-term      trajectory          Assess the reasoning behind these two claims: \u201cmen have probably     sustained their gender advantages more through competition with other     men than through efforts to keep women from enjoying similar     opportunities or status\u201d; \u201cmen resisting women\u2019s advance      [typically] understood themselves to be fulfilling their      obligations or protecting well-earned rights\u201d.          How did both ordinary men\u2019s interests in opposing improvements in     women\u2019s status and their capacity to do so change over     time?           Writers have suggested that men long opposed women\u2019s movement     into high-status jobs (and women\u2019s access to higher education that     would prepare them for such jobs) because adding women would increase the     competition men would face for promotions and the like. Why is this a     strong or weak argument?          Why are culturally derived beliefs and rational calculations both     important for understanding changes over time in men\u2019s typical     actions that affected gender inequality? (Note that the same question     can be asked about women\u2019s typical actions.)          If most men in positions of organizational power share a     discriminatory attitude towards women, why do we expect any men with     similar organizational power who do not share these discriminatory     biases still to act (in their jobs) largely like their discriminatory     colleagues? (Note this question relates to the general problem of why     people conform, but in this question focuses on the causes specific     to the context of organizational power.)          What do analysts mean by the \u201cmale rebellion\u201d against marriage in     the second half of the twentieth century, and why might it have     occurred?           Why did men in government think differently about the woman     suffrage issue than ordinary male voters? How does this compare     to differences between the ways that employers\u2019 thought about hiring     women and the ways that male workers thought about it?          How do we explain women\u2019s difficulties at achieving economic     power through entrepreneurial success, rising through organizational     ranks, or inheriting wealth?          How do we explain women\u2019s difficulties at achieving political     power, both as individuals and collectively?          How have feminist efforts contributed to the reduction in gender     inequality, and how have those efforts fallen short?                             X.

What were the major influences responsible for the rise of     meritocratic ideas and their increasing     influence?           Why does Ridgeway stress it is important not only that we     hold stereotypical beliefs about gender, but that we can take it for     granted that others hold them as well?          According to Ridgeway, what are the most basic, shared     beliefs about differences between women and men in our culture (we     are concerned with the content of the beliefs, not the     terminology)?          What, according to Ridgeway, decides which gender     stereotypes are embodied in popular beliefs about the differences     between women and men?

Table of Contents                              Description \u2013 Scope, Organization, and Access:      The Scope of the Topics and Materials.      We know a lot about gender inequality \u2013 its history, how people     experience it in their lives, the ways it varies in intensity and form     across time and place, the beliefs that make it seem natural, and much     more. The outpouring of research and commentary on gender     inequality over the past half century has been extraordinary.      Unfortunately, despite all this, our understanding of what causes     gender inequality remains troubled. Both ordinary people and experts     (such as scholars) commonly fluctuate between simplistic explanations     that founder under close scrutiny and throwing up their hands in     frustration over what can seem an enigma beyond human     comprehension. Here we will seek to surmount this dilemma.      We will explore diverse facets of gender inequality and varied ideas     about what causes might be decisive. We will also look carefully     at the ways we can identify and verify the causes of social     phenomena. Through these efforts we will aim both to enhance our     understanding of what produces gender inequality and to improve our     general ability to do causal social analyses effectively.      The class     organization and goals. In this class, each week's work will     be organized around an analytical task, as well as a set of     readings. Rather than focusing on discussion of the readings,     the analytical tasks involve attempting a causal analysis of some     aspect of gender inequality related to the week's issue, building on     the materials we read (in brief papers of a couple pages). The     approach in this class seeks to develop analytical skills as well as     understandings of the relevant literature by stressing doing actual     analyses of gender inequality. (Note: this class does not have an exam     nor a final paper.)      All class meetings are organized as discussions. Part of our     class discussions will be on the common readings and part on students'     efforts to explore the analytical tasks each week. We will     adjust the time devoted to these two goals according to our     experiences over the class. Every week, students will initiate     discussions on readings and papers. To make this work, each week's     papers will be exchanged (electronically) with enough lead time that     we can all read all the papers prior to the class meetings.      Each topic below includes \u2013 beside the common readings \u2013     three other subsections. These are: an analytical task ,     recommended readings , and related readings . The analytical task is the writing     assignment for the week. Everyone should read the common     readings while doing the analytical task (and be prepared to     discuss them). In each of these papers \u2013 always brief      papers \u2013 students will try out causal ideas related to the week's     topic. Recommended and     related readings are optional      materials useful for those who want to dig deeper into a topic.      To simplify navigating through the syllabus, these subsections are     hidden until the viewer clicks on the subsection heading, then they     will appear.      Most of our readings will be articles available for downloading.      The links will appear in the online version of the course     syllabus. Excerpts from Down So Long . . .: The Puzzling     Persistence of Gender Inequality (book manuscript by RMJ not yet     published) will similarly be available for downloading from the class web     site. (As we will read selections from Jackson's book Destined     for Equality [Harvard U Press] throughout the course, you might     want to buy it or borrow it.)      Any student unfamiliar with the study of gender, can (and probably     should) pick up the basics from a standard textbook in the area \u2013 I     recommend Michael Kimmel's Gendered Society (which I use in my     basic general undergraduate class on gender, so used copies should be     easy to find).      For further relevant sources, my reading lists/syllabi for two     graduate courses might be valuable. The one most directly     related is      What Causes Gender Inequality:     Analytical Foundations ; a more general class,           What Causes Inequality: Analytical     Foundations , may provide materials for broader     questions about different kinds of inequalities and how to think about     gender inequality in relationship to them.       A note      on the \"hidden\" material below : Each section of     this guide includes \u2013 beside the common readings \u2013 three     subsections, one for an analytical task , one for recommended     readings , and one for related readings . To     simplify navigating through the course guide, only the headings for     these subsections are initially visible. The contents of all     these subsections are hidden (so that the beginning appearance of the     page is similar to a standard syllabus) until the viewer clicks on a     subsection heading, then its contents will appear. While this     organization is helpful for negotiating the page most of the time, it     can become an obstacle if we want to search the page (for example, for     a particular article) as searches will ignore the hidden material     (that is, if you search a page you are viewing in an internet browser,     the search will only examine what is shown on the page at that time).      To overcome this limitation, you can \"open\" all the hidden sections to     show everything on the page by clicking the \u00a7 symbol at the top of the     page. (To restore the page to the normal condensed view, simply     reload the page which will collapse all the \"hidden\" sections to their     usual look). The table of contents at the top of this page will     aid speedy navigation to any topic, which is particularly helpful if     you reveal all the \"hidden\" material.                              The Topics                I. Introduction. What    do we mean by gender inequality?     To analyze the causes of gender     inequality, we need to know what we mean by gender     inequality. How can we conceive of and talk about     gender inequality in ways that are general enough to apply across the     range of relevant phenomena, consistent enough to minimize conceptual     ambiguities, and precise enough to be analytically effective?      Gender inequality has been extraordinarily diverse and wide     spread. Women and men are unequal in every conceivable way in     endless circumstances, both immediate and enduring, by both objective     criteria and subjective experience. So, what counts as gender     inequality? Can we characterize it in ways that let us confidently and     impartially assess when there is more or less of it?

II. Causality - What are causes,    mechanisms, and the like?     We casually refer to causes and effects in normal   interactions all the time. We all conduct our lives \u2013 choosing actions,   making decisions, trying to influence others \u2013 based on theories about why   and how things happen in the world. From the early stages of childhood   we attribute causes, building a vision of the social (and physical) world   that makes it understandable. Every action, every choice about what to   do, is based on our anticipation of its effects, our understandings of   consequences. Analytical and scientific reasoning has a similar form,   but requires that we approach causation more systematically and   self-consciously.          Analytical     Task                 The general      analytical problem . In this and other societies,      women and men commonly dress differently. Prepare a      causal analysis that seeks to explain why women and men dress      differently .              Our analytical task this week is to attempt a \"simple\"       causal analysis of a gender difference that is obvious but not       often questioned - the way we dress. The purpose of this       exercise is to get us thinking about causality.        To the degree that we can, we want to try to think of       different kinds of causes based on varied ways of framing the       causal question. Realistically, one could easily write a       book about all the possible ways of interpreting this causal       question and answering it. We are just trying to develop       some sensible insights in a couple pages.                   Thinking Tools .       The starting point of most causal analyses is a comparison.       When we start with the general question \"what causes X?\" we turn      it into possible comparisons to produce an answer. Examples      of such questions might be \"why do people in group A do X more      than those in group B?,\" \"why does X occur more often in summer      than winter?,\" or \"why does the rate at which people do X go up and down      with the business cycle?\" The underlying idea is simple but      powerful. If we are trying to explain some phenomenon, X,      then we need to identify variations in the likelihood of X or the      rate of X, and look for potential causes that (1) vary across the      relevant circumstances in a way that could explain X and (2) that      we can connect to the outcomes for X in some way. For      example, with the gender distinctive clothing question, some ways      to better specify the question and look at it through comparisons      are:              What causes individual       conformity to the cultural pattern? What       induces women and men to conform to the expectations for       dressing differently? Whenever we observe a consistent       pattern of social behavior, some common conditions or       processes must be inducing people to act in a similar       way. Figuring out what encourages conformity and       discourages deviance allows us to provide a causal       explanation. Think about what happens to people who do       not conform to the expectations about male and female       appropriate clothing. And, just as important, ask why it       is that people punish nonconformists. Here the basic       comparison is between people who conform and those who do not,       or between the reactions of people to conformity and       nonconformity.        What causes differences       in dress \"codes\" across cultures? What circumstances       could exist across societies that consistently produce gender       differences in modes of dress? The clothing       characteristic of each sex varies greatly across societies       (and time). Clothing differs between \"primitive\"       cultures and modern ones, between warm and cold climates, and       between different parts of the world. But seemingly       everywhere men and women dress differently. How can we       explain this pattern? Here the primary comparison is       between cultures that have different clothing.        Why do the expectations       about clothing differences vary by context ? Why       are gender differences in dress greater in some circumstances       than in others? For example, both women and men may wear       similar coveralls in a factory, but women and men generally       wear dramatically different clothing to formal dances.        Our efforts to find causes behind any phenomena are improved       by looking at variations. If male and female clothing is       just a little different in some contexts but greatly different       in others, we can usefully focus on what might produce this       variance in gender differences. Here the primary       comparison is between contexts with greater differences in the       expected clothing and contexts with lesser differences.                   Thinking Tools 2 .       While considering how to explain the differences in the ways      women and men dress, it can also be helpful to think through       ways that this pattern could be considered an example of a       larger pattern. The explanation for the broader pattern       may be different or easier to develop. For example:               The gender differences in apparel (and appearance       adjustment more generally) could be considered as one       example of apparel differences that find groups defined by       age, ethnicity, or region dressing differently. That       is to say, it is not only women and men who consistently       dress differently. Different ways of dressing also       distinguish other groups. If we think about those       other groups, does it give us insights into explaining the       difference between women's and men's clothing?        The gender differences in dress could be considered as one       example of a wider range of behavioral differences between       women and men such as rules of proper decorum, speech       patterns, or displays of sexuality. That is, we can       point to other presentational differences between women and       men. If we think about the range of these       presentational differences, do they suggest ideas that might       help explain differences in apparel?

How is gender inequality    symbolized and reproduced in everyday life?     To start our investigation of the causes of gender   inequality, we will consider how people experience and act out gender in   their day to day lives. We want to think about the most basic   questions. Why and when do women and men act differently? Why   and when do people respond differently to women than men? How do all   these private individual actions when taken together over time influence the   understanding of gender in a culture and gender inequality?          Analytical     Task                  The general       analytical problem . Using a typical setting       where women and men meet, assess how Ridgeway's framing       approach helps explain the role of gender in these       interactions and where it might fall short.               For this task, we choose some familiar (to us) setting        or type of interaction where women and men typically        engage each other. For example, this could be a        workplace, a bar, interactions between buyers and sellers,        or parties. We use this as our source of empirical        data and focus our argument on explaining gender        interactions there.         First, we need to read Ridgeway's argument        carefully. Then we try to apply her argument to the        setting we have chosen.         We want to assess how much we believe people's actions (in        the context we chose) fit the expectations we can derive        from her argument and when they might not. As we        work on our analyses, we are evaluating Ridgeway's        approach as a tool. The right tool allows us to construct        a better edifice with less effort; the wrong tool does        not.                      Thinking tools .       The remaining notes for this analytical task look at some       analytical steps that allow us to think through this problem       effectively.               Systematic steps in        the analysis . Doing this kind of thought        experiment, we want our thinking to be as systematic as        possible. For all systematic causal analyses, we        want to consider how the phenomenon being examined varies        in regular or predictable ways across conditions,        settings, types of people, places, or the like. Then, we        ask what conditions or events typically precede or occur        along with the outcomes that could plausibly influence        those outcomes.                 For example, first, we simply consider possible         differences between men's and women's actions.          Then we consider how their actions might differ         between opposite-sex and same-sex encounters.          We can broaden the range of the examples we use to         think about these differences by considering other         characteristics that might affect interactions, such         as the age or race of the people, whether the         interaction is cordial or unfriendly, how well the         people know each other, and so on.          We want to ask ourselves if the gender aspect of the         interaction will be influenced by these other         circumstances that seem relevant to interactions. For         example, does gender influence cordial interactions         differently from the ways it influences confrontations         in our setting? If we believe the answer         is yes, then we consider how and why.          Analogously, we want to think about the ways that         people's goals in gendered interactions vary in these         kinds of circumstances, and how these goals influence         their actions. For example, in the same setting,         a person seeking sex will commonly act differently         than someone trying to curry favor or sell a product.                  When we apply a systematic logic to the analysis, we         usually do not want to write about all the         possibilities we think about. Instead, we use         the ones that we find telling. But we will not         identify those telling possibilities unless we         systematically work through all the relevant possible         influences.                         Gender context .        We can take the analysis of interactions another step by        considering how the influence of gender on these        interactions is potentially affected by conditions like:                 the presence or absence of onlookers (i.e., the         relative privacy of the interaction) or          the gender distribution of other people present         (i.e., mostly male, mostly female, or mixed)                         Conformity .         Whenever we try to explain patterns like this, we want to        consider the exceptions. When will people violate        the implications of gender expectations and what follows        when they do? Are there circumstances that make it        more likely people will depart from conventional        behavior? Violations of norms or common expectations        are valuable for causal analyses because cracks in the        veneer of social order can reveal its structure and        dynamics.                      Bring it       together . After working through the steps       above, we try to assess when Ridgeway's approach does a good       job explaining how gender influences behavior in our chosen       setting, and when her approach seems to fall short. Do       we see ways that her approach neglects or misunderstands       important causes influencing the gender character of behavior       in the context we examine? Our central goal here is to       explain how and why gender organizes interactions in our       chosen example. We are not attempting a general evaluation of       Ridgeway's ideas, but a focused assessment of their       effectiveness in the setting we have selected to try them out.

And how does    explaining the \"origins\" of gender inequality relate to explaining the    \"persistence\" of gender inequality?     Although some scholars may question if    women have been subordinate in all societies, all agree that men have been   dominant in most societies although the degree of dominance varies   greatly. This raises the very tricky question, how do we explain the   prevalence of male dominance? This exceedingly elusive question   continues to elude any answer that will evoke a consensus.          Analytical     Task                  Analytical Task       Alternative 1: An analytical critique . As most       of us lack the substantive knowledge needed to develop even       simple analyses of gender inequality's possible origins, we       will explore the causal possibilities by responding to the       arguments of people who are knowledgeable.               Please read the \" Basics of Causal        Descriptions \" on a separate page for some simple,        beginning ideas about describing a causal analysis.         Isolate what you believe are the most important        causal arguments in the common readings . Give        a critical assessment of their different approaches .         In doing this, try to pay attention to what it is that        makes you find the causal arguments more or less        persuasive. The recommended and related readings        provide a range of material that you can look at as you        need to deepen and sharpen your arguments.                       It can be helpful to look back at the material from        Topic II, especially Gerring's list of criteria for causal        arguments.                      Analytical Task       Alternative 2: A hypothetical scenario . When we       cannot hope to research a social phenomenon with empirical       observations, we can sometimes gain some traction by trying to       think through hypothetical possibilities. Here is an       example.               Assume that sometime in the near future we launch a        rocket into space with a crew of 1,000. This crew is        evenly divided between women and men, the women and men        have similar credentials and accomplishments, and the two        sexes are about equally represented at each level of        authority. The crew members' cultural understandings        are similar to those of college students today.         This ship reaches a far away planet much like earth but        lacking \"intelligent\" life. Unfortunately, the        ship's engines have become unstable and the crew must        abandon it. So they must start life on this new        planet. While they possess much advanced knowledge,        they have no technology. They must start from        scratch, producing food, organizing themselves into a        community, pairing off to reproduce, slowly building        toward some kind of technological development over        generations. [Note: If the distant planet scenario        seems unnerving, we could have the same effect by dropping        a 1,000 people on a remote island that is isolated as a        social experiment.]         Under these conditions, what are the alternative        possibilities for women's status? What might decide        which alternative occurs?

What determines men's and    women's roles and positions within families?     Family and kinship are potentially relevant to gender   inequality in varied ways and a lot of work had pursued such issues.    Probably the two most important general issues involve the ways that women   and men are unequal within families and the ways that family organization   both contributes to and is influenced by gender inequality beyond the family   institution. We will just touch the surface of these issues this week.          Analytical     Task                  The general       analytical problem . We want to provide an       integrated analytical overview of the principal causal       arguments about gender inequality and family organization that       appear in the common readings.        Each of the readings has various causal arguments about       family organization, some directly about gender inequality,       some relevant to gender inequality but not directly exploring       it. Some of the causal questions may receive different       causal analyses by these authors. Sometimes two or more       authors may use a similar causal approach to explain different       causal problems. Our goal is to sort this out.        Our overviews should be organized around the causal       arguments, not        a series of summaries of what each author wrote (see Thinking       Tools).        Thinking tools .               We want to use one of the following two possible ways to        organize the causal assessment (unless one of us has a        better way). The first organizes around what is to        be explained, the second around the causes.                 First approach .          We start by identifying the principal causal problems         addressed by the group of papers. That is, we         figure out what they suggest needs to be         explained. Then, we organize these causal         problems in a sensible order (including consideration         of some problems potentially being secondary or         sub-problems of others). Under each causal         problem, we summarize and assess all the relevant         explanations found in the readings.          Second approach .          We start by identifying the principal causal         frameworks used in the papers. That is, we         figure out what they suggest are the conditions or         processes that have the most important influence over         the outcomes. Then, we organize these causal         frameworks in a sensible order, taking into account         which are entirely different and which might be         variations of a similar theme, and which are competing         versus complementary. For each of these, after         summarizing the causal logic of the framework, we show         how it has been used by these authors, describing the         range of outcomes the framework is supposed to         determine and how it has such effects.          Note that         regardless which way we organize our analysis of         competing causal arguments, it can be valuable to         think about not only what is          considered by the authors being examine, but also         which theoretical questions and which causal         frameworks seem relevant but absent.                         Please reread the \" Basics of Causal        Descriptions \" on the starting point for describing a        causal analysis.                      Bringing it       together . In short, our aim is to produce a       critical overview of the principal causal arguments concerning       the family and gender inequality, starting with the ideas       present in the common readings for this week. To do this       effectively, we need to identify all the relevant causal       arguments, deduce the logical structure of each causal       argument and determine how to present that clearly (even if       the original source is inconsistent or ambiguous), detect how       the causal arguments (from different sources) relate to each       other and present them in a way that makes those relations       clear, and, where possible, summarize the important analytical       strengths and weaknesses of each argument (or facet to an       argument).       (We should start with the understanding that this kind of       analytical overview is rather easy to do poorly and very       demanding to do well and thoroughly. At this stage we       are not aspiring to a professional job but hoping to achieve       a reasonable, if basic, analysis.)                             Common Readings           Andrew J.

What is the role of    sexuality?     Sexuality has been evoked in     multiple ways in the study of gender inequality. Some have     considered it as a possible motivating cause for inequality, others have     explored how gender inequality can mold the experience and practice of     sexuality, and others have tried to theoretically incorporate     sexuality as a peculiar tension between women and men that mediates     both the causes and effects of gender inequality. Essentially,     everyone recognizes sexuality is critically important to gender     inequality, but we lack agreement or clarity on how it matters.          Analytical     Task                 The general analytical      problem . Our central task this week is to propose a      causal account that plausibly explains the relationship between one      aspect of sexuality and gender inequality.              Everyone who analyzes gender inequality considers sexuality       important, but they have highly varied ideas about what       matters and why. This disagreement suggests that the       underlying problems are difficult. We cannot       hope to solve them in this brief effort. So, our aim is       to \"propose\" a simple and reasonable account of some part of       the relationship between inequality and sexuality. We are        not trying to develop a full, professional analysis.        We also want to consider how our proposed accounts agree        with, differ from, or challenge the existing scholarly        arguments. Again, our goal here is limited. The        aim is to give a reasonable first sense of how the proposed        account fits (or does not fit).                   Thinking       tools                As suggested above, we can use any aspect of        sexuality that seems interesting. However, it may        help if the selected facet of sexuality:                 has a relationship to gender inequality that at         least some writers think is important. Which way         it is important is wide open. The role of the         chosen sexuality characteristic relative to gender         inequality may be cause, effect, catalyst, or whatever         else seems causally relevant.          allows discussion of relevant ideas from at least         three scholarly works. These may be part of the         common readings, any of the other readings recommended         here, or another legitimate source. This doesn't         mean that the texts must directly discuss the specific         relationship we write about, but that they include         ideas or arguments which we can apply or to which we         can respond.                         A basic approach to the task presentation might have the        following three parts:                 First, we lay out the causal, explanatory         problem. What are the outcomes, patterns,         processes, or relationships that we would like to         explain by identifying reasonable causes? And         why is this important enough to merit attention? (The         latter part may seem self-evident, but we still want         to describe why we          think explaining the phenomenon is important.)          Second, we provide the causal analysis. We         want to be as complete as possible within reasonable         space limits. And, we want to be clear, simple,         and direct.          Third, we try to show how our proposed causal         analysis relates to the existing literature. For         our purposes, we can limit ourselves to considering a         couple theories or perspectives that would support or         compliment our approach and a couple that would be         likely to question our proposed causal analysis.          (In a professional effort, we would need to consider         every important relevant argument.) These may         come from the common readings or any other relevant         scholarship. When discussing those who might         disagree, we want to be as specific as possible about         what criticism we would expect from each of these         \"opponents\" and how we might respond.                                      Bringing it       together . In short, our aim is to construct a       basic causal argument seeking to understand how some aspect of       sexuality is related to gender inequality, and to assess how       that causal argument relates to the existing literature (as       represented in our readings).

Attempts to explain gender inequality at all levels are   haunted by essentialism . Essentialist arguments impute   distinctive attributes to women and men and attribute the social differences   between women's and men's activities, opportunities, statuses, and roles to   these distinct attributes. Even theoretical analyses of gender   inequality that expressly reject the possibility of consequential, inherent   sex differences, commonly build their explanations of inequality on   gender differences. To complicate matters, essentialist arguments   proclaiming superior attributes for women exist alongside of the arguments   proclaiming women inferior. Moreover, while for some, essentialism   always means a difference based in biology or genetics, for others it   includes cultural differences that are embodied in women and men.          Analytical     Task                 The general analytical problem .      To investigate how essentialist arguments work, we will      examine how different kinds of essentialist arguments might be      applied to explain some aspect of gender inequality, in contrast      to a non-essentialist argument. We aim to see both the      attraction of essentialist arguments and the possibilities for      alternatives.             Select one form or facet of gender inequality that you will       try to explain for this task. This instance or aspect of       gender inequality should be sufficiently important,       widespread, and enduring or recurring to merit thoughtful       theory and explanation. It should also be narrow or       specific enough that the goal of explaining it is       plausible. For example, the facet might be that wives       commonly defer to husbands.        For the selected type or aspect of gender inequality, you       will suggest five alternative explanations, each one       representing a different approach to explaining such social       phenomena. The explanations should be succinct but       clear. They should also be plausible to the extent that       a reasonable person might make such an argument. Plausible       does not mean true, of course. Rather, we are trying to       imagine an argument that would seem plausible to people who       are advocates for each of the perspectives.                   The five types of explanation .       Attempt to devise the best explanations you can for the relevant      facet of inequality from each of the following      perspectives. Explanations may be categorized in many      ways. The five perspectives defined here are meant to engage      different responses to the problem of essentialism.              Direct biological - Devise an explanation claiming       that some biological difference between the sexes produces the       relevant aspect of inequality by making women and men act       differently. For example, an argument might be that men       are stronger than women so men dominate women as a simple       result of superior strength. (More complex biological       explanations might be derived from evolutionary       psychology.) This type of explanation is usually purely       essentialist. Note that this type of explanation can be       divided further into those relying on real biological       differences and those imputing fictional biological       differences. Let us stress biological differences that       are at least potentially real here, leaving the fictitious       ones for below.        Indirect biological - Formulate an explanation       claiming some biological difference does not directly       produce the inequality, but the biological difference has       important effects or implications of some sort, and those       effects that make likely or unavoidable the emergence or       persistence of the selected aspect of gender inequality.        For example, someone might argue that women's child bearing       makes them anxious about the welfare of their children, and       that anxiety makes them feel weak and in want of a protector,       leading them to defer to husbands. Or, others might       suggest that women's biologically induced child rearing       orientation encourages both women and men to make men       responsible for warfare, and that men's resulting skill at       combat, their possession of weapons, and men's organization       around mutual defense leaves wives typically in their       husbands' control. The key for this type of explanation       is that the relevant biological differences do not directly       cause the gender inequality being explained, but have effects       on social behavior and social organization that lead to gender       inequality. These types of explanations have       essentialist origins in a biological difference, but the       explanation as a whole may invoke mediating causal influences       that reduce the essentialist quality, sometimes greatly.        Non-biological sex difference - Suggest how       some socially constructed difference between women and men \u2013       one that is neither biological nor a direct result of       biological differences \u2013 initiates or preserves the aspect of       gender inequality being explained. This will usually be       an enduring individual characteristic (a difference that       people carry with them, not a difference in their       circumstances). For example, one might claim that women       are fearful and dependent because of socialization processes       (that have no biological basis), and this psychological       condition induces wives to defer to their husbands. Or,       one might argue that childhood sports available only to boys       result in a higher competitive drive that accounts for adult       men's greater success in business. This type of       explanation claims a real difference exists between women and       men (in the society or social context where the inequality       being explained occurs; the relevant sex difference need not       exist in all or any other society or social context), but this       difference is a social construction. This type of       explanation often becomes redundantly circular: each aspect of       inequality exists as a result of inequality, and that overall       inequality is constituted by the various aspects.        Fictitious sex difference - An imputed sex       difference that does not really exist is claimed to play a       significant role in producing the selected facet of gender       inequality. For example, someone might suggest that       although women have no better capacity for child rearing,       people commonly assume they do because women bear children,       and that this false expectation produces a division of labor       and power favoring men. This type of explanation focuses       on the consequences of beliefs, relying on the observation       that beliefs can organize behavior even if they are false       beliefs. While such fictitious differences are commonly       assumed to be biological, they need not be.        Causes independent of sex differentiation - A       causal process that does not involve any difference between       the sexes is argued to produce the inequality being       considered. For example, some might argue that for       families to fulfill their social functions effectively, they       need one spouse/parent to perform the critical emotional       actions needed and the other spouse/parent to perform the       practical and leadership actions (this is essentially a       well-know idea of Talcott Parsons). This role       differentiation can then result in spouse inequality, as an       indirect and unintended consequence. This category       includes highly diverse explanations, the one critical       similarity among them being that they do not rely on a sex       difference in their central causal argument. It may be       worth noting that one reason explanations based on sex       differences (including all the preceding perspectives) are       more common is that formulating a plausible analysis that       forgoes the mechanism of sex differences is often a hard task.                         (Note, in this task we are aiming to produce explanations that      those advocating each of the above types of explanation would      think are reasonable. It is often hardest to conceive good      explanations from the points of view we find unconvincing or      unappealing, but the capacity to do this is a valuable skill.)       Bringing it together .       The point of this exercise is to examine how it is possible to      devise a range of alternative causal explanations of gender      inequality stressing some mechanism of sex differences, while      developing alternative theories that do not rely on sex      differences is rather hard. The difference arguments run the      full range from being directly and fully biological to relying on      non-biological or fictitious differences in indirect ways.       The arguments that exclude not only biology but all dependence on      sex differences commonly derive from another theoretical approach,      such as functionalism or conflict theories. The challenge      with these approaches is not only to make the immediate causal      process eschew differences, but to avoid relying on sex      differences one or two steps earlier in the causal chain.

What is the role of     violence and intimidation in the relationships between men and     women?     Most theoretical approaches to gender inequality   suggest that violence between women and men plays a role in sustaining   inequality; some also point toward violence as an initial    cause. A recurring issue concerns the degree to which violence is an   expression or result of gender inequality or, alternatively, is a cause of   inequality. The separate roles of rape, harassment, and domestic   violence, and their relationships to each other are another critical   question. Much research and argument has also been focused on the   question of women's aggressive impulses and actions.          Analytical     Task                 Analytical Task 1:      Explain why women do not engage in sexual harassment or sexual      violence at anything like the rates that men do? Our      strategy is to reverse the usual way people approach the problem      of gender violence.              When people refer to the patterns of violence between women       and men (in modern societies), they are usually referring to       several distinctive patterns including sexual violence       (particularly rape), sexual harassment, and intimate partner       violence (which includes wife battering). These       categories implicitly distinguish patterns of aggression based       on several criteria: the degree to which the aggressive acts       involve sexuality, the severity of the aggressive acts, and       the relationship between the man and woman. These       aggressive actions in these categories are all related to       gender inequality both in that inequality engenders them and       that they reinforce gender inequality. They are       particularly linked in their contributions to women\u2019s fear and       sense of physical vulnerability. And that fear is       crucial. For it is the prospect of possible violence       that induces women to restrict their behavior, to seek male       protectors, and to heed men\u2019s wishes.        Here, to simplify our task, we will set aside the question       of intimate partner violence.        To begin, you might consider what determines the actions of       women that do or do not lead to violence and how those       immediate determinants differ from the determinants for       men. Men vary greatly, so you must decide if you will       abstract away all that variation (to talk of \"men\" in the most       generic or abstract possible manner) or if you feel that some       variations (e.g. wealth or age) require consideration.        Remember that you can restrict the scope of your analysis.               Potential determinants include beliefs, resources,        opportunities, the anticipated consequences of alternative        actions         Another way to look at it is the old detective's script:        motives, means, opportunity         It is commonly useful to start your reasoning        concretely, using what you know best. Think about        the kinds of people you know best, either through personal        experience or from studying them. Try to explain        concretely why the women do not engage in sexual        harassment or sexual violence more. This gives you a        starting point.               Expect to develop your argument backwards from the concrete       beginnings. This means that after you assemble your       first round explanation of what directly influences women's       actions, you take those explanatory conditions as the problem       to explain in the second. For example, if you used       women's beliefs about violence as an immediate cause of their       restrained violence, then you next need to consider why they       have different beliefs from men. You want to produce at       least two levels of the causal analysis, and see if you can do       three.        Please take the time to look over the lists of Recommended       and Related Readings. You are likely to find some work       there what will shorten the time needed to complete this task.                              Analytical Task 2 : Try      to develop a clear causal analysis of the role played in      gender inequality by a fear of violence.                    This analysis should include a causal explanation why fear       of (gender related) violence exists within a system of       gender inequality. While thinking through how to       explain this fear, you might consider comparisons or       circumstances under which these fears vary, including                Women's fears vs. men's fears         The circumstances under which women experience greater        fear and those where they feel safe         Differences in the amount of fear typical amongst        groups or categories of women according to their age,        affluence, location, companions, or any other relevant        social condition         Differences in the distribution of fear across        societies distinguished by such conditions as forms of        economic and political organization, degree of        development, prevailing religious or cultural        institutions and the like                       This analysis should also include a causal explanation of       the consequences for gender inequality of the distribution       of fears of violence. In what ways do fears of       violence influence the behavior of women or the       relationships between women and men? Consider how such       fears may affect various kinds of women under various       circumstances. But remember to return to aggregate       effects \u2013 it is the impact of these fears on the pattern of       women's experiences and behavior that affects gender       inequality writ large.        Avoid the analytic temptation to argue as if equality       might imply an absence of discord and aggression.        Realistically, equality between two groups by itself only       leads us to expect that acts of aggression will occur with       equal frequency and effect between members of the two       groups. Removing inequality as a source of discord       should reduce one kind of frustrations that motivate       aggression. Other sources of discord still exist,       however, and some forms of aggression that would be       suppressed by inequality might even rise.        Try to introduce appropriate connections between the       argument(s) you present and the readings. Consider not       only the common readings from this week, but also past       readings and optional ones from this week that seem       particularly relevant.        The causal arguments should try to conform to the       standards for a good causal argument that we have read about       and discussed. Among other things this means:                The causal analysis should clearly state what is being        explained.         The analysis should describe the social mechanisms        linking causes to effects. It should show what        happens in the world that produces the outcomes, what        kinds of people or organizations behave in manner, what        circumstances arise that induce the relevant behavior,        and so forth. This may be abstract at the level of        the causal model.         The analysis should consider why the decisive        causes exist and take the form that they do. That        is, the causal analysis should push back at least one        step past the causes being invoked to ask what causes        them.         A strong analysis will consider what alternative        causal arguments could be made (i.e., how the causal        processes could be different from what you describe) and        show what evidence or logic favors the argument you have        presented. A thorough causal analysis will        recognize that other causal models might be considered        plausable, and try to compare the causal model being        promoted to the alternatives.         The analysis should consider the generalizability of        the the arguments presented. It should consider to        what periods, places, types of societies, parts of        society, kinds of social relationships or interactions        do the arguments apply?         Most will find it difficult to do all of the above        effectively, so consider it suggestions about what would        be ideal, then apply your judgment about allocating your        time and effort.

How has the economy    influenced men's and women's positions in society?     Analyses of gender inequality attribute great   importance to the economy. Gender inequality appears everywhere   embedded in economic inequality, in the sense that a critical aspect of   gender inequality involves unequal access to economic resources and   positions. This relationship becomes clearer in more \"advanced\"   societies where economic organization has become institutionally   differentiated from kinship and political organization. Sometimes this   unequal economic access is understood as an expression of gender inequality,   sometimes a cause of gender inequality, sometimes a result. Many analyses   consider it all three.          Analytical     Task                 Analytical Task       1: Develop a causal analysis of economic inequality between      women and men that accounts for two empirical observations, one      being the earnings inequality between the sexes by the gender      composition of major occupational categories, the other being the      changing likelihood that wives will earn more than their husbands.              The data to be explained can be found in three tables (click to see) .        Use the tabs at the bottom to switch between tables.               The first table shows the 2012 earnings gap in the 20        occupational categories that have the largest number of        females. These have been sorted by the proportion        female. The numbers in dark red show the earnings        gap where women also account for two-thirds or more of the        those in the occupational category.         The second table shows the same kind of data as the        first, but is for the 20 occupational categories that have        the largest number of males. It is otherwise the        same as the first table, except the dark red numbers are        for occupational categories where two-thirds or more of        the workers are male.         The third table shows the changing proportion of married        couples where the wife earns more than the husband over        the 25 years up to 2011.                      Preliminary to developing an analysis, the first task is,       of course, to interpret what the data in the tables tell us       about economic inequality between women and men. It is       recommended that you focus on the dark red numbers of all the       tables. The first two tables are meant to be interpreted       as one.        The main task is to develop a background analysis of gender       inequality in the economy, as it exists today and how it has       changed over the past several decades. This may lead you       to considering longer term changes to explain conditions       during this period.        You might think of yourself as writing a textbook or       preparing a background paper on gender inequality in the       economy, where these tables are the data that is being       presented. Your goal is to offer an understanding of       these tables.        One way to think about this is in terms of what we don't see       in the tables.               Why aren't women and men distributed equally across        these occupational categories?         Why are women's earnings lower?         Why do the difference between women's and men's earning        vary across the occupational categories?         Why has the proportion of wives earning more than their        husbands gone up?         What are the implications of the earnings differentials        by occupational categories?         What are the implications of the data on wives'        earnings?         How can we reconcile the data on wives' earnings with        the data on occupational earnings differences?                      In short, we are aiming at a brief explanation of women's       vs. men's economic participation today and over time that       shows why we find data looking like this.                   Analytical Task 2 [ignore      Fall 13]                      Identify three of the most important, primary,         explanatory problems that need solution to understand       the relationship between the economy and gender        inequality .                 Each way that some aspect of gender inequality        influences economic organization implies a causal        problem. Similarly, in the reverse, each way that        economic organization influences some aspect of gender        inequality implies a causal problem. For example,        women used to have no access to most high-status        positions in the American economy and are now still        under represented in them. In either direction we        might consider the intensity or degree of gender        inequality, rather than some aspect of gender        inequality, as that which influences or is influenced by        economic organization. For each observation or        claim about economic inequality between women and men,        we can ask \"why?\" or \"how?\" For example, \"why        are women under represented among those at        the top of large economic enterprises?\" or \"how does        women's relative absence from positions great economic        power influence the persistence of gender inequality?\"         Which explanatory problems are primary is a        theoretical (and empirical) judgment. A         primary causal process is one without which the         relationship between the economy and gender inequality         would look and work differently . Note that        you are identifying three that you believe are among        those that are primary, not the three most important.                        For each of the three selected, primary,       explanatory problems, do the following: State clearly what        is the explanatory problem and why it is a        primary or important one . Think carefully about       what makes some causal processes more important than others       when we are trying to understand a social phenomenon (her       the relationship between gender inequality and economic       organization).        Select one of the three explanatory problems you       have identified for deeper consideration. For that       problem:                Briefly describe what stand out as the         possible causal processes that could account for        the relationship or condition that is the focus of the        explanatory problem. For example, what might        be the causal processes that account for few women        being in positions of high economic power? These        are the competing or alternative explanations for the        problem. These may include the causes or        explanations explicitly suggested in the literature        concerning the problem, or explanations derived from        applying a more general theoretical orientation (e.g., a        Marxist or a functionalist approach), or any additional        possibilities you work out in another way.          Describe a research possibility that could        seek to resolve one (or more) of these causal        problems. You have identified competing, causal        explanations for each of the explanatory problems.         For one of these, consider how we might hope to learn        which causal explanation is more valid by doing relevant        research. To do this, we usually want to think        about the circumstances under which the competing        theories suggest that something in the world should look        or work differently.                       To summarize, the analytical task involves (1) identifying       three primary, explanatory problems relating gender       inequality and economic organization, providing a careful       description for each of those explanatory problems, stating       why it is important, (2) for one explanatory problem,       exploring competing explanations that could solve the       problem, and describing a research design that could,       hypothetically, discover which explanation is better.

X. What role does ideology play in    determining the relations between men and women?     Ideology is near the center of almost all   efforts to explain gender inequalities. People's conceptions of   masculinity and femininity, ideas concerning the fairness of differential   treatment or expectations of women and men, internalized schema that   evoke different judgments of women's and men's actions, rules about proper   male and female behavior applied to children \u2013 all these and more concern the   influence of ideology on gender identities, differential treatment of women   and men, and the organization and persistence of gender inequality.    Conversely, each ideological belief that symbolizes, legitimates, invokes,   guides, induces, or helps sustain gender inequality is itself a product of   gender inequality. To untangle these complex causal interdependencies,   we must always attend carefully to two kinds of distinctions. First,   we must consistently recognize differences in levels of social organization,   including, among others, societal structures and culture, organizations,   social networks, social processes, and individual actors. While it is   tempting to treat ideological beliefs as diffuse entities unconnected to   identifiable people, organizations, or structures, the analytical results   are poor. Second, we must consistently distinguish between   contemporaneous causes (e.g., the ways that internalized schema can   influence interactions) and asynchronous or historical causes (e.g., the   ways that changes in domestic production induce different ideas about   women's place). Causal arguments about ideology consider it as both an   effect of gender inequality and a cause of gender inequality, although it is   ideology's potential role as a contributing cause that stands out as more   theoretically important.          Analytical     Task                 The general analytical problem .      For this week's task, we want to pose an initial analysis of the      relationship between ideology and some aspect of gender      inequality. We want to consider the joint direction of      causal influence for the selected context, how the dynamics of      inequality influences the ideas and how the presence of ideas      influences the understandings and actions of all the relevant      actors.             The aim of       this week's task is to explore the relationship between       beliefs \u2013 ideology \u2013 and some example of inequality. The       goal is to work through the various ways that ideas and       expectations are involved in the causal processes surrounding       gender inequality using the chosen example to do this at a       more concrete level. The purpose of the task       specification that follows is to help you to be systematic       about this.        To begin ,       choose one aspect or component of gender inequality.        This may involve the direct relationships between women and       men or a difference in the opportunities or status available       to women. Examples might be the way that women overall       select less prestigious fields of study than men in college,       that higher education used to be restricted for women, that       women are objects of sex trafficking, that male professional       sports have much higher status, or the different kinds of       restaurants that use male vs. female waiters. You might       try to be a bit creative. It can be helpful to focus your       discussion using a concrete instance of that type of       inequality with which you are familiar.                   Contents of the analysis .       Use this schematic outline as a starting point.             1        Clarify what aspect or component of gender inequality is your       focus.               As always, remember to give the basic characteristics        and principal patterns of the inequality as you understand        it. Among other possibilities, this will normally        include: (1) describe what is unequal; (2) describe what        this inequality looks like, how it is experienced, or how        it has its impact in social life; (3) assess how the        distribution appears or is manifest in the world, how we        would recognize the differences between more or less of        it, and how it is currently distributed).         The goal is to ensure the reader (and you) clearly        understand what inequality is relevant, and what examples        of that inequality you will address.                      2        Describe the principal ideological beliefs or ideas that seem       relevant to the inequality being examined.               While identifying the relevant beliefs is obviously        crucial, it can also be difficult. The range of        potentially relevant beliefs may be very large, so we have        to exercise judgment about which are most important         It may help to distinguish beliefs that motivate         the practice of this aspect of gender inequality from         those that legitimate it.         It is crucial to consider the actions and ideas of both men and women .         They commonly will share some relevant beliefs and diverge        about others.         Consider also whether different beliefs motivate or        legitimate this type of inequality in different times,        places, or circumstances. That is, you want to        decide what characteristics of the beliefs connected to        this inequality are fairly consistent across various        concrete instances of this type of inequality and what        sort of beliefs differ across instances. For        example, the beliefs that motivated male resistance to        women entering \"male\" occupations may have varied by the        status of the occupation and by the time period women        began to enter.         Consider the degree of consensus (or dispute) over the        important beliefs. When is the consensus high or        low, what causes it to be high or low, and what difference        does the degree of agreement make? In particular, do        people dispute some aspects of the beliefs relevant to        this type of inequality, such that the dispute affects the        inequality or informs us about it? Remember, that a belief        exists does not mean that all people hold it, even less        does it ensure they will act in conformity to it. The        greater the disagreement about a belief within a group or         category of actors, the less that it can contribute to         consistent responses it decides actions (although this         may not diminish its appeal as a justification).         Beliefs have a variety of other variable characteristics         that can be important to analyzing their significance.         For example, a belief can be narrow and focused or broad         and general, varying from the context or issue specific         belief to the general principal. A belief can be so         salient and closely held that people refer to it all the         time or so insignificant and loosely held that it plays a         role only when forced to the forefront.                      3        Assess the effects of these beliefs.               Consider the social significance or function of beliefs.         The effects of beliefs are generally understood by        comparing them to real or hypothetical alternatives.         Although beliefs exist only by being held by individuals,         we generally want to think of beliefs as cultural         phenomena. The beliefs that concern us are those preserved         and imposed by cultures or acquired as the common effect of         shared or parallel experiences. People are prone to all         kinds of idiosyncratic beliefs, but only shared beliefs         have social effect.         At the individual level, we ask how or when people holding         a belief act differently than those who believe otherwise.         At the social level, we ask how the presence of those         beliefs in a group or circumstance has social consequences         -- such as influencing the structure of organizations, the         prevailing legal system, or direction of historical         changes.         What we identify as important effects will therefore        depend on the selection of those alternative beliefs.         Reasonable alternatives might include: beliefs observed to        exist in more egalitarian (or more unequal) circumstances,        reversal of beliefs about women and men (often implausible        in reality, but potentially clarifying as an imaginary        experiment), the absence of any such beliefs, or the        presence of some reasonable hypothetical alternative         beliefs.         As usual, we want to give some thought to both women and        men, and we want to consider how the effects of the        beliefs might vary depending on the context or other        mediating influences. Typically, we expect to find women         and men share many beliefs, but are sharply divided on        others.         Beliefs can affect judgments, motives, aspirations,        quality of experience, and so forth. Again, deciding        what is important is an analytical judgment. We are trying        to figure out what beliefs really make a difference to the        strength, durability, or form of gender inequality.                      4        Try to explain how the relevant beliefs come to exist and why       they persist.               Thus, for the example of inequality being examined, we         are trying to explain how beliefs or ideas might         arise as a result of the presence of the inequality         that they legitimate and motivate. This is our         central goal, and it is difficult.         It can help to do a hypothetical experiment.         Consider an imaginary circumstance (which might have a        real historical counterpart) where the relevant aspect of        gender inequality did not exist, nor did the related        beliefs \u2013 then at some point in time this type of gender        inequality came into existence. Then try to think        through how ideas would change as a result of the        emergence of this facet of gender inequality.         Consider what issues might arise if this type of        inequality came to exist, but the beliefs still did not,        and how might the response to such issues lead to new        beliefs. Think about both women and men trying to make        sense of the unequal circumstances, and trying to mold the        perception of reality and justice to fit their        circumstances.         To make the analysis more concrete, see if you can        provide evidence or observations about real circumstances        where this type of inequality is minimal (different        cultures, different historical periods, different parts of        society). Assess how the beliefs under minimal        inequality compare to those where it is high.         It is a good idea to consider under what conditions, if        any, would the beliefs associated with a facet of gender         inequality exist without the presence of this facet of        gender inequality. That is, could similar or analogous        beliefs appear with different kinds of inequality or under        conditions of little inequality. The first        possibility is critical, because it suggests beliefs due        to the presence of inequality per se, not dependent on the        type of inequality. The second possibility suggests        the prospect of beliefs hijacked from conditions distinct        from inequality, then converted to some service to        reinforce or challenge inequality.         It is also a good idea to consider how people acquire        the relevant beliefs? Are they part of general        cultural expectations, are the transferred in specific        contexts, or do people generate them from experience        rather than learning them from others?         Finally, ask what happens if some people question or        reject the beliefs? This question applies to both women        and men. The mechanisms to ensure acceptance and        conformity are crucial to the preservation and        effectiveness of beliefs.                      5        Finally, after completing the steps in the analysis above, try       to give an overall assessment about the significance of       ideology to the facet of gender inequality you are       considering.                   Additional Notes              Throughout, be careful to distinguish between empirical        claims and moral claims. Both kinds of beliefs       are important. And they may be confused or overlapping       rather than neatly distinguished in real life. Still,       they are crucially different. Similarly, distinguish       between the explanation of beliefs and the justification        of beliefs.

Today, feminism is both extolled and condemned, often   by people whose orientations toward feminism seem to defy their   interests. Both the popular press and scholarship have devoted a lot   of effort seeking to make sense of people's beliefs about feminism and   equality, but these efforts have done little to reduce the disagreements.          Analytical     Task                 The goal of this task is to explore what young people think      about feminism today and to attempt to explain these beliefs.       As a prelude, you should interview some female and some male      acquaintances about feminism.             Use your own judgment about who to interview and how       many. You are trying to get enough \"data\" to serve as       the basis for your analysis.        Also use your own judgment about how to conduct your       interviews and what to ask. However, at a minimum try to       include: 1) how they would define feminism, 2) what kinds of       the people they know do they consider feminist, 3) what they       think is true about gender inequality/equality today, 4)       whether or not they consider themselves feminist and why, 5)       whether or not they consider themselves committed to gender       equality.                   Based on these interviews and your pre-existing observations,      write a descriptive assessment of young, educated American's      orientation toward feminism.       Prepare a provisional causal analysis of these current attitudes      toward feminism and gender equality in your reference population.      Try to do a reasoned analysis, taking into account the readings      for this topic.       Causal analyses always hinge on the choice of comparison.       Among others, you might consider: 1) the differences between now      and the past, 2) the differences between women and men, 3) the      differences between those who identify as feminist and those who      do not, 3) the difference between people like you and people      unlike you                     Common Readings            Destined for Equality : Women's      Rejection of Subordination      Nancy Burns and Katherine Gallagher. \" Public      Opinion on Gender Issues: The Politics of Equity and Roles .\"     Annual Review of Political Science, 2010, Vol. 13: 425-443       [doi: 10.1146/annurev.polisci.12.040507.142213]      Jo Freeman. \" Political      Organization in the Feminist Movement .\" Acta Sociologica ,     Vol. 18, No. 2/3 (1975), pp. 222-244      Susan E.

How have political    processes and structures sustained men's and women's relative status?     As structure and as actor, the state has been   unavoidably central to ongoing practice of gender inequality, to its   persistence, and to changes in the form and amount of gender inequality.     States or governments have power. Through the   military and police, a state can enforce conformity to its rules, repel and   punish challenges from the scale of individual acts to collective   rebellions, and by threat, implicit or explicit, deter rebellions from   appearing. Through the law, regulations, and bureaucratic policies, a state   can define what constitutes acceptable or legitimate behavior at all levels   of social organization. Through economic policies of taxation, expenditures,   and redistributions (such as welfare policies or agricultural supports), a   state influences the relative economic status of different groups.     By acting differently toward groups with   regard to any of these aspects of government power, a state can create,   reinforce, or exacerbate social inequalities. Analogously, a state can, in   theory, obstruct, destabilize, or diminish social inequality by using its   power in ways that are inconsistent with social inequalities. States   determine, influence, legitimize, and sanction rights and opportunities;   they may do so in more or less egalitarian ways.     When significant, enduring, social inequality   exists, those privileged by that form of inequality will normally have more   influence over the state than do those disadvantaged by the inequality, and   the overall effect of state policies will reinforce the exercise and   persistence of the inequality. A fundamental problem for all state theories   is who or what decides state policies and actions. To some degree, those   \"in\" the state (elected, appointed, hired, or appropriated) make decisions   based on their interests and outlooks as members of the state apparatus. To   some degree, state actors respond to the influence of power brokers outside   the state, such as the economically powerful. In either case, when making   policy or strategic planning decisions, those influencing state actions are   in part responding to what they perceive will be the responses of all actors   in the nation affected by those decisions. States, or the political   actors who comprise the government, also have their own interests, most   notably preserving their power, and these interests are not automatically   consistent with the interests of dominant social groups.     These political processes may support and   enforce gender inequality, passively permit it, or oppose gender inequality   (as is true with any form of social inequality). They may do any combination   of these with respect to different aspects of gender inequality.    Sustaining influence over political processes is a fundamental feature and   goal of socially dominant groups and the long monopoly of men over political   power has both demonstrated and sustained gender inequality. Yet,   government actions have also contributed to the decline of gender inquality   over the past two centuries.          Analytical     Task                 You have been hired by the newly elected President of the United      States (or the analogous top political position in another country      that you prefer to examine). One of the new President\u2019s main      goals for her years in office is to use government power to      improve gender inequality and the status of women. Your job      is to recommend toward what specific goals she should focus her      efforts.       You may recommend new legislation (or the removal of old), new      administrative strategies such as who gets appointed, new      executive policies (for example, rules for the military) that are      within the President\u2019s power without legislation, concerted      efforts to influence public opinion or state level      governance. In short, you can consider the entire range of      actions available to a President.       You should propose at least three distinct initiatives that you      believe could serve this purpose.       Chose the strategy you believe holds the most promise. For      this strategy, you must provide an analytical justification. Your      justification should consider the following:             At what aspects of gender inequality is the policy       aimed?        Include a brief analysis of this inequality that explains       what is unequal, how great is the inequality, who does it       effect, how widely is it recognized, how it has (or has not)       changed over time, and what seem to be the principal causes.        Describe how have government actions (or inaction)       influenced this inequality in the past.        Show why we should expect that it will be easy or hard to       carry out the strategy and how the possible difficulties       reflect the influence or effects of gender inequality.        Explain how the proposed strategy can be expected to       alleviate gender inequality. This explanation should       connect directly to the causal explanation of the inequality       being diminished.                   In short, you should propose several strategies by which a      government could promote greater gender equality, then provide an      analytic appraisal of the strategy you deem best. This      appraisal should stress the causes of relevant facets of gender      inequality, how the proposed strategy will affect that causal      process, and how gender inequality has a causal influence on      government policy that must be countered to implement the      policy. Do not forget to provide a historical context.

XIII. What does the future hold?     Where do we go from here? Predicting the future is the     ultimate challenge for causal analyses. To have any potential to     see into the future, we need a sound and thorough causal theory, one     that can encompass the range of possible influences     simultaneously. We also need to cope with the unpredictable     potential effects of processes and events that are outside the     boundaries of our theories. These are extremely difficult     conditions to meet. But the need to make some sense of the     future weighs on us. Will gender inquality continue to decline,     and greater gender equality spread throughout the world? Are     some aspects of gender inquality particularly resistant to reduction,     and if so why? Could change stagnate? Behind such concerns     are two principal questions. What has caused the long-term     pattern of declining gender inequality? And what has preserved     aspects of gender inequality in the face of these accumulating     changes? Combining the answers to these two questions with an     effort to project the relevant influences into the future, is the     basis for trying to understand the possibilities for the future.      Behind this also lies another analytical question with moral     overtones: what does gender equality really mean?                    Analytical       Task 1                    Select two types of inequality, both       important, one that you believe to be moving toward greater       equality at a relatively high rate, the other that you       believe is moving toward equality at a relatively slow rate       (or is stalled or is moving backwards)               for each of these two types, describe what is the        inequality (how are women and men unequal, which women        and men experience it, how do things differ when this        inequality is high from when it is low)         describe the evidence and logic that suggests one        type is declining relatively quickly and the other        relatively slowly                      Try to explain why the two different rates of movement       toward equality               For each, consider what processes, conditions,        interests, and the like propel the movement toward        greater equality         For each, consider what circumstances, activities,        and the like obstruct the movement toward greater        equality         Try to explain how and why the balance between the        causes propelling greater equality and the causes        sustaining existing inequality differ between the two        types of gender inequality                                                 Analytical       Task 2                    The general       analytical problem . Using two       plausible future scenarios about gender inequality, assess       what processes or conditions will decide which future       alternative comes to pass.        The task has the following main parts               Select two         of three alternatives to use for the analysis: highest        conceivable level of equality, highest possibility of in equality,        most likely conditions. Essentially this means        that we compare the two extreme possibilities, or we        compare what we think most likely with one of the        extreme possibilities.         For each of the two        selected alternatives, give a clear description of what        the expected level of gender inequality means.         How severe will be major components of gender        inequality, how consistent will different aspects of        gender inequality be with each other, how consistent        will these patterns be in society, and so on. (It        might help to look back over the range of topics        covered above.)         The center of the        analysis will be to provide a causal argument about        what causal conditions and sequence of developments         could lead to each of the two alternatives.         To this end, we must consider the full        range of causal influences that we have examined        previously.                      Thinking tools .               To consider any future path, we must make assumptions        about: (1) how far into the future, (2) in what society        and with respect to what social groups, and (3) what        other changes might occur, altering the cultural,        political, and economic environment.                  For our purposes, let us set the future to be         about one and two generations, that is when your         children are your current age, and then when their         children reach a similar age. The key         tradeoff with setting the distance into the future         is simple: the further we go into the future the         more interesting and significant are the social         changes but equally the more obscure become the         realistic possibilities.          Let us focus on our own society as a whole,         referencing distinctive social categories as         needed.          Similarly, let us assume that the cultural,         political, and economic environments are reasonably         stable, with the expectation that existing long         term trends will continue into the future. We         will ignore the potential for significant         structural changes and historical \"shocks\" such as         economic recessions and wars. Of course, the         further we look into the future, the more         speculative and fallible such assumptions become,         but our purpose is not to predict the actual         future.                         Looking forward, the future is always uncertain,        however well we may explain it once it becomes the        past. One way to make the future more amenable to        analysis is to simplify it into what we believe are the        principal alternative futures that matter to us.         Probably the simplest technique it to focus on one        characteristic and consider the most extreme plausible        possibilities.         With this in mind, let us try to analyze the future        of gender inequality by contrasting stark        alternatives. To begin consider three        possibilities:                 First, the highest level of gender equality that         we can imagine. This might be the current         state of inequality, or it might be the highest         level of inequality now seen in any comparable         society, or it might be a much higher level of         inequality. The problem here is to imagine         what is the greatest amount of future inequality we         can          Second, the highest level of gender in equality         that we can imagine.          And, third, the most likely level of gender         inequality that we expect. This could         coincide with either one of the previous, but will         commonly be somewhere between them.                         For deciding the plausibility of any future        circumstances, we want to remember that there are two        kinds of limiting conditions we must consider.         First, functional plausibility ,        asking if that level of inequality is feasible in the        context of what we perceive to be the relevant        surrounding circumstances. For a simple example,        a social custom of leaving all property to sons is        largely unworkable in a society with a low reproduction        rate because so many families have no sons.         Second, transition        plausibility , asking if a conceivable        historical path of development could lead from present        circumstances to the future scenario. For a        simple example, it might be possible to conceive how        American society could have functioned with full gender        equality in 1900, but it would extremely difficult to        suggest any plausible way that condition could have        emerged under any conceivable historical sequence from        the social organization of American society in 1850.                              Bringing it together . Our goal here is       not to predict the future of gender inequality, but to       examine what sequence of causal conditions seem likely determinants       of that future. We are trying to discover defensible       \" if, then \" arguments. To do this, we are       starting by imagining possible futures, then working       backwards from them to find paths from the present to those       futures, then asserting what else must occur for those       paths to materialize. We should not forget, there may       be more than one path to an imagined future and more than       one set of causal conditions that could lead us there.        For each alternative being considered, we want to analyze        why and how it might reasonably occur.        As an optional extra, you can offer an analysis of which        alternative seems more likely and why.

How have women's and     men's actions obstructed or furthered change, taking into account     the changing institutional context?       Both women and men    have acted in every possible way towards gender inequality. What    we want to understand are the circumstances in which they predictably    act in ways that either reinforce or erode inequality. People's    actions are complex results of their interests, ideologies,    circumstances, opportunities, and constraints. While theories of    gender inequality invoke all kinds of abstract causal processes, in real    life inequality is sustained and changed by the actions of women and    men. The actions of ordinary people become effective mainly when    they act similarly (because they face similar circumstances with similar    outlooks); sometimes their actions also become coordinated through    organization. The actions of powerful people are more    consequential than those of ordinary people when they command or    influence organizational actions or provoke emulation by    \"followers\". Even unique political actions may have great effect    by altering laws, policies, or the balance of power, although even in    these cases the institutionalization of changes generally depends on    dispersed acceptance; in the economic realm, even organizational actions    typically become effective only when multiple organizations pursue    parallel policies (governmental controls over an economy would be an    exception).           Analytical      Task                  The goal of this task is to       examine why some of men's actions worked against gender       inequality while others sustained it, and similarly why       women's actions also included ones that challenged gender       inequality and others that reinforced it. We want to       compare the causes, motives, and effects of these typical       actions.               \"Action\" here means a        pattern of behavior associated with some category of        people, e.g. the tendency to take or not take advantage of        educational opportunities by women of some type in some        period. The relevant actions are those that were one        typical result either of being either in certain enduring        categories of women or men (for example, single women with        higher education) or in certain recurring circumstances        (for example, married women whose husbands lost their jobs        for long periods). The category could include all        women or all men.        To say that actions        reinforce gender inequality means that they either bolster        the stability of gender inequality or help to make it more        severe; alternatively, if those actions became rare        and were not replaced by alternative actions with        similar effects, then either the degree of gender        inequality experienced by some people would decline or the        persistence of gender inequality would become more        problematic. (by the identified group in the        identified conditions)        Analogously, to say that        actions challenge gender inequality means that those        actions, if taken by enough people, result in reducing the        amount of gender inequality or they erode the stability of        gender inequality making it more vulnerable to future        challenges.                    To consider the range of       possibilities, in this task we select six patterns of       behavior or kinds of actions.               Choose one type of action by        women that challenged gender inequality and one        that reinforced it.        Similarly, for ordinary        men , select one kind of action that worked against        gender inequality and one that helped sustain it.        Finally, do the same for men        with power .                    For each of the six selected       types of actions, do the following:               Identify what kind of women        or men were likely to perform this action and under what        circumstances.        Describe the action,        including an assessment of its effects on gender        inequality. This may include consideration of        reasons why its effects might vary (e.g., the number        acting might have to surpass a threshold before there are        widespread effects, the effects might be contingent on        other conditions, the effects might happen after a delay,        and so on).        Try to specify the reasons        why this type of action occurred. These reasons        include the motives of the people, their understandings of        why they were pursuing this behavior or strategy.         The reasons also include the social and cultural        conditions that induce the actions and make them seem        necessary, sensible, and just. The reasons may also        include triggering events.                    To summarize: Pick six kinds of       behavior that have made a difference to the persistence of       gender inequality, one reinforcing and one challenging for       each of the three categories: women, ordinary men, powerful       men. Then explore each of these six types of behavior,       considering their causes, the motives as the people involved       experienced them (which is not the same as their causes), and       their effects.

How do the media    influence or reflect gender inequality?     Commentators often point toward media influence when   they try to explain contemporary gender inequality. Theories of media alert    us that we must always consider reciprocal causal processes. While any    individual may appear only to be the object of media influence, the content    and impact of media depend greatly on the existing culture and social    structure. The relationship of the media to the collective market effect of    consumers may be compared to the relationship between elected public officials    and voters. Also, consumers have considerable freedom to choose which media    outlets to give their attention and people selectively interpret and judge    the media to which they are exposed. All of this makes the relationship    between what is portrayed in the media and what occur in the \"real\" world    rather complex.          Analytical     Task                 Select one kind of popular/mass media, such as magazines or the      cinema, or, alternatively, a form of popular culture thought to      have an analogous impact, such as popular music.       Prepare a simple comparative analysis of current examples to      examples from around 1980, a third of a century ago.             Choose a small, reasonable sample from the two       periods. For example, the samples might be       advertisements from three magazines present in both periods,       or the female and male protagonists of top earning movies, or       the lyrics of the highest rated songs.        Using the dimensions or characteristics identified in the       readings, (or analogous ones that better fit the media you are       assessing), characterize the differences in the ways women and       men are portrayed in the two periods.                   Given the results of your comparisons, show how the data you      observe might be explained by (1) theories stressing the influence      of the media on gender expectations, evaluations, and behavior, or      (2) theories stressing the media as reflecting gender inequality,      or (3) theories stressing market segmentation (audiences choose      among media offerings and media makers aim at audience segments.       Prepare a simple, reasonable response to the questions, \"What is      the basic causal relationship between mass media and gender       inequality?\" and \"How      is the correspondence between media portrayals and real-life      gender inequality sustained over time as gender inequality changes?

How have political     processes and structures sustained men's and women's relative     status? [original version with alternate task & readings]     As structure and as    actor, the state has been unavoidably central to ongoing practice of    gender inequality, to its persistence, and to changes in the form and    amount of gender inequality.      States or governments have power. Through the    military and police, a state can enforce conformity to its rules, repel    and punish challenges from the scale of individual acts to collective    rebellions, and by threat, implicit or explicit, deter rebellions from    appearing. Through the law, regulations, and bureaucratic policies, a    state can define what constitutes acceptable or legitimate behavior at    all levels of social organization. Through economic policies of    taxation, expenditures, and redistributions (such as welfare policies or    agricultural supports), a state influences the relative economic status    of different groups.      By acting differently toward groups with regard to    any of these aspects of government power, a state can create, reinforce,    or exacerbate social inequalities. Analogously, a state can, in theory,    obstruct, destabilize, or diminish social inequality by using its power    in ways that are inconsistent with social inequalities. States    determine, influence, legitimize, and sanction rights and opportunities;    they may do so in more or less egalitarian ways.      When significant, enduring, social inequality    exists, those privileged by that form of inequality will normally have    more influence over the state than do those disadvantaged by the    inequality, and the overall effect of state policies will reinforce the    exercise and persistence of the inequality. A fundamental problem for    all state theories is who or what decides state policies and actions. To    some degree, those \"in\" the state (elected, appointed, hired, or    appropriated) make decisions based on their interests and outlooks as    members of the state apparatus. To some degree, state actors respond to    the influence of power brokers outside the state, such as the    economically powerful. In either case, when making policy or strategic    planning decisions, those influencing state actions are in part    responding to what they perceive will be the responses of all actors in    the nation affected by those decisions.           Analytical      Task                   Task summary: Assess the most       important ways the American state (or some other) has       influenced and been influenced by gender inequality over the       past two hundred years. Try to keep in mind that this       always concerns the accumulation and exercise of social power.              What are the crucial ways that       government reflected gender inequality?                Consider how and why the        state treated women and men differently         Consider ways that the        state helped gender inequality operate smoothly         Consider how the state        helped gender inequality to persist                     How and why has the state       promoted gender equality by reducing the differences in its       treatment of women? How has the state How and why has       the state made it difficult (and irrational) for many to       continue practices that disadvantage women?        How and why have the relevant       government actions changed over time?         While developing the analysis       for this task, it can be helpful to examine how the       relationship between the state and gender inequality resembled       or differed from the state's relationships to other kinds of       inequality.
