NYUAD Class of 2014.     Having grown up in the UAE, I have witnessed the rapid growth of Abu Dhabi and Dubai. However exciting their development into urban centers, their transformation raises questions about the effects of urbanization on the environment \u2014 a topic I find particularly interesting, as I believe it is vital to find solutions to safeguard our natural habitats while allowing nations to thrive. Therefore, this January Term, I took the State and Fate of Biodiversity course in Ghana, which covered ecology, biochemical cycles, wildlife population dynamics, and conservation.

And as a junior majoring in social research and public policy and visual arts, I began to think of ways through which I could apply the hands-on experience gained from my J-Term course to raise awareness about the importance of protecting biodiversity in the Arab world.   Being that we had only three weeks to explore and learn about biodiversity in Ghana, we spent our first week in the classroom, delving into several principles of biodiversity, such as ecology and conservation. In addition, we attended lectures at the University of Ghana, which provided us with insight and helped us to bridge these topics to Ghana's biodiversity. I was impressed with the academic approach and commitment to environmental issues expressed by both the professors and students I met throughout this trip.   The next week we began our journey across Ghana, from Accra to Cape Coast, then on to Kumasi, Aburi, and finally Lake Volta. We visited several forest reserves, fisheries, markets, cultural heritage sites, and partook in discussions en route to our next destination. The road trip was an education in both biodiversity and breaking through stereotypes of what Africa is and what it has the potential to become. It was all very exhilarating and different than anything many of us had ever seen before \u2014 even though the members of our class were of nine different nationalities!   One of our first stops was the Elmina Slave Castle, a UNESCO World Heritage site in Cape Coast. First established as a trade settlement, it later became a major player in the Atlantic slave trade. Roberto El Khoury (NYUAD '15) said, &quot;I found that visiting the Elmina Slave Castle was a moving experience due to the fact that it gave us deep insight into a critical part of Ghana's history. On our tour we were able to learn about and visualize the conditions in which the slaves were detained and how poorly they were treated in these dungeons.&quot; I couldn't agree more that this visit was an emotional one; deeply moving and pivotal in my understanding of the culture in which we were now immersed.   The practical approach to this course was the ability to see the implementation of textbook theories, the challenges that continue to plague decision makers in those projects, and the involvement of the general population. Throughout our trip we visited reserves and traditional farms, and got a first-hand view of aquaculture. Perhaps most interesting and impressive in both scale and environmental impact was Lake Volta. As well as being one of the largest man-made reservoirs in the world, it also generates most of Ghana's power and exports electricity to neighboring countries.                                                                             The State and Fate of Biodiversity course has provided me with the essential courage and realization to discover new approaches to old dilemmas by taking me out of my comfort zone and literally into the jungle of social change where all things are possible.         Bouthayna Baltaji, NYUAD Class of 2014.                             The role that social research plays in implementation of change within any community is extremely important. Hence, I found it very interesting that religion continues to play a fundamental role in the communities throughout Ghana. For example, during a tour of one fishery, our guide explained that it has always been unlawful to fish on Tuesdays because it was said that the Gods would curse anyone who did so; a similar myth was also prevalent for hunting. I found this fascinating because in a way it was an old tactic for preserving biodiversity.   Another interesting cultural encounter was in a Kumasi market. The amazing thing was that even though it was intensely crowded, humid, and filled with a cornucopia of smells (raw meat, fish, spices, woods, textiles, etc.) everyone seemed to be happy, friendly, and eager to get our attention. At the beginning it was overwhelming due to the sheer amount of people approaching us; however, once we were able to compose ourselves, it was a truly remarkable experience.   Academically, I learned the complexity of biodiversity and its fundamental role in the continuity of life and civilization as we have come to know it. Biodiversity provides a sustainable food supply, encourages medical research into biomedical solutions to global health threats, and is a key element in nearly all fields of general scientific research directed to improving and sustaining a productive quality of life. Some would agree that those nations who effectively manage biodiversity could look forward to greater economic stability and social progress.   We spent our last days in Ghana collecting research and composing presentations with topics ranging from human impact on biodiversity and the economics behind preserving biodiversity to the development of strategies and methods to raise awareness regarding the benefits of biodiversity. The presentations \u2014 all of which were innovative, thoughtful, and a direct result of our personal experiences in Ghana \u2014 were a vital part of this J-Term experience and I personally wanted to leave something behind that could be a resource for future projects.   My own project explored ways in which visual arts could be used in both the education and implementation of biodiversity projects. The goal of my paper was to introduce to those in Ghana the existence of environmental artists, an influential group of professionals that can facilitate projects as well as participate in community outreach programs. My fundamental concerns highlighted the need for the involvement of scientists, engineers, contractors, government agencies, environmental artists, local artists, and the general public in such projects.   Growing up in a diverse community has enabled me to appreciate the advantages of international cooperation, as well as highlighted how environmentally unfriendly some of the population is. The State and Fate of Biodiversity course has provided me with the essential courage and realization to discover new approaches to old dilemmas by taking me out of my comfort zone and literally into the jungle of social change where all things are possible. It has exposed me to broader cultural understanding, political awareness, and intellectual approach, which will be important during future decision-making, both personally and professionally. And it has prepared me for real-life situations, during which interacting with different people and cultures is a vital skill needed for meeting objectives successfully.

NYUAD Class of 2014.     Having grown up in the UAE, I have witnessed the rapid growth of Abu Dhabi and Dubai. However exciting their development into urban centers, their transformation raises questions about the effects of urbanization on the environment \u2014 a topic I find particularly interesting, as I believe it is vital to find solutions to safeguard our natural habitats while allowing nations to thrive. Therefore, this January Term, I took the State and Fate of Biodiversity course in Ghana, which covered ecology, biochemical cycles, wildlife population dynamics, and conservation.

And as a junior majoring in social research and public policy and visual arts, I began to think of ways through which I could apply the hands-on experience gained from my J-Term course to raise awareness about the importance of protecting biodiversity in the Arab world.   Being that we had only three weeks to explore and learn about biodiversity in Ghana, we spent our first week in the classroom, delving into several principles of biodiversity, such as ecology and conservation. In addition, we attended lectures at the University of Ghana, which provided us with insight and helped us to bridge these topics to Ghana's biodiversity. I was impressed with the academic approach and commitment to environmental issues expressed by both the professors and students I met throughout this trip.   The next week we began our journey across Ghana, from Accra to Cape Coast, then on to Kumasi, Aburi, and finally Lake Volta. We visited several forest reserves, fisheries, markets, cultural heritage sites, and partook in discussions en route to our next destination. The road trip was an education in both biodiversity and breaking through stereotypes of what Africa is and what it has the potential to become. It was all very exhilarating and different than anything many of us had ever seen before \u2014 even though the members of our class were of nine different nationalities!   One of our first stops was the Elmina Slave Castle, a UNESCO World Heritage site in Cape Coast. First established as a trade settlement, it later became a major player in the Atlantic slave trade. Roberto El Khoury (NYUAD '15) said, &quot;I found that visiting the Elmina Slave Castle was a moving experience due to the fact that it gave us deep insight into a critical part of Ghana's history. On our tour we were able to learn about and visualize the conditions in which the slaves were detained and how poorly they were treated in these dungeons.&quot; I couldn't agree more that this visit was an emotional one; deeply moving and pivotal in my understanding of the culture in which we were now immersed.   The practical approach to this course was the ability to see the implementation of textbook theories, the challenges that continue to plague decision makers in those projects, and the involvement of the general population. Throughout our trip we visited reserves and traditional farms, and got a first-hand view of aquaculture. Perhaps most interesting and impressive in both scale and environmental impact was Lake Volta. As well as being one of the largest man-made reservoirs in the world, it also generates most of Ghana's power and exports electricity to neighboring countries.                                                                             The State and Fate of Biodiversity course has provided me with the essential courage and realization to discover new approaches to old dilemmas by taking me out of my comfort zone and literally into the jungle of social change where all things are possible.         Bouthayna Baltaji, NYUAD Class of 2014.                             The role that social research plays in implementation of change within any community is extremely important. Hence, I found it very interesting that religion continues to play a fundamental role in the communities throughout Ghana. For example, during a tour of one fishery, our guide explained that it has always been unlawful to fish on Tuesdays because it was said that the Gods would curse anyone who did so; a similar myth was also prevalent for hunting. I found this fascinating because in a way it was an old tactic for preserving biodiversity.   Another interesting cultural encounter was in a Kumasi market. The amazing thing was that even though it was intensely crowded, humid, and filled with a cornucopia of smells (raw meat, fish, spices, woods, textiles, etc.) everyone seemed to be happy, friendly, and eager to get our attention. At the beginning it was overwhelming due to the sheer amount of people approaching us; however, once we were able to compose ourselves, it was a truly remarkable experience.   Academically, I learned the complexity of biodiversity and its fundamental role in the continuity of life and civilization as we have come to know it. Biodiversity provides a sustainable food supply, encourages medical research into biomedical solutions to global health threats, and is a key element in nearly all fields of general scientific research directed to improving and sustaining a productive quality of life. Some would agree that those nations who effectively manage biodiversity could look forward to greater economic stability and social progress.   We spent our last days in Ghana collecting research and composing presentations with topics ranging from human impact on biodiversity and the economics behind preserving biodiversity to the development of strategies and methods to raise awareness regarding the benefits of biodiversity. The presentations \u2014 all of which were innovative, thoughtful, and a direct result of our personal experiences in Ghana \u2014 were a vital part of this J-Term experience and I personally wanted to leave something behind that could be a resource for future projects.   My own project explored ways in which visual arts could be used in both the education and implementation of biodiversity projects. The goal of my paper was to introduce to those in Ghana the existence of environmental artists, an influential group of professionals that can facilitate projects as well as participate in community outreach programs. My fundamental concerns highlighted the need for the involvement of scientists, engineers, contractors, government agencies, environmental artists, local artists, and the general public in such projects.   Growing up in a diverse community has enabled me to appreciate the advantages of international cooperation, as well as highlighted how environmentally unfriendly some of the population is. The State and Fate of Biodiversity course has provided me with the essential courage and realization to discover new approaches to old dilemmas by taking me out of my comfort zone and literally into the jungle of social change where all things are possible. It has exposed me to broader cultural understanding, political awareness, and intellectual approach, which will be important during future decision-making, both personally and professionally. And it has prepared me for real-life situations, during which interacting with different people and cultures is a vital skill needed for meeting objectives successfully.

NYU Biology's growth in Evolutionary Biology has been built largely at the interfaces of disciplines already strong in the department: developmental genetics, genomics and systems biology, and molecular evolution/systematics. As such, areas of focus include: Molecular and Genomic Evolution, Evolutionary Systems Biology, Experimental Evolution, Evolution of Developmental Systems and Molecular Systematics/Phylogenetics. Research opportunities span different levels of organization, such as: molecular mechanisms underlying the evolution of genomes, gene-interaction networks, developmental and genetic processes, morphology and adaptive features; phylogenetic relationships and character evolution; the genetic/genomic architectures of populations; and the history of life on earth. Model organisms used in these studies include bacteria, single-celled eukaryotes, plants, nematode worms, flies and parasitic wasps, plants, cave fish, and primates. Theory and computational biology are regularly integrated with the experimental work to build explanatory models. Major facilities and resources at NYU Biology supporting these studies include: the Sequencing (GenCore) Facility (high-throughput sequencing and expression analysis), the Computational Core , an Imaging Core (with confocal and other microscopes), and special collections (e.g. the NYU Rhabditid Collection with live strains of &gt;150 nematode species). Our research and education missions in evolutionary biology are assisted by associations with other NYU departments ( Anthropology , Computer Science ), the American Museum of Natural History , the New York Botanical Garden , and the Wildlife Conservation Society .  Ecology and Environmental Biology at NYU covers interactions among organisms, environments, and Earth. For research, Ecology and Environmental Biology draws on the diverse interests of our faculty across a range of levels from microbes and invertebrates to mammals and ecosystems, and includes geosphere, biosphere, and anthroposphere. Current areas of focus include: Climate Change, Biogeochemistry, Mass Extinctions, Disease Ecology, Biodiversity, and Landscape Ecology. Most faculty have joint or associated appointments with the Environmental Studies Program . Research approaches incorporate field work, laboratory analysis, computer modeling, and data and interdisciplinary systems analysis.

NYUAD Class of 2014.     Having grown up in the UAE, I have witnessed the rapid growth of Abu Dhabi and Dubai. However exciting their development into urban centers, their transformation raises questions about the effects of urbanization on the environment \u2014 a topic I find particularly interesting, as I believe it is vital to find solutions to safeguard our natural habitats while allowing nations to thrive. Therefore, this January Term, I took the State and Fate of Biodiversity course in Ghana, which covered ecology, biochemical cycles, wildlife population dynamics, and conservation.

And as a junior majoring in social research and public policy and visual arts, I began to think of ways through which I could apply the hands-on experience gained from my J-Term course to raise awareness about the importance of protecting biodiversity in the Arab world.   Being that we had only three weeks to explore and learn about biodiversity in Ghana, we spent our first week in the classroom, delving into several principles of biodiversity, such as ecology and conservation. In addition, we attended lectures at the University of Ghana, which provided us with insight and helped us to bridge these topics to Ghana's biodiversity. I was impressed with the academic approach and commitment to environmental issues expressed by both the professors and students I met throughout this trip.   The next week we began our journey across Ghana, from Accra to Cape Coast, then on to Kumasi, Aburi, and finally Lake Volta. We visited several forest reserves, fisheries, markets, cultural heritage sites, and partook in discussions en route to our next destination. The road trip was an education in both biodiversity and breaking through stereotypes of what Africa is and what it has the potential to become. It was all very exhilarating and different than anything many of us had ever seen before \u2014 even though the members of our class were of nine different nationalities!   One of our first stops was the Elmina Slave Castle, a UNESCO World Heritage site in Cape Coast. First established as a trade settlement, it later became a major player in the Atlantic slave trade. Roberto El Khoury (NYUAD '15) said, &quot;I found that visiting the Elmina Slave Castle was a moving experience due to the fact that it gave us deep insight into a critical part of Ghana's history. On our tour we were able to learn about and visualize the conditions in which the slaves were detained and how poorly they were treated in these dungeons.&quot; I couldn't agree more that this visit was an emotional one; deeply moving and pivotal in my understanding of the culture in which we were now immersed.   The practical approach to this course was the ability to see the implementation of textbook theories, the challenges that continue to plague decision makers in those projects, and the involvement of the general population. Throughout our trip we visited reserves and traditional farms, and got a first-hand view of aquaculture. Perhaps most interesting and impressive in both scale and environmental impact was Lake Volta. As well as being one of the largest man-made reservoirs in the world, it also generates most of Ghana's power and exports electricity to neighboring countries.                                                                             The State and Fate of Biodiversity course has provided me with the essential courage and realization to discover new approaches to old dilemmas by taking me out of my comfort zone and literally into the jungle of social change where all things are possible.         Bouthayna Baltaji, NYUAD Class of 2014.                             The role that social research plays in implementation of change within any community is extremely important. Hence, I found it very interesting that religion continues to play a fundamental role in the communities throughout Ghana. For example, during a tour of one fishery, our guide explained that it has always been unlawful to fish on Tuesdays because it was said that the Gods would curse anyone who did so; a similar myth was also prevalent for hunting. I found this fascinating because in a way it was an old tactic for preserving biodiversity.   Another interesting cultural encounter was in a Kumasi market. The amazing thing was that even though it was intensely crowded, humid, and filled with a cornucopia of smells (raw meat, fish, spices, woods, textiles, etc.) everyone seemed to be happy, friendly, and eager to get our attention. At the beginning it was overwhelming due to the sheer amount of people approaching us; however, once we were able to compose ourselves, it was a truly remarkable experience.   Academically, I learned the complexity of biodiversity and its fundamental role in the continuity of life and civilization as we have come to know it. Biodiversity provides a sustainable food supply, encourages medical research into biomedical solutions to global health threats, and is a key element in nearly all fields of general scientific research directed to improving and sustaining a productive quality of life. Some would agree that those nations who effectively manage biodiversity could look forward to greater economic stability and social progress.   We spent our last days in Ghana collecting research and composing presentations with topics ranging from human impact on biodiversity and the economics behind preserving biodiversity to the development of strategies and methods to raise awareness regarding the benefits of biodiversity. The presentations \u2014 all of which were innovative, thoughtful, and a direct result of our personal experiences in Ghana \u2014 were a vital part of this J-Term experience and I personally wanted to leave something behind that could be a resource for future projects.   My own project explored ways in which visual arts could be used in both the education and implementation of biodiversity projects. The goal of my paper was to introduce to those in Ghana the existence of environmental artists, an influential group of professionals that can facilitate projects as well as participate in community outreach programs. My fundamental concerns highlighted the need for the involvement of scientists, engineers, contractors, government agencies, environmental artists, local artists, and the general public in such projects.   Growing up in a diverse community has enabled me to appreciate the advantages of international cooperation, as well as highlighted how environmentally unfriendly some of the population is. The State and Fate of Biodiversity course has provided me with the essential courage and realization to discover new approaches to old dilemmas by taking me out of my comfort zone and literally into the jungle of social change where all things are possible. It has exposed me to broader cultural understanding, political awareness, and intellectual approach, which will be important during future decision-making, both personally and professionally. And it has prepared me for real-life situations, during which interacting with different people and cultures is a vital skill needed for meeting objectives successfully.

NYU Biology's growth in Evolutionary Biology has been built largely at the interfaces of disciplines already strong in the department: developmental genetics, genomics and systems biology, and molecular evolution/systematics. As such, areas of focus include: Molecular and Genomic Evolution, Evolutionary Systems Biology, Experimental Evolution, Evolution of Developmental Systems and Molecular Systematics/Phylogenetics. Research opportunities span different levels of organization, such as: molecular mechanisms underlying the evolution of genomes, gene-interaction networks, developmental and genetic processes, morphology and adaptive features; phylogenetic relationships and character evolution; the genetic/genomic architectures of populations; and the history of life on earth. Model organisms used in these studies include bacteria, single-celled eukaryotes, plants, nematode worms, flies and parasitic wasps, plants, cave fish, and primates. Theory and computational biology are regularly integrated with the experimental work to build explanatory models. Major facilities and resources at NYU Biology supporting these studies include: the Sequencing (GenCore) Facility (high-throughput sequencing and expression analysis), the Computational Core , an Imaging Core (with confocal and other microscopes), and special collections (e.g. the NYU Rhabditid Collection with live strains of &gt;150 nematode species). Our research and education missions in evolutionary biology are assisted by associations with other NYU departments ( Anthropology , Computer Science ), the American Museum of Natural History , the New York Botanical Garden , and the Wildlife Conservation Society .  Ecology and Environmental Biology at NYU covers interactions among organisms, environments, and Earth. For research, Ecology and Environmental Biology draws on the diverse interests of our faculty across a range of levels from microbes and invertebrates to mammals and ecosystems, and includes geosphere, biosphere, and anthroposphere. Current areas of focus include: Climate Change, Biogeochemistry, Mass Extinctions, Disease Ecology, Biodiversity, and Landscape Ecology. Most faculty have joint or associated appointments with the Environmental Studies Program . Research approaches incorporate field work, laboratory analysis, computer modeling, and data and interdisciplinary systems analysis.

concepts, economic and sociological forces, and literary and artistic endeavors. This inherently interdisciplinary subject intimately connects to our existence and is especially relevant in Abu Dhabi, which has made a major commitment to environmental sustainability. The concentration is designed to integrate the fundamental sciences, including biology, chemistry, computer science, mathematics, and physics, with economics and the arts to provide an understanding of the Earth System and the current and future challenges imposed on it as the human population grows.   The curriculum emphasizes both quantitative reasoning and descriptive analysis in courses that emphasize science, economics, social concerns, the humanities, and arts as a means to identify, explore, and solve fundamental problems and issues of environmental concern. Whenever possible, the courses utilize the local Abu Dhabi environment as a natural laboratory and studio for field trips and consider relevant local phenomena and issues. Students have the opportunity to integrate their understanding of the environment into a broader scientific, social, economic, and artistic framework through a senior Capstone project .                             Requirements   The multidisciplinary concentration in the Environment requires four courses. In order to develop an interdisciplinary understanding of environmental concerns, students must take at least one course in each of the following areas:     Environmental Science   Environmental Policy   Environment, Culture, and Society                           The Environment Courses                        To refine course list, add or remove filter options and press \"Submit\".

COREI-AD 11J State and Fate of the Earth                                                                   What is the current state of Earth in terms of human well-being and human impact on Earth&rsquo;s natural systems? Issues such as energy consumption, CO2 emissions, climate change, food production, water, and material fluxes are intricately tied together as a global system. The economic trend of this system can be used to project a world in 2050 in which the world&#39;s lifestyle will be approximately equal to that of many developed nations today. Will this projected state of the world be possible, given the environmental issues above? Investigating this topic in Sydney gives us perspective from a developed nation with unique climate, resources, and world famous biodiversity. Substantial portions of this inquiry-based seminar require students to compare environmental issues in Australia to those in their home nations, other developed regions, and the world, in order to look at how conditions and solutions in Australia might be generally applicable to shared challenges.

COREI-AD 16 Where the City Meets the Sea: Studies in Coastal Urban Environments                                                                              Over half of the human population lives within 100km of a coast and coastlines contain more than two-thirds of the worlds largest cities. As a result, the world&#39;s natural coastal environments have been substantially modified to suit human needs. This course uses the built and natural environments of coastal cities as laboratories to explain the environmental and ecological implications of urban development in coastal areas. Using data from multiple coastal cities, student teams use field-based studies and Geographic Information System (GIS) data to examine patterns and processes operating in coastal cities. This course uses the local terrestrial marine, and built environments as a laboratory to address these issues, and team projects requiring field work form a core component of the learning experience. As part of the NYU Global Network University initiative this course is being offered simultaneously in several NYU sites globaly and students are collaborating extensively with students from their sister campuses through the duration of this course.    *All COREI-EDNW courses are replaced with COREX.

As a result, Australia&#39;s coastal environments have been substantially modified to suit human needs. This course will use the built and natural environments of Sydney, Australia&#39;s largest city, as a case study to examine the environmental and ecological implications of urban development in coastal areas worldwide. Using Sydney&#39;s terrestrial, marine, and built environments as a natural laboratory for field research, students will collect environmental data throughout the city and use Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to examine the spatial patterns of human impacts to Sydney&#39;s environment and to compare their results with patterns observed in other coastal cities.    *All COREI-EDNW courses are replaced with COREX.

These four examples offer excellent learning templates for exploring public health because of their diversity: one has ended (smallpox), one is current near eradication (polio), one is an infectious disease for which no vaccine exists (AIDS) and one is a fully preventable human-manufactured epidemic (tobacco). The course will include a mix of lecture, class exercises, the role of games in health education, CSI-like investigation approaches, guest lectures and site visits based in Washington, DC. Students become familiar with how an epidemic emerges, steps taken to measure an epidemic&#39;s scope and distribution, how epidemiologists-the detectives of public health-go about determining the source of an epidemic, the role research plays in answering questions with respect to source and cure, how public health leaders work to arrest an epidemic and the interplay between society, culture, politics and health.    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

When and where did these, and other pressing environmental concerns, have their origins? What can history teach us about how we might best address these issues in the present? This course offers a comprehensive overview of the world&rsquo;s environmental history with a focus on the period from 1500 C.E. to the present &ndash; a time marked by a dramatic intensification in the use of land, water, and energy resources. The course&rsquo;s central goal is to understand the relationships between globalization, natural resource and energy use, and environmental change, and to explain how these relationships unfolded, and continue to unfold, differently in major world regions, including the Gulf. By incorporating material from the fields of ecology, biology, geology, demography, economics, political science, and anthropology, this course also provides students with important historical grounding in the multidisciplinary field of global environmental studies.

The goal of the course is to identify the best ways of asking and answering questions about the widespread environmental challenges that are seemingly inherent in China&rsquo;s economic development. Are the challenges new to Chinese history &ndash; particular to modernization &ndash; or are they rooted in long-standing patterns of land use and resource exploitation? How to do we square the history of damage wrought to nature with the equally salient history of &ldquo;Asian&rdquo; notions of &ldquo;living in harmony&rdquo; with nature, exemplified by philosophical Daoism and millennia of poetic and painting traditions extolling the beauty and wonder of nature? Who, moreover, is entitled to do what with and about the environment: what are the roles of the state?; of scientists and engineers?; of humanists? The course doubles as an introduction to the history of China, and to the multidisciplinary field of environmental studies.

MDENV-AD 115 The Global Debate on Green Growth                                                                    In March 2012, the OECD published its influential Environmental Outlook Report to 2050, confirming that the world is faced with an explosive new cocktail of geopolitical challenges: population explosion, environmental degradation, the failure to stop climate change, and the increased competition over limited natural resources. In response, governments are increasingly turning to renewables and high tech to diversify their energy mix and to reduce reliance on fossil fuels in order to stimulate stagnant economies and create new jobs. Ironically, the transition to a low fossil fuel economy through the use of RES and high tech applications has led to the creation of new global race over limited resources, such as rare earths, and this competition has already given rise to a series of fresh global political and economic realities, tensions, and disputes. We will examine how major industrial powers are approaching the asymmetric threat of climate change; the nature of contemporary resource competition; the way policy decisions are influenced by political rhetoric and public opinion; and the overall economic and political impact of climate change on international relations.

POLSC-AD 184 UN: Negotiation towards A New Binding &amp; Universal Agreement on Climate Change in Paris in Dec 2015                                                                   The United Nations (UN) provides the forum where states come together to discuss mutual problems. In our rapidly globalized world, the enormous and complex challenges to humankind are making UN indispensable. This course will provide an overview of the various UN departments and programs encompassed within it and treaty negotiation process. The main concentration of this course will remain climate change negotiations. We will take climate change as a case study and consider many aspects of international policy response to this environmental and social crisis. The purpose of this course is to provide students with a general understanding of how climate change issues have been addressed at the UN. The class will be invited to study ongoing process of the new climate change agreement, which will be adopted in Paris in December 2015, at the 21st Conference of the Parties (COP21). The meeting will mark a decisive stage in negotiations on the future international agreement on a post-2020 regime. The course will closely investigate the pertinent challenges currently facing diplomats and international decision makers in making progress with what is currently on the negotiating table. We will try to seek the answer of the following questions: Will all the nations of the world, including the biggest emitters of greenhouse gases, be bound by a universal agreement on climate change for the first time in over 20 years of UN negotiations? Will it take the form of a protocol, another legal instrument or &#39;an agreed outcome with legal force&#39;, and will it be applicable to all Parties including US and China? In a treaty negotiation simulation, the students will play the roles of major green house gas emitting nations and will negotiate proposals to reduce emissions. The in-class negotiation exercise will be modeled on the real negotiations under the UNFCCC.

SRPP-AD 142 Renewable Energy Law and Policy                                                                              Energy&rsquo;s role in global climate change is increasing its importance. This course focuses on two major and interrelated themes: climate change and energy. The class will look at implications of new climate change and renewable energy mandates for the electric power sector. Energy is considered a prerequisite for economic growth and poverty alleviation. Electricity demand almost doubled from 1990 to 2011, and is projected to grow 81% from 2011 to 2035 in the existing policies scenario. Over 70% of the increased energy demand is from developing countries. At this time some two billion people (one third of world&rsquo;s population) have no access to electricity. Population growth (United Nations predicts world population growth from 6.7 billion in 2011 to 8.7 billion by 2035) and increasing standards of living (the UN Population Division projects 70 % people will be living in urban areas by 2050) for many people in developing countries will cause enormous growth in energy demand. Many poorer countries lack this essential capacity. Meeting the energy needs of developing countries without compromising the environment is a challenge. Advancement of innovative energy solutions and implementation of smart policies to make the transition to clean energy in ways that fulfill growing needs and improve economy without hurting environment is very much needed. This introductory level course on renewable energy examines the historical and legal origins of energy regulations and emerging policies. The course provides an introduction to the renewable sources and basic terms and concepts, regulatory trends and other emerging issues. The primary focus of the course will be on renewable energy policies and laws of the developing countries. We will spend considerable time with Africa, Small Island States, United Arab Emirates (UAE), and examples from other countries. The centerpiece of this course is to focus on a specific renewable energy project (in a developing country) completed with international cooperation and assistance. The course will also focus on global institutions and policymaking, the divide between industrialized countries and developing countries, the nexus between global climate change and renewable energy, sustainable energy sources, and challenges that global policymakers will face in future. The course will look at the wide variety of local and regional laws, regulatory techniques, and policy objects.

SRPP-AD 151 Introduction to Global Health                                                                              Despite the significant progress made towards achieving globally set targets for health in some countries, others&mdash;particularly in sub-Saharan Africa&mdash;are falling behind. This course introduces students to the main concepts of the public health field and the critical links between global health and social and economic development. Lectures explore major themes in global health, including the social determinants of health, the global distribution of disease burden and risk factors, key measures to address the disease burden in cost-effective ways, and the role of health systems and diverse global actors in responding to the health needs of populations worldwide. The course is global in coverage, but with a focus on low- and middle-income countries and on the health of the poor.
