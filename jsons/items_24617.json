Purchasing &amp; Supply Services &raquo;         NYU Purchasing &amp; Supply Services' mission is to directly support the university's environmental, educational and administrative needs. By using best business practices and professional ethics we can assist faculty and staff in obtaining high quality products and services in a timely matter and at the lowest cost possible. The business activities include obtaining price quotations; negotiations; contract review; chartfield validation; approval verifications; vendor sourcing; document management; interaction with requestors and review/approval from other departments such as Legal Counsel, Insurance, ITS etc.         Purchasing &amp; Supply Services recommends environmentally preferable products whenever they perform satisfactorily and are available at a reasonably competitive price. Purchasing Services will also continue to work very closely with our many local suppliers to minimize transportation costs while simultaneously supporting our local economy.                Asset Management &raquo;        Asset Management maintains the University&rsquo;s inventory records for       capital equipment, items costing $3,000 or more and having a life       expectancy of at least one year.

Please refer to the Asse Management web site which includes information on surplus items, procedures, forms and FAQs.              Reprograhics (Copy Central)&raquo;              Copying, Printing, Graphic Design &amp; Mailing: All copying and printing jobs totaling more than $1,000 must be purchased through Reprographics, Purchasing Services or Advertising &amp; Publications.
