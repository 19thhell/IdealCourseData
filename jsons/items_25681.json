These processes, from Schoenberg' serialism to Xenakis' statistics  or Cage's chance music, explore new strategies of sound (or note) organisation.  In the recent past, the digitalization of sound combined with the power of  computers has enabled the processing of sounds at the sample level, a level  of granularity below milliseconds. Technologies have also made it possible  to create new interrelationships between sound and the visual modality. This  talk will explore the reverse process: visually-driven strategies of composition.  I will describe a commission from the National Portrait Gallery in London  in which I produced a sonified portrait. The image is treated as a map of  constraints for a multi layer approach. The values extracted from the still  image organise the overall form of the sound and also control sound effects  such as granular synthesis and frequency filtering. I will go on to present  a recent piece based on the sonification of animated images. The work, which  draws on the idea of music processes, investigates the similarities between  films articulations and musical articulations, and whether a visual art could  be transposed into music.    BIO: Jean-Baptiste Thiebaut has a MS in Computer Science  from University of Toulouse II and a MA in Composition from the University  of Paris VIII. He is actually doing a PhD in Computer Science at Queen Mary  University of London, on the topic of music visualisation and representation.  He has been collaborating with the Groupe de Recherches Musicale (GRM) and  the Centre de recherches Informatique et Creation Musicale in Paris. His  past research focused on the representation of sound in space. He also composes  electroacoustic and instrumental music and does live performance with a laptop  within the band pplato. Recent artistic works have been exhibited at the  National Portrait Gallery and the Institute for Contemporary Arts (ICA) in  London.           Upcoming Events    Read all Upcoming Events Posts"}]}]
