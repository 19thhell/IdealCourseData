Applicants choose a concentration in either Solo or Collaborative Piano , and complement their performance studies with courses in Music History and Theory, Music Education, Music Technology, and Music Business and Performing Arts Administration, choosing from a colorful array of electives to suit their professional aspirations. The Solo Concentration is a 36-point degree completed in three or four semesters. The Collaborative Concentration is a four-semester, 39-point degree emphasizing the art of chamber playing and vocal accompaniment. For pianists interested in the Advanced Certificate, please contact Marilyn Nonken directly for information. Pianists interested in the Master's Degree (Concentration in Collaborative Piano) should directly contact Grant Wenaus .    Mission Statement    The Master of Music program in Piano Performance is designed to develop performers with distinctive artistic profiles, skilled as solo and collaborative players and fluent in the musical styles of the 18th, 19th, 20th, and 21st centuries. It is the goal of the program that each student achieve a level of performance excellence that makes it possible for that student to enter the field as a professional. In order to accomplish that goal, each student must demonstrate a technical foundation that will allow that student&rsquo;s playing to evolve in an efficient and healthy manner throughout the years that follow training at NYU, as well as a thorough knowledge of the historic and contemporary performance practices that inform interpretation of the score.    Student Learning Objectives       Each pianist should demonstrate a level of excellence in performance that makes it possible for that student to enter the field of professional piano performance, as a solo and collaborative artist    Each pianist should possess a knowledge of the repertoire written for the piano, from the18th, 19th, 20th, and 21st centuries, and of the performance practices, both historical and contemporary, informing the performance of that repertoire.    Each pianist should possess a technique that will make it possible for that student to perform standard and contemporary repertoire in a fluent and stylistically appropriate manner, and maintain an injury-free career as a pianist    Each pianist will be educated as to the myriad ways that, as professionals, they can share their expertise at the piano and knowledge of the repertoire with their audiences, students, and colleagues, recognizing their role, not only in performing, but in educating audiences about their art form and its history       Course Offerings and Requirements    Students work with their advisor to tailor the curriculum towards their personal interests and career goals. Requirements include private lessons, chamber music coachings, and piano literature courses, as well as seminars in music history and practical research methodologies. For pianists concentrating on Solo Performance, one recital is required. For those concentrating on Collaborative Performance, two recitals are required, featuring solo and chamber repertoire. In conjunction with these recitals, degree candidates complete a research project examining the repertoire from historical or theoretical perspectives, considering aspects of aesthetics and performance practice. Students choose electives from NYU Steinhardt&rsquo;s rich course offerings in pedagogy, theory, history, aesthetics, and performance practice; also open to pianists are courses in Music Business, Music Technology, and professional career training.    See more information about our Advanced Certificate program , designed specificially for master's degree holders.    Performance Opportunities    NYU Steinhardt graduate pianists frequently perform in solo and collaborative contexts. They play in recitals, showcase concerts, on the nationally acclaimed Artist Master Class Series , and in collaboration with vocalists, chamber groups, and larger ensembles including the NYU Symphony and New Music and Dance Ensemble. Each semester, Steinhardt pianists play to enthusiastic audiences at a host of on-campus venues , and on series featuring the Pianists of NYU Steinhardt: \"Steinhardt at Saklad\" (Saklad Auditorium), \"Pian@poly!\" (NYU School of Engineering), and \"Music with a Vue\" (The Bellevue Atrium).

For pianists interested in the Advanced Certificate, please contact Marilyn Nonken directly for information. Pianists interested in the Master's Degree (Concentration in Collaborative Piano) should directly contact Grant Wenaus .    Mission Statement    The Master of Music program in Piano Performance is designed to develop performers with distinctive artistic profiles, skilled as solo and collaborative players and fluent in the musical styles of the 18th, 19th, 20th, and 21st centuries. It is the goal of the program that each student achieve a level of performance excellence that makes it possible for that student to enter the field as a professional. In order to accomplish that goal, each student must demonstrate a technical foundation that will allow that student&rsquo;s playing to evolve in an efficient and healthy manner throughout the years that follow training at NYU, as well as a thorough knowledge of the historic and contemporary performance practices that inform interpretation of the score.    Student Learning Objectives       Each pianist should demonstrate a level of excellence in performance that makes it possible for that student to enter the field of professional piano performance, as a solo and collaborative artist    Each pianist should possess a knowledge of the repertoire written for the piano, from the18th, 19th, 20th, and 21st centuries, and of the performance practices, both historical and contemporary, informing the performance of that repertoire.    Each pianist should possess a technique that will make it possible for that student to perform standard and contemporary repertoire in a fluent and stylistically appropriate manner, and maintain an injury-free career as a pianist    Each pianist will be educated as to the myriad ways that, as professionals, they can share their expertise at the piano and knowledge of the repertoire with their audiences, students, and colleagues, recognizing their role, not only in performing, but in educating audiences about their art form and its history       Course Offerings and Requirements    Students work with their advisor to tailor the curriculum towards their personal interests and career goals. Requirements include private lessons, chamber music coachings, and piano literature courses, as well as seminars in music history and practical research methodologies. For pianists concentrating on Solo Performance, one recital is required. For those concentrating on Collaborative Performance, two recitals are required, featuring solo and chamber repertoire. In conjunction with these recitals, degree candidates complete a research project examining the repertoire from historical or theoretical perspectives, considering aspects of aesthetics and performance practice. Students choose electives from NYU Steinhardt&rsquo;s rich course offerings in pedagogy, theory, history, aesthetics, and performance practice; also open to pianists are courses in Music Business, Music Technology, and professional career training.
