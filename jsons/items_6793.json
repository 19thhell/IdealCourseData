Second, what is the role of intellectuals in relation to power and politics? On the one hand, we ask: what is power? (Is it located in the state? corporations? media? in discourse? In what ways is power a problem and in what ways a resource?) On the other hand, we ask: what is \u201cthe intellectual?\u201d What sort of social category and institution is thereby denoted? What do intellectuals claim to know and what is the political impact of their authority? Our goal is to explore how intellectuals give us a language to \u201csee\u201d power, but also how they have been implicated in the very forms of power they teach us to analyze. Readings include texts by Lenin, Gramsci, and Foucault, among others.

By the end of the semester we will be comfortable looking at the complex ways in which power is not just institutional, but also implicated within the very knowledges used to theorize it \u2013 and the ways in which power goes way beyond just repression and control. Primary readings include Foucault\u2019s History of Sexuality , Discipline and Punish, and The Birth of Biopolitics ; Lenin\u2019s What is to Be Done , State and Revolution; and excerpts from Gramsci\u2019s pre-prison and prison writings -\u2013 plus contributions from secondary sources from philosophy, sociology, and literary theory.

Second, what is the role of intellectuals in relation to power and politics? On the one hand, we ask: what is power? (Is it located in the state? corporations? media? in discourse? In what ways is power a problem and in what ways a resource?) On the other hand, we ask: what is \u201cthe intellectual?\u201d What sort of social category and institution is thereby denoted? What do intellectuals claim to know and what is the political impact of their authority? Our goal is to explore how intellectuals give us a language to \u201csee\u201d power, but also how they have been implicated in the very forms of power they teach us to analyze. Readings include texts by Lenin, Gramsci, and Foucault, among others.
