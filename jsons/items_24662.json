This club aims to provide a forum and a safe space to explore ideas and share experiences. We hope to generate dialogue and allyship, advocacy and activism. We aim to inspire civic engagement and expand student knowledge on a variety of issues and identities. We broadly define disability to include both visible and invisible, learning disabilities, mental illness, chronic pain, chronic illness, and temporary disabilities. In addition, we welcome an evolving understanding of our definition of disability. We are also open to new and different perspectives, with the recognition that this group is rooted in social justice, intersectionality, respect, and constructive dialogue for the purpose of improved understanding.    NYU P.E.A.C.E., Professionals Educating and Advocating for Children with Exceptionalities   P.E.A.C.E. is the NYU student chapter of Council for Exceptional Children (CEC), &quot;the largest international professional organization dedicated to improving the educational success of individuals with disabilities and/or gifts and talents.&quot; CEC chapters work to fulfill the mission and vision of CEC International by &quot;advocating for appropriate governmental policies, seting professional standards, providing professional development, advocating for individuals with exceptionalities, and helping professionals obtain conditions and resources necessary for effective professional practice.&quot;   NYU Health, Humanities and Culture Working Group   The Humanities Initiative   Our Working Research Group (WRG) is devoted to teaching and scholarship at the interface of health, medicine, and culture. Increasingly health care scholars have recognized that health care involves more than bodies and biology; it also involves human meaning, purpose, and culture. And, in the other direction, humanities scholars have increasingly recognized the bodily dimensions of human subjectivity and culture. People are more than their hopes, dreams, and imagination; they are also embodied creatures intimately connected to their biology. Thus, to understand this side of human side of medicine and the bodily side of humanity, academic centers must foster quality inquiry into this rapidly growing interdisciplinary domain.   ASD Nest Support Project  Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development   Department of Teaching and Learning, Programs in Special Education   NYU's partnership with New York City&rsquo;s Department of Education (DoE) and Hunter College&rsquo;s School of Education began in 2001 to fill a gap in the programs the DoE offered for higher functioning children on the autism spectrum. The fruit of that collaboration was the new ASD Nest program, piloted at PS 32 in Brooklyn in September 2003. Its goal was and is to help these children learn how to function well academically, behaviorally and socially in school and in their community. Now, in the 2011-12 school year, the New York City school system serves 500 children with ASDs in 131 fully inclusive Nest classrooms in 19 elementary schools, three middle schools and one high school.       Academic Programs   Working with Individuals with Disabilities: Physical, Mental, and Cognitive   Silver School of Social Work   Continuing Education   This Post Master&rsquo;s Certificate is designed for social workers and other health professionals who are currently working with individuals with disabilities or are interested in making this a part of their practice or agency based work. The Certificate Program will explore disability from a biological, social, psychological, spiritual, and cultural perspective. Defining what is meant by disability will be integral to the learning. This approach to understanding disability focuses on the perspective of the individual and ability not the disability.   Masters Scholars in Medical Humanism Program   NYU Medical School     The Master Scholars in Medical Humanism Program (MSMHP) is a component of the Office of Student Affairs developed to complement the culture of medical education by encouraging students to explore intellectual and artistic interests not necessarily covered in the core curriculum. Through innovative seminars, colloquia, and events moderated by expert facilitators, students are encouraged to pursue their interests outside of the classroom to better prepare them for their practice and inevitably make a meaningful difference in the individual lives of patients.   The MSMHP invites students to develop new opportunities to promote conversations in medicine and humanities; past events have included lectures with nationally recognized faculty, writers and artists, film screenings, visits to off-site museums, concerts and performance arts, and collaborations with other NYU programs.

It is the University\u2019s policy that no qualified student with a disability be excluded from participating in any University program or activity, denied the benefits of any University program or activity, or otherwise subjected to discrimination with regard to any University program or activity.   The Henry and Lucy Moses Center for Students with Disabilities (CSD) determines qualified disability status and assists students in obtaining appropriate accommodations and services. CSD operates according to an Independent Living Philosophy and strives in its policies and practices to empower each student to become as independent as possible. Our services are designed to encourage independence, backed by a strong system of supports.   Any student who needs a reasonable accommodation based on a qualified disability is required to register with the CSD for assistance.              Mission Statement     The mission of the Moses Center for Students with Disabilities (CSD) is to facilitate equal access to programs and services for students with disabilities throughout the schools and divisions of New York University (NYU) and to foster independent decision making skills necessary for personal and academic success.   CSD endeavors to fulfill its mission by:     Developing programs and activities that foster the personal and academic growth and independence of students with disabilities.       Educating the NYU community about the legal standards for accommodating students with disabilities and ensuring awareness of CSD programs and services.       Providing efficient and responsive service delivery systems for students, faculty and administrative staff.

This club aims to provide a forum and a safe space to explore ideas and share experiences. We hope to generate dialogue and allyship, advocacy and activism. We aim to inspire civic engagement and expand student knowledge on a variety of issues and identities. We broadly define disability to include both visible and invisible, learning disabilities, mental illness, chronic pain, chronic illness, and temporary disabilities. In addition, we welcome an evolving understanding of our definition of disability. We are also open to new and different perspectives, with the recognition that this group is rooted in social justice, intersectionality, respect, and constructive dialogue for the purpose of improved understanding.    NYU P.E.A.C.E., Professionals Educating and Advocating for Children with Exceptionalities   P.E.A.C.E. is the NYU student chapter of Council for Exceptional Children (CEC), &quot;the largest international professional organization dedicated to improving the educational success of individuals with disabilities and/or gifts and talents.&quot; CEC chapters work to fulfill the mission and vision of CEC International by &quot;advocating for appropriate governmental policies, seting professional standards, providing professional development, advocating for individuals with exceptionalities, and helping professionals obtain conditions and resources necessary for effective professional practice.&quot;   NYU Health, Humanities and Culture Working Group   The Humanities Initiative   Our Working Research Group (WRG) is devoted to teaching and scholarship at the interface of health, medicine, and culture. Increasingly health care scholars have recognized that health care involves more than bodies and biology; it also involves human meaning, purpose, and culture. And, in the other direction, humanities scholars have increasingly recognized the bodily dimensions of human subjectivity and culture. People are more than their hopes, dreams, and imagination; they are also embodied creatures intimately connected to their biology. Thus, to understand this side of human side of medicine and the bodily side of humanity, academic centers must foster quality inquiry into this rapidly growing interdisciplinary domain.   ASD Nest Support Project  Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development   Department of Teaching and Learning, Programs in Special Education   NYU's partnership with New York City&rsquo;s Department of Education (DoE) and Hunter College&rsquo;s School of Education began in 2001 to fill a gap in the programs the DoE offered for higher functioning children on the autism spectrum. The fruit of that collaboration was the new ASD Nest program, piloted at PS 32 in Brooklyn in September 2003. Its goal was and is to help these children learn how to function well academically, behaviorally and socially in school and in their community. Now, in the 2011-12 school year, the New York City school system serves 500 children with ASDs in 131 fully inclusive Nest classrooms in 19 elementary schools, three middle schools and one high school.       Academic Programs   Working with Individuals with Disabilities: Physical, Mental, and Cognitive   Silver School of Social Work   Continuing Education   This Post Master&rsquo;s Certificate is designed for social workers and other health professionals who are currently working with individuals with disabilities or are interested in making this a part of their practice or agency based work. The Certificate Program will explore disability from a biological, social, psychological, spiritual, and cultural perspective. Defining what is meant by disability will be integral to the learning. This approach to understanding disability focuses on the perspective of the individual and ability not the disability.   Masters Scholars in Medical Humanism Program   NYU Medical School     The Master Scholars in Medical Humanism Program (MSMHP) is a component of the Office of Student Affairs developed to complement the culture of medical education by encouraging students to explore intellectual and artistic interests not necessarily covered in the core curriculum. Through innovative seminars, colloquia, and events moderated by expert facilitators, students are encouraged to pursue their interests outside of the classroom to better prepare them for their practice and inevitably make a meaningful difference in the individual lives of patients.   The MSMHP invites students to develop new opportunities to promote conversations in medicine and humanities; past events have included lectures with nationally recognized faculty, writers and artists, film screenings, visits to off-site museums, concerts and performance arts, and collaborations with other NYU programs.
