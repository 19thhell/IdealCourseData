Madrid is the political and cultural center of Spain and one of Europe's most lively and charming cities. It boasts a history that goes back to the Middle Ages; from the 16th century on, it was the seat of a brilliant royal court. This is reflected in the city's rich architecture and abundance of monuments.   Contemporary Madrid is a clean and efficient city of wide boulevards, outstanding museums, monuments, theatres, and libraries. The city's public transportation-metro and buses-is first rate. Madrid is famous for its restaurants as well as its nightlife. The numerous caf\u00e9s are frequented by students, writers, artists, and journalists. Because of its location in the geographical center of the country, Madrid is also an ideal base for exploring the rest of the Iberian Peninsula and beyond through a network of rapid, modern bus and rail transportation. Students who have lived and studied in Madrid often look at that period as one of the most transforming experiences of their lives.           ACADEMICS   NYU Summer in Madrid offers Spanish language courses at all levels, including intensive study, as well as Spanish literature, culture, fine arts, history, and cinema courses in English or Spanish. Courses are taught by NYU Madrid faculty and Spanish university professors who are recognized experts in their fields. Students also enjoy a full range of cultural activities, seminars, and excursions led by experts in history, art, and architecture. Visits include the world-renowned Prado museum, other important museums and monuments, and Old Madrid, the &quot;Greenwich Village&quot; of this historic city. In addition, students' knowledge and understanding of Spain is broadened by excursions to other regions and cities such as Santiago de Compostella, Gij\u00f3n and Toledo.           HOUSING &amp; MEALS      The NYU Madrid academic center is two chalet-style buildings located in the beautiful El Viso neighborhood just a few Metro stops from the city center.     All students participating in the program are required to live in NYU-provided housing. The program arranges for students to live in Spanish homes, which is strongly recommended as the best way to encourage the use of Spanish and to immerse oneself in the rhythms of everyday life. Apartments are also available. Students are informed of their homestay families and apartments before arrival in Madrid.           EXCURSIONS   There is a three-day excursion as part of the Summer Program. Option A is Castilla-Leon and the Basque Country (Burgos, Bilbao, and Soria); Option B is Northern Spain: Oviedo and Gijon. Possible day trips include El Escorial, Toledo, and Segovia.           COURSES     Students must register for 8 points. It is strongly suggested that students register for one 4 point language course and one 4 point content course, or for one 8 point intensive language course.

Students who have lived and studied in Madrid often look at that period as one of the most transforming experiences of their lives.           ACADEMICS   NYU Summer in Madrid offers Spanish language courses at all levels, including intensive study, as well as Spanish literature, culture, fine arts, history, and cinema courses in English or Spanish. Courses are taught by NYU Madrid faculty and Spanish university professors who are recognized experts in their fields. Students also enjoy a full range of cultural activities, seminars, and excursions led by experts in history, art, and architecture. Visits include the world-renowned Prado museum, other important museums and monuments, and Old Madrid, the &quot;Greenwich Village&quot; of this historic city. In addition, students' knowledge and understanding of Spain is broadened by excursions to other regions and cities such as Santiago de Compostella, Gij\u00f3n and Toledo.           HOUSING &amp; MEALS      The NYU Madrid academic center is two chalet-style buildings located in the beautiful El Viso neighborhood just a few Metro stops from the city center.     All students participating in the program are required to live in NYU-provided housing. The program arranges for students to live in Spanish homes, which is strongly recommended as the best way to encourage the use of Spanish and to immerse oneself in the rhythms of everyday life. Apartments are also available. Students are informed of their homestay families and apartments before arrival in Madrid.           EXCURSIONS   There is a three-day excursion as part of the Summer Program. Option A is Castilla-Leon and the Basque Country (Burgos, Bilbao, and Soria); Option B is Northern Spain: Oviedo and Gijon. Possible day trips include El Escorial, Toledo, and Segovia.           COURSES     Students must register for 8 points. It is strongly suggested that students register for one 4 point language course and one 4 point content course, or for one 8 point intensive language course.

An Intercambio Program brings NYU Madrid students together with local college students to practice their Spanish and make friends.       Madrid is the political and cultural center of Spain and one of the liveliest and friendliest capital cities in Europe, replete with magnificent architecture, world-class museums, and delicious cuisine. Students at NYU Madrid enjoy a semester of rich cultural experiences that complement their studies, whether they\u2019re on a class trip to the Museo del Prado to learn firsthand about Goya's masterpieces or at an out-of-the way tapas bar on Cava Baja.

Madrid is the political and cultural center of Spain and one of Europe's most lively and charming cities. It boasts a history that goes back to the Middle Ages; from the 16th century on, it was the seat of a brilliant royal court. This is reflected in the city's rich architecture and abundance of monuments.   Contemporary Madrid is a clean and efficient city of wide boulevards, outstanding museums, monuments, theatres, and libraries. The city's public transportation-metro and buses-is first rate. Madrid is famous for its restaurants as well as its nightlife. The numerous caf\u00e9s are frequented by students, writers, artists, and journalists. Because of its location in the geographical center of the country, Madrid is also an ideal base for exploring the rest of the Iberian Peninsula and beyond through a network of rapid, modern bus and rail transportation. Students who have lived and studied in Madrid often look at that period as one of the most transforming experiences of their lives.           ACADEMICS   NYU Summer in Madrid offers Spanish language courses at all levels, including intensive study, as well as Spanish literature, culture, fine arts, history, and cinema courses in English or Spanish. Courses are taught by NYU Madrid faculty and Spanish university professors who are recognized experts in their fields. Students also enjoy a full range of cultural activities, seminars, and excursions led by experts in history, art, and architecture. Visits include the world-renowned Prado museum, other important museums and monuments, and Old Madrid, the &quot;Greenwich Village&quot; of this historic city. In addition, students' knowledge and understanding of Spain is broadened by excursions to other regions and cities such as Santiago de Compostella, Gij\u00f3n and Toledo.           HOUSING &amp; MEALS      The NYU Madrid academic center is two chalet-style buildings located in the beautiful El Viso neighborhood just a few Metro stops from the city center.     All students participating in the program are required to live in NYU-provided housing. The program arranges for students to live in Spanish homes, which is strongly recommended as the best way to encourage the use of Spanish and to immerse oneself in the rhythms of everyday life. Apartments are also available. Students are informed of their homestay families and apartments before arrival in Madrid.           EXCURSIONS   There is a three-day excursion as part of the Summer Program. Option A is Castilla-Leon and the Basque Country (Burgos, Bilbao, and Soria); Option B is Northern Spain: Oviedo and Gijon. Possible day trips include El Escorial, Toledo, and Segovia.           COURSES     Students must register for 8 points. It is strongly suggested that students register for one 4 point language course and one 4 point content course, or for one 8 point intensive language course.

Homestays with Spanish host families encourage students to build a deeper connection with Spanish culture and provides an opportunity to practice speaking in a more casual environment. An Intercambio Program brings NYU Madrid students together with local college students to practice their Spanish and make friends.       Madrid is the political and cultural center of Spain and one of the liveliest and friendliest capital cities in Europe, replete with magnificent architecture, world-class museums, and delicious cuisine. Students at NYU Madrid enjoy a semester of rich cultural experiences that complement their studies, whether they\u2019re on a class trip to the Museo del Prado to learn firsthand about Goya's masterpieces or at an out-of-the way tapas bar on Cava Baja.

M.A. in Teaching Spanish as a Foreign Language and TESOL Jointly offered by NYU's Graduate School of Arts and Science and Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development, this innovative degree program allows students to spend one year at NYU Madrid and one year at NYU's main campus in New York City. The goal of this program is to provide students with professional training in teaching of English and Spanish as second languages. Students will also gain mastery of the Spanish language through an immersive year living and studying in Spain. For more information about this program and to apply, please click here .  M.A. in Spanish and Latin American Linguistic, Literary, and Cultural Studies NYU\u2019s Graduate School of Arts and Science offers a unique one-year M.A. in Spanish and Latin American Linguistic, Literary, and Cultural Studies at NYU Madrid. With courses taught entirely in Spanish by NYU Madrid faculty, as well as by professors from Spanish universities, the M.A. brings an interdisciplinary and transatlantic perspective to the study of the Spanish-speaking world. A young, ethnically diverse, and culturally vibrant city, Madrid is home to growing Latin American communities, a focal point where the Iberian and Latin American worlds meet. The program takes full advantage of the vast range of cultural activities and events in Madrid, which form an integral part of the curriculum. Students have access to some of the most resourceful libraries and archives in the world and also benefit from membership to the historic Instituto Internacional and its excellent library. Depending on their interests and career goals, students choose one of two concentrations: Literary and Cultural Studies: Spain and Latin America or Applied Linguistics: Spain and Latin America . The capstone M.A. project allows students to develop an original scholarly work with the guidance of a faculty advisor, and to present a portion of this work at the Graduate Research Conference. The M.A. program is designed to encourage students to immerse themselves linguistically and culturally in Madrid life. All students are provided with a Madrid Cultura y Arte membership card to attend events, screenings, talks, shows, and exhibitions of their choice throughout the year. An integral part of the core curriculum and orientation program, visits and study trips give students the unique opportunity to investigate Spanish culture in situ. Whether studying urban space in Bilbao, transatlantic trade in Seville, or Roman architecture in Segovia, students are guided by faculty experts. Concentration in Literary and Cultural Studies: Spain and Latin America Students with a concentration in Literary and Cultural Studies develop their interests in literary and critical theory, peninsular and Latin American literature, and the arts and culture of both regions. While most students who choose this option are interested in pursuing a doctoral degree and/or teaching at the college or university level, others go on to careers in secondary education or in other fields in which they can use their thorough knowledge and understanding of the Spanish-speaking world. Concentration in Applied Linguistics: Spain and Latin America The concentration in Applied Linguistics emphasizes three main research areas within the historical, political, and cultural context of the Spanish-speaking world: general linguistics, psycholinguistic and sociolinguistic theories, second language teaching and acquisition, and translation studies. The program is designed for students interested in pursuing a doctoral degree in these fields or others related to Applied Linguistics, as well as for those whose professions (primary or secondary education, business, community service, government, international affairs, etc.) would benefit from advanced training. The concentration is not designed for students who wish to go on to a Ph.D. degree in literature. Why choose NYU Madrid? The unique one-year M.A. program offers graduate students rigorous academic training to develop their own research interests and approaches to debates in linguistic, literary, and cultural studies, often cutting across disciplinary boundaries. The design of the program aims to foster student responsibility and independence when exploring and generating new areas of knowledge in dialogue with the academic community at large, and beyond. NYU Madrid draws from the diverse expertise of its faculty within a local and global network of universities, research institutions, and cultural centers and museums, at the very core of our graduate students\u2019 experience in Madrid. Our challenge to students to develop their own goals for the program, met with the flexibility of its design and faculty encouragement to pursue independent research, has made for a successful combination. The M.A. program has served as a platform for students who wish to pursue a doctoral degree in their chosen field of studies and for those who aim to use their linguistic and cultural knowledge of the Spanish-speaking world for the benefit of their professions. Attracting students from diverse backgrounds in the United States and abroad, the M.A. program provides a forum to exchange ideas and explore new critical perspectives in which academic pursuits are inseparable from vital experience.
