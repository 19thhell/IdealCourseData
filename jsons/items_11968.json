FREN-UA 145 Approaches to Francophone Literature Prof. J. Michael Dash MW, 12:30pm - 1:45pm Silver 500 #22205 The   course examines the conceptualizing of Francophonie through the   literature from a network of French-speaking countries which together   form a Francophone space. It not only addresses the colonial past but   the anti-colonial and postcolonial situations in which French   colonialism is replaced by more complex relationships and ideologies.   One of the most difficult issues that confronts the postcolonial   francophone world is the question of cultural homogeneity and social   integration within national structures. This course focuses on the   problematic area of cultural transformation, language contact and the   role of the writer in elaborating a post-colonial national identity. The   problematizing of language, nation and writing will be examined in both   a theoretical way and in the prose fiction of Maryse Conde of   Guadeloupe, Jacques Roumain of Haiti, Sembene Ousmane of Senegal and   Assia Djebar of Algeria.

Jusqu'\u00e0 pr\u00e9sent souvent   ignor\u00e9es par les critiques, et mises \u00e0 l'\u00e9cart du corpus officiel de la   litt\u00e9rature fran\u00e7aise, elles trouvent maintenant la place qui leur est   due. Depuis le 17 eme si\u00e8cle jusqu'\u00e0 aujourd'hui ce cours \u00e9tudiera   quelques une des figures majeures parmi les femmes \u00e9crivains. Nous   r\u00e9fl\u00e9chirons aussi \u00e0 la pertinence ou pas de cette cat\u00e9gorie des femmes   \u00e9crivains. (Authors include Madame de la Fayette, Madame de S\u00e9vign\u00e9, Georges Sand, Colette, Duras, and de Beauvoir .)  FREN-UA 992.002 Esp\u00e8ces d'espaces Prof. Phillip John Usher MW, 4:55pm \u2013 6:10pm Silver 406 #10026 Le   titre de ce cours est emprunt\u00e9 \u00e0 un livre de Georges P\u00e9rec, publi\u00e9 en   1974, qui s\u2019interroge sur le sens des \u00ab lieux \u00bb dans lesquels nous   vivons (le lit, la chambre, l\u2019appartement, l\u2019immeuble, la rue, le   quartier, la ville, etc.). P\u00e9rec d\u00e9montre combien ces lieux que nous   fr\u00e9quentons, comme inconsciemment, sont aussi lisibles qu\u2019un livre,   combien ces lieux poss\u00e8dent une logique et une syntaxe, combien ces   lieux sont des \u00ab fictions \u00bb autant que des r\u00e9alit\u00e9s. Embo\u00eetant le pas \u00e0   P\u00e9rec (que nous lirons) et nous inspirant \u00e9galement de certains autres   penseurs du XXe si\u00e8cle (Foucault, Certeau, Aug\u00e9, Latour, etc.), nous   voudrions donc r\u00e9fl\u00e9chir \u00e0 la fa\u00e7on dont la litt\u00e9rature probl\u00e9matise   notre relation aux \u00ab lieux \u00bb, des plus intimes (le lit) aux plus   abstraits (l\u2019univers, l\u2019 \u00ab anthropoc\u00e8ne \u00bb). En privil\u00e9giant ces   questions, nous pr\u00e9l\u00e8verons sur l\u2019histoire de la litt\u00e9rature fran\u00e7aise   des \u0153uvres publi\u00e9es depuis le Moyen \u00c2ge jusqu\u2019au XXIe si\u00e8cle. Auteurs   probables (liste pr\u00e9liminaire) : Marie de France, Christine de Pisan,   Fran\u00e7ois Rabelais, Joachim du Bellay, Gilles Corrozet, Raymond Queneau,   Eug\u00e8ne Ionesco, Michel Butor, Michel Foucault, Georges P\u00e9rec, Monique   Wittig, Annie Ernaux, Michel Houellebecq.

Le   cours est co-enseign\u00e9 par Prof. Cl. Bernard, sp\u00e9cialiste de litt\u00e9rature,   et Prof. L. Cortade, sp\u00e9cialiste de cin\u00e9ma.

Nous nous attacherons   dans ce cours \u00e0 illustrer cette vari\u00e9t\u00e9. Privil\u00e9giant des oeuvres du   XIX\u00e8 et du XX\u00e8 si\u00e8cles, nous montrerons qu\u2019elles mettent   alternativement l\u2019accent sur l\u2019exp\u00e9rience du voyageur, l\u2019appel du   Divers, la rencontre avec l\u2019Autre, l\u2019exotisme et sa condamnation. FREN-UA 868.001 (conducted in English ) Topics in French Literature: Acting Medieval Literature Prof. Evelyn Vitz R, 9:30am \u2013 12:15pm\u2028GCASL 379 #22175 In   this course students read, discuss, and then perform in class major   works of medieval literature \u2013 works that were originally intended for   live, semi-dramatic performance. Focus is on narrative rather than   dramatic works. The works explored vary from year to year, but always   include epic, romance, tales of various kinds, and a range of narrative   genres, from different countries and traditions. Students work   particularly on the skills required for the performance of different   kinds of narrative \u2013 including the ability to impersonate of all kinds   of characters; rapid shifts from character to character, voice to voice;   and effective use of body language, Most performances are done solo,   but there is also some teamwork\u2014performances in small groups. Students   who can sing, dance, play an instrument, or have other performance   skills are very welcome, but such skills are not necessary. Work for   the course consists of reading and classroom discussion; several short   performances over the course of the semester; a final performance (often   done in a group); short written responses to readings and \u201cimaginary   performances\u201d; a final oral exam.

FREN-UA 868.002 (conducted in English ) Topics in French Literature: An Introduction to Jacques Derrida (1930-2004) Prof. Lucien Nouis MW, 11:00am \u2013 12:15pm Silver 500 #22176 From   Derrida\u2019s critique of \u201cWestern\u201d categorizations of universality and   rationality (logocentrism, phallogocentrism, humanism,   anthropocentrism), to his later reflections on metaphoricity,   translation, and performativity, this course will first explore the   question of \u201cwriting\u201d as it unfolds throughout the 1960\u2019s and beyond. We   will then focus on the more directly political and ethical dimension of   Derrida\u2019s thought, and carefully examine his use of concepts such as   hos(ti)pitality, gift, forgiveness, animality, friendship, faith, and   \"\u00e9v\u00e9nement,\" paying particular attention to his later conversation with   Emmanuel Levinas. Readings will include passages, chapters and essays   taken from Writing and Difference (1967), On Grammatology (1967), Psyche: Inventions of the Other (1987), Points... , (1992); Force of Law (1994); Politics of Friendship (1994); Monolinguism of the Other (1996); Of Hospitality (1997); On Cosmopolitanism and Forgiveness (1997); Philosophy in a Time of Terror (2003); The Beast and the Sovereign (2008), etc. The course and the readings will be in English.

The remaining twelve weeks   will deal with four plays. We will consider each of the four authors   with respect to their work in general and their place in contemporary   theater and the history of ideas. The plays will be analyzed in detail   thematically and stylistically. Each will be seen as a highlight of   anti-realistic dramaturgy, as a brilliant example of the sensibilities   of European artists and thinkers in the periods following each of the   two World Wars.\u2028 (Cross-listed as DRLIT-UA 267 )\u2028 (This course is for 2 points and does not count toward the requirements for the French major or minor.)

This intensive course is the   equivalent of a year (two semesters) of regular elementary-level French.   The work done throughout the session focuses on the presentation and   systematic practice of the basic structures and vocabulary of oral and   written French through a variety of creative activities that stress   real-world contexts and communicative situations, situations that   provide learners with the opportunity to develop their knowledge of   French by creating, both orally and through writing, in the language.

The work done throughout the session   focuses on the presentation and systematic practice of the initial basic   structures and vocabulary of oral and written French through a variety   of creative activities that stress real-world contexts and communicative   situations, situations that provide learners with the opportunity to   develop their knowledge of French by creating, both orally and through   writing, in the language.

FREN-UA 20 Intensive Intermediate French (6 points) MTWRF 9:00am \u2013 12:00pm Section 001 (#2512) -- Camilo Frias / Janos Kun Section 002 (#2513) -- Samantha Presnal / Lauren Weaver This   intensive intermediate French course is designed to give students who   have already mastered the basics of French vocabulary, culture,   pronunciation, and grammar the opportunity to deepen their knowledge of   the French language and the cultures for which it is a vehicle. This   course not only allows students to gain even easier access to the   thoughts, ideas, history, and production of hundreds of millions of   French-speaking people scattered across every continent around the   globe, but also prepares students to tackle advanced-level French   courses. This course includes an intensive review and expansion of the   most important grammatical structures through written and oral exercises   and activities, the continued development of vocabulary through   creative and communicative activities and projects, and extensive   individual, small-group, and large-group practice to allow for the   development of spoken fluency and presentational skills. FREN-UA 865.001 (conducted in English ) Topics in French Culture \u2013 Sugar, Shackles, Sabotage: The French Caribbean Suzy Cater MW, 2:00pm \u2013 5:00pm #2743 A headless   statue stands in the center of Fort-de-France, the capital of   the Caribbean island of Martinique. Now decapitated and splattered in   red paint, it once represented the Empress Josephine, wife of Napoleon   I - and daughter of sugar plantation owners in Martinique. Supposedly,   Josephine encouraged Napoleon to reinstate slavery in the   French colonies, after it had legally been abolished in 1794. Once   reintroduced, slaves wouldn't be free again until 1848. The headless   statue is one of many sites where official French history and culture   is challenged - or sabotaged - by local Caribbean realities   and practices. This course will explore works   of Martinican and Guadeloupean literature and film which refuse to be   French and insist on being Caribbean, highlighting their own history (of   slavery, revolts, and maroon leaders) and their own culture (such as   seen in Carnival and the language of Creole). Yet the islands have   been overseas departments of France since 1946 \u2013 distant, but a part of   that country \u2013 and we will examine how authors and artists negotiate   this double, conflictual belonging. Its tension haunts their oeuvre, but   they produce original and fascinating works which traverse oceans and   borders, interrogate fixed identities, and overturn expectations about   what the idea of \u201cFrench\u201d literature really means. (This course is   taught in English; however, NYU French students can arrange to take the   course for credit for a French major or minor. See the French   Department for details.) FREN-UA 868.001 (conducted in English ) Topics in French Literature \u2013 The Story of My Life: Published Books, Private Lives Youna Kwak TR, 2:00pm \u2013 5:00pm #6441 Gide, Beauvoir, Sartre, and Barthes are writers so iconic that they can be identified by just one name. Likewise The Immoralist, The Second Sex, Nausea , and Camera Lucida    are among the most influential Francophone books of the 20th century.   But in addition to writing well-known works of fiction and philosophy,   each of these authors also wrote intimately revealing diaries and   autobiographies that testify to turbulent sexual affairs, fierce social   rivalries, jealousy, grief, and the horror of confronting violence and   war. Which are more famous, the authors or their books? In this course   we examine the fraught distinction between private lives and public   books, when writers put their personal lives on display. What effect   does it have on readers to think they know a writer\u2019s secrets? How does   fascination with the private lives of writers inevitably influence the   way we read? We will pursue our questions into the present-day,   discovering contemporary authors whose blogs, memoirs, autobiographies   and autofictions reflect and incite readers\u2019 desires to uncover   seemingly real and authentic lives behind famous works of literature. In   our so-called \u201cage of no secrets,\u201d can there be such a thing as an   intimate life in print?

Critical study of key themes, genres, and styles; focuses on   analytical writing and literary analysis. Follows but does not require   completion of Readings I. Authors studied may include Colette, Andr\u00e9   Malraux, C\u00e9line, Simone de Beauvoir, Kateb Yacine, Georges Perec, and   Marguerite Yourcenar. FREN-UA 145 Approaches to Francophone Literature Prof. J. Michael Dash MW, 12:30pm - 1:45pm Silver 500 #22205 The   course examines the conceptualizing of Francophonie through the   literature from a network of French-speaking countries which together   form a Francophone space. It not only addresses the colonial past but   the anti-colonial and postcolonial situations in which French   colonialism is replaced by more complex relationships and ideologies.   One of the most difficult issues that confronts the postcolonial   francophone world is the question of cultural homogeneity and social   integration within national structures. This course focuses on the   problematic area of cultural transformation, language contact and the   role of the writer in elaborating a post-colonial national identity. The   problematizing of language, nation and writing will be examined in both   a theoretical way and in the prose fiction of Maryse Conde of   Guadeloupe, Jacques Roumain of Haiti, Sembene Ousmane of Senegal and   Assia Djebar of Algeria. FREN-UA 164 Contemporary France Prof. Julie Hugonny MW, 9:30am \u2013 10:45am Silver 500 #22207 An   introduction to French history, politics, and social relations from   1900 to the present. Attention is paid to the successive crises that   challenged France's stature, its national identity, and its Republican   model. Topics include the French political and social systems; France's   \u201cexceptionalism\u201d and relationships with Europe, the United States, and   globalization; colonialism, immigration, and post-colonialism; and   gender and class relations.

Jusqu'\u00e0 pr\u00e9sent souvent   ignor\u00e9es par les critiques, et mises \u00e0 l'\u00e9cart du corpus officiel de la   litt\u00e9rature fran\u00e7aise, elles trouvent maintenant la place qui leur est   due. Depuis le 17 eme si\u00e8cle jusqu'\u00e0 aujourd'hui ce cours \u00e9tudiera   quelques une des figures majeures parmi les femmes \u00e9crivains. Nous   r\u00e9fl\u00e9chirons aussi \u00e0 la pertinence ou pas de cette cat\u00e9gorie des femmes   \u00e9crivains. (Authors include Madame de la Fayette, Madame de S\u00e9vign\u00e9, Georges Sand, Colette, Duras, and de Beauvoir .)  FREN-UA 992.002 Esp\u00e8ces d'espaces Prof. Phillip John Usher MW, 4:55pm \u2013 6:10pm Silver 406 #10026 Le   titre de ce cours est emprunt\u00e9 \u00e0 un livre de Georges P\u00e9rec, publi\u00e9 en   1974, qui s\u2019interroge sur le sens des \u00ab lieux \u00bb dans lesquels nous   vivons (le lit, la chambre, l\u2019appartement, l\u2019immeuble, la rue, le   quartier, la ville, etc.). P\u00e9rec d\u00e9montre combien ces lieux que nous   fr\u00e9quentons, comme inconsciemment, sont aussi lisibles qu\u2019un livre,   combien ces lieux poss\u00e8dent une logique et une syntaxe, combien ces   lieux sont des \u00ab fictions \u00bb autant que des r\u00e9alit\u00e9s. Embo\u00eetant le pas \u00e0   P\u00e9rec (que nous lirons) et nous inspirant \u00e9galement de certains autres   penseurs du XXe si\u00e8cle (Foucault, Certeau, Aug\u00e9, Latour, etc.), nous   voudrions donc r\u00e9fl\u00e9chir \u00e0 la fa\u00e7on dont la litt\u00e9rature probl\u00e9matise   notre relation aux \u00ab lieux \u00bb, des plus intimes (le lit) aux plus   abstraits (l\u2019univers, l\u2019 \u00ab anthropoc\u00e8ne \u00bb). En privil\u00e9giant ces   questions, nous pr\u00e9l\u00e8verons sur l\u2019histoire de la litt\u00e9rature fran\u00e7aise   des \u0153uvres publi\u00e9es depuis le Moyen \u00c2ge jusqu\u2019au XXIe si\u00e8cle.

A cette occasion, ce cours propose aux \u00e9tudiants d'\u00e9tudier le   regard que portent les romanciers et les cin\u00e9astes sur la guerre de   1914-1918. Le cours porte sur l'\u00e9tude de la langue, du contexte   historique et du style des romanciers et des cin\u00e9astes, ainsi que sur   leur vision des horreurs de la guerre, du courage et de la paix. Le   cours est co-enseign\u00e9 par Prof. Cl. Bernard, sp\u00e9cialiste de litt\u00e9rature,   et Prof. L. Cortade, sp\u00e9cialiste de cin\u00e9ma.

FREN-UA 868.001 (conducted in English ) Topics in French Literature: Acting Medieval Literature Prof. Evelyn Vitz R, 9:30am \u2013 12:15pm\u2028GCASL 379 #22175 In   this course students read, discuss, and then perform in class major   works of medieval literature \u2013 works that were originally intended for   live, semi-dramatic performance. Focus is on narrative rather than   dramatic works. The works explored vary from year to year, but always   include epic, romance, tales of various kinds, and a range of narrative   genres, from different countries and traditions. Students work   particularly on the skills required for the performance of different   kinds of narrative \u2013 including the ability to impersonate of all kinds   of characters; rapid shifts from character to character, voice to voice;   and effective use of body language, Most performances are done solo,   but there is also some teamwork\u2014performances in small groups. Students   who can sing, dance, play an instrument, or have other performance   skills are very welcome, but such skills are not necessary. Work for   the course consists of reading and classroom discussion; several short   performances over the course of the semester; a final performance (often   done in a group); short written responses to readings and \u201cimaginary   performances\u201d; a final oral exam. Note: This is a course where faithful   attendance is an absolute must. Students who are not comfortable   performing are strongly advised not to sign up for this course.

FREN-UA 868.002 (conducted in English ) Topics in French Literature: An Introduction to Jacques Derrida (1930-2004) Prof. Lucien Nouis MW, 11:00am \u2013 12:15pm Silver 500 #22176 From   Derrida\u2019s critique of \u201cWestern\u201d categorizations of universality and   rationality (logocentrism, phallogocentrism, humanism,   anthropocentrism), to his later reflections on metaphoricity,   translation, and performativity, this course will first explore the   question of \u201cwriting\u201d as it unfolds throughout the 1960\u2019s and beyond. We   will then focus on the more directly political and ethical dimension of   Derrida\u2019s thought, and carefully examine his use of concepts such as   hos(ti)pitality, gift, forgiveness, animality, friendship, faith, and   \"\u00e9v\u00e9nement,\" paying particular attention to his later conversation with   Emmanuel Levinas. Readings will include passages, chapters and essays   taken from Writing and Difference (1967), On Grammatology (1967), Psyche: Inventions of the Other (1987), Points... , (1992); Force of Law (1994); Politics of Friendship (1994); Monolinguism of the Other (1996); Of Hospitality (1997); On Cosmopolitanism and Forgiveness (1997); Philosophy in a Time of Terror (2003); The Beast and the Sovereign (2008), etc. The course and the readings will be in English.

The remaining twelve weeks   will deal with four plays. We will consider each of the four authors   with respect to their work in general and their place in contemporary   theater and the history of ideas. The plays will be analyzed in detail   thematically and stylistically. Each will be seen as a highlight of   anti-realistic dramaturgy, as a brilliant example of the sensibilities   of European artists and thinkers in the periods following each of the   two World Wars.\u2028 (Cross-listed as DRLIT-UA 267 )\u2028 (This course is for 2 points and does not count toward the requirements for the French major or minor.)

This intensive course is the   equivalent of a year (two semesters) of regular elementary-level French.   The work done throughout the session focuses on the presentation and   systematic practice of the basic structures and vocabulary of oral and   written French through a variety of creative activities that stress   real-world contexts and communicative situations, situations that   provide learners with the opportunity to develop their knowledge of   French by creating, both orally and through writing, in the language.   This course includes a robust online component.

This course systematizes and   reinforces language skills and functions presented in earlier courses   through an intensive review of grammatical structures and usages, a   variety of written activities, an introduction to composition writing,   exercises and activities that promote lexical enrichment, and numerous   opportunities to develop conversational and presentational skills.

The work done throughout the session   focuses on the presentation and systematic practice of the initial basic   structures and vocabulary of oral and written French through a variety   of creative activities that stress real-world contexts and communicative   situations, situations that provide learners with the opportunity to   develop their knowledge of French by creating, both orally and through   writing, in the language.

FREN-UA 20 Intensive Intermediate French (6 points) MTWRF 9:00am \u2013 12:00pm Section 001 (#2512) -- Camilo Frias / Janos Kun Section 002 (#2513) -- Samantha Presnal / Lauren Weaver This   intensive intermediate French course is designed to give students who   have already mastered the basics of French vocabulary, culture,   pronunciation, and grammar the opportunity to deepen their knowledge of   the French language and the cultures for which it is a vehicle. This   course not only allows students to gain even easier access to the   thoughts, ideas, history, and production of hundreds of millions of   French-speaking people scattered across every continent around the   globe, but also prepares students to tackle advanced-level French   courses. This course includes an intensive review and expansion of the   most important grammatical structures through written and oral exercises   and activities, the continued development of vocabulary through   creative and communicative activities and projects, and extensive   individual, small-group, and large-group practice to allow for the   development of spoken fluency and presentational skills. FREN-UA 865.001 (conducted in English ) Topics in French Culture \u2013 Sugar, Shackles, Sabotage: The French Caribbean Suzy Cater MW, 2:00pm \u2013 5:00pm #2743 A headless   statue stands in the center of Fort-de-France, the capital of   the Caribbean island of Martinique. Now decapitated and splattered in   red paint, it once represented the Empress Josephine, wife of Napoleon   I - and daughter of sugar plantation owners in Martinique. Supposedly,   Josephine encouraged Napoleon to reinstate slavery in the   French colonies, after it had legally been abolished in 1794. Once   reintroduced, slaves wouldn't be free again until 1848. The headless   statue is one of many sites where official French history and culture   is challenged - or sabotaged - by local Caribbean realities   and practices. This course will explore works   of Martinican and Guadeloupean literature and film which refuse to be   French and insist on being Caribbean, highlighting their own history (of   slavery, revolts, and maroon leaders) and their own culture (such as   seen in Carnival and the language of Creole). Yet the islands have   been overseas departments of France since 1946 \u2013 distant, but a part of   that country \u2013 and we will examine how authors and artists negotiate   this double, conflictual belonging. Its tension haunts their oeuvre, but   they produce original and fascinating works which traverse oceans and   borders, interrogate fixed identities, and overturn expectations about   what the idea of \u201cFrench\u201d literature really means.

FREN-UA 868.001 (conducted in English ) Topics in French Literature \u2013 The Story of My Life: Published Books, Private Lives Youna Kwak TR, 2:00pm \u2013 5:00pm #6441 Gide, Beauvoir, Sartre, and Barthes are writers so iconic that they can be identified by just one name. Likewise The Immoralist, The Second Sex, Nausea , and Camera Lucida    are among the most influential Francophone books of the 20th century.   But in addition to writing well-known works of fiction and philosophy,   each of these authors also wrote intimately revealing diaries and   autobiographies that testify to turbulent sexual affairs, fierce social   rivalries, jealousy, grief, and the horror of confronting violence and   war. Which are more famous, the authors or their books? In this course   we examine the fraught distinction between private lives and public   books, when writers put their personal lives on display. What effect   does it have on readers to think they know a writer\u2019s secrets? How does   fascination with the private lives of writers inevitably influence the   way we read? We will pursue our questions into the present-day,   discovering contemporary authors whose blogs, memoirs, autobiographies   and autofictions reflect and incite readers\u2019 desires to uncover   seemingly real and authentic lives behind famous works of literature. In   our so-called \u201cage of no secrets,\u201d can there be such a thing as an   intimate life in print?

The course will take as its point of departure an insight made by Antoine Berman, namely that \u201cto translate intuitively means either (a) translating any which way, or (b) translating by unconsciously obeying the ideological prejudices/prejudgments of one\u2019s era.\u201d In other words: we will ask why translators did what they did the way they did it?; what can we learn from that to better articulate our critiques of translation and our own work as translators?; and how does translation relate to wider theoretical projects in literary studies? We will read and respond to key contributions to the field (Saint Jerome, Schleiermacher, Nietzsche, Benjamin, Berman, Venuti, Apter, Simon, etc.). FREN-GA 2790 Le tintamarre de la musique dans la litt\u00e9rature fran\u00e7aise aux XXe et XXIe si\u00e8cles Prof. Francois NOUDELMANN Course taught in French La musique a souvent servi de r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 la litt\u00e9rature, les \u00e9crivains y trouvant des mod\u00e8les \u00e0 imiter ou \u00e0 \u00e9viter. Affirmation des go\u00fbts, analyses musicales, m\u00e9taphores du style, th\u00e9ories de la musique\u2026 ces registres semblent ajouter une valeur artiste \u00e0 la cr\u00e9ation litt\u00e9raire. Mais la musique, loin de favoriser l'harmonie, a \u00e9t\u00e9 aussi un mode d'engagement pol\u00e9mique. Elle a suscit\u00e9 de violentes querelles, parfois nationalistes (pour ou contre Wagner) et plus largement culturelles (o\u00f9 les modernes ne sont pas ceux que l'on croit). Les oppositions entre musiques classiques ou contemporaines, savantes ou populaires, jazz ou rock, ont cliv\u00e9 les \u00e9crivains. Le s\u00e9minaire \u00e9tudiera le r\u00f4le m\u00e9tonymique de ces engagements musicaux li\u00e9s \u00e0 la valorisation d'un compositeur, d'un instrument, ou d'une forme musicale, et qui permettent d'affirmer un rapport au monde et un style d'\u00e9criture. Il les mettra en perspective en rappelant l'histoire du r\u00e9f\u00e9rent musical dans la litt\u00e9rature, dans le spectre de Rousseau, compositeur et th\u00e9oricien engag\u00e9 dans les combats musicaux. Il analysera aussi les malentendus entre litt\u00e9rature et musique, et leur singularit\u00e9 face \u00e0 la philosophie esth\u00e9tique et la musicologie. Il montrera les enjeux litt\u00e9raires de ces r\u00e9f\u00e9rences musicales en observant, au-del\u00e0 de la guerre des go\u00fbts, comment la musique offre une multiplicit\u00e9 de figures pour la litt\u00e9rature, tant par ses codes de composition que par ses pratiques instrumentales et vocales.

Il s\u2019agira ici de tracer un chemin \u00e0 travers ces trois \u00ab massifs \u00bb que sont Ric\u0153ur, Levinas et Derrida, en privil\u00e9giant les moments de leurs \u0153uvres o\u00f9 se conceptualise \u2013 sur fond de xxe si\u00e8cle et \u00e0 chaque fois diff\u00e9remment \u2013 ce couple, ou cet accouplement, complexe. Pour Ric\u0153ur, nous le verrons, \u00e9thique et politique ne sont pas dans une relation de subordination, mais sont \u00e0 comprendre comme \u00ab deux foyers d\u00e9centr\u00e9s l\u2019un par rapport \u00e0 l\u2019autre, posant chacun une probl\u00e9matique originale et cr\u00e9ant un segment commun, pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment par leur intersection \u00bb. C\u2019est cette intersection que l\u2019on retrouvera travaill\u00e9e dans ceux de ses textes o\u00f9 sont abord\u00e9es les questions du pouvoir, du vivre-ensemble, de l\u2019\u00e9thique d\u00e9mocratique, du juste, de l\u2019action, ou encore de la dette, de l\u2019oubli, du pardon, etc. Avec Levinas, il faudra explorer \u2013 \u00e0 travers une r\u00e9flexion sur le droit, la justice, l\u2019\u00c9tat, les villes-refuges, le Livre \u2013 les limites d\u2019une politique qui \u00ab doit toujours \u00eatre contr\u00f4l\u00e9e et critiqu\u00e9e \u00e0 partir de l\u2019\u00e9thique \u00bb, ou encore sollicit\u00e9e de l\u2019int\u00e9rieur par une \u00e9thique qui serait un au-del\u00e0 du politique dans le politique. Dans un troisi\u00e8me temps, avec Derrida, nous poursuivrons notre probl\u00e9matique en suivant, diffract\u00e9 sur plusieurs textes, un questionnement sur la loi, la violence, la force, l\u2019\u00e9v\u00e9nement, l\u2019amiti\u00e9, l\u2019hospitalit\u00e9, la jud\u00e9it\u00e9, etc. Nous lirons \u00e0 l\u2019occasion certains des auteurs sur lesquels Derrida appuie sa pens\u00e9e : Levinas bien s\u00fbr, mais aussi Platon, Kant, Marx, Walter Benjamin, Jean-Luc Nancy... Ce cours s\u2019adresse \u00e0 des doctorants qui n\u2019ont pas forc\u00e9ment de formation philosophique, mais qui pourraient chercher \u00e0 d\u00e9velopper, dans leurs travaux, une approche qui ne serait pas \u00e9trang\u00e8re \u00e0 un certain nombre de questionnements conceptuels relevant de cette discipline. Ce qui est certain, c\u2019est qu\u2019avec Ric\u0153ur, Levinas et Derrida, nous avons affaire \u00e0 trois philosophes qui sont aussi lecteurs et commentateurs d\u2019\u0153uvres litt\u00e9raires, et pour qui politique et \u00e9thique ne sont pas des domaines radicalement \u00e9trangers au roman et \u00e0 la po\u00e9sie. Le cours et les lectures se feront en fran\u00e7ais. En plus d\u2019articles et d\u2019extraits photocopi\u00e9s, qui seront mis \u00e0 votre disposition sur Internet et qui constitueront la majorit\u00e9 de nos sources, je vous invite \u00e0 vous procurer les livres suivants.

The ability to study and teach film is also a skill that is sought after by language and literature search committees in the academic job market. And yet, graduate students in departments of modern languages and literatures have few opportunities to receive a comprehensive training in cinema studies. The goal of this graduate course is twofold: 1) \u201cTeaching Cinema\u201d is an introduction to the methodology of film analysis that is specifically tailored to the needs and to the interests of graduate students in modern languages and literatures; 2) \u201cTeaching Cinemas\u201d also provides students with an opportunity to discuss and implement teaching strategies using films. Students choose and analyze films on the basis of their interest through the lens of a large range of topics (class, gender, politics, globalization, etc.). They also discuss teaching strategies, including how to interact with students in class, how to create a lesson plan, how to write a syllabus that includes films, etc. Lastly, students in this workshop have several opportunities to teach class periods, and to receive constructive feedback from the instructor and from fellow graduate students. This course is both an introduction to film and a teaching skills workshop that help students diversify their teaching portfolio and help them prepare for the academic job market. -  The course is conducted in English. -  No background in Cinema Studies required. -  Students with no teaching experience are welcome. -  No book to purchase. FREN-GA 2776 Proust  Prof. Eugene NICOLE Course taught in French On the one hand, this course will focus specifically on Du c\u00f4t\u00e9 de chez Swann, \u00c0 l\u2019ombre des jeunes filles en fleurs, Albertine disparue and Le Temps retrouv\u00e9, providing a framework for an in-depth study of these four texts. On the other hand, it will also give the student an opportunity to reflect upon broader, theoretical issues, which are representative of Proustian criticism today. Accordingly, special emphasis will be placed both on the structure and the making of \u00c0 la recherche du temps perdu (especially of \u00ab Combray \u00bb, Albertine disparue and Le Temps retrouv\u00e9). After examining Proust\u2019s theory of Love, his concept of the Self, his \u201cpsychology in Space\u201d, we will examine the philosophical roots of his aesthetics marked by such paradoxical concepts as that of \u201csensible ideas\u201d and the rich intertextual field of la Recherche. We will then show that Proust\u2019s most powerful innovation resides in his conception of the novel as an instrument in the search for Truth. The course will provide ample opportunities to discuss a number of seminal interpretations, including works by Barthes, Bataille, Bayard, Beckett, Belloi, Benjamin, Bizub, Blanchot, Cohn, Deleuze, Descombes, Genette, Girard, Henry, Jullien, Kristeva, Ladenson, Levinas, Merlau-Ponty, Muller, Nabokov, Poulet, Richard, Ricoeur, Rousset. Important Note : For Du c\u00f4t\u00e9 de chez Swann, \u00c0 l\u2019ombre des jeunes filles en fleurs et Le Temps retrouv\u00e9, we will use the Livre de Poche classique edition (Ldp n\u00bas 7390, 7391, 7396). For Albertine disparue will use the GF Flammarion vol n\u00ba 1153 provided by Jean Milly. FREN-GA 1990 Figures de l'\u00e9tranger dans la litt\u00e9rature fran\u00e7aise et Francophone Prof. R\u00e9da BENSMAIA Course taught in French From Michel de Montaigne to Marguerite Duras, Victor Segalen to Jean Gen\u00eat, modern French literature has always been haunted by a specter: the figure of the Other (the foreigner, the \"exote\", the \"immigrant\", the \"bon sauvage\", etc). Various literary texts and essays written by contemporary francophone writers will help us study the historical status and the various forms of these figures in modern French and Francophone Literature. Texts which will include excerpts or full works of, Abdelk\u00e9bir Khatibi, Abdelwahab Meddeb, Albert Memmi, Ma\u00efssa Bey and others will help us draw a map of the displacements and metamorphoses of these intriguing figures in French and Francophone Literature of the 20th and 21rst centuries.

FREN-GA 2290 Emotions in French Medieval Literature Prof. Evelyn VITZ Course taught in English This course focuses on the role and representation of the emotions in French medieval literature, with particular focus on narrative of the 11th-13th centuries. We begin with some large issues, such as: What are emotions? Is there some \u201cbasic list\u201d of emotions?\u2014and if not, why not? To what degree is there a \u201chistory\u201d of emotions? What is the vocabulary of emotions in Old French literature?\u2014what words were used? Who has (and doesn\u2019t have), emotions: What of the role of gender, of class? What about religious/supernatural figures: God, Jesus, the Virgin, saints, angels, demons? Animals, monsters, etc.? And other \u201cothers\u201d? How were emotions distinguished from vices and virtues? From temperament and permanent character traits? From appetites? From feelings? With regard to audience response: how were/are emotional responses to works related to (and distinct from) physiological and cognitive responses? Do readers seem to have had different emotional response from those who saw/heard performed works? Thus, we have a large set of large questions that we will raise at the start of the course, with some theoretical /philosophical/ theological readings (e.g., from the Bible, the Stoics, Augustine, Bernard of Clairvaux, Thomas Aquinas, rhetorical treatises). What were the important kinds of agreements and disagreements about emotions in the Middle Ages\u2014and how did thinking on the issues develop? How much was vernacular literature influenced by philosophical and theological disagreements? We then focus our attention on major examples from particular genres\u2014since it appears to be the case that, for the most part, in this period, different genres handle and evoke emotions quite differently: each genre seems to focus on some emotions, and avoid others. We will look at saints\u2019 lives and pious tales; an epic (La Chanson de Roland, and a few excerpts from other chansons de geste); romance (esp. Yvain but with glimpses elsewhere); lais of Marie de France; beast epic (Le Roman de Renart); and a few fabliaux. Toward the end of the semester, we will look at a few short 14th and 15th c. texts to see how the handling of emotions has changed and what has changed it\u2014one example being the increased interest in the humours, such as melancholy. I am open to having us pause to examine texts that are of particular interest to the students in the class. Students need to read modern French; we will work on Old French as needed in class. Texts to purchase: La Chanson de Roland (Lettres gothiques) Chr\u00e9tien de Troyes, Yvain ou le chevalier au lion (Lettres gothiques) Other texts will be handed out in class, read on-line, or put into a Reader.  FREN-GA 1500 Catastrophes in Modern France Prof. Stephane GERSON Course taught in English Disaster studies go back decades, but only recently have natural and technological catastrophes have become objects of study among historians of France (and other countries as well). These sudden, unexpected, and sometimes unexplained events make visible those forces, power relations, tensions, and vulnerabilities that are otherwise hidden from view. In this respect they serve as a window into their era. They can also propel history in new directions. Sometimes, they do so by provoking disruptions and nourishing ways of thinking, grounds for contestation, or emotional registers. Sometimes, they consolidate pre-existing norms, conceptual frameworks, and social, gendered, or race/ethnicity-based inequalities. Finally, the history of catastrophes can provide a genealogy of our own disaster culture, our own era caught in what one commentator calls \u201cthe long emergency.\u201d This course has a triple agenda \u2014 and three corresponding parts. First, we will delve into recent empirical and theoretical writings about modern catastrophes to engage with key concepts. These include: risk society, spectacles of disaster, trauma, new social possibilities, the disaster state, biological citizenship, states of emergency/exception, symbolic politics, and social drama. Second, we will test out these concepts (and play with others) through a rich case-study: the first massive railroad crash in France (and perhaps the world), on the Paris-Versailles line in 1842. How did contemporaries anticipate, experience, feel, represent, and respond to this unprecedented event? By delving into contemporary sources, we will ask questions about governmentality, public and private grief, risk and the market, expertise, heroization, wounded and damaged bodies, media and public inquiries, secular and religious representations and rituals. Finally, each one of you will frame a significant research project on one aspect of this question and workshop it in class during the final weeks of the semester. Each paper will contribute to a collective inquiry whose final outcome \u2014 the sum-total of our intellectual efforts \u2014 will take us into uncharted territory.
